<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Digitalisation is now a part of everyday life for most people. The development of computers, tablets and smartphones with internet connections has been a major reason why most individuals use digital tools and services. This creates a need to develop digital skills. Be it in people’s private lives, in community life, in education or in working life, digital tools and services are used every day. This Commission has chosen to concentrate on and submit proposals in the area of digital skills based on these four areas of life. The proposals are intended to help increase understanding for the need for digital skills and create the conditions for individuals to improve their digital skills. The proposals are also intended to ensure that a knowledge base is built up for future analysis and proposals for measures.</p>
<h2>Remit and points of departure</h2>
<p>The Digitalisation Commission has been instructed to work towards the achievement of the ICT policy objective – that Sweden is to be best in the world at using the opportunities offered by digitalisation. This remit includes continuously monitoring developments in Sweden on the basis of indicators and comparing them with developments in a selection of countries in Europe and other parts of the world. In addition, the Commission has followed up the work carried out on the regional digital agendas. The Commission has also concentrated and presented proposals in the area of digital skills.</p>
<p>The starting point is that digitalisation is advancing developments in society and transforming most areas and activities. In light of this, the development and dissemination of knowledge is an important prerequisite for growth and social development, whether regarding the ability of individuals to develop digital skills or the ability of manufacturing businesses to adapt. Globalisation brings with it great pressure to adjust, with technical developments and digitalisation influencing the need to develop digital skills. This trend also affects what knowledge and skills will be desirable and in demand, but also necessary in a changing society.</p>
<h2>Analysis–Sweden in an international comparison and regional digital agendas</h2>
<p>Sweden in an international comparison</p>
<p>In this report, the Digitalisation Commission has compared digital skills based on four areas of life – private life, community life, education and working life – and it has only made comparisons with other countries. The Commission has described the indicators that influence digital skills in these areas in comparison with the results of other countries. Eurostat conducts annual statistical comparisons between countries in terms of specified indicators.</p>
<p>Sweden’s figures are reported to Eurostat by Statistics Sweden.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission has described the international indexes that compare digitalisation. The indexes considered most relevant for forming a good basis for comparison are the ICT Development Index (IDI) , the Network Readiness Index (NRI) , the Web Index, the Digital Economy Rankings and the EU’s Digital Agenda Scoreboard .</p>
<p>Sweden occupies a strong position in international comparisons and has been ranked among the top countries since comparisons began. The most recent updates of the indexes also show that</p>
<p>Sweden is the only country to rank among the top five countries in all three indexes. Eurostat’s 2014 results show that in several indexes a number of countries in Europe have caught up and Sweden has thus dropped from certain top positions.</p>
<p>The regional digital agendas</p>
<p>In January 2014, the Commission conducted an initial status analysis of the counties’ work on the digital agendas. In December of the same year, a follow-up assessment was carried out to monitor how the work was progressing. The follow-up assessment shows that all regional digital agendas are expected to be adopted during the first half of 2015.</p>
<p>The regional digital agendas have a similar focus but varying structures. Several agendas have, or will have, clearly defined areas with measures linked to each area. Other counties have chosen to divide their agenda up into thematic or more overarching sections, in which several areas are interwoven.</p>
<p>Following up the regional digital agendas will provide the opportunity to highlight measures carried out and concrete results, with a view to encouraging continued development work. In most counties, the regional digital agenda is also seen as part of–or a specification of–the regional development strategy.</p>
<p>Many counties are still in the early stages of their work on the regional digital agenda and have not yet formulated or carried out concrete measures linked to the agenda. It is not possible either to give an overall picture of how much of a priority digitalisation issues are in the different counties. The majority of counties recognise that digitalisation issues have an increasingly important role, but these issues often have to take a back seat behind other development work within the county. Key individuals and successful stakeholder cooperation has, in many cases, proven to be crucial for work on the agenda, but for some time to come it will be difficult to assess in what way the work on the regional digital agendas will contribute to digitalisation within the counties.</p>
<p>All in all, the counties have identified a number of key challenges and success factors for continued digitalisation efforts. Using this as a guide, a number of recommendations have been produced for continued work on the regional digital agendas. One of the challenges is to inspire the engagement of key actors, primarily at management level. Support is also lacking, as is guidance from national level, to move forward with digitalisation regionally.</p>
<h2>Digital skills in the four areas of life</h2>
<p>To promote the greater use of the opportunities offered by digitalisation, the Digitalisation Commission has taken its cue from the digital skills that exist, those that are needed and those that should be developed in the different areas. In the areas of life highlighted by the Commission – private life, community life, education and working life – digital skills are one of the cornerstones of social development today. Clarifying and illustrating what is meant by digital skills, what the status quo is and what needs exists in these areas lays the foundation for the</p>
<p>Commission’s assessments and proposals.</p>
<p>To define the term ‘digital skills’, the Commission has considered the terms ‘digitalisation’ and ‘skills’ separately. In short, digitalisation means the process whereby digital communication and interaction between people, businesses and things become a matter of course. The reasoning concerning the term ‘skills’ has been based on the EU’s key competences for lifelong learning. A key competence is described as a combination and the integration of knowledge, skills and attitudes. The key competences are considered necessary for Europe’s welfare and growth, as well as for all individuals’ self-fulfilment and personal development, social cohesion and active citizenship, and opportunities in the labour market.</p>
<p>In the Digitalisation Commission’s definition, digital skills are determined by the extent to which people are familiar with digital tools and services and have the ability to keep up with digital developments and their influence on our lives.</p>
<p>The Commission has focused on four areas of life and provides a status report that clarifies the needs that exist in these areas. The skills people have and develop influence others and are influenced by others in these areas, which means that they cannot be kept completely separate.</p>
<p>Private life</p>
<p>Digital skills in private life are about what we as individuals do online and how we use the digital tools and services that exist and are on offer. Digital private life covers the areas communication, information gathering, learning, consumption of commercial goods and services or public services, and personal creativity.</p>
<p>Digitalisation has changed our communication patterns and how we now consume goods and services. Individuals are more proactive consumers. The development of digitalised tools and services has gone from being pursued by entrepreneurs and developers to being determined to a greater extent by consumer demand. Social media are forums that have created new communication patterns in individuals and most people regard these as an additional forum in which to communicate with others, be it private conversations or public debates.</p>
<p>On the whole, we can see that an ever larger proportion of the population does not differentiate between the digital and nondigital world. Today, the integration of the internet into other parts of our lives is a natural part of the activities of both children and adults.</p>
<p>Community life</p>
<p>Community life is made up of the activities that affect people as citizens in society. Examples include public institutions, civil society and cultural life. Swedish civil society is made up of both large and small organisations, such as popular movement organisations, cooperatives, churches and faith communities, political organisations, trade unions, media, etc.</p>
<p>The structural changes that come with digitalisation mean that organisations and institutions both develop and change in terms of how they value new knowledge and what knowledge can be seen as credible. Everything points to societal structures undergoing a change that is very difficult to predict. Digitalisation has increased the opportunities for everyone to gather and spread information, knowledge and opinions in a way that was not previously possible. As most things are now communicated in a digital context and digital media and technologies are a fundamental part of our existence, the tools and services offered in digital form become a part of the community life in which we exist.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>In today’s knowledge-based society, school, higher education and continuing professional development are increasingly important for creating growth and welfare in an increasingly competitive world. Learning is about transferring knowledge and developing skills, which occurs through information, communication and interaction. It is these areas that are being transformed by digitalisation, and this will affect schools and education in a fundamental way. Digitalisation means that most people will have to learn new things and continuously develop new skills in the course of their working life. This in turn places greater demands in terms of flexibility, creativity and innovativeness, as well as opportunities and the desire to undergo further training or education. Therefore, the importance of learning abilities, critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, communicative abilities and the ability to deal with a large amount of information will grow. General skills will also become increasingly important in the education system, and there will be greater focus on ‘noncognitive’ skills, i.e. attitudes and behaviour.</p>
<p>Working life</p>
<p>The business sector and the public sector have gone increasingly digital. Both service companies and manufacturing companies, irrespective of sector, are now working digitally with development work, digital services or digital tools. As a result of digitalisation, working life has generated new jobs and new professions, but this has also meant that existing professions have been redefined and some professions will disappear completely.</p>
<p>The digital services sector is expected to continue growing and there is already a skills shortage in several parts of the sector. The market is increasingly globalised, which means that greater market shares can be gained, but also that companies are facing greater competition. One challenge when it comes to maintaining competitiveness is being able to retain and develop the labour you have and to recruit new skilled labour. Labour migration is part of the solution, but additional measures will be needed to remain competitive in the market of the future. One part of the future challenge is the lack of women in IT professions. Women’s skills and experience are important parameters for the development of digital tools and services, contributing to greater competitiveness. Currently, not even one fifth of professionals in the sector are women.</p>
<p>Digitalisation is affecting both companies and the labour force. ICT plays a key role in most companies as digitalisation helps to simplify and streamline operations, and it can also act as a driving force for the development of new processes, products and services. This in turn requires companies – through their owners and management – to be able to assess how high levels of digital skills can provide strategic business benefits and competitive advantages in the market in which they operate.</p>
<p>Digital leadership entails a new way of managing and organising work, which is needed to be able to deal with the pace of change in an insightful way, from both corporate and staff perspectives. The digital transformation is challenging for the very reason that it affects every part of the organisation and requires new skills and new investments.</p>
<h2>The Commison’s assessments</h2>
<p>Together with several other strong megatrends, digitalisation represents a societal transformation that can be compared to previous radical shifts in society. Unlike previous societal changes, the digitalised information and knowledge-based society is developing at a faster pace and is more complex than previous changes. It is very difficult to predict the future and more complicated to identify the origin of various problems. It is also difficult to assess what effects various measures could have.</p>
<p>If Sweden is to continue using the opportunities of digitalisation in the best possible way, we need to continue developing digital skills. Measures are needed for continuous capacity-building in several areas to ensure everyone’s opportunity for participation and to improve gender equality in the IT sector. Comprehensive status reports and analyses are needed to be able to provide well-founded proposals for measures that can enhance the conditions for the education sector to strengthen the digital skills of individuals. The Commission sees the need for comprehensive knowledge of how well education programmes respond to the needs that have emerged in the labour market as a result of digitalisation.</p>
<p>Society’s support needs to be designed so as to ensure that all individuals are given help to use digital services based on their needs, regardless of which service this may involve. The aim is to develop individuals’ digital skills and greater confidence in digital tools and services. Despite the high level of women’s participation in the Swedish labour market, the gender balance in the ICT sector is uneven. Attitudes, expectations and development opportunities are highlighted as areas where there is a need for change. Overall knowledge and analysis of the causes of lacking gender equality in the area are needed so that measures can be taken.</p>
<p>The assessments of the Digitalisation Commission in the area of digital skills are based on the following points:  digital skills are a matter of equity and democracy;  digital skills are necessary to strengthen Sweden’s welfare and development in the public and business sectors;  continuous development of individuals’ digital skills is necessary; and  the role of central government needs to be continuously assessed in relation to the developments taking place.</p>
<p>What central government can, should and has to do to promote these developments are key questions for the Commission. The role of central government is to remove barriers and take measures to strengthen the conditions for the better use of the opportunities provided by digitalisation. What central government has to do must also be seen in relation to what developments would be like without central government measures, what measures are already under way and what should be done by others.</p>
<h2>The Commission’s proposals</h2>
<p>The Commission considers that the Government should take responsibility within the following areas to strengthen the development of digital skills so that Sweden can use the opportunities provided by digitalisation in the best possible way.  The Government should instruct the Swedish Higher Education Authority to annually monitor and analyse the development of digital skills in higher education and to propose measures to further develop digital skills in higher education.  The Government should instruct the Swedish Higher Education Authority to continuously monitor and analyse the gender balance in ICT education programmes and to propose measures aimed at achieving a greater gender balance.  The Government should introduce a tax reduction for skills enhancement initiatives for digital skills in the home. The tax reduction should cover initiatives such as instruction and technical support so as to increase skills levels and individuals’ abilities regarding the use of digital tools and services in the home.  Sweden’s municipalities should offer digital service centres to inhabitants to develop their digital skills. This support should be designed such that it enables everyone to use basic social services online. The municipalities should decide for themselves how to design and organise this support. Beyond the municipalities’ own digital services, the municipalities’ service should also cover digital service support for the use of state eServices for various government agencies. från myndigheten Digitaliserings-kommissionen. på Digitaliserings-kommissionens webbplats.</p>
