<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Committee’s remit</h2>
<p>The State Ownership Committee’s remit is to submit proposals for how state ownership in enterprises currently administrated by the Swedish Government Offices should be organised and conducted in the future.</p>
<p>Analysis and assessment of alternative forms of organisation to the current system were also part of the Committee’s remit. The Committee has consulted with current company administrators and owner-managed businesses, examined models applied in other countries and those in use both now and previously in other areas of central government as well as looked at the models and listened to the experiences of major private owners.</p>
<p>The starting-point for the Committee’s work has been the premise that the administration of the state-owned enterprises shall be active, efficient and professional, and responsible. It shall also generate long-term value and fulfil specific public service assignments. The scope of the Swedish Government and the Swedish Riksdag for insight into and overall governance of state-managed enterprises shall not be restricted. The Committee’s terms of reference also state that the Government is looking to streamline the Government Offices.</p>
<h2>The state is Sweden’s largest business-owner</h2>
<p>The Swedish state is a significant business-owner. It has an ownership stake in 58 enterprises, a small number of which are partowned and three of which are listed on the stock exchange. These enterprises constitute a heterogeneous group. Their activities are vastly different and they are of varying backgrounds and sizes. Some have a complete or partial monopoly on their market while others are exposed to competition. Furthermore, some enterprises are partially financed by appropriations.</p>
<p>In June 2011, the state enterprise portfolio was valued at approximately SEK 600 billion (EUR 68 billion). Just over 100 000 people are employed in enterprises in which the state has an ownership stake. If we include associated companies, the figure rises to about 190 000.</p>
<h2>Problems in the current administration model</h2>
<p>The Committee has identified a number of problems in the current ownership administration model:  There is a fundamental difference between political and business rationality when it comes to the governance of  state-owned enterprises - a difference that is not sufficiently reflected in how the administration is currently organised and conducted.  The state has a dual role as both legislator and business owner, two functions that are not differentiated clearly enough in the current system.  The Government and the Government Offices risk taking on far too operative a role in their corporate governance of the enterprises, causing the boundary between the handling of ownership issues and corporate issues to become fuzzy.  As a result, the political and  owner-strategic governance of the administration becomes unclear and unstructured.  Instead, the governance of companies tends to become  “ad-hoc” and is characterised by disjointedness, a short-term approach and a lack of consistency.  The complicated owner tasks and complex goals that characterise many of the  state-owned enterprises have not been sufficiently clarified to be able to form the basis for clear and effective corporate governance.  Neither are these differences adequately reflected in the view of how ownership of the enterprises should be administrated, which leads to a far too uniform and undifferentiated management model that does not suit all the enterprises.</p>
<p>These problems have significant consequences:  The shortcomings lead to ineffective corporate governance that does not realise the potential for value generation in enterprises owned by the state.  Neither does the current model provide satisfactory democratic influence, as exercised by the Swedish Riksdag, over the strategic focus of the corporate administration.</p>
<p>To solve these problems, an independently accountable, professional organisation for operative corporate administration should be established as a link between the political and strategic governance from the Riksdag and the Government on the one side, and the individual portfolio companies on the other. The proposals submitted aim to create this link.</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Based on its terms of reference and the problems identified, the Committee has formulated the following overarching objectives for the administration of the state’s corporate ownership:  Clear political influence on the strategic level.  Stable conditions for the enterprises’ operations and development.</p>
<h2>Operative administration in limited companies</h2>
<p>The Committee proposes that the operative administration of enterprises owned by the state be transferred to two 100 percent state-owned limited companies that own the shares in the portfolio companies and have the following responsibilities and tasks:  Holding Company 1  will be responsible for the corporate administration of enterprises whose main task is to generate value.  Holding Company 2  will be responsible for the corporate administration of enterprises whose main task is to generate public benefit.</p>
<p>A solution with a separate organisation for operative administration lays the foundation for a clearer structure and more distinct division of roles and responsibilities in the administration of the state’s corporate ownership.</p>
<p>Responsibility for the overarching and strategic governance of the state’s ownership and the tasks of the enterprises will continue to rest with the Riksdag and the Government while operative management will be implemented by the holding companies. This will create the prerequisites for combining democratic influence over the state’s ownership with active, efficient and professional administration that can contribute to long-term value generation in stateowned enterprises in the broad sense .</p>
<p>The reason why the enterprises shall be administrated by limited companies is because this business form is considered to be the one that best satisfies the demands for efficient and professional administration and that is best-placed to attract the skills, business acumen and experience required at the top executive level.</p>
<p>The alternative of the administration being conducted by a government agency is feasible but is considered to be less beneficial.</p>
<p>The limited company corporate model is also particularly well suited to the administration of business-driven enterprises.</p>
<p>Dividing the administration of state-owned enterprises between two holding companies is motivated by the fact that two main categories of state-owned enterprise have been identified:  enterprises whose fundamental objective is to generate financial value,  enterprises whose fundamental objective is to create public benefit.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s opinion, this difference in mandate and focus can best be underpinned by dividing the function between two management organisations.</p>
<p>The holding companies shall be controlled by the Government, who will be responsible for operations and have to report results to the Riksdag. The Government shall formulate provisions in the articles of association and otherwise provide the necessary operational guidelines. At annual shareholders’ meetings, the Government shall appoint the chairpersons and members of the holding company boards.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Committee’s proposal, the holding companies could start operations at the beginning of July 2013.</p>
<h2>The holding companies’ mandate</h2>
<p>The mandate of the holding companies shall be to operationalise and implement the corporate governance adopted by the Riksdag and Government. They shall fulfil the tasks required to implement active and professional corporate governance and as owners appoint boards and chairpersons in the portfolio companies.</p>
<p>The tasks also include defining clear mandates and objectives for each company and supporting and monitoring their fulfilment. Major emphasis shall be put on formulating clear and consistent governance targets for each company that reflect the companies’ collective task in terms of both financial value and public benefit.</p>
<p>The administration and management of the enterprises shall be active, focusing on developing and realising the potential of the portfolio companies to generate value in a broad sense. The administration shall be characterised by transparency and accountability and a high level of professionalism, and be implemented based on the state’s specific role as owner and the core values it is founded upon.</p>
<p>The holding companies shall be led, organised and staffed in a way that reflects the enterprises’ different mandate. Considerable emphasis shall also be put on developing and utilising synergies both between and inside the holding companies.</p>
<p>Capital in the portfolio companies that is not needed to fulfil the companies’ tasks shall be distributed to the owner and, with the exception of limited amounts to finance the holding companies’ operations and provide scope for capital transfers between the portfolio companies, passed on to the state.</p>
<p>Holding Company 1  comprises portfolio companies that have financial value generation as their main task and whose targets are mainly financial in nature. They may also, to the extent deemed necessary, be subject to supplementary restrictions of a public benefit nature. It is proposed that 28 portfolio companies be included in this holding company, including the majority of the largest and financially most valuable enterprises.</p>
<p>The governance target for this holding company should be to generate long-term stable growth in value measured as the sum of the value generated in all its portfolio companies over time. The skills requirement for the board, executive and administration in the company include a high level of business acumen and sound political judgment.</p>
<p>Holding Company 1 should be divided into two sub-categories, large enterprises  and small and  medium-sized  enterprises (SME)  based on different governance rationales.</p>
<p>Large enterprise sub-category   will be responsible for 80 percent or more of the value in the state’s portfolio of wholly or partly owned companies. All the businesses are mature companies that are commercially run but may have certain special commitments or restrictions.</p>
<p>SME sub-category   consists of a few small but mainly of mediumsized enterprises, several of which may be deemed to have considerable development potential. Accordingly, the corporate governance of these enterprises should be focused on utilising this potential. Several of the enterprises can be categorised into a few coherent industrial groups.</p>
<p>Holding Company 2  comprises portfolio companies whose overarching task is to create public benefit. It is proposed that 27 enterprises be included in Holding Company 2. In some cases, it is a question of corporatised government operations that have a businesspecific public assignment as their main task.</p>
<p>The portfolio companies in this holding company have sectorpolitical targets. Several of the companies also have financial objectives, which constitute restrictions for the fulfilment of their specific public assignment. In their running of the holding company and their administration of the portfolio companies, board members, executives and administrators must have sound political judgement, good skills and specific expert knowledge in the relevant policy areas in addition to the required business acumen.</p>
<p>An important task for Holding Company 2 will be to develop methods and techniques for the efficient administration of companies that have public benefit as their main objective. The company needs to develop a new bank of professional expertise and experience in order to be able to effectively administrate companies whose main objectives are not financial.</p>
<p>The portfolio companies in this holding company can also be divided into two sub-categories. It is proposed that one of these contain a significant number of companies with the purpose of sustaining economic growth . These are mainly companies in the enterprise policy area that often have no profitability targets.</p>
<p>The other proposed sub-category would contain companies whose purpose is to contribute to public welfare . These companies are of varying size and are active in several policy areas although most of them have socially, culturally and environmentally motivated assignments.</p>
<p>Costs and financing</p>
<p>The costs of the new management organisation are estimated to be approximately SEK 175 million (EUR 20 million) per year. The current management system is estimated to cost about SEK 115 million (EUR 13 million) a year. The reason for the increased costs is a significantly higher level of ambition regarding both in terms of numbers and skills. Compared to other actors, however, the costs are considerably lower, in relation both to the value of the portfolio holdings and to the number of employees.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the costs be financed by allowing the holding companies to keep a small proportion of the profit dividends from the portfolio companies which means they would not be financed from the central government budget Certain start-up costs will be incurred in connection with the establishment of the holding companies, estimated to be in the region of SEK 15–20 million (EUR 1.7–2.3 million).</p>
<p>Dividends and capital contributions</p>
<p>Profit dividends from state-owned companies will continue to go to the state and be assigned as earnings in the central government budget. The Committee proposes however that the holding companies be given the opportunity to redistribute the profits in an efficient manner among the portfolio companies within a framework established by the Riksdag.</p>
<p>Major capital contributions or contributions aimed at achieving strategic reorientations of a company’s operations shall continue to be decided by the Riksdag under the provisions of the Budget Act. It is proposed that the holding companies not be allowed to finance their operations through loans.</p>
<h2>Ownership policy framework</h2>
<p>The premise is that a new organization may be reconciled with a strong democratic influence over state ownership. The scope of the Swedish Government and the Swedish Riksdag for insight into and overall governance of the state-owned enterprises shall not be restricted. The Government is responsible for the governance of the holding companies.</p>
<p>There is a need to develop a clear framework for how to exercise parliamentary and governmental governance of and influence over the administration of state-managed companies. The aim is to create clearl corporate governance roles, better accounting and monitoring, and greater transparency.</p>
<p>It is proposed that this framework include:</p>
<p> A  long-term ownership strategy with overarching strategic goals for the administration of the state’s corporate ownership.</p>
<p> Administration assessments</p>
<p> Legal framework.</p>
<p>The establishment of holding companies means that the Govern- ment’s corporate governance needs to be based to a greater degree on an overarching ownership perspective. It is proposed that the Government develop a long-term  ownership strategy  that establishes the overarching strategic focus of the ownership policy and corporate governance for many years to come.</p>
<p>This long-term ownership strategy shall constitute the basis for the Government’s governance of the administration and of the holding companies. It is proposed that the ownership strategy form the basis for a consultation with the Riksdag on issues that concern overarching and long-term objectives and principles for state ownership and corporate governance. This consultation could take place at least once per term of government.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Government adopt annual administration guidelines  in the form of governance tasks to the holding companies. This is help to increase transparency in the Govern- ment’s corporate governance and support more openness is the state’s role as an owner. A comparison can be drawn here with the guidelines established by the Government as regards management of the national debt.</p>
<p>The administration of state-owned enterprises should, as is the case with other management activities, be the subject of thorough assessments  as a basis for the Government’s and the Riksdag’s governance. The proposal is to perform assessments every second year and for them to be presented in a report to the Riksdag, which will then have a basis for its audit of the holding companies and the administration of state-owned enterprises. This type of assessment is already carried out by the authorities responsible for manage- ment of the national debt and the national pension funds.</p>
<p>The Riksdag must also be given the insight, information and basis necessary for it to be able to exercise overall governance and perform an audit of the administration in its capacity as represent- ative of the owners and the country’s citizens. It is the assessment of the Committee that the current arrangement whereby members of the Riksdag are allowed to attend annual shareholders’ meetings shall continue to apply even in the proposed new organisation with holding companies.</p>
<p>The National Audit Office has an important role in the auditing of the state’s corporate ownership. According to the Committee’s proposal, the National Audit Office shall be able to audit both the</p>
<p>holding companies and the portfolio companies in which the state has a controlling influence. The Committee also considers that it should be possible to develop forms for disseminating information between the holding companies and members of the Riksdag.</p>
<p>The Committee is also of the opinion that certain fundamental provisions concerning the administration and governance of the state’s corporate ownership could be regulated by law The Committee is submitting a complete legislative proposal.</p>
<p>To support its corporate governance, the Government needs to retain resources in the Government Offices. This new ownership function  shall support the Government in its role as an owner representative. A central task will be to support the Government in its governance and monitoring of the holding companies’ activities, including the appointment of chairpersons and members to the holding company boards.</p>
