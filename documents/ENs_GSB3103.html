<p>The assignment</p>
<p>The assignment of the Inquiry on the Act concerning Support and Service for Persons with Certain Functional Impairments and assistive devices is to examine and clarify the following aspects of the Act concerning Support and Service for Persons with Certain Functional Impairments (LSS):</p>
<p>• regulations relating to measures in the form of advice and other personal support (advice and support)</p>
<p>• the scope of Section 23 of LSS, and</p>
<p>• the responsibility of municipalities to provide health and medical care for persons living in housing providing special services for children and young people and in housing providing special services or other specially adapted housing for adults.</p>
<p>The problems associated with the interpretation of the concept “advice and other personal support” arise from the lack of distinction between these measures under LSS and the care and treatment measures, inter alia in the form of habilitation and rehabilitation, under the Health and Medical Services Act.</p>
<p>The chair of the Inquiry shall adopt a position on the scope of Section 23 of LSS which regulates, inter alia, the issue of mandatory licences for private activities.</p>
<p>The assignment also includes a clarification of the municipalities’ responsibility to provide health and medical care for residents in housing providing special services pursuant to LSS. According to Section 18 of the Health and Medical Services Act, municipalities are also obliged to offer health and medical care to persons living in certain forms of housing or accommodation pursuant to the Social Services Act. Housing providing special services that has been</p>
<p>granted in accordance with LSS is not mentioned in the Health and Medical Services Act.</p>
<p>Points of departure</p>
<p>A starting point for the Inquiry has been the values that form the basis of Swedish disability policy. The most important principle for various regulations concerning persons with functional impairments is the fundamental ethical principle of the equal value of all human beings. Section 5 of LSS states that: “The activities pursuant to this Act shall promote equality in living conditions and full participation in the life of the community for those referred to in Section 1. The objective shall be for it to be possible for the private individual concerned to live as others do.”</p>
<p>Another point of departure has been various descriptions in recent years regarding the situation of persons with functional impairments in today’s society. In its latest Welfare Status Report on care of the disabled, the National Board of Health and Welfare states that, as a whole, care of the disabled in Sweden works well. At the same time, it maintains that there are certain areas that should be afforded special attention, both as regards the present situation and from a more long-term perspective. Many of the descriptions highlight shortcomings as regards support to persons with functional impairments. They still appear to have considerable difficulties in their daily lives of achieving equality in several important areas of society.</p>
<p>As regards the task of clarifying regulations relating to measures in the form of advice and support, the Inquiry has tried in various ways to create a picture of the practical application of these measures today and also to highlight their development over time. The intention has been to clarify the purpose of the measures, in accordance with the terms of reference.</p>
<p>Advice and other personal support Special personal support</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the entitlement law, LSS, is needed in today’s society. In the foreseeable future, persons with extensive and permanent functional impairments will continue to need a law</p>
<p>that entitles them to special support measures as a supplement to other legislation such as the Health and Medical Services Act. This applies to all measures described in Section 9 of LSS – including advice and support.</p>
<p>Advice and other personal support (advice and support) was one of the special forms of care under the Act on Services for the Intellectually Handicapped (“The Care Act”, 1985:568). The Government bill 1992/93:159 states that persons with severe functional impairments and their families are so vulnerable that their access to supplementary special expert support is to be regulated under a law. It further states that this entitlement shall ensure persons who meet the criteria specified in the new Act (LSS) access to such qualified measures from several areas of competence that are needed to facilitate their daily lives. The measures shall be regarded as a supplement to and not as a substitute for habilitation, rehabilitation and social services.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s terms of reference set out that there have been differences regarding the interpretation of the concept “advice and other personal support”, both when the Care Act was in force and since the introduction of LSS. The interpretation problems are based on the fact that the distinction between advice and support in LSS and certain treatment measures, for example, in the form of habilitation and rehabilitation under the Health and Medical Services Act, is unclear. In 1989, the Supreme Administrative Court (RÅ 1989 ref. 79) stated that the Care Act could serve as a complement to the Health and Medical Services Act as regards the individual’s needs for habilitation measures if these needs were not actually met in any other way. After the entry into force of LSS, the Supreme Administrative Court (RÅ 1997 ref. 49) has established that habilitation measures are not encompassed by advice and support pursuant to LSS, and that such measures should be taken under the Health and Medical Services Act.</p>
<p>According to the National Board of Health and Welfare, the Supreme Administrative Court’s decision has made it more difficult for individuals to receive advice and support than it was before this decision was announced. The report “Lindkvist’s ninth</p>
<p>– nine ways to improve the treatment of persons with functional impairments” (SOU 1999:21) states that the lack of clarity of the concept “advice and other personal support” has meant, among other things, that many people who have applied for these measures have been refused. It has also been difficult for</p>
<p>individuals to receive information about the measures, about where to apply and about what they involve. The chair of the Inquiry therefore proposes that the law be clarified with the aim of restoring its original purpose. Most of the referral bodies that have commented on the issue agree with this proposal.</p>
<p>In the terms of reference, the Government states that the purpose of and the conditions for being granted advice or support pursuant to LSS need to be clarified. The clarification should also elucidate in what way the measures can supplement measures pursuant to other legislation.</p>
<p>The Inquiry can establish that after the entry into force of LSS in 1994, the application of the measures for advice and support was influenced by the National Board of Health and Welfare’s General Recommendations 1994:1. The measures were regarded by many authorities as a supplement to other legislation, including habilitation and rehabilitation under the Health and Medical Services Act, in cases where individual needs failed to be met. This is despite the fact that the Swedish Federation of County Councils espoused another interpretation.</p>
<p>The Supreme Administrative Court’s judgments of 1997 have had a clear impact on the application by public authorities and have changed the conditions for receiving advice and support. Many measures that were previously regarded as being supplements within the sphere of advice and support are now strictly regarded as measures under the Health and Medical Services Act, thus imposing limitations on the content of advice and support. This means that responsible authorities can, to a greater extent, limit the scope of the measures or refuse to grant measures without any opportunities for the individual to take legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Many of the opinions submitted by responsible authorities in the questionnaire provided by the Inquiry, or by staff and user representatives at the Inquiry’s dialogue conferences indicate that clearer advice and support measures under LSS will also be needed in the future, among other things, to ensure that individuals’ needs are actually met and are not moved to the bottom of the list of priorities or “placed on healthcare waiting lists”. Many have therefore recommended that the measures should be restored as a complement to habilitation and rehabilitation.</p>
<p>The application of the current advice and support measures is affected, to a considerable extent, by the relationship between advice and support and habilitation and rehabilitation. It is clear</p>
<p>that these activities have many similarities as regards objectives, content, working methods, organisation and staff skills. In principle, habilitation and rehabilitation can include all the measures that can today be said to be included in the concept “advice and support”. It appears to be the ambition of many responsible authorities to replace advice and support with habilitation or rehabilitation measures. According to the Inquiry, however, it has not been possible to verify that this would ensure the complete fulfilment of individuals’ needs. There is a risk that some of the needs of persons to whom LSS applies have been equated with the needs of other target groups under the Health and Medical Services Act. This could mean that necessary measures are not provided or are delayed.</p>
<p>According to the Inquiry, therefore, eliminating the possibility of supplementing habilitation and rehabilitation with advice and support measures under LSS in cases where needs fail to be met implies an excessive limitation of “advice and support” measures.</p>
<p>It is crucial that advice and support pursuant to Section 9 of LSS can, if necessary, be used to supplement measures included in habilitation and rehabilitation. The distinction between advice and support pursuant to LSS and habilitation and rehabilitation under the Health and Medical Services Act would then be made less dramatic. The similarities that exist as regards objectives, content, working methods and staff skills could be used to their advantage, for example for coordination purposes and for the creation of common benefits.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore proposes that a clarification of the regulations relating to advice and support measures should, inter alia, mean that habilitation and rehabilitation measures can once again be supplemented in their entirety (main proposal) or in part (alternative proposal) with advice and support measures if individual needs fail to be met in other ways.</p>
<p>New designation for the measures</p>
<p>The designation “advice and other personal support” (Section 1, paragraph 1 of LSS) is often regarded as being too general and too reminiscent of the general obligation of many authorities to provide information and advice. A new designation for the support measures could therefore help to clarify their content. For this</p>
<p>reason, the Inquiry proposes that the measures under Section 9, paragraph 1 of LSS be referred to as Special personal support . The new designation makes it easier to distinguish these measures from the above-mentioned obligation to provide information and advice. A new designation also indicates that the measures have been clarified and enhanced in relation to the present advice and support.</p>
<p>In the same way as advice and support, special personal support will be an area of activity that is closely associated with certain aspects of health and medical care. It should be easiest to build up cooperation, create coordinating development measures and achieve common benefits if the county councils are responsible for the organisation and provision of these activities. The special knowledge and skills needed for the provision of these measures normally require a greater recruitment area than the average-sized municipality. Furthermore, county councils generally have a welldeveloped organisation that can provide a good basis for personal support. The division of responsibilities set out in Section 2 of LSS, whereby the county councils have the overall responsibility for measures pursuant to Section 9, paragraph 1 should therefore be maintained. As with advice and support, special personal support shall be characterised by special knowledge about the conditions governing the lives of, opportunities for and problems of persons with extensive and permanent functional impairments. This support should be provided by experts – individuals or teams – with a broad knowledge of the medical, psychological, social and educational aspects of various functional impairments.</p>
<p>As in the case of advice and support, the measures can only be provided to individuals that qualify under Section 1 of LSS and only at the request of the individual or his or her legal representative. Measures will only be provided if there is an evident need for support measures that are clearly related to the individual’s functional disability. This also applies to any indirect support measures to relatives.</p>
<p>Special personal support can be seen as a general and coordinating service. For an individual, personal support can play a decisive role in creating the conditions for a good standard of life and opportunities for participation in the life of the community. Special personal support shall strengthen the individual’s position as a member of society and make it easier for people with extensive and permanent functional impairments to live independent lives</p>
<p>with full participation in the life of the community. The support shall be characterised by self-determination, adaptation to the needs of the individual and continuity, and will be based on each individual’s unique situation in life with a special focus on the specific conditions that apply to his or her functional impairment. Among the strengths of the new system of special personal support will be flexibility and adaptation to needs. It will also be characterised by an open attitude towards new research and development findings that can lead to new working methods or measures in the area of special personal support. The aim is to ensure that the functional impairment disables the individual as little as possible.</p>
<p>Points of departure for special personal support will be each individual’s specific needs, the individual’s right to selfdetermination and the objective of the measures. Access to special knowledge and skills is fundamental in ensuring a high level of quality. It would be too restrictive to describe the content of special personal support on the basis of a list of available experts, but the professional categories that are currently used for today’s advice and support measures could serve as a basis for the skills needed for the provision of special personal support. Decisions about measures should be based on the, often varying, needs that the individual has and on an overall assessment, where the focus and extent of the measures is weighed against the benefits and the prospects of achieving the desired objective. The measures should be provided on the basis of a holistic approach that aims to fulfil the individual’s needs in an all-round manner. When necessary, it should be possible to coordinate different forms of support measures so that they interlink to provide the best possible quality, with the greatest possible efficiency.</p>
<p>The individual should be able to exercise considerable influence over the objectives of the measures. As regards the organisation of the support measures, the experts are responsible for offering adequate help, on the basis of their knowledge, while at the same time taking into account the individual’s points of view. In collaboration with the individual, and where necessary with his or her relatives, single or teams of experts shall endeavour to meet the individual’s needs. Together the experts’ special skills and competence and a well-developed working method shall combine to create conditions to achieve the objective of a good standard of life. One aspect of the experts’ skills and competence is the ability</p>
<p>in this process to treat the individual with respect by allowing room for both participation and self-determination.</p>
<p>Main proposal</p>
<p>It is important that special personal support is a flexible system of measures that can be supplemented partly according to individual needs, and partly according to changing circumstances arising from technical developments and other knowledge and skills development. There is little point, therefore, in drawing up a comprehensive list of measures to be included in the concept. However, based on existing experience of the contents of advice and support, three aspects can be identified as the cornerstones of special personal support: knowledge support, psychosocial support and special supplementary support.</p>
<p>It is important not to make a sharp distinction between these aspects, since the greatest benefits can be achieved if a combination of skills and competence can interact in a way that best corresponds to the individual’s needs. This cross-cutting working method may continue to cause problems regarding the delimitation of measures, but a demand for clear guidelines and detailed control must be weighed against the individual’s need for specially adapted measures.</p>
<p>According to the main proposal , a clarification of the measures means that it will be possible, within the framework of special personal support to provide supplementary measures – qualitatively or quantitatively – that can be regarded as habilitation and rehabilitation in cases where these needs fail to be met in other ways. This applies to all four aspects that are normally considered to make up habilitation and rehabilitation – medical, psychological, social and educational.</p>
<p>Alternative proposal</p>
<p>The Swedish Federation of County Councils and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities have voiced objections against the main proposal, and it cannot be ruled out that these objections may influence the outcome of a decision about the implementation of the main proposal. For this reason, and since the Inquiry is keen to</p>
<p>ensure that a clarification of measures for advice and support will provide a high level of quality, an alternative proposal  is also presented as a compromise proposal. When the report is circulated for comments an assessment can be made of both proposals in relation to the current application of advice and support measures.</p>
<p>The alternative proposal  is also based on three aspects, where knowledge support  and psychosocial support  have the same content as the main proposal. The third aspect is development and activity support.</p>
<p>In the alternative proposal , just three aspects of habilitation and rehabilitation, that is the psychological, social and educational aspects, may be included as supplements. So as not to influence the principles that are considered to guide health and medical services, the medical aspects of habilitation and rehabilitation cannot be included as a possible supplement. To compensate for this, in part, some specific measures have been described as regards development and activity support.</p>
<p>Individual plans and a coordinating function</p>
<p>During the course of the inquiry, a clear connection has emerged between central aspects of special personal support and the provisions on individual plans in Sections 10 and 14 of LSS. This includes information, appraisals, planning, coordination, follow-up and evaluation. The connection has been underlined by responsible authorities, administrators and user representatives. Individual plans have been highlighted as an instrument that should be developed in order to support a cooperation process where the individual is given a real influence over planning and follow-up of various measures. The plans can also give the individual a clear overview of different measures and the need for coordination. Individual plans can be regarded as a bridge between measures in the form of special personal support and other activities intended to provide support to the user.</p>
<p>Today, individual plans are used to a very limited extent and the legislator’s intentions have not been fulfilled. One reason for this may be that it is up to the individual himself or herself to ask for a plan, and that knowledge of this option is lacking. In order to increase the use of individual plans, and consequently to strengthen opportunities for influence and self-determination, the Inquiry</p>
<p>proposes that Section 10 of LSS be amended. When a measure is granted pursuant to LSS, the responsible authority shall be obliged to inform the individual of the opportunity to draw up an individual plan. According to the proposal, the plan is to be followed up, evaluated and reviewed at least once a year.</p>
<p>For many users, coordination of various support measures is a recurrent need, and an important aspect of measures in the form of special personal support. In particular, families with children that have several functional impairments need to coordinate a number of different support measures. Sometimes parents or other relatives are compelled to take on the task of finding and coordinating these contacts without really having the prerequisites to do so. In order to enhance the quality of the coordination process and to ensure greater continuity, the Inquiry proposes that the individual should have the option of being assigned a specific, named coordinator within the context of special personal support. The coordinator shall help the user and his or her relatives to find what they are looking for among the available health care and social services. The coordinator can help to simplify contacts between various support persons and to increase opportunities for continuity in cooperation with users and their relatives.</p>
<p>Quality assurance</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals for clarifications through special personal support mean an enhancement of the existing system of measures for advice and support that can serve to increase the quality of support to persons to whom LSS applies. It is especially important to develop certain aspects of the measures, for example, coordination processes. Other quality criteria which can also be developed are the individual’s right to exercise an influence and to self-determination. Regional R&D activities could be a way to develop qualitative methods and follow-up instruments in close consultation with user representatives and staff.</p>
<p>The National Board of Health and Welfare has underlined the need for staff skills development and stresses the importance of extending the special skills that are needed in care of the disabled, inter alia, to increase feelings of professional belonging. In this area too, regional or local R&D activities should have the potential to contribute to quality development. Basing these activities in the</p>
<p>local community makes it possible to take advantage of the staff’s knowledge in order to develop work in the field of special personal support.</p>
<p>R&D departments have been set up in the social services and elderly care services with the help of state incentive funds. The Inquiry proposes support to a corresponding development of R&D projects with the aim of elaborating objectives, content, working methods and staff skills in the field of special personal support. It therefore proposes that funds amounting to SEK 5 million per year are distributed regionally for a period of five years.</p>
<p>Financial implications</p>
<p>It is probable that the proposal for a clarification of measures will lead to an increased use of resources in the field of special personal support. A central question in the impact assessment is whether or not the need for advice and support measures and habilitation and rehabilitation measures is satisfied today. In financial terms the question can be put as follows: Do the costs exist to satisfy needs today, or will new users mean additional costs? If the costs exist, the clarification will not involve any additional costs, but it is necessary to elucidate who bears the costs today.</p>
<p>The county councils bear the overall responsibility for measures in the form of advice and support. Since 1994, when LSS superseded the Care Act, county councils have received a government grant of SEK 200 million per year to cover the additional costs that could be estimated to incur when a larger group was given the right to measures. Among most responsible authorities it is impossible to distinguish these funds, since separate accounts cannot be presented. It is therefore very difficult to analyse how these funds have been used and how they relate to other costs for advice and support activities. One reason is that the responsible authorities work in an integrated manner with advice and support in habilitation activities and in many cases have the ambition primarily to offer the support in the form of habilitation pursuant to the Health and Medical Services Act. Surveys show that less than 20 per cent of the government grant is used for advice and support, and that between 60 and 80 per cent is used for habilitation and rehabilitation purposes. The tendency to use the government grant largely for habilitation and rehabilitation</p>
<p>purposes means that it is likely that individuals to whom LSS does not apply are also at the receiving end of the additional resources. This also causes a lack of clarity as to the extent to which the resources satisfy the needs of persons to whom LSS does apply.</p>
<p>From a financial perspective, the proposal for special personal support should mean a redistribution of funds that are earmarked for advice and support – funds that are largely used for habilitation and rehabilitation purposes today. Presuming that the demand for support measures increases and based on certain assumptions, the projected estimations show that this increase will not give rise to additional costs over and above the government grant. It should also be possible to finance the proposal for support to the development of R&D departments amounting to SEK 5 million per year through a redistribution of funds within the limits of the current government grant.</p>
<p>Private activities under LSS</p>
<p>Section 23 of LSS regulates, inter alia, the issue of mandatory licences for activities conducted on a commercial basis. According to this provision, no private person may conduct on a commercial basis activities such as are envisaged in Section 9, subsections 6 10 of LSS. This includes housing providing special services. The background to the Inquiry’s assignment regarding a clarification of the scope of Section 23 of LSS is that the Parliamentary Ombudsmen have informed the Government that there are differences in opinion as to whether the provision on mandatory licences is applicable when a municipality transfers the management of housing providing special services for adults under Section 9, subsection 9 of LSS to a private legal subject. The application of Section 23, i.e., of whether or not licences are mandatory has, at any rate until the summer of 2001, varied between different county councils.</p>
<p>In a statement to the Parliamentary Ombudsmen, the National Board of Health and Welfare notes that licences are also mandatory in the case of contract activities, and that any deviations require a direct exemption clause in the law or some clear form of statement about the possibility of granting exemptions of this kind. Since the announcement of the Parliamentary Ombudsmen’s decision in the summer of 2001 and the adoption of guidelines by the county</p>
<p>councils in the autumn of 2001 relating to licences to conduct activities on a commercial basis pursuant to Section 23 of LSS, provisions on mandatory licences have been applied in a uniform manner.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that it seems most logical to adopt the same interpretation of the provision on mandatory licences in Section 23, paragraph one of LSS as the National Board of Health and Welfare. If a municipality, in the case of housing providing special services for adults pursuant to LSS, maintains responsibility for the provision of housing and any common premises – but on the basis of Section 17 of LSS – transfers the management thereof to a private legal subject, the private legal subject must consequently apply for a licence from the county council. Today, all county councils require that persons or bodies conducting private contract activities pursuant to LSS apply for a licence, which means that there is a uniform interpretation of Section 23 of LSS. According to the Inquiry, therefore, there is no need for a clarification of the law.</p>
<p>The responsibility of municipalities to provide health and medical care for persons living in special forms of housing</p>
<p>According to the terms of reference, the Inquiry shall clarify the issue of municipalities’ responsibility to provide health and medical care for persons living in housing providing special services for children and young people and in housing providing special services or other specially adapted housing for adults. There are currently different interpretations of municipalities’ responsibility to provide health and medical care for persons living in housing providing special services pursuant to LSS. This may be due to the fact that this form of accommodation is not mentioned in Section 18 of the Health and Medical Services Act.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has established that it is logical that municipalities’ responsibility to provide health and medical care should also apply to housing providing special services under LSS, in conformity with housing providing special services under the Social Services Act. The same conditions should also apply to the corresponding forms of accommodation covered in Section 23 of LSS. However, the Inquiry has learnt that there are demarcation problems between health authorities that negatively affect the provision and quality of</p>
<p>health and medical care for the intended target groups. For this reason, it is important to take into special consideration the skills that are required to ensure that the needs of persons to whom LSS applies are satisfied. There is a risk that municipalities – in particular smaller municipalities – do not have the necessary resources to develop these skills.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore proposes that the municipalities’ responsibility to provide health and medical care under Section 18 of the Health and Medical Services Act should also comprise individuals who have been granted housing providing special services pursuant to Section 9, subsection 8 or 9 of LSS. The municipalities’ responsibility for these persons should not include health and medical care that is provided by a doctor or care that requires a hospital’s medical or technical resources or other specialist skills. The term “other specialist skills” refers to support from experts, inter alia, with knowledge of extensive and permanent functional impairments. Such skills are normally found in the county councils’ habilitation services for children and young people and for adults.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the municipalities’ responsibility to provide health and medical care should only include housing with special services for children and young people who need to live away from their parental home  pursuant to Section 9, subsection 8 of LSS and housing providing special services  for adults, pursuant to Section 9, subsection 9 of LSS. Responsibility for health and medical care for persons living in a family home pursuant to Section 9, subsection 8 of LSS and for persons living in other specially adapted housing for adults pursuant to Section 9, subsection 9 of LSS rests with the authority responsible for home medical care.</p>
