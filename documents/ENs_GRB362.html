<p>Task of the Committee</p>
<p>The Committee of Inquiry into legislation governing radio and television has been instructed to analyse and consider the need for alterations principally to the Radio and Television Act (1996:844) and the Television Licence Fees Act (1989:41) and to propose the amendments occasioned by its considerations.</p>
<p>This interim report deals with the part of the Committee’s task that consists of presenting draft amendments to the effect that short overruns of the permitted advertising time per hour can be accepted if they were unforeseen or incidental.</p>
<p>This report proposes that a rule providing for an exception should be introduced in a new paragraph in Chapter 7. Section 5 of the Radio and Television Act. Our deliberations and proposals are presented briefly in the following.</p>
<p>Present situation</p>
<p>The Radio and Television Act contains regulations on the amount of advertising permitted in radio and television broadcasts. According to Chapter 7, Section 5, paragraph 1, advertising may be broadcast for not more than eight minutes in each clock hour. In television broadcasts this time may be extended to not more than ten minutes both during broadcasting hours between 7.00 p.m. and midnight and in strictly exceptional cases. The amount of advertising in television broadcasts may never exceed ten per cent of the total transmission time per day.</p>
<p>The Television Directive (89/552/EEC amended by 97/36/EC) applies to European Union Member States. The Directive, which is intended to create free movement for television broadcasts, contains minimum requirements that Member States must</p>
<p>maintain. However, each Member State is free to require that broadcasters in its jurisdiction comply with stricter or more detailed regulations. According to the Television Directive it is permissible to broadcast advertising for not more than 20 per cent of a clock hour, i.e. for twelve minutes per hour. Advertising may account for not more than 15 per cent of the total transmission time during a day.</p>
<p>The Broadcasting Commission monitors compliance with the advertising regulations. If the Commission finds that the regulations have been broken it can ask the Stockholm County Administrative Court to impose a special fee.</p>
<p>In some cases the present formulation of Chapter 7, Section 5 of the Radio and Television Act has led to breaches of the regulation by broadcasters. This may happen when live programmes have run over their scheduled times, for instance. As a result, advertising spots have been displaced from their scheduled transmission times and broadcast at other times. When overruns of the permitted advertising volume during an hour have taken place, this has not, however, usually led to an increase in the total volume of advertising during the relevant broadcasting hours.</p>
<p>Overruns of the maximum permitted amount of advertising can arise for a number of reasons. The situations our terms of reference are intended to address are mainly live broadcasts of sports events and other topical events. The source of the problems is the difficulty of estimating the exact length of programmes in these contexts. This is because unforeseen or incidental events may occur making it impossible to keep to programme schedules. As a result, advertising blocks may be transmitted during a different broadcasting hour from the one originally planned or may have to be withdrawn completely. This means that the broadcaster can then be placed in the situation of either breaking the advertising rule and risking the imposition of a special fee or being forced to compensate advertisers because their advertising was not broadcast or was not broadcast at the agreed time. In this context the intention behind the task given to us is to open up an exception to present Swedish regulations on advertising time per clock hour.</p>
<p>Deliberations and proposals</p>
<p>Our starting point for an amendment to the Act is that a new exception from the provision of Chapter 7, Section 5, paragraph 1 of eight or ten minutes during an hour must not make it permissible to increase the total amount of advertising on television. So a new exception should only mean that planned adverts can be moved to a different time.</p>
<p>A new exception to be introduced</p>
<p>We propose that it should be possible to run over the limit for the amount of advertising normally permitted if the broadcaster can show that the overrun is due to a recent event that the broadcaster did not reasonably have cause to take into consideration in programme scheduling and that the event was outside the broadcaster’s control.</p>
<p>To begin with the Committee takes the view that broadcasters should be capable of planning to avoid slight shifts in programme schedules. We therefore consider that – for the exception to be applicable – something must have happened that the broadcaster could not reasonably have foreseen and that the broadcaster was therefore unable to plan for when scheduling programmes. By this we mean events of an incidental or unforeseen nature.</p>
<p>We also propose that the event in question should be outside the broadcaster’s control. This ought to apply to most live sports broadcasts where the broadcaster is not able to make its own breaks to transmit commercials during the programme. In the case of live galas produced by the broadcaster and similar events as well as in normal news broadcasts, however, any deviations from planned schedules can be regarded as being within the broadcaster’s control. According to our proposal the exception should, however, be applicable to live news broadcasts of great interest to the general public, such as the plane crash at Gottröra, the Estonia Disaster and the events in the United States on 11 September 2001.</p>
<p>The burden of proof for showing that a particular situation was exceptional rests with the broadcaster, who has to show the relevant conditions were met.</p>
<p>A general maximum limit of twelve minutes</p>
<p>In our view the Television Directive’s regulations on the amount of advertising permitted during a clock hour must be the ceiling for the size of permitted overruns of the eight or ten minutes of advertising in an hour stipulated in the Radio and Television Act. The Committee therefore proposes that it should never be permissible to broadcast more than twelve minutes of advertising during a clock hour. In our view this upper limit should apply both during prime time, i.e. 7.00 p.m. to midnight, and at other times. We also take the view that the maximum limit stipulated in the Television Directive should be interpreted as 20 per cent of a whole hour whatever the actual transmission time. We therefore propose that the upper limit of twelve minutes should also apply in cases where the transmission time is less than to one hour in a clock hour.</p>
<p>Ten per cent rule still to apply</p>
<p>The Committee is not proposing any change in the rule that the total daily amount of advertising may not be more than ten per cent of the total transmission time.</p>
<p>Knock-on changes to be permitted</p>
<p>In some cases a situation may arise in which a delay in a programme schedule means that unused advertising time has to be moved on to the next broadcasting hour but – because of the twelve minute rule, reasons of space or the regulations on placing adverts – all unused time cannot be used during that hour. When this happens knock-on changes may be necessary. This means that the unused advertising time is used later than during the hour immediately after the hour for which the advertising was originally scheduled. We propose that knock-on changes of this kind should be permitted, as the scope of the exception would otherwise be too limited. The general rule is, however, that unused time should be used in the hour immediately following the hour in which the delay occurred.</p>
<p>Present exception to be abolished</p>
<p>As mentioned above Chapter 7, Section 5, paragraph 1, sentence 2 of the Radio and Television Act permits an exception from the rule of eight minutes advertising time from midnight until 7.00 p.m. In strictly exceptional cases the maximum permitted volume of advertisements may be ten minutes. The Committee considers that the arguments put forward when the exception was introduced are no longer relevant. Our proposal is therefore that the present exception should be abolished.</p>
<p>Consequences</p>
<p>The proposals that the Committee is putting forward do not involve increased costs for the State or for other parties affected by them. On the contrary, our proposals will lead to some, albeit marginal, cost reductions for TV4 AB and for the Broadcasting Commission. To some extent our proposals may also lead to a revenue increase for TV4 AB and then for the State on account of the method used to calculate the concession fee paid by TV4 AB.</p>
