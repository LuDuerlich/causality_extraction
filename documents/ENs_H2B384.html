<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Our  mission</h2>
<p>In May 2012, the Swedish Government decided to appoint a Coordination Council and National Knowledge Platform for Smart Grids (ToR 2012:48). The Coordination Council's mission includes stimulating dialogue and cooperation, developing a national knowledge platform and a national action plan for the development of smart grids in Sweden from 2015 to 2030. The proposal for an action plan shall be submitted to the Government by 15 December 2014 at the latest.</p>
<p>The work of the Coordination Council has covered smart grid solutions all along the value chain, from the connection of power stations to new end user services, such as smart solutions for the home.</p>
<p>Based on the requirements laid down in its terms of reference (ToR), the Coordination Council has formulated the following vision and objective for its activities:  The vision: Sweden is a world leader in the field of smart grids that enable greater customer empowerment, sustainable development, security of supply and growth.  The objective: Through greater cooperation, knowledge development and knowledge dissemination and by means of an action plan, to help create clear ground rules on the market, strengthened customer empowerment, beneficial development conditions for smart grids in Sweden and to promote smart grids as a Swedish growth industry.</p>
<p>A crucial starting-point for the mission has been how to adapt the electricity system to the long-term energy and climate policy goals in Sweden and the EU – a considerable challenge in itself. This requires an electricity system that is considerably more flexible than it is today. At the same time, however, rapid developments in information and communication technology (ICT) are facilitating the modernisation of the electricity system and the introduction of new market solutions that can contribute to crucial changes in the way customers participate on the market. New technology and new market models that help to increase flexibility throughout the system will function better than current solutions. It is in this perspective that the need to invest in smart grids is to be considered.</p>
<p>The reference groups that we have established to facilitate cooperation have also been important. These were made up of experts and key actors in primary focus areas and have provided vital background material for the Coordination Council as it developed the knowledge platform and action plan. Our own surveys and analyses based on central questions in the Council's terms of reference have also been of considerable use.</p>
<p>In order to highlight the long-term consequences and the need for measures, the Coordination Council has produced future scenarios for the development of smart grids in Sweden in 2030 and their development towards 2050. These feasible future scenarios have made it easier to identify and formulate potential consequences and the need for measures.</p>
<h2>Premises for the action plan</h2>
<p>A key premise for the Coordination Council's action plan is that smart grids can increase customer empowerment as they provide customers with more options on the market and stimulate the development of new products and services. The potential expansion of electricity generation from short-term fluctuating energy sources such as sun and wind (known as "intermittent electricity generation") is the other crucial factor influencing the need for smart grid solutions in the future.</p>
<p>The driving-forces for smart grids are primarily market-based. The aim of the action plan is to ensure long-term planning and facilitate adaptation to future challenges. The plan should take a holistic approach, the main focus of which is on customer benefit coupled with efficient and sustainable resource use and a secure supply of electricity. Smart grids are primarily a tool to achieve the desired level of customer and public benefit, e.g. greater energy efficiency, electrification of the transport sector and a sustainable energy system. The realisation of these goals requires long-term development efforts to which smart grids can make a significant contribution.</p>
<p>The development of smart grids is closely linked to the development of the European electricity market and poses complex problems that need to be carefully analysed. At the same time, it is important that the process to facilitate the adaptation to new conditions on the electricity market (a large percentage of intermittent generation, active customers with entirely new consumption patterns, etc.) gets under way as soon as possible. This will provide us with practical experience before the challenges become more urgent.</p>
<h2>Overarching focus and monitoring of the action plan</h2>
<p>In order to manage the uncertainty of such a long-term perspective (2015–2030), the action plan is based on a number of basic goals and recommendations that we anticipate will also be valid in the longer term. These cover the need for change in areas that we deem to be of significance for the development of smart grids. For each recommendation, we have made assessments and developed proposals for measures that need to be implemented within the next few years along with a proposal for how to allocate responsibility. As a result of changes in the world around us, it will be possible to identify new needs for measures linked to the recommendations as they emerge.</p>
<p>This structure will provide us with a stable framework for our long-term efforts where the need for concrete measures can be identified step by step. Systematic monitoring and updating of the action plan is therefore of the utmost importance. To this aim, we propose that a national forum for smart grids be established with the task of promoting dialogue between the actors involved, monitoring implementation of the action plan, identifying the need for supplementary measures and coordinating the implementation and follow-up of certain proposals. The forum should also be responsible for managing and developing the knowledge platform.</p>
<h2>Recommendations and proposals</h2>
<p>The recommendations and proposals in the action plan have been divided into three main areas, each of which corresponds directly to an area described in the Coordination Council's wording of its objectives. All the recommendations and proposals are listed in the table on the inside cover of the report.</p>
<p>The Council is presenting only one legislative proposal, which is an amendment to the existing legal framework. This amendment gives the electricity customers who ask for it access to information that at least corresponding to hourly meter data without them having to have an hourly based contract and at no extra cost to them.</p>
<p>Impact assessments for our proposals can be found in Section 7.</p>
<p>Political framework and market terms and conditions</p>
<p>The political framework should be developed in order to take advantage of the new possibilities that smart grids can offer while at the same time maintaining competition on the deregulated electricity market. And the market terms and conditions should be designed so that they provide a clear incentive for socioeconomic, cost-effective smart grid measures without restricting competition on the market for new technology.</p>
<p>In order to cope with the future challenges of the electricity system, the ground rules on the market will need to be improved so that smart grid solutions can benefit both the system and the grids. Here, the terms and conditions for demand response and energy storage that are dealt with in Recommendations 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 are of particular interest. Of similar importance are the conditions for modernisation of the electricity grids dealt with in Recommendation 4.2.3.</p>
<p>Operation of future smart energy systems requires greater automation in order to control the physical processes for electricity generation and distribution, and more advanced IT systems to cope with large flows of information (measurement data, site information, work orders, customer data, etc.). Information management of the smart grids requires awareness of security and integrity, which is discussed in Recommendation 4.2.4.</p>
<p>Smart grids also mean new conditions for cooperation with other parts of the energy system. Integration between the electricity system and energy carriers such as gas and district heating can provide greater scope for the storage of heat and cooling capabilities. Electrification of vehicular traffic can give rise to a demand for greater flexibility in the grid when vehicles are to be charged. Smart grids can play an important role in this. The scope for energy efficiency is also affected by different smart grid solutions. In a future electricity system, the capacity need will be just as important as the energy need. And this will have a bearing on how energy efficiency should be designed and coordinated with the various demand response options. These issues are dealt with in Recommendations 4.2.5–4.2.7.</p>
<p>The extent of the expansion of intermittent electricity generation in Sweden and northern Europe will determine the demands placed on the different levels of the electricity system. And the composition and location of the intermittent electricity generation are also decisive factors. In order to deal with these long-term challenges, greater understanding of the effects on the system level is required so that we can change the rules in time. Recommendations 4.2.8 and 4.2.9 discuss these challenges.</p>
<p>Customer participation and societal aspects</p>
<p>Several of the recommendations and proposals have a clear customer perspective, primarily focussing on the pre-conditions and need for initiatives that support customers linked to the new opportunities for active participation that smart grids provide.</p>
<p>In Recommendations 4.3.1 and 4.3.2, we highlight the consumer perspective and personal integrity in particular. Knowledge of what determines people's preferences and their interest in smart grid solutions is also an important part of the customer perspective in Recommendation 4.3.3. How measurement data and information can become more easily accessible for customers is discussed in Recommendations 4.3.4 to 4.3.6. Here the focus is on the need for rule changes, clearer priceand cost-related information from market players and functional requirements for the next generation of smart meters.</p>
<p>This section also looks at overarching social aspects and synergies between smart grids and other societal developments. Smart grids are important for sustainable community development and the development of smart cities. In order to utilize the potential of community planning to contribute to the development of the energy system and smart grids, greater information and knowledge exchange is required, something that is discussed in Recommendation 4.3.7.</p>
<p>There are synergy effects between the energy sector and smart products and services being developed in other areas. Even if this development is primarily market-driven, there is still a need to disseminate information and knowledge, an aspect that is discussed in Recommendation 4.3.8.</p>
<p>R&D, innovation and growth</p>
<p>The third part of the action plan concerns how Sweden can benefit from the development of smart grids in the best possible way and create the conditions for smart grids to develop into a Swedish growth industry. By way of introduction, the need for knowledge and skills supply is discussed (4.4.1) where we highlight, in two recommendations, the new skills requirement created by the development of smart grids and the importance of making educational programmes in this subject more attractive. Recommendations 4.4.2 and 4.4.3 focus on the need to stimulate research, development and innovation.</p>
<p>Important components are the proposal for a thematic research plan and an integrated strategy for innovation. The importance of utilising and strengthening existing settings and stimulating greater cooperation is also highlighted as a key priority.</p>
<p>As regards initiatives involving the whole knowledge triangle – education, research and innovation – test and demonstration projects play a vital role. Demonstration projects can also assist the development of new market models. Section 4.4.4 gives two recommendations for the initiatives.</p>
<p>Sweden has a strong position in several of the technical areas that are relevant to the development of the future smart electricity system and has asserted itself well in international comparisons and publications. But Sweden is a small, export-dependent country and further internationalisation is therefore important for Sweden's position in the area of smart grids. We discuss the issue in Recommendation 4.4.5 and 4.4.6 where aspects such as standardisation and interoperability are highlighted as important tools.</p>
<p>The long-term focus of the action plan</p>
<p>Finally, the action plan concludes with a discussion on long-term measures that are not directly linked to the recommendations in the action plan. Here we discuss how the tools currently in use today may need to be improved in the longer term to keep up with the constantly changing conditions on the market. One important condition is the rules on the European market, which in turn will lead to changes on the Swedish market. Even economic instruments, such as green electricity certificates and energy taxes may need to be reviewed in a long-term perspective. Finally, we need to highlight the opportunities in the public sector, e.g. in the form of public procurement and innovation procurement.</p>
<h2>Assessment of the opportunities for smart grids</h2>
<p>The Coordination Council's mission also covers a number of demands for assessments, surveys and analyses within different areas that might feasibly influence the development of smart grids and that are to constitute the basis of the action plan. The results of this work are presented in Section 5 and have been structured as follows:</p>
<p>The results presented here are based on a thorough analysis and a broad dialogue with various stakeholders. The results from the analyses in different areas can be found in the Coordination Council's own reports and in a number of background reports. A complete list can be found in Appendix 3.</p>
