<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>My remit was to review the conditions required to ensure that the Swedish business sector has access to efficient and competitive maritime transport. In line with the terms of reference, the conditions affecting the competitiveness of maritime transport under the Swedish flag, and the risks of increased flagging-out of ships, have been highlighted. The remit also included submitting proposals, where appropriate, for measures to strengthen competetiveness and to consider the possibility of introducing a Swedish international shipping register.</p>
<h2>Starting points</h2>
<p>To be able to make an overall assessment of whether it is suitable to implement additional support measures, I have chosen to shed light on the issue of Swedish-flagged ships from several perspectives.</p>
<p>The competitiveness of Swedish-flagged ships has been compared with the competitiveness of ships flying the flags of maritime nations in our vicinity. Moreover, I have shed light on and evaluated the socio-economic effects of support to maritime transport. I have also looked into what value the Swedish business sector attaches to the possibility of transporting its goods on Swedish-flagged ships. In addition, I have analysed the added value for society in general of Swedish-flagged ships.</p>
<p>Moreover, I have assessed the need for additional measures from a political perspective. This perspective covers the maritime policy decisions taken in the EU and Sweden’s transport, industry and labour market policies.</p>
<h2>Current conditions affecting the competitiveness of Swedish-flagged ships</h2>
<p>My assessment is that the conditions affecting the competitiveness of Swedish-flagged ships are worse than those for ships from maritime nations in our vicinity. The most crucial competitive disadvantage is higher staffing costs. The main reason for the higher staffing costs is the fact that the proportion of crew members from low-wage countries is lower on Swedish ships than on ships from flag states in our vicinity.</p>
<p>When it comes to fees associated with the Swedish flag, such as registration fees and inspections, I do not consider these to be a determining factor in a Swedish shipping company’s decision to register its ship in another country.</p>
<p>I can also note that the lack of a maritime tonnage tax system represents a deviation from the conditions that prevail in most other EU maritime nations; it also means that Sweden has a considerably higher tax on mortgages on ships than Denmark, for example. Proposals for amendments in the area of taxation are not part of my remit, however.</p>
<h2>Socio-economic assessment</h2>
<p>To be able to assess the benefit to society of Swedish-flagged ships and to place this benefit in relation to the socio-economic cost of maintaining a Swedish-flagged merchant fleet, I have had a socioeconomic analysis carried out.</p>
<p>In the calculations made, the current situation with maritime support and TAP agreements has been compared with a situation with maritime support alone, and with scenarios including a Swedish international register of ships.</p>
<p>According to the calculations, all of these scenarios would entail a considerable socio-economic cost. The calculations show that current maritime support – SEK 1.7 billion as at 1 January 2010 – results in a socio-economic cost of approximately SEK 1.4 billion.</p>
<p>If 60 per cent of the employees on board were temporarily employed staff, the socio-economic cost would decrease by approximately SEK 240 million compared to the current situation.</p>
<p>The decrease with 75 per cent temporarily employed staff would be approximately SEK 340 million.</p>
<h2>The business sector’s assessment of the benefit of access to Swedish tonnage</h2>
<p>I can state that it is currently very common for the Swedish business sector to use vessels that are not Swedish-flagged for shipping.</p>
<p>As a complement to the socio-economic study, I have had a special study carried out on the Swedish business sector’s view of access to maritime transport. According to those who were interviewed in the study and who represent a relatively large share of the market in the sectors chosen, access to Swedish-flagged ships does not have any crucial significance for the competitiveness of the Swedish business sector.</p>
<p>My view is that the Swedish business sector is not reliant on Swedish-flagged ships or Swedish shipping companies for gaining access to efficient and competitive maritime transport. However, Swedish shipping companies do provide added value to the Swedish transport market. This added value consists of the shipping companies’ knowledge of and proximity to the Swedish market, as well as the opportunity to pursue issues concerning development and innovation with other parts of the Swedish maritime cluster.</p>
<h2>Reasons to maintain a Swedish merchant fleet</h2>
<p>In my view, there are arguments in favour of Sweden continuing to support maritime transport so that a Swedish-flagged merchant fleet can be maintained at the same level as today. The main factors in favour of retaining a Swedish merchant fleet are:</p>
<p>• the opportunity to influence work on environmental and maritime safety within international organisations;</p>
<p>• the opportunity to maintain maritime  know-how in Sweden; and</p>
<p>• the opportunity to help achieve the strategic objectives of EU maritime policy.</p>
<p>The objectives of European maritime policy are European maritime transport with high safety standards and efforts to reduce the negative environmental impact of maritime transport in the form of emissions and waste. As Sweden supports these objectives, I consider it necessary that Sweden contribute to achieving them. Retaining a Swedish merchant fleet will also help to maintain and develop the Swedish maritime cluster.</p>
<p>In my assessment, the current size of the Swedish merchant fleet has been adequate to maintain maritime know-how and to be able to take a proactive stance in international contexts. My proposals are therefore primarily targeted at maintaining this level.</p>
<p>If measures are not taken to strengthen the competitiveness of Swedish maritime transport, I consider that the flagging-out of cargo ships will continue. However, these measures should be evaluated based on the cost they would entail for society, and the focus is therefore on limiting the negative impact on the economy.</p>
<h2>Proposals for retaining a Swedish merchant fleet</h2>
<p>The conditions affecting the competitiveness of Swedish-flagged ships may be strengthened primarily through measures resulting in reduced staffing costs. I consider that this should be achieved by increasing the proportion of temporarily employed staff on Swedish-flagged ships. To achieve this, new agreements should be reached without delay between the social partners. The proportion of temporarily employed staff should be regulated in central agreements. For staffing costs to be reduced within a reasonable time, the shipping companies should offer adjustment measures. In addition, labour market policy measures may be required. For the practice of flagging out ships to be curbed, negotiations should begin without delay between the social partners, with the aim of having a new agreement signed by 1 March 2011 at the latest. The Government should follow these negotiations closely. To ensure a high pace in negotiations between the partners, the Government should consider offering a chief negotiator.</p>
<p>An additional proposal to strengthen competitiveness in the long term is to establish an innovation fund for maritime transport. The fund could be created by redistributing a small share of the funds currently making up maritime support. The fund should focus on support for innovations and investments in the areas of the environment and maritime safety.</p>
<p>In addition, I propose that a comprehensive research and innovation programme be drawn up for the maritime sector as a whole. The Swedish Maritime Administration should be responsible for drawing up such a programme in collaboration with relevant actors.</p>
<p>I also consider that maritime support should be provided for all ships covered by the Commission’s guidelines on state aid to maritime transport. This means that a small number of ships currently not receiving support may do so in future.</p>
<h2>Swedish international shipping register (SIS)</h2>
<p>I have considered the possibility of introducing an SIS as a way of reducing staffing costs. The aim of an SIS would be to make it easier for Swedish shipping companies to employ staff from lowwage countries on terms that result in lower staffing costs.</p>
<p>For an SIS to have the desired effect, amendments to Swedish labour legislation are needed. These amendments are of such a nature as to contravene international conventions that Sweden has ratified. Amendments to Swedish labour law may, in my view, lead to more sectors demanding similar regulatory amendments. I also fear that there will be difficulties achieving sustainable long-term conditions for maritime policy with an SIS. In light of this, I cannot recommend introducing one.</p>
<p>My assessment is based on an in-depth analysis of how an SIS could be designed. I have chosen to present this analysis and the legislative amendments on which it is based in an annex to this report.</p>
