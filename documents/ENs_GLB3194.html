<p>The Assignment</p>
<p>Rules on the non-contractual liability of the State and of local authorities are in Swedish law to be found in the Tort Liability Act (Skadeståndslagen 1972:207) and in a number of acts containing provisions on liability in certain fields. Questions concerning the Swedish rules on the liability of the State and other public bodies for loss inflicted through fault or negligence in the exercise of public powers have most recently been dealt with in a report presented by a government committee in 1993 (SOU 1993:55).</p>
<p>The background to the report here presented is constituted by a number of decisions where the Court of Justice, in preliminary rulings under Article 177 of the Treaty of Rome, has held that it is a principle of Community law that the Member States, under certain conditions, are obliged to pay compensation for harm caused to individuals by breaches of EC law for which the State can be held responsible. Since Sweden´s accession to the European Union, on the 1st of January 1995, the question has arisen as to how the concept of the Member States liability is to be understood and whether the Swedish rules on the noncontractual liability of the State and local authorities are in accordance with EC law as put down by the Court of Justice.</p>
<p>The Commission´s assignment has been to analyse the question of the non-contractual liability of the State and local authorities for breaches of EC law. The main task has been to describe the liability för damages which, according to the Court of Justice, can be imposed on a member State when harm is caused to individuals by breaches of EC law for which the State can be held responsible and to propose such amendments to Swedish law which prove necessary.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>After a short introductory section the second part of the report deals with Sweden´s accession to the European Union  (section 2), The legal system of the EU  and The relation of Community law to national law</p>
<p>(sections 3 and 4). The commission discusses, inter alia, the special character of EC law and the importance of the case law of the Court of Justice. The most important general principles of EC law are described as well as the methods of interpretation applied by the Court of Justice. As to the question of the relation of Community law to national law the principles of direct applicability and direct effect and the principles of solidarity and supemacy are, among others, mentioned.</p>
<p>The liability of Member States for breaches of EC law</p>
<p>The third part of the report deals with the present development – in EC law as well as in national law – as to the liability of Member States for breaches of EC law. It begins with a survey of Cases from the Court of Justice  (section 5). The most important decisions in which the Court has, up to now, developed the principle of State liability for breaches of Community law are examined. The survey includes among others the Francovich, Brasserie du pêcheur, Factortame III and Dillenkofer cases.</p>
<p>After this follows The Situation in Sweden  (section 6). The question of State liability for breaches of Community law has so far mainly arisen as a consequence of the implementation of the so called Directive on the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer (80/987/EEC). There are however also examples of claims for compensation within other fields of law. The Commission notes that there is a great interest in questions connected to the liability of member states for breaches of EC law and that new issues arise continuously.</p>
<p>According to the terms of reference the Commission was to investigate how the matters in question have been solved in the legal systems of other Member States. In the section The Situation in other  EU-countries   (section 7) the answers to an inquiry made by the Commission to the other Member States are accounted for. The national laws of the EU-countries present different models of liability. In certain states there are rules of law concerning the liability of the State and other public bodies, whereas in other states such a liability has developed only in case law. Requirements corresponding to the Swedish notions of ”exercising public authority” and ”fault or negligence” are a prerequisite för liability in several countries. The possibility to impose liability upon a state for acts and omissions of the national legislature varies. The answers given to the questions put by the Commission show that the decisions of the Court of Justice in the Francovich case and subsequent judgements has not yet lead to any</p>
<p>legislative measures in the Member States concerned. However, in several countries claims for compensation have been put forward, with referece to the Francovich doctrine by individuals against the State, based on allegations of infringements of EC-rules.</p>
<p>Considerations and proposals</p>
<p>In part four of the report there is an introduction on The liability of Member States for breaches of EC law – an abstract of the criteria laid down by the Court  (section 8). To sum up the following facts are established.</p>
<p>* All types of infringements are actionable.</p>
<p>* The infringement must apply to a binding EC rule.</p>
<p>* Imposition of liability is possible irrespective of the direct effect of the rule which has been infringed.</p>
<p>* The Court has specified the bodies being able of incurring liabilit y on the State.</p>
<p>* The infringement must comply with certain requirements/comply with a specified standard.</p>
<p>The Commission describes the three requirements which the Court expressly states to be necessary and sufficient in order to give rise to a right to compensation.</p>
<p>* The Community law infringed must have been intended to confer rights on individuals.</p>
<p>* The breach of the rule of law must be sufficiently serious.</p>
<p>* There must be a direct causal link between the breach and the damage caused.</p>
<p>The Commission finds that when a national court tries a case concerning compensation for breach of EC law the question whether there exists a right to compensation or not shall be determined according to the rules of Community law, as determined by the Court of Justice. The right to compensation is consequently based directly upon Community law. When prescribing the compensation, the national court shall, however, apply national rules of procedural law and national rules on liability for damages. Thus the legal system of the Member State in question will determine the competent court, the appropriate procedural system and the method to be applied when calculating the compensation. The national legal system must however,</p>
<p>in the respects mentioned, comply with certain minimum requirements established by the Court.</p>
<p>* National law must not lay down any conditions as to procedure or facts that imply unfair treatment of the individual compared to rules of national law governing claims for compensation.</p>
<p>* National law must not be designed in a way which makes it impossible or unreasonably difficult, in practice, to obain compensation for damage.</p>
<p>Following th examination of the criteria put down by the Court of Justice the Commission deals with the question of The liability of the Member States for breaches of EC rules compared with the liability of the State and other public authorities according to Swedish law</p>
<p>(section 9). The comparison between EC law and Swedish law shows differences, but also the existence of a fundamental concensus between the two systems which in practice appears to ensure equivalent legal protection. There is, however, an apparent disparity between Community law and Swedish law with regard to the express exemption, under Chapter 3 Article 7 of the Tort Liability Act, for damages caused by the national legislature and the supreme courts. According to Community law, as put down by the Court, the liability of the Member States also includes liabilty for actions or omissions for which the legislator, courts of law and executive bodies can be held responsible.</p>
<p>The section  Is an amendment of the Tort Liability Act necessary in order to fulfill the obligations imposed upon Sweden as a member of the European Union (section 10), deals with the question if amendments of law are necessary.</p>
<p>The Commission´s view is that the existence of disparities between the two systems of liability does not necessarily entail an amendment of the Swedish Tort Liability Act. It is not possible to obtain exact equivalence between the liability of the Member States as laid down by Community law and the liability of the State and other public authorities according to Swedish law. However, such an equivalence is not necessary since the rules laid down by the Court, as to the trying of claims for compensation, imply that an individual may be ensured his right to compensation despite the lack of perfect conformity between Swedish law and the rules laid down by Community law.</p>
<p>The Commission does not propose any amendment of the provision laid down in Chapter 3 Article 2 of the Tort Liability Act. Concidering the general disparities between the two legal systems and the uncertainty still existing as to the exact implications of the Community</p>
<p>rules on Member State liability the Commision does not consider it meaningful to try to achieve a greater conformity.</p>
<p>When making a general appraisal the Commission finds it most consistent and appropriate to suggest a repeal of the rule laid down in Chapter 3 Article 7 fo the Tort Liability Act. The conclusive reason for adopting this solution is that the actual discrimination between different categories of claimants will thus be set aside. Since the adhesion of Sweden to the European Union the provisions of Chapter 3 Article 7 of the Tort Liability Act entail that a victim of the legislator´s mistake or malapplication of law is treated differently depending on whether it is a matter of infringement of Community law or of national law.</p>
<p>The Commission also proposes amendments of Chapter 3 Article 10 of the Tort Liability Act and of the Regulation (1995:1301) concerning the handling of claims for compensation of damages raised agaínst the State, in order to establish that these provisions also apply to actions for compensation due to infringements of EC law.</p>
<p>Finally the matter of Financial consequences  (section 11) is discussed. The Commission notes that the commitment to pay damages and to ensure a fair trying of claims for compensation, in regard to the principle of legal security, is in consistency with Sweden´s membership of the European Union and that this commitment cannot be altered nor influenced by unilateral Swedish measures. By ensuring the correct implementation and application of Community law it is, however, possible to avoid infringements which could give rise to liability for damages.</p>
