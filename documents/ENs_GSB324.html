<p>Introduction</p>
<p>In accordance with its terms of reference the Commission on Overseas Allowances presents a comprehensive review of the conditions of employment, pay and allowance arrangements as well as tax rules that are applicable to employees in the Swedish Foreign Service and the development cooperation activities for which the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) is responsible, as well as some attachés, who are posted abroad.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The conditions of employment for employees in the Swedish Foreign Service and Sida’s development cooperation activities and attachés who are posted abroad are the subject of a separate collective bargaining agreement (U-ALFA). The allowances that are payable under this agreement are tax-exempt. In 2002, another collective bargaining agreement (URA) was concluded for all other government employees who are posted abroad. At the same time as this agreement entered into force, new rules relating to taxation of allowances payable to government employees serving abroad were introduced. Under these rules, allowances relating to expenses for housing, certain kinds of travel and school fees, as well as basic and accompanying person allowances, are exempt from tax. The new rules are not, however, applicable to employees who are covered by the U-ALFA Agreement. In Bill 2001/02:18 the Government declared that the most rational approach when introducing new rules in this area would be to make the same rules applicable to all government employees serving abroad. The Government stated that this matter called for further analysis and that it intended without delay to study the conditions of employment and pay and allowance arrangements for the staff categories that are currently covered by the U-ALFA Agreement.</p>
<p>The assignment</p>
<p>The Commission was assigned the following tasks:</p>
<p>• to carry out a comprehensive review of the conditions of employment, pay and allowance arrangements and tax rules that are applicable to employees in the Swedish Foreign Service and Sida’s development cooperation activities, as well as some attachés, who are posted abroad.</p>
<p>• to review the special tax rules that apply to these staff categories and – to the extent that special rules are still necessary – to propose rules that define more precisely which allowances and benefits are  tax-exempt and set cash limits on the amounts that are tax-exempt; and</p>
<p>• to examine the possibility of coordinating the rules relating to the calculation of overseas allowances and of standard amounts for cost of living increases, for example in connection with official travel abroad.</p>
<p>Focus of the Commission’s work</p>
<p>The Commission has concentrated on proposing uniform rules on the taxation of allowances that are payable to all government employees who are posted abroad. This should, in the Commission’s view, make it possible for the parties to adopt a single agreement on conditions for overseas service for government employees. In certain cases the Commission has submitted recommendations to the parties concerning the content of such an agreement. The Commission has not considered it necessary to propose any changes in the present mix of statutory and contractual provisions in this area.</p>
<p>Comments and recommendations</p>
<p>General observations and assumptions</p>
<p>The staff assigned to represent Sweden abroad in future should continue to be as well-qualified as the representatives of comparable countries. A new package of conditions for overseas service that are applicable to all government employees should be prepared with reference to the specific demands made on the relevant staff</p>
<p>categories in the Swedish Foreign Service and development cooperation activities. These consist in the strain and higher additional expenses experienced by overseas staff, and their families, in connection with repeated postings abroad, which normally last for several years. The additional expenses and inconvenience are not as great in the case of staff who are only occasionally posted abroad.</p>
<p>The conditions for overseas service must in future allow for a higher salary component in the overall compensation payable to overseas staff. This is important in view of the fact that the new pension system is based on the principle of lifelong earnings and that, under the government sector collective agreement on pensions, contributions and benefits are linked to pay.</p>
<p>It can no longer be taken for granted that overseas staff will be accompanied by their spouses or partners. An overseas posting may well be detrimental to the spouse’s/partner’s career and involve loss of income, as well as loss of pensionable income. To make it possible in future to recruit overseas staff who have families and children it will be necessary to provide basic protection for accompanying family members that makes up for this to some extent.</p>
<p>There is a need for more individual solutions than is the case today. This will require a transition to a contract model under which the employer and the employee agree on terms and conditions for each posting as regards pay etc. and in which the allowances payable to the posted employee him-/herself and to accompanying family members should be specified in detail.</p>
<p>Taxation</p>
<p>The rules concerning tax exemption for allowances payable to Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Sida employees who are posted abroad have been discussed on several occasions in the last few years. It is now time to bring these discussions to an end by adopting rules relating to taxation and tax exemption that are consistent with the general principles on which the Swedish tax system is based. In the Commission’s view, the foreign service and Sida need rules on the taxation of overseas allowances that are not continually questioned.</p>
<p>The tax-exempt components of the package of conditions for overseas service should compensate overseas staff for additional expenses incurred as a result of working and living abroad. However, the Commission considers it necessary, when assessing the tax aspects, to accept that compensation will have to be fixed without taking into account each individual’s consumption patterns. The conditions for overseas service must ensure reasonable compensation for normal additional expenses incurred in connection with an overseas posting. Stipulating in detail how this money is to be used is neither possible nor desirable.</p>
<p>To some extent, therefore, the system must be based on flat-rate payments. A system whereby every additional expense item paid for by overseas staff is reimbursed against receipt or paid by the diplomatic mission itself would involve too much administrative work. Nevertheless, direct payment by the employer of items that are currently included in flat-rate overseas allowances may be advisable in certain cases.</p>
<p>Elements of a new package of conditions for overseas service</p>
<p>It may be appropriate at this juncture to list the allowances and benefits that according to the Commission’s recommendations should be included in a new package of conditions for overseas service. What allowances over and above their home salary are paid to overseas staff?</p>
<p>Taxable allowances and benefits:</p>
<p>• Special service allowances, where applicable</p>
<p>• Hardship allowances (in hardship posts)</p>
<p>• Family allowances (in exceptional cases).</p>
<p>Tax-exempt allowances and benefits:</p>
<p>• Reimbursement of removal expenses</p>
<p>• Free housing of a good general standard</p>
<p>• Rather generous travel concessions paid by the employer</p>
<p>• Additional expense allowances payable in cash to cover the increased cost of living at the post of assignment</p>
<p>• Comprehensive personal injury insurance for all family members, paid by the employer</p>
<p>• An accompanying person allowance payable in cash, where the accompanying person has little or no income at the current post</p>
<p>• Pension compensation to the accompanying person, where the accompanying person has little or no income at the current post</p>
<p>• Reimbursement of day nursery, primary/secondary or upper secondary school fees – where such fees are higher than those in Sweden.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the proposed conditions for overseas service provide adequate compensation for the increased cost of working and living abroad. It is quite clear, even without specifying compensation and allowance levels, that the employer’s costs for overseas staff and their families are substantial.</p>
<p>It should perhaps be mentioned that the recommended changes in conditions for overseas service will affect the salaries and allowances of individual employees. In some cases levels will be lower, while they will rise in others. One important aspect of our proposals is the focus on improved cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>The Commission’s recommendations concerning conditions for overseas service</p>
<p>The basic allowance</p>
<p>The basic allowance is extremely complex and difficult to calculate. It is virtually impossible to say to what extent the compensation amounts correspond to actual expenses. It must, however, be said that simple solutions cannot always be found for complex issues such as those addressed by the basic allowance. It is, however, possible to simplify the concept of additional expense allowances and to make the compensation approach easier to understand.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s opinion, the basic allowance should be taxexempt. Some changes will have to be made in order to determine the scope of tax exemption. It is not, however, either appropriate or feasible to quantify the various components of the basic allowance in the legislative text. That would in certain cases mean specifying more than 100 amounts. The Commission has indicated the extent to which tax exemption can be retained by means of recommendations to the parties, for example that an item can continue to be tax-exempt if it does not exceed the present amount specified in additional expense category 4. Application by the</p>
<p>employers of the rules defining the extent of tax exemption that are recommended by the Commission will reduce the differences in compensation levels between different groups of overseas staff. The Commission considers this a beneficial effect in this context.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view,  the system of additional expense categories should be revised. The six categories should be reduced to four:</p>
<p>The Commission does not propose any alterations with regard to the items food  and transport  in the basic allowance. They should continue to be tax-exempt elements of the basic allowance.</p>
<p>We propose that the item domestic help  be abolished. Consequently, the draft Act does not contain any exemption from taxation for this item. However, a tax-exempt element for additional expenses for domestic help – but only in certain postings and with regard to certain staff categories – should be included under the heading Special additional expenses in the basic allowance. It will be up to the employer (in connection with the collective bargaining process) to ascertain which postings are really in need of domestic help and how great the need is. Otherwise, domestic help should only be provided at counsellor level. The staff categories that are currently entitled to domestic help allocated directly by the Ministry (Heads of mission etc.) should continue to be so entitled in future.</p>
<p>As regards special additional expenses  included in the present basic allowance, the following ceilings should be placed on the constituent components:</p>
<p>• Distance from Sweden: three levels, i.e. SEK 500, SEK 1,000 and SEK 1,500 per month.</p>
<p>• Service: the maximum amounts should be the levels set for the present additional expense category 4.</p>
<p>• Clothing: should for tax purposes be treated as pay and excluded from the basic allowance.</p>
<p>• Equipment: the maximum amounts should be the levels set for the present additional expense category 4.</p>
<p>• Miscellaneous: the maximum amounts should be 15 % of the items  food  and transport  at each post.</p>
<p>The average tax exemption ceilings on basic allowances – per month</p>
<p>– for the various current  additional expense categories can be estimated at approximately SEK 200 in category 1, SEK 2,100 in category 2, SEK 1,900 in category 3, SEK 1,800 in category 4, SEK 5,600 in category 5 and SEK 7,100 in category 6 (i.e. at Heads of mission level).</p>
<p>Accompanying persons/spouses</p>
<p>With a view to meeting future staffing needs, the conditions for overseas service should include compensation for accompanying spouses in the form of basic protection. This protection is appropriate in view of all the additional expenses that can occur where accompanying persons are involved.</p>
<p>Basic protection should be paid to accompanying spouses who have little or no income at the current post regardless of their income in Sweden prior to their departure. This protection should not be regarded as unemployment benefit or social assistance.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that accompanying spouses allowances should be the same for all accompanying persons, regardless of the additional expense category to which the employee is assigned. In the Commission’s view, it is reasonable to adjust the allowance to the cost of living level at the post in question.</p>
<p>In view of the need to keep additional expenses under control there is, in the Commission’s opinion, limited scope for exempting accompanying person allowances from tax. Apart from this, the Income Tax Act contains provisions restricting the extent of tax exemption for overseas staff who are covered by an URA Agreement.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the maximum tax-exempt component of accompanying person allowances for spouses or partners should correspond to 1/6 of a price base amount for each month spent abroad (SEK 6,550 in 2004 prices). Any higher amounts that are paid out by the employer should be treated as pay.</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that the employer concerned expand the pension solution provided by the present system, which has been presented to Parliament. However, an exemption rule should be introduced, since otherwise the premiums would constitute a taxable allowance for the posted employee. The maximum tax exempt amount should be 1/12 of a price base amount for each month spent abroad, which is the equivalent of SEK 3,275 in 2004 prices.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the period during which previous gainful employment qualifies unemployed persons for payment of unemployment benefit should be increased from 7 years, as is the case at present, to 12 years for persons accompanying government employees posted abroad. Accompanying persons should enjoy protection of their entitlement to sickness benefit, which means that the rate of sickness benefit to which they were entitled prior to their departure from Sweden should be the same after their return.</p>
<p>Hardship allowances</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, a hardship allowance should primarily be regarded as flat-rate compensation for various kinds of inconvenience and only to a lesser extent as reimbursement of actual additional expenses. There is thus not sufficient justification for a flat-rate tax-exempt allowance. This view is confirmed by the fact that hardship allowances are not tax-exempt under the tax rules that apply to the URA Agreement.</p>
<p>The Commission is in favour of hardship allowances, but considers that they should be taxable. With a view to meeting future staffing needs it is appropriate to pay hardship allowances in the form of salary supplements. Such supplements should confer pension entitlement. Furthermore, taxing the allowance as a whole would simplify administration and make the future conditions for overseas service more transparent.</p>
<p>Child benefits</p>
<p>Offering overseas staff the same conditions as in Sweden when it comes to their children’s schooling and pre-school and childcare facilities is an essential feature of the overseas service conditions. As regards school expenses – school fees etc. – this principle has been in force for a long time. It should, in the Commission’s opinion, also apply to pre-school fees etc. in overseas postings. This issue is also about providing a secure upbringing for the children.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, overseas staff should be entitled to an allowance for pre-school fees for their children at the post of assignment from the age of 4 where this is necessary to ensure that their childcare expenses are not higher than in Sweden.</p>
<p>Overseas staff should also be entitled to an allowance for childcare fees for small children aged 1–4 in facilities corresponding to Swedish family day nurseries/open pre-schools, after-school care centres or other such facilities that exist at the post.</p>
<p>Such fees should – to the extent that they exceed normal fees in Sweden – be paid directly by the employer. These fees should be tax-exempt for overseas staff.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s opinion, the arguments for tax-exempt, flat-rate child allowances whose purpose is to pay for various additional expenses for children – apart from pre-school and school fees – are untenable from a tax point of view since expenses for children are by definition living costs. Since families stationed abroad continue to receive Swedish child benefit, the additional expense of a cash child allowance is not justified.</p>
<p>Overseas staff who are covered by an URA Agreement do not receive tax-exempt child allowances.</p>
<p>The Commission has not found sufficiently good reasons for proposing that child allowances should be tax-exempt, either wholly or in part. This means that child allowances paid out under the UALFA Agreement will be taxable.</p>
<p>The Commission’s position fully recognizes the marginal additional expense principle and promotes the transparency of the conditions for overseas service.</p>
<p>Housing benefits</p>
<p>Obviously, residential accommodation must be provided for overseas staff and their families if they are to consider an overseas posting.</p>
<p>With special reference to accompanying persons, the Commission regards the provision of free housing in future conditions for overseas service as a significant factor when it comes to meeting staffing needs, both today and in the future. This is a core benefit for overseas staff and their families, and the state’s ability to offer them good-quality housing at their posts facilitates recruitment to overseas service.</p>
<p>The housing benefits and housing cost allowances that are payable under the U-ALFA and URA Agreements are tax-exempt.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that housing cost allowances or free housing at the current post that are provided by a government agency for posted employees should continue to be tax-exempt.</p>
<p>It is important that the employer’s costs for accommodation at the posts are kept at a reasonable level. This could be done by improving budget management and continuously adjusting housing standards to actual operational needs and economic realities.</p>
<p>Travel concessions</p>
<p>The travel paid for by the employer is very important to enable overseas staff to keep in touch with their home country and to keep families together.</p>
<p>In the future, when more families will probably be two-career families than is the case today, generous travel concessions will play an important part in employees’ decisions whether or not to accept overseas postings. In the Commission’s view, this is likely to lead to more commuting and/or telework in connection with postings abroad.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that concessions in the form of free travel offered by a government employer to posted employees or members of their families should be tax-exempt where such travel is related to postings abroad.</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that the parties reduce the qualification period for single employee travel from 18 to 12 months.</p>
<p>Removal expenses</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that removal allowances granted to employees of government agencies in connection with transfers to, from or between overseas posts should be tax-exempt where the allowance does not exceed a total amount corresponding to 0.75 of a price base amount (SEK 39,300 [2004]) in respect of the transferred employee plus 0.25 of a price base amount for an accompanying spouse or partner plus 0.10 of a price base amount for each accompanying child.</p>
<p>Removal allowances also cover initial additional expenses for purchases of equipment and clothing that are suitable for localities with a different climate.</p>
<p>Other matters</p>
<p>Coordination of standard amounts and basic allowances</p>
<p>In the Commission’s opinion, the additional expenses covered by standard amounts/subsistence allowances and those covered by basic allowances are so different that it is impossible to find a simple formula for coordinating their calculation. The Commission cannot see any gains in cost-effectiveness or any other practical advantage in trying to coordinate the calculation of standard amounts and basic allowances. Besides, there is no objective reason why the National Tax Board should fix standard amounts or other cash limits for basic allowances.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Commission has not presented any proposals as to coordination of these amounts and allowances.</p>
<p>Reviews etc.</p>
<p>The Government annually reviews government employer policy and presents its conclusions to Parliament. This exercise gives the Government the opportunity to study the formulation and application of collective bargaining agreements and examine the employer policies that are developed. The Commission does not consider that implementation of its proposals would call for any further review and evaluation efforts. If a more comprehensive</p>
<p>evaluation is considered necessary in addition to the Government’s review, it could be carried out by the existing bodies.</p>
<p>In connection with the annual review of the conditions for overseas service the Government Offices naturally examine the possibility of establishing a common regulatory framework and common policies for all the relevant staff categories in the Government Offices. Attention should also be paid to the possibility of administrative simplification.</p>
<p>The Swedish Board for Overseas Allowances</p>
<p>The Swedish Board for Overseas Allowances is an employer’s organization consisting of representatives of the employers and the employees. It is one of the last remaining agencies of this kind.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the Board should cease its activities at the end of 2004.</p>
<p>Insurance cover for overseas staff and their families</p>
<p>In its terms of reference the Commission was instructed to propose any amendments to the Compensation for Sickness or Injury Ordinance (1986:259) that it might consider necessary.</p>
<p>The Ordinance is obsolete and should be repealed.</p>
<p>Insurance cover is inadequate in certain respects in the case of overseas staff who are covered by the U-ALFA Agreement and in connection with official travel abroad. The Commission recommends adopting a more comprehensive version of the insurance scheme provided under the URA Agreement. The Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency should be instructed to design a comprehensive insurance solution for government employees.</p>
<p>Entry into force, implementation and cost</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the new tax rules enter into force on January 1 2006. They should be applied for the first time in connection with the 2007 tax assessment. Since previous provisions will in certain cases be applied in connection with the 2008 tax assessment, government employees who are posted before January 1 2006 will have ample time for reflection and opportunities for</p>
<p>adjusting their consumption patterns to the compensation levels and tax rules that will subsequently apply.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, this time frame would give the parties sufficient time to conduct negotiations on a new collective bargaining agreement. Negotiations could start after a bill is presented, possibly in the autumn of 2004.</p>
<p>As regards the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Sida, the cost of employer’s contributions will, according to one estimate, increase by SEK 30 million per year unless the U-ALFA Agreement is revised. This provides an incentive for the employers concerned to review the Agreement.</p>
<p>The costs for the improvements proposed by the Commission will be around SEK 12 million per year, based on current staff volumes.</p>
<p>Both the employers and the trade unions would be well-advised to calculate the effects of the tax rules and consider various alternative solutions regarding matters that are the subject of collective bargaining. As always, costs will determine how much can be achieved.</p>
