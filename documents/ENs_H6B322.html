<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Inquiry on the reception and housing of applicants for asylum and newly arrived immigrants was tasked by the Government with proposing a cohesive system for the reception of applicants for asylum and newly arrived immigrants. In this report, the Inquiry outlines a main proposal in which central government, the municipalities and the county councils take joint responsibility for reception. The Inquiry recommends adopting this proposal.</p>
<p>We also outline an alternative in which primarily central government takes full responsibility for reception.</p>
<h2>Reforms needed</h2>
<p>The Government’s terms of reference and the Inquiry’s analysis both show that the reception system needs reforming. One key starting point was to remedy the lack of a holistic perspective in the reception system. The lack of a holistic and systematic approach means long waiting times, delayed establishment or return, and high costs for society and individuals.</p>
<p>A serious shortcoming in the existing reception system is that measures are planned and located on the basis of where there is available housing. Because other aspects, such as the prospects of establishment or a more even reception between the country’s municipalities, are not considered, the existing system cannot fulfil this task in a long-term and sustainable manner.</p>
<p>Particularly serious is the fact that a limited number of municipalities have had to take a disproportionately high level of responsibility, resulting in considerable pressure on welfare services and local communities.</p>
<p>The high incidence of asylum seekers arranging their own accommodation aggravates the uneven distribution between municipalities and often contributes to a socially undesirable situation. However, asylum seekers arranging their own accommodation can also have positive effects.</p>
<p>The system of compensation to municipalities and county councils is inefficient and administratively burdensome. The municipal sector is currently forced to wait much too long for compensation from central government.</p>
<h2>An orderly system</h2>
<p>In light of the abovementioned problems, we propose a cohesive reception system based on the following standpoints: – Concentrate resources early in the process.  The Inquiry’s proposal is based on the use of resources early in the reception process so that individuals end up in the right place from the outset, by having a coherent first encounter with Sweden at an obligatory arrival centre. – Shorten waiting times and use the waiting time actively.  A stay at an arrival centre provides the opportunity for a legally secure and rapid examination in which the asylum seeker and government agencies are accessible to each other. The time should be used actively for obligatory surveying of asylum seekers’ skills and provision of information on Swedish society, as well as a health examination. – Establishment or return in focus from the outset.  The waiting time that accrues after leaving the arrival centre should be used for continued information on society, surveying, teaching in Swedish or measures to prepare for efficient returns. From the outset, the focus should be on the individual’s establishment in Sweden or on their return to another country. – Reduce the need for arranging one’s own accommodation.  The proposals involve asylum seekers arranging their own accommodation in an orderly manner. This involves offering an orderly reception system as an alternative, and limiting the possibilities for asylum seekers to arrange their own accommodation by conducting a social examination. – Make use of the capacity and expertise of all of Sweden.  The main proposal entails central government, the municipalities and the county councils jointly organising reception on the basis of a clear division of responsibility and orderly financing. This means making use of the total capacity and expertise in the 290 municipalities and 20 county councils, as well as of central government, in this complex social mission.</p>
<h2>A coherent first encounter with Sweden</h2>
<p>Getting it right from the outset and concentrating resources and measures early on in the asylum process to prevent asylum seekers becoming passive during the long wait are the ideas that guide the reception system in other comparable countries. A quick and efficient start to an asylum seeker’s stay in Sweden provides substantial benefits for both government agencies and individuals.</p>
<p>The Reception Inquiry therefore proposes that central government set up arrival centres for all asylum seekers. These centres will enable a swift examination according to the rule of law, clearer governance and a more orderly reception system. It will be obligatory for all asylum seekers to live in these centres and take part in the activities there. It will only be possible to submit an application for asylum at an arrival centre or at the border.</p>
<p>The arrival centres will function as a ‘one stop shop’ where asylum seekers are available for the government agencies and where they can quickly come into contact with the relevant actors. The time spent at the arrival centre should be used efficiently. The focus will be on immediately getting started with the examination and conducting the measures that require personal involvement.</p>
<p>Asylum seekers will receive basic information about Swedish society. An initial survey of asylum seekers’ professional and educational backgrounds will be conducted, and a health examination will be offered.</p>
<p>During their time at the arrival centre, asylum seekers will also be allocated future accommodation in order to stake out a clear path for their continued stay in Sweden.</p>
<h2>Arrival centres in the right places and with the right conditions</h2>
<p>The state arrival centres we are proposing would be an important investment for a long-term, sustainable reception system. It is therefore crucial that they be designed and placed so that they can be run efficiently.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the centres should be large facilities where all relevant actors are represented with the right staffing levels, expertise and presence.</p>
<p>The municipalities in which the centres are located must have the right conditions for this. They should be large municipalities that are suited in various regards to having the centres placed there, such as proximity to an international airport. The establishment of arrival centres must take place in dialogue with the municipality concerned.</p>
<p>The arrival centres should be acquired on long-term contracts for the sake of cost-effectiveness and continuity.</p>
<h2>Waiting in the municipality – being placed correctly from the outset</h2>
<p>All municipalities must share the responsibility for offering certain asylum seekers accommodation and early measures following their initial stay at an arrival centre. This will provide good conditions for an active and meaningful period of waiting for a decision.</p>
<p>The principles of the Act on reception for settlement of certain newly arrived immigrants (the Reception for Settlement Act) will therefore apply from the outset for many asylum seekers. This will strengthen the link between the time spent as an asylum seeker and the time spent as a newly arrived immigrant. It will also enable preparations to be made for early establishment following arrival and contribute to a holistic approach to the individual’s initial period spent in Sweden.</p>
<p>The proposal places a clear focus on the conditions for establishment at the time of settlement. It will allow municipalities to plan better and distribute the responsibility more evenly between municipalities. The proposal will mean many asylum seekers having better options for organising their own accommodation and more being offered an orderly reception system. When the whole country’s capacity is used, it is also easier to cope with fluctuations in the number of asylum seekers.</p>
<p>The reception of asylum seekers is not hugely different from the provision of welfare in general. It is very much the municipal sector that has the expertise and capacity required for this. Normalisation is efficient when central government uses an available resource and compensates the municipal sector for its measures, instead of building up parallel state structures.</p>
<p>The housing situation is acute almost everywhere in Sweden. However, the results of the Reception for Settlement Act show that the majority of municipalities are able to organise accommodation for newly arrived immigrants. We also consider that the municipalities are better placed to identify and use available housing than would be the case if a centralised procurement process were used that did not make use of local knowledge. The proposal also gives the municipalities important influence over the planning of accommodation as opposed to when central government makes decisions on local use. The Swedish Migration Agency will also return the apartments it has rented in several municipalities so that they can be used in municipal housing planning.</p>
<p>In addition, the county administrative boards will be responsible for supporting municipalities in the acquisition of housing and access to development funding to stimulate new solutions in this area.</p>
<p>However, not all asylum seekers will spend their waiting period under municipal supervision. People considered to have little chance of being granted a residence permit or whose case is being processed under the Dublin Regulation will remain in state arrival or departure centres.</p>
<h2>Local involvement in early measures</h2>
<p>The Inquiry considers that it is essential that the reception system gives asylum seekers the right conditions to prepare for their establishment in Sweden or for their return to another country. Passivity and poor use of waiting times must be avoided.</p>
<p>One of the most important things to start with is to provide clear information about society, giving asylum seekers knowledge about the country they are in, what is expected of them and what they themselves can expect from their stay in Sweden.</p>
<p>Language training is also essential, as is knowledge about the Swedish labour market, its rules and the way it functions.</p>
<p>Giving the municipalities the main responsibility for early measures for asylum seekers with good chances of staying means that there is a local involvement in these measures, which strengthens the conditions for establishment.</p>
<p>Measures provided are to be stepped up over time. The longer a person waits, the more extensive the content.</p>
<h2>Efficient returns</h2>
<p>To maintain a long-term and humane migration policy that protects the right to asylum, it is essential that returns of people who have been issued with a removal order can be enforced quickly.</p>
<p>On the whole, return issues have not been in focus in the reception system. The Inquiry therefore considers that measures in this area should be developed.</p>
<p>The greater clarity offered by our proposals would provide better conditions for preparing efficient returns. Early and clear signals about what is reasonable to expect from the asylum process and measures focusing on returns are crucial if the returns system is to function.</p>
<p>The Reception Inquiry also proposes that it should be obligatory for people issued with enforceable refusal-of-entry or expulsion orders, as well as people issued with a transfer order under the Dublin Regulation, to live in a departure centre.</p>
<h2>Restrictions on people arranging their own accommodation</h2>
<p>Sweden allows asylum seekers to organise their own accommodation to an extent that is unique among comparable countries. In the right circumstances, this can be positive. However, in some municipalities, this solution has led to considerable social problems for individuals and local communities.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposal on a clearly identified path for asylum seekers will mean that they are able to a lesser extent to arrange their own accommodation when the social conditions are poor. Despite this, the proposals will be supplemented with clear limitations on the possibility of people arranging their own accommodation.</p>
<p>The point of departure for the Inquiry’s proposals is that an inspection of the accommodation must ensure that it is socially sustainable. Inspections will only take place in municipalities with socio-economically disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Following an application from an asylum seeker, the Swedish Migration Agency will inspect the housing on the basis of criteria such as size, number of residents and whether it is located in a socio-economically disadvantaged residential area.</p>
<p>Asylum seekers who choose to live in their own accommodation that has not been approved will lose the right to a daily allowance and a special allowance. Moreover, asylum seekers who are unable to support themselves must move to public sector accommodation. Asylum seekers are therefore not entitled to having their accommodation arranged by the municipality in which they are located.</p>
<h2>Initial reception of unaccompanied minors</h2>
<p>The Reception Inquiry proposes the introduction of a new form of preparedness compensation for municipalities that receive unaccompanied minors. Central government will compensate municipalities for their preparedness to handle a rapid increase in the number of unaccompanied minors.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that the Swedish Migration Agency should be able to determine where minors are sent. This is to enable the municipalities in a county to share the responsibility for the initial reception in situations where large numbers of unaccompanied minors arrive.</p>
<h2>More efficient compensation for the municipal sector</h2>
<p>Trust-based collaboration between central government and the municipal sector is crucial if the reception system is to work. The Inquiry’s proposal for a new compensation system is therefore characterised by the ideas that clarity promotes trust and that tax revenue is used effectively.</p>
<p>The proposal entails moving from a focus on details to a focus on the essentials. Compensation must be predictable and disbursed quickly, with just the necessary processing. The proposal therefore also entails lower administrative costs.</p>
<p>Our proposal is based almost exclusively on standard compensation that is paid without the need to apply. The municipalities are to be compensated for their new tasks through standard compensation for housing asylum seekers, early measures for asylum seekers and measures for children in arrival centres. Compensation for asylum-seeking children in preschool and school will be paid without the need to apply. Central government will compensate municipalities for the initial costs of receiving newly arrived immigrants, including income support during the first two years, through standard compensation. Compensation to county councils for health examinations will be paid without the need to apply. The basic level of compensation and certain exceptions for high costs linked to individual cases will be kept.</p>
<p>Systematic follow-up of costs and built-in incentives to promote the achievement of targets will also be included in the new compensation system.</p>
<h2>Differences in an alternative system</h2>
<p>Shared responsibility requires trust. During the course of the In- quiry’s work, we have seen good examples of trusting cooperation between central government agencies and municipalities. We have also seen examples to the contrary.</p>
<p>Lack of trustful co-operation between the state, the municipalities and the county councils could make it difficult to implement The Inquiry’s main proposal. The Inquiry therefore also presents an alternative way to arrange the reception of asylum seekers and newly arrived immigrants in order to give the state a way to act if it will</p>
<p>not be possible to reach an agreement with the municipalities on implementing the main proposal.</p>
<p>The main proposal is largely the same as the alternative system. The proposal on arrival centres and concentrated measures early in the reception process are the same. The restrictions on allowing asylum seekers to organise their own accommodation are also the same. The starting point concerning standard compensation to the municipal sector remains, although there would be fewer tasks for which the municipalities would receive compensation.</p>
<p>There would be three most obvious differences. Firstly, central government would take responsibility itself for accommodation and early measures for all asylum seekers during the asylum process.</p>
<p>Secondly, the alternative system is more focused on the needs of the examination process.</p>
<p>And thirdly, the alternative system would entail considerably more solutions concentrated in geographical areas than when all munici- palities share the task of organising accommodation and early mea- sures.</p>
<p>However, the alternative system cannot be seen as a fully central government track in which central government solves everything itself. In the Inquiry’s view, it would be inefficient to build up parallel state functions for schooling, medical care and social ser- vices, for example. Expertise in these areas is in the municipal sector. This expertise should be used in the alternative system too, and central government would then compensate municipalities and county councils for their measures through a reformed compensation system.</p>
