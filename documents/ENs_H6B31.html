<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The overarching aim of this Inquiry has been to analyse and assess whether the current regulatory framework – in light of the major changes in the advertising landscape in recent years – provides adequate and appropriate protection for customers.</p>
<p>Our remit has comprised different parts. One part has involved surveying and describing marketing channels and methods. This survey has then served as a basis for analysing and assessing the extent to which these channels and methods are problematic from both a consumer perspective and a gender equality perspective, with particular focus on vulnerable consumers. Based on the problems we identified in the survey, we have then analysed and assessed whether the current regulatory framework offers adequate and appropriate protection for consumers.</p>
<p>Another part of our remit has involved analysing and assessing which particular challenges the supervisory authority is facing in the prevailing circumstances, to assess whether the Swedish Consumer Agency and the Consumer Ombudsman have the investigative and supervisory powers and opportunities to impose charges required for active and efficient supervision.</p>
<p>The remit did not include presenting concrete legislative proposals. However, in accordance with our terms of reference, taking into account the EU perspective, we have discussed possible needs for legislative amendments.</p>
<h2>Carrying out the survey</h2>
<p>The survey was conducted in different phases. A knowledge inventory of the areas we are tasked with identifying was initially carried out in the start-up phase. We then produced a structure for identifying marketing channels and methods in consultation with our advisers and experts. This structure and the committee terms of reference have since served as a basis for work going forward.</p>
<p>In the subsequent data collection phase, extensive material has been collected and analysed. Data has also been collected in connection with meetings initiated externally with government agencies and organisations in the area.</p>
<p>The compilation phase has been ongoing and here, the material has been processed and compiled. The compilation, which has been subject to dialogue within the Inquiry, has subsequently been the basis for the final analysis phase of the survey.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s starting points</h2>
<p>In light of our survey, the Inquiry assesses that it is mainly the digital marketing channels that stand out as being problematic from a consumer perspective. There are methods that are particularly problematic from this perspective and that exist in both traditional and digital channels. However, the difficulties that exist from a consumer perspective – even with regard to such methods – are mainly linked to the use of marketing in digital channels.</p>
<p>The problems we have identified are generally not because of shortcomings in the regulations – either in the Marketing Practices Act or in the underlying EU directive. Nor should marketing on the internet be subject to special rules, as we consider this would mean taking a step backwards. The Inquiry considers that regulations should continue to be technology-neutral, i.e. should not distinguish between online and offline environments.</p>
<p>Instead, work should continue also in the future on education and training, counselling and clear guidelines to increase awareness of established law. It is also important that active and efficient supervision is carried out.</p>
<p>We have particularly highlighted personalised advertising and disguised advertising as core issues for the Inquiry, as we consider that many of the problems we have identified focus on these issues. However, there is a fundamental difference between these two types of advertising, namely that personalised advertising is not in itself illegal, while disguised advertising, in fact, is. This means that considerations about what is needed to remedy the problems in part have different starting points.</p>
<h2>Our proposals and assessments Information, guidelines and education</h2>
<p>In the Inquiry’s view, marketing on the internet should not be subject to special rules. Instead, the Inquiry considers that, even in the future, it is important to use education, training and counselling to spread knowledge on established law and how it is to be applied in new media. Consumer protection agencies should strive to reach a wide audience with information and education on what rules apply concerning marketing in digital channels. Guidelines on marketing on the internet should be as clear as possible. The Swedish Consumer Agency should also, in a first step, be tasked with collaborating with industry representatives. If collaboration does not work on a voluntary basis, requirements may be considered. This is to emphasise how important it is that all actors take part in this work.</p>
<h2>Personalised advertising should not be prohibited</h2>
<p>Personalised advertising is permitted. There are no specific rules that relate to the use of personalised advertising, either in the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive or in the Marketing Practices Act.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s view, completely prohibiting the use of personalised advertising is neither possible nor desirable. All the same, adequate protection of personal data in connection with data collection and use is important, although this lies outside the remit of the Inquiry.</p>
<p>In the EU’s new General Data Protection Regulation, requirements on the individual business operator in connection with data collection will be stricter. This will probably have a positive impact on problems concerning personalised advertising.</p>
<p>It is important to provide information to and educate consumers so as to strengthen their awareness of the use of personalised advertising. Consumers must also have better opportunities to control what advertising is shown to them to ensure that they benefit from personalisation. Platforms should offer functions to enable such control.</p>
<p>In our assessment, the Internet of Things can be regarded as such a similar automatic system for individual communication as regulated in Section 19 of the Marketing Practices Act. The Internet of Things should therefore be covered by the rules of the Marketing Practices Act on unsolicited advertising. Practice will show how the rules are to be applied to the Internet of Things.</p>
<h2>Problems concerning disguised advertising cannot be solved through legislative amendments</h2>
<p>Problems concerning disguised advertising cannot be solved through legislation. All marketing must be designed and presented so as to make it clear that it is a question of marketing. The regulation in the Marketing Practices Act is clear on this point and also includes the internet.</p>
<p>We believe that education and counselling for both advertisers and producers will remain important. The supervisory authority should strive to produce clear and easily applied guidelines. As part of these efforts, the Inquiry considers that the supervisory authority should exercise its right to pursue cases in court to create practice in the area.</p>
<h2>Marketing targeting vulnerable consumers</h2>
<p>Children and young people</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s opinion, the existing regulation generally provides sufficient protection even when marketing targets children and young people. However, the Inquiry proposes the introduction of a provision in the Marketing Practices Act stipulating that if marketing targets or reaches children and young people, particular consideration must be given to children’s inexperience and natural naiveté.</p>
<p>The introduction of such a provision does not actually have any new implications, but rather may be seen as codification of what already applies. However, the Inquiry considers that introducing a provision may have a clarifying function and emphasise the importance of protecting children and young people.</p>
<p>Other vulnerable consumers</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes introducing a provision in the Marketing Practices Act stipulating that if marketing targets or reaches vulnerable consumers, particular consideration must be given to such a group’s vulnerability. ‘Vulnerable consumers’ refers to a clearly identifiable group of consumers who, due to cognitive or physical disabilities, age or naiveté, are particularly sensitive to the method or the product that the method refers to. The provision involves codification of what already applies, but here too, the regulation can have a clarifying function.</p>
<h2>Regulation of intermediaries’ accountability is currently adequate</h2>
<p>Our survey has shown that many of the consumer problems we have identified are related to marketing in digital channels, which means it is important that the actors involved in marketing can be held accountable. There are different kinds of intermediaries, and in the</p>
<p>Inquiry’s opinion, it appears to be appropriate that their accountability should vary depending on the role they play and the extent of their influence on the marketing. That is, we consider that the type of assignment should affect the level of accountability of each intermediary. Attempting to regulate the meaning of such accountability appears to be very difficult and would also lead to a regulation that would be difficult to apply. Furthermore, interactive digital media are also an environment in which new actors are constantly emerging, which is another argument against excessively detailed regulation. We consider that the existing regulation concerning intermediaries’ accountability is adequate. It is our view that more detailed questions concerning how the rules are to be applied following the emergence of the new technology should be left to the authorities applying the law.</p>
<p>We also consider that the Swedish Consumer Agency should produce guidelines concerning its position on intermediaries’ accountability.</p>
<h2>The Swedish Consumer Agency should have the possibility to make purchases for inspection under a cover identity</h2>
<p>It is difficult for the Swedish Consumer Agency to gain access to the marketing that consumers see, since it is becoming increasingly personalised. Ultimately, this means it is difficult, in principle impossible, to preserve marketing evidence. In light of this, it is important for the Swedish Consumer Agency to be able to access the same marketing that is shown to consumers. We propose that the Swedish Consumer Agency should be given the power, under another identity and without stating the intention of the purchase, to purchase a product or service for the purpose of checking compliance with marketing legislation, i.e. purchases for inspection purposes under a cover identity (also known as ‘mystery shopping’). It seems appropriate that the Government be authorised to issue regulations on how purchases that require fictitious personal data are to be managed.</p>
<p>We consider that the Swedish Consumer Agency should also have the possibility of using such fictitious personal data for registering accounts on social media and other platforms to access marketing there.</p>
<h2>The Consumer Ombudsman should be allowed to request access to information etc. under penalty of a fine</h2>
<p>The supervisory authority has the right to take certain measures in its supervisory operations. However, under established law, the supervisory authority must first request that someone submit information to then have the right to order someone to submit the information under penalty of a fine. This type of procedure is a circuitous path that unnecessarily delays inspection. In our opinion, the Consumer Ombudsman should be allowed to request information under penalty of a fine. Therefore, we propose that Section 45 of the</p>
<p>Marketing Practices Act be adjusted so that it stipulates that a request under Sections 42–44 of the Marketing Practices Act may be accompanied by a fine.</p>
<h2>The supervisory authority’s investigative powers</h2>
<p>Efficient supervision requires that the supervisory authority is allowed to request access to or in another way gain access to data needed for finding advertising that breaks the law. We consider that Section 42 of the Marketing Practices Act already currently includes a right for the supervisory authority to use the platforms to request data needed in a case. Therefore, we consider that a potential legislative amendment should not be considered until the authority attempts to access data and pursues cases for the purpose of creating legal practice.</p>
<p>In some cases secrecy rules may prevent access. The authority’s supervisory operations should not be unduly hindered by secrecy rules that apply at other authorities. Therefore, we consider that the</p>
<p>Swedish Consumer Agency’s possibilities to access documents that are subject to secrecy at other authorities in the course of its supervisory operations should be reviewed.</p>
<h2>Consumer Ombudsman may act as counsel in the Patent and Market Court</h2>
<p>Under Section 2 of the Act concerning the involvement of the Consumer Ombudsman in certain disputes (2011:1211), the Consumer Ombudsman may decide, in a dispute between a consumer and a business operator, to assist the consumer as counsel in a general court and before the Swedish Enforcement Authority. This is the case if the dispute is important for the application of the law or if there is some other general consumer interest in examining the dispute. The Patent and Market Court is not specially mentioned in the Act. The Inquiry considers that the Consumer Ombudsman should also be allowed to act as counsel in disputes in the Patent and Market Court.</p>
<h2>Attachment in cases concerning the imposition of a fine</h2>
<p>In cases concerning market disturbance fees, the Consumer Ombudsman may apply for attachment, while a corresponding possibility is lacking in cases concerning the imposition of a fine. Even in cases when fines may be imposed, such amounts may be substantial. It appears reasonable to introduce the possibility for the Consumer Ombudsman to apply for attachment in cases concerning the imposition of such fines. Introducing such a right with regard to procedural fines may also help strengthen supervision. Therefore, we propose that the Consumer Ombudsman should be allowed to apply for attachment in cases concerning the imposition of a fine under Sections 26, 28 or 45 of the Marketing Practices Act.</p>
<h2>The Swedish Consumer Agency should be allowed to publish a warning list</h2>
<p>The Swedish Consumer Agency’s remit includes ensuring that consumers have access to information and guidance on consumers’ rights and obligations and other information that makes it possible for them to make well-balanced choices if no other public authority has that task. The Swedish Consumer Agency should therefore be allowed to provide information to inform consumers by publishing a warning list. However, each warning message must be based on adequate, factual and objective circumstances.</p>
<h2>Technical solutions are needed for effective and active supervision</h2>
<p>Today’s advertising landscape requires new forms of technical solutions to ensure that the Swedish Consumer Agency can continue to exercise active and effective supervision. It is the Inquiry’s assessment that increased allocations are needed for the Agency to be able to live up to the new requirements. It is matter of finding and procuring new technical solutions, but also of broadening competencies among employees and hiring different types of competencies than has traditionally been the case.</p>
<p>In recent years, Sweden has fallen behind in consumer protection efforts, largely due to inadequate resources. According to what has emerged during the Inquiry, progress in several other EU countries is much more advanced than in Sweden. This is also an argument in favour of increased allocations to the Swedish Consumer Agency.</p>
<h2>No new sanctions are proposed</h2>
<p>We have considered two different powers for the supervisory authority: website shutdown and a trading prohibition. However, we have made the assessment that such powers should not be introduced.</p>
<h2>The market disturbance fine level should be reviewed</h2>
<p>The market disturbance fine was raised recently. Despite this, it still appears to be much too low. Therefore, in the Inquiry’s opinion, the Government should once again consider reviewing the size of the market disturbance fine.</p>
<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>Our proposals will primarily affect the Swedish Consumer Agency and the Consumer Ombudsman. We submit a number of assessments that should be regarded more as recommendations to the Agency, as draft guidelines. However, drafting guidelines such as those we propose should be regarded as already being part of the Agency’s remit, and should therefore fit within existing appropriations.</p>
<p>In general, our proposals relating to supervision should mainly affect the Swedish Consumer Agency and the Consumer Ombudsman in a positive way, since they should facilitate supervision and make it more efficient. More efficient supervision could possibly lead to an increased number of cases. However, we do not believe that the increase will be substantial. Our proposal relating to the Consumer Ombudsman acting as counsel could also lead to more cases, although here too, the increase would be marginal.</p>
<p>We have assessed that, for the Swedish Consumer Agency to be able to exercise active and effective supervision, it must have access to new forms of technical solutions and employ more staff with the skills to use and further develop such technical solutions. This requires increased appropriations to the supervisory authority, which means an increased cost for the state.</p>
<p>With regard to the proposals’ impact on the courts, in summary, it is our view that any additional cases that may result from these proposals are so few that they may be regarded as fitting within existing appropriations.</p>
<p>Our proposal to raise the requirement to take particular consideration in marketing targeting children and young people in the legislative text should be favourable to that group. Although the proposal is a codification of what already applies, we consider that the clarification will probably contribute to consideration being taken to a greater extent than at present.</p>

<p>”The marketing of [products only accessible in exchange of providing personal data]as ’free’ without telling consumers how their preferences, personal data and user-generated content are going to be used could in some circumstances be considered a misleading practice.”. Enligt vägledningen skulle det alltså under vissa omständigheter redan kunna betraktas som en vilseledande metod. Enligt kommissionen skulle, som framförs i ”fitness check” rapporten, en sådan tillämpning också bryta mot personuppgiftslagstiftningen.</p>
