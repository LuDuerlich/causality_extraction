<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The task</h2>
<p>The Swedish Energy Efficiency Inquiry's main task is to propose how European Parliament and Council Directive (2006/32/EC) of 5 April 2006 on energy end-use efficiency and energy services is to be implemented in Sweden. TPF FPT  The directive is referred to here as the</p>
<p>EC directive, the directive or the energy-efficiency directive depending on the context.</p>
<p>The investigator shall propose a national indicative energy savings target and present a proposal for the first National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP), as required under Article 14 of the EC directive. This part of the task is presented in the Inquiry's interim report (SOU 2008:25) A more energy-efficient Sweden.</p>
<p>The investigator shall draw up proposals for a suitable organisation and any necessary new statutes or statutory amendments. The investigator shall also highlight a number of specific issues relating to the EC directive's rules, e.g. the role of the public sector, the markets for energy efficiency improvement products and services, the need for accreditation and certification schemes, individual metering of heat and hot water, the wording of transmission tariffs, informative energy billing and how information to the general public on energy efficiency can be strengthened.</p>
<p>The investigator shall analyse the effects of any proposals on people's private finances and the social economy in general. The investigator is to present a final report by 30 November 2008 at the latest.</p>
<p>This report shall present the Inquiry's final considerations as regards how the EC directive should be introduced in Sweden. The proposals include draft measures and instruments that cumulatively should lead to the minimum indicative target specified under Article 4 of the EC directive being easily achieved.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The EC directive on energy end-use efficiency and energy services is an important instrument in the community's efforts to promote more efficient energy use throughout the EU. Under Article 4, the member states shall adopt a national indicative energy savings target of at least 9 percent of energy end use by 2016. The target shall be achieved using cost-effective, practicable and reasonable measures.</p>
<p>There is also a more general savings target, which EU heads of state and government supported in the spring of 2007 and which involves savings of 20 percent of primary energy TPF FPT  estimated to be used in EU countries in 2020. TPF FPT  The target of 20 percent primary energy savings is still not legally binding for Member States, however.</p>
<p>In addition to these targets at the EU level, there is also a national target, determined by the Swedish Riksdag, stating that total energy consumption per unit area heated in residential and commercial buildings shall decrease by 20 percent by 2020 and by 50 percent by 2050 in relation to energy use in 1995. TPF FPT</p>
<h2>General starting-points</h2>
<p>Energy efficiency should be seen in a system perspective according to the Inquiry. This means that primary energy efficiency should be taken into account and evaluated rather than a one-sided focus on energy end use. It is the use of primary energy that determines the consumption of the earth’s resources, and thereby the amount of emissions affecting the environment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Inquiry considers that policy measures should be designed, as far as possible, to support a system perspective. in buildings). See www.miljomal.nu/english</p>
<p>A lack of system perspective would risk ineffective solutions being prioritized over efficient ones. The Inquiry estimates that early actions and policy measures already implemented can lead to a reduction of approximately 27 TWh energy end use, corresponding to approximately 46 TWh primary energy consumption. This means that Sweden without further measures can achieve a reduced energy end use of 7.5 percent or 10.1 TWh in primary energy terms. Thereby it can be stated, in a broader interpretation of the directive, that Sweden will only just achieve the given minimum goal.</p>
<p>Achieving energy efficiency improvements that exceed the minimum target and that take us more towards the 20-percent primary energy savings target requires new and more powerful instruments than those employed up until now. A general startingpoint for the inquiry has been to present a package of reasonable measures designed to help us progress towards the target of 20 percent primary energy savings.</p>
<p>A fundamental starting-point for the inquiry has been to ensure that energy efficiency improvements are profitable both for society and for individual actors such as households, enterprises, etc. Certain guiding principles have been applied for quite some time in Sweden when choosing and designing instruments and when formulating energy efficiency targets. These mean that in principle no quantified energy consumption targets should be specified, since such targets require a holistic approach, which can never be achieved in practice. The risk for suboptimisation then becomes considerable. Instruments should be general, such as energy taxes, and not tied to specific technologies. Support to efficient markets, or to measures that are already profitable in themselves, shall be avoided. Prices shall provide correct (or desired) information and search costs should be reduced by removing barriers. TPF FPT</p>
<p>The inquiry believes that these fundamental principles are to a large extent still relevant. It can be ascertained, however, that a great deal has happened recently that affects the wording of targets and design of policy instruments for a more energyefficient Sweden. As has been mentioned earlier, several different quantitative energy efficiency targets have now emerged with fixed time frames. It can also be established that the energy efficiency gap, i.e. the difference between the sum of energy efficiency improvement measures, in e.g. buildings, that are profitable to implement and the profitable measures that are actually implemented is considerable. On average only 15 percent of the measures that are profitable for property owners are implemented. This situation is similar in industrial and transport sectors. This is new knowledge. Not until now has the energy efficiency gap been possible to verify and quantify empirically. This finding is supported e.g. by a quantitative analysis of measures proposed in conjunction with energy certificates for buildings.</p>
<p>In light of this, and considering the potential for profitable energy efficiency improvements, the following indicative principles should mainly apply to the inquiry's considerations and proposals:</p>
<p>• Future and higher energy efficiency targets than those that apply under the EC directive should be considered.</p>
<p>• The effect of instruments and measures should be seen and evaluated in a primary energy perspective.</p>
<p>• Even efficiency measures that are pressing and profitable for private households may need economic stimulation if they are to be implemented.</p>
<p>• Energy efficiency measures shall be socioeconomically profitable.</p>
<h2>The inquiry's proposals – The road to a more energy- efficient Sweden</h2>
<p>The housing and service sector</p>
<p>Strategic support to energy efficiency measures in buildings</p>
<p>The system is proposed to be applied to both residential and tertiary buildings. The Inquiry proposes that the existing subsidies to, inter alia conversion from direct electrical heating are retained and that several new subsidies are introduced for other strategic energy efficiency measures in buildings, e.g. energy efficient mechanical ventilation systems and building automation systems. In addition a subsidy is proposed for design and purchasing of efficiency measures recommended after energy performance certification in accordance with statute (2006:985) on energy declaration of buildings. All subsidies regarding energy efficiency in buildings should be handled in a common policy model. Subsidies will be allocated in the period 2010 2014.</p>
<p>As an alternative to the subsidy model a new, time-limited system with tax reductions for energy-efficiency investments in buildings could be considered. Such a system could be developed with the so called ROT reduction TPF FPT  as a model and could include for example conversion from direct electrical heating, installation of geo-thermal heat pumps and biofuel boilers, extra insulation of roofs and outer walls, energy-efficient windows and tap water fittings and energy-efficiency measures in ventilation systems.</p>
<p>More stringent building regulations</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that energy-saving requirements in connection with building refurbishments be introduced and that the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning be given the task of evaluating the current requirements for new construction and, where necessary, propose changes.</p>
<p>Energy certificates for buildings</p>
<p>An independent evaluation of the energy certificate system shall be performed no later than 2010. This evaluation shall highlight the experience property owners and users have had of the system and how energy certificates work as an instrument.</p>
<p>The evaluation shall include an overview of the types of profitable measures proposed in the certificates and examine whether the system of energy certificates shall be revised so that household and business electricity is also included in them.</p>
<p>The National Board of Housing, Building and Planning is to be given the task in 2009 of evaluating whether the routines introduced work as intended from a consumer perspective and an administrative point of view.</p>
<p>The National Board of Housing, Building and Planning shall also be given the task of consulting the Swedish Energy Agency to continuously improve and further develop routines and bases for energy certificates. Any revisions made should be in line with the CEN standards that have been devised for energy certificates.</p>
<p>Continued promotion of energy services</p>
<p>The Swedish Energy Agency is to be given the task of working with skills improvement, procurement support and information dissemination regarding energy services.</p>
<p>Technology procurement and market introduction</p>
<p>The Swedish Energy Agency is to given the task of increasing its efforts regarding the procurement of technology in the housing and service sector. Within the framework of the programme, the Swedish Energy Agency shall strive to ensure the emergence of more customer groups. The Swedish Energy Agency shall also be given the task of increased dissemination of information about the products developed as a result of technology procurements.</p>
<p>More efficient district heating</p>
<p>The central joint Heating Market Committee (Värmemarknadskommittén) is proposed to systematically help to improve energy efficiency in the district heating sector. On the local level, energy efficiency committees should be established, composed of relevant stakeholders, including customers.</p>
<p>District heating companies in locations where industrial or other waste heat is lost to the surroundings shall test the possibility of utilising this waste heat before decisions to implement other measures are taken. An investigation into utilising waste heat should, where relevant, be a compulsory part of the environmental impact assessment that must be drawn up prior to the construction of new energy production plants.</p>
<p>Individual energy metering in multi-unit dwellings</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that requirements for individual metering of domestic hot water shall be introduced for newly constructed or renovated buildings that house dwellings, when not unreasonable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is proposed that electricity billing for households in multi-unit dwellings be based on individual metering of electricity consumption in each apartment. A minimum requirement is for distribution metering with sub-metering to be used.</p>
<p>The Energy Markets Inspectorate is to be given the task of performing a special survey, in consultation with the Swedish Energy Agency, into how the metering and billing of electricity is done in commercial premises. This survey shall also include looking into the scope for converting to individual metering.</p>
<p>The industrial sector</p>
<p>Prolonged and extended programmes for energy efficiency improvements in industry</p>
<p>The Swedish Energy Agency is to be given the task of carrying out a second five-year period for the Programme for efficient energy use in electricity-intensive industries (PFE). In the second PFE programme period, non-energy-intensive enterprises shall also be given the opportunity to participate. The Swedish Energy Agency is to be given the task of extending the transfer of knowledge about energy efficient improvements to include enterprises that are currently outside the group permitted to participate in PFE.</p>
<p>Energy advice to small and medium-sized enterprises</p>
<p>More energy advice to small and medium-sized enterprises. Regional energy offices, municipal climate and energy advisors, the county administrative boards and energy service companies shall be involved in this work. The Swedish Energy Agency is to be given the task of administrating this increase in advisory services. These advisory services shall include information, network building and, for enterprises with an annual energy end use of more than 0.5 GWh, subsidised energy audits and analysis for a maximum of two days per enterprise. The services shall also include follow-up contact with the enterprises after the energy audits and analyses have been performed.</p>
<p>Technology procurement in the industrial sector</p>
<p>The Swedish Energy Agency is to be given the task of carrying out technology procurements for the industrial sector, of forming purchaser groups for such procurements and of disseminating information about technology procurements carried out.</p>
<p>The transport sector</p>
<p>Increased CO B B  component in vehicle tax and other tax issues</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes an increased carbon dioxide component of vehicle taxation.</p>
<p>Vehicles are currently taxed not only a basic amount but also a carbon dioxide component, calculated as SEK 15 per gram of carbon dioxide emitted by the vehicle per kilometre driven. This means that fuel-efficient vehicles are taxed just as highly. calculated per gram, as e.g. gas-guzzling vehicles. The inquiry proposes that a system similar to e.g. the one employed in Denmark be introduced in Sweden. Using this system, the tax per gram of carbon dioxide increases progressively as the vehicle's fuel consumption rises.</p>
<p>A SEK 0.75 increase in the taxes on petrol and diesel-oil per litre is also proposed. This will lead to an increase for consumers of SEK 1 per litre including VAT.</p>
<p>Planning for more efficient transport</p>
<p>Infrastructure, traffic and development planning should be better coordinated. This will facilitate energy efficiency improvements through increased cooperation between different forms of transport.</p>
<p>Planning on the regional and local level shall stimulate a societal structure that promotes resource-efficient transport. Regional planning coordination is required.</p>
<p>A review of the regulatory framework for preferential taxation and travel allowances should be performed aimed at making it more vehicle-neutral.</p>
<p>Binding emission requirements</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that Sweden works in the international arena to ensure the forthcoming average emission requirements in the EU are set at 130 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre in 2012 and that they are subsequently tightened to a level of 70 grams of carbon dioxide per kilometre in 2025. Emission requirements should also be introduced for light and heavy lorries, buses and non road mobile machinery.</p>
<p>The public sector's specific responsibility</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the public sector, made up of central government, municipalities and county councils, set an example in the area of energy-efficiency and show the way forward for other actors by implementing a central government and municipal energy efficiency programme.</p>
<p>The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency is to be given the task in its appropriation directions of integrating the central government energy efficiency programme into environmental management systems. The Swedish Energy Agency is to be given the task of providing support to central agencies regarding energy efficiency tools such as energy management and lifecycle cost calculation.</p>
<p>Municipalities and county councils are invited to enter into energy efficiency agreements with the Swedish state via the Swedish Energy Agency in accordance with the agreement model proposed by the inquiry in Annex 6.</p>
<p>The Swedish Energy Agency is to be given the task in its appropriation directions to administrate and follow up the agreements with municipalities and to investigate how the Sustainable municipality programme can be extended in the long term and opened up to all municipalities and county councils. Furthermore the Agency shall investigate how compulsory energy efficiency targets, the magnitude of which is to be decided on the municipal level, can be integrated into the programme in a clearer way.</p>
<p>Information on energy efficiency improvement</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the information on energy efficiency improvement within different societal sectors and directed towards various target groups shall be strengthened and coordinated in a combined and mostly web-based Forum for energy efficiency improvement within the Swedish Energy Agency.</p>
<p>The Swedish Energy Agency is also to be given the task of broadening the scope of municipal climate and energy advisory services, in consultation with the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. This task should be performed in close cooperation with the relevant professional organisations and actors.</p>
<p>Energy bills</p>
<p>A new mandatory obligation to report information on current prices and metered electricity consumption on energy bills is to be introduced for electricity trading and district heating enterprises. On or in conjunction with bills, or in some other appropriate way, these enterprises shall report information on how energy use has developed over a period of at least twelve months retroactively and provide contact information to independent organisations that can give advice on how to use electricity more efficiently.</p>
<p>The Energy Markets Inspectorate is to be given the task of monitoring compliance with these rules. The Energy Markets Inspectorate and the Swedish Energy Agency are to be given the task of performing an evaluation of how energy enterprises design their bills to customers with a subscription of a maximum of 63 A. This task is to be carried out in consultation with consumer representatives. The Energy Markets Inspectorate and the Swedish Energy Agency will also be given the task of helping professional organisations to improve their energy bill information.</p>
<p>Strategic plan and improvement of energy consumption statistics</p>
<p>The Swedish Energy Agency is to be given the task, in consultation with the Council for Official Statistics, Statistics Sweden and other relevant agencies, to draw up a strategic plan to ensure and improve the quality of energy consumption statistics and to reduce uncertainty in quantitative data.</p>
<p>The Swedish Energy Agency is also to be given the task, in consultation with the Council of Official Statistics and relevant other national agencies, of improving energy consumption statistics to enable better evaluation of the effects of both existing and future instruments.</p>
<p>The Swedish Energy Agency, the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning and other relevant agencies are to be given the task of simplifying data reporting for end-users by increasing data collection coordination.</p>
<p>The Swedish Electricity Act and District Heating Act are to be complemented so that the relevant agencies can be authorised to collect the data needed to follow up energy efficiency improvement programmes and measures.</p>
<p>Education and training for a more energy-efficient Sweden</p>
<p>The relevant energy technology and energy supply industries are proposed to in joint efforts to market energy technology professions more forcefully among young people.</p>
<p>Further development and in-service training of professionally active staff should be expanded and improved.</p>
<p>Professional organisations and other labour market organisations should be invited to participate when energy-related education and training programmes and qualifications are being formulated.</p>
<p>Undergraduate programmes in technical subjects should be broadened with increased efforts in the energy field.</p>
<p>Other proposals</p>
<p>The Swedish Energy Agency and the Energy Markets Inspectorate are to be given the task of studying and improving feedback on energy use in connection with the billing of electricity and district heating, after consultation with the relevant consumer interest bodies.</p>
<p>Output metering for electricity customers with fuse sizes under 63 A should be developed. The Energy Markets Inspectorate is to be given the task of formulating proposals for models and the introduction of requirements for output-based electricity network tariffs, in consultation with the industry.</p>
<p>Metering of electricity by the hour should eventually be introduced for all customers. The Energy Markets Inspectorate is to be given the task of looking into the scope for introducing a general requirement for hour-by-hour readings for all end-users.</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that all types of energy supplies, i.e. including petrol, diesel and fuel oil, shall be accompanied by clear information about their energy content, expressed in kWh.</p>
<p>The Swedish Energy Agency is to be given the task of creating regional networks for cooperation on more efficient energy consumption, in close collaboration with those municipalities and county councils that choose to enter into voluntary agreements with the Swedish state regarding more efficient energy end use.</p>
<p>A central organisation for a more energy-efficient Sweden</p>
<p>The working tasks specified under the directive are such that they should be performed by state authorities and not by private bodies. Furthermore, it is less appropriate to establish a new agency for the working tasks specified under the directive. The inquiry feels that these working tasks should instead be incorporated into existing agency structures.</p>
<p>Relevant sector agencies shall, in cooperation with the Swedish Energy Agency and within their sectors, be responsible for the analytical, promotional, supervisory and control activities that ensue from the energy efficiency directive. The Swedish Energy Agency should however be given the main responsibility for the promotional, supervisory and control tasks ensuing from the directive.</p>
<p>In order to coordinate energy efficiency improvement efforts, it is proposed that a special decision-making council, an energy efficiency council, with representation from the relevant agencies shall be established within the Swedish Energy Agency. The Council's task is to coordinate Swedish efficiency improvement efforts that require participation from several different societal sectors.</p>
<h2>Funding of the proposals</h2>
<p>The policy measures proposed by the Inquiry result in an increased cost for the state. The total cost amounts to 12 billion kronor made up of 2.4 billion per annum during the period 2010 2014. The Inquiry has analyzed how these measures can be financed.</p>
<p>The inquiry rejects a construction establishing a separate energy efficiency fund. The general costs for instruments etc., should be tax -funded via the government budget.</p>
<p>The inquiry feels that the state's costs for new instruments should ultimately be shouldered by both energy producers and end users. The EC directive is based to some extent on energy enterprises helping to realise energy efficiency improvements. This can, according to the directive, take place by the enterprises offering energy services or by them paying for energy efficiency improvements to be implemented. An increase in production taxes is therefore also a way for energy enterprises to take an active part in the funding of energy efficiency improvements, in the spirit of the directive.</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the costs to the state for the new instruments should be funded via an increase in production taxes in the region of SEK 1 billion in combination with an increase in energy taxes for electricity and fuel equal to SEK 0.01 per kWh and applying the conversion table in Annex 2 of the directive. This amounts to a total of approx 1.75 billion kronor per annum. However, the Inquiry considers that this proposal should not lead to an increased tax burden for companies included in the emissions trading scheme. As a consequence the current rules for tax restitution need to be adjusted. Taking tax restitution for the ETS industry into account, such an increase would be approximately 1.5 billion kronor. The proposal gives in total 2.5 billion kronor per annum for financing of policy measures.</p>
<h2>Other aspects taken into consideration by the inquiry</h2>
<p>Markets for energy efficient products and services</p>
<p>No new measures are required to ensure the efficient functioning of current markets. The requirements in Article 6 can be said to have been fulfilled as a result of energy inspections being provided across the country, inter alia, pursuant to the Act on Energy Certificates for Buildings. In case any of the other concrete measures presented in Article 6 are still deemed necessary, a system of voluntary agreements should be introduced. If introduced, such agreements should be offered to all the actors on the energy services market and not just to energy enterprises.</p>
<p>The Swedish Energy Agency should be given the task of following developments on the markets for energy inspections and energy services as well as on strategic markets for energy efficient products.</p>
<p>Transmission tariffs for network-borne energy</p>
<p>The inquiry has found no reason to propose the introduction of entirely flexible transmission charges for electricity and district heating in Sweden. Current pricing, with elements of fixed fees in the transmission charges, is well justified. The fixed part of the network charge can, for example, be seen as a price on output.</p>
<p>The inquiry feels that if the incentives for justified energy efficiency improvements need to be strengthened as regards electricity and heating, it is more socioeconomically effective to levy energy tax on electricity and introduce a tax on district heating than to prohibit what the inquiry believes are well-motivated price structures.</p>
<h2>The consequences of the inquiry's proposals</h2>
<p>The inquiry has assessed the effects of most of the proposals. It has not been possible to shed light on all the effects completely, however. Table 1 below summarises the inquiry's assessments.</p>
<p>All in all, the inquiry estimates that the measures whose effects can be quantified will lead to more efficient primary energy consumption of 30 37 TWh in 2016. This corresponds to about 17 21 TWh in energy end use. Significant effects can also be assumed to be achieved by implementing the proposals whose effects the inquiry has not had the opportunity to quantify.</p>
<p>Adding together all the estimated effects of the proposed and quantified instruments, the effects of previous measures and the inquiry's assessment of existing instruments, primary energy efficiency improvements of 76 83 TWh can be achieved in 2016. This corresponds to about 44 48 TWh in energy end use. In relation to energy use during the base year period, this is the equivalent of about 17 18 percent more efficient primary energy consumption and about 12 14 percent more efficient energy end use respectively.</p>
<p>In addition significant effects can be assumed to be achieved by the following proposed measures:</p>
<p>• Strengthened and coordinated dissemination of information on energy efficiency improvement</p>
<p>• More stringent building regulations</p>
<p>• Evaluation and revision of routines for energy certificates for buildings</p>
<p>• Continued promotion of energy services</p>
<p>• More efficient district heating</p>
<p>• Planning for more efficient transport</p>
<p>• Binding emission requirements</p>
<p>• Increased tax on fossil fuels</p>
<p>Table 1</p>
<p>End-users' annually reduced costs for the proposed measures are estimated at about SEK 10 12 billion, when all the proposed instruments have achieved full impact. Accumulated over the lifetime of the measures, the end-users' energy costs are expected to be reduced by at least SEK 280 billion. From these accumulated savings the end users’ incremental investments in conjunction with the measures should be deducted. Total investments have not been possible to quantify, thus net profit cannot be calculated. However, it should be noted that all proposed measures are profitable for the end users, possibly with the exception of some of the strategic investments in buildings where governmental support has been proposed in chapter 5.5.1.</p>
<h2>A new national energy efficiency target</h2>
<p>The current, by the Swedish Riksdag determined, national target on energy efficiency states that Sweden should achieve an energy savings target of at least 9 percent energy end use by 2016 in relation to the average energy end use of 2001 2005. The Govern- ment has in addition proposed an interim target of 6.5 percent in 2010. TPF FPT</p>
<p>A key task for the inquiry has been to assess and propose a new national energy-efficiency target to be achieved by 2016. The analysis carried out by the inquiry shows that 17 18 percent more efficient primary energy consumption and about 12 14 percent more efficient energy end use respectively can be achieved. Taking into account the assumed significant effects of the inquiry’s non- quantified proposals, it is concluded that a realistic target should be in the upper part of this interval. Thus the inquiry proposes a new national energy efficiency target, based on the guiding principles in chapter 2 and the findings of the inquiry’s analyses, to be</p>
<p>50 TWh energy end use and 80 TWh primary energy by the year 2016, respectively. This corresponds to 14 percent in energy end use terms and 18 percent in primary energy terms.</p>
<p>The inquiry should also according to the directive propose a new interim target to be achieved by the year 2010. This is proposed to be determined to be 25 TWh energy end use and</p>
<p>40 TWh primary energy, corresponding to 7 percent in energy end use and 9 percent in primary energy. The two proposed targets should both be seen in relation to the average energy consumption of 2001 2005.</p>
