<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In September 2000 the Government took a decision to appoint a committee to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of the reform of the system of dental care subsidies that entered into force on 1 January 1999. Where necessary the committee was to present proposals for changes leading to a more efficient system and improved chances of fulfilling the aims of the reform.</p>
<p>The committee, which was given the name the Dental Service Review Committee  2000, submitted an interim report A Better Dental Insurance System for the Elderly  (Swedish Government Official Reports 2001:36) on 4 April 2001, in which enhanced protection against high dental costs for the elderly was presented. The interim report also contains an analysis of price development since the introduction of the reform and the committee’s assessment of cost trends in the next five years.</p>
<p>This present report, which is the committee’s final report, discusses matters concerning the future organisation of dental care and the long-term focus and scope of the system of dental care subsidies. Based on an analysis of the present situation and forecasts of future developments in dental health and the need for treatment in different age groups as well as supply and demand for dental personnel with different types of skills and qualifications, the committee presents its views regarding the organisation and development of the future dental service.</p>
<p>All in all, the committee’s proposals aim to increase the availability of dental care to all, to secure a supply of qualified personnel throughout the country that meet the demands that will be made on dental personnel in the future, and to promote efficiency and cooperation in the dental health service.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>General dental insurance with the aim of making dental care financially accessible to all citizens was introduced in Sweden in 1974. The insurance covered all types of treatment and the subsidies covered all measures. Thanks to the fact that investments were made at the same time in preventive care, the Swedish people’s oral health steadily improved over the following decades. However, a decline in government finances made it necessary to modify government subsidies to adult dental care and the dental insurance system increasingly focused on granting support to expensive treatments for a small proportion of the population and the demand for regular primary dental care declined.</p>
<p>A new aim and direction for dental care subsidies was announced in the dental care bill 1997/98:112 and the Government in power at the time established that the dental insurance system should focus on promoting the dental health of the whole population. In addition, it was considered most important to give priority to certain groups of elderly, unwell and disabled people and, the cost ceiling permitting, patients with high dental costs.</p>
<p>The reformed system of dental care subsidies, which entered into force on 1 January 1999, aimed to provide all adults with improved financial support for primary dental care and to give better financial support to groups in health care and social services. Support to these groups is divided into two parts, on the one hand support for dental care included in the dental insurance which is administered by the social insurance offices, on the other hand, support for dental care administered by the county councils.</p>
<p>Subsidies that come under the responsibility of the county councils are considered to function fairly well. The reform has meant essential improvements for several groups in health care and social services and it has been possible to help a considerable number of people with a major neglected need of dental treatment. The part administered by the social insurance offices intended for patients who, due to chronic illness or disability, have a considerably greater need of dental care has been criticised, inter alia , for being complicated and not benefiting patients to the extent intended.</p>
<p>The National Social Insurance Board has been instructed by the Government to follow the development of the new dental insurance system. The Board establishes that there has been a shift towards primary dental care in accordance with the aim of the reform but price trends in the dental service sector have been so strong since the reform entered into force – between 30 and 40 per cent – that insurance benefits have been generally undermined.</p>
<p>In its bill  A Better Dental Insurance System for the Elderly (bill 2001/02:51), the Government presented a proposal for  high-cost  protection for prosthetics which will apply as from the calendar year in which a person reaches 65. 100 per cent of the charge above SEK 7 700 will be covered. The cost of some material must be paid. The care provider’s claims and the treatment recommended will be subject to examination by the social insurance office. The Government also presented proposals for better protection of the elderly regarding primary dental care. The proposals, which have been approved by the Swedish Riksdag, enter into force on 1 July 2002.</p>
<h2>Trends</h2>
<p>Chapter 2 reports on topical issues relating to dental care such as, among other things, the demand for dental services and supply of personnel in relation to population development and developments in the health services as well as other social trends relevant to dental care.</p>
<p>Sweden’s demographic structure will undergo powerful changes in the next few decades. The greatest change over time is the major increase in the number of elderly. Longer average life expectancy in the population means increased consumption of health services, including dental care, and the resource needs of the health service are expected to increase by 10–15 per cent by the year 2020.</p>
<p>At the same time, the working-age population will decline which will affect economic developments and the chances of financing increased health care costs. This calls for efficient use of resources and a careful analysis of the effect that the altered age composition of the population, increased knowledge of the dental care situation of chronically ill and disabled people and also extensive immigration to Sweden will have on future demand for dental services and possibly also on the system of dental care subsidies.</p>
<p>Future dental care must be planned on the basis of the population’s need of dental care and be offered to all citizens on equal terms. Repeated epidemiological surveys provide a relatively safe basis for an assessment of future dental health development. In the last few decades the oral health of the population has steadily improved and this applies particularly to children and young people. However, there are major regional differences and there are differences in dental health between children of Swedish parents and children of immigrant parents. The incidence of caries among the latter is much higher.</p>
<p>Epidemiological surveys show that there has also been a marked improvement among the adult population but here too there are differences between different parts of the country. Thus, dental health in the population has improved considerably in the last 25 years but considerable differences related to socio-economic conditions remain. There is also a social imbalance as regards utilisation of dental services and it is primarily in the lowest income brackets that visits to the dentist have declined in recent years.</p>
<p>According to the 1999 survey on household incomes, HINK, carried out by Statistics Sweden, almost 15 per cent, which is equivalent to a million people, stated that they had wholly or partly denied themselves dental care because of the expense. Since it is mainly people with low incomes that sacrifice dental care, there is reason to pay particular attention to risks to vulnerable groups in connection with changes to the system of charges. Although increases in charges are not particularly large they may have noticeable effects in the lower income levels.</p>
<p>Just as it may be assumed that higher charges may cause people to refrain from using dental services, there are equally good grounds for assuming that a considerably larger subsidy component to patients may lead to an increase in demand. The survey considers it probable that the high-cost protection for all prosthetics, for example crowns, bridges, implants, for the age group 65 and over will mean an increase in consumption of dental services. With the current scarce staff resources in dental care outside metropolitan areas, it may prove difficult to meet large increases in demand.</p>
<p>There are several important factors that affect the development of and need for dental services today and in the future. The rapid development of information technology has had an impact on and developed most public services. IT also means dental technology is changing. The potential of teleodontology both regarding clinical service and staff training is enormous and the Internet also offers the possibility of international knowledge networks.</p>
<p>New technology and knowledge that contribute to simplifications also bring with them a continuous need to reorganise work and to review the division of work between the different professional categories in dentistry. The challenge in the next few years will be to bring about a more efficient mixture of skills and increased cooperation between professional groups so that the real skills of all professions can be better utilised.</p>
<p>All in all, developments mean that in future public resources must be better coordinated and prioritised than is the case today if they are to be sufficient for everyone since economic resources are finite and shortage of personnel will probably be a limiting factor as well.</p>
<p>However, the committee is convinced that a reformed organisation and personnel structure and a change in working methods can increase the availability of dental care to patients.</p>
<h2>Objectives and principles</h2>
<p>Chapter 3 deals with objectives and principles for the dental service and public financial support to it, and it also deals with organisational changes in the dental service and with the scope and content of dental training.</p>
<p>Under the Dental Services Act (1985:125) the overall objectives for the dental service are good oral health and dental care for the whole population on equal terms. The reformed dental subsidies system introduced in Sweden in 1999 meant that the dental insurance system was given a clearer health focus through increased investment in primary dental care. Future dental subsidies should also have a clear public health profile and be formulated so as to stimulate patients to take greater responsibility for their own oral health.</p>
<p>The committee considers it essential to ensure that those in greatest need of dental care are given precedence and that people in need of treatment need not go without it for financial reasons. Regarding dental care in connection with illness and disability, the committee considers that patients with a considerably greater need of dental care due to illness or disability should not have increased dental expenses as a result and that a uniform allowance system is needed for all dental care connected with illness or disability.</p>
<p>The committee considers that certain adjustments and improvements to the current dental subsidy system are necessary. This applies, for example, to improvement of the system of subsidies to primary dental measures and high-cost protection also needs to be improved so that all adults can obtain extensive dental care at a reasonable cost. It is also important to take advantage of the gains in oral health achieved through organised dental care for children and young people and to improve the situation in connection with the transition between free dental care for children and young people and adult dental care which is subject to a charge.</p>
<p>Regarding economic support the committee presents proposals for in principle gradually extending dental subsidies when resources so permit. To be able to carry out the committee’s broad proposals for improvements, not only will financial resources be needed but also an even distribution of the available resources across the country.</p>
<p>Regarding the educational system, the objectives and principles emphasised by the committee are that, after completing basic training, all dental personnel shall be capable of providing highquality treatment and that their basic training furnishes the preconditions for continued lifelong learning. Training programmes for dental personnel shall be dimensioned with a view to meeting demand in Sweden. The committee generally considers that no training programme should extend beyond what is necessary to meet the qualification requirements demanded by the labour market. Nor should education programmes imply a deadend but should lead to continued studies in the dentistry sphere or other university studies.</p>
<h2>The structure of the dental service</h2>
<p>Chapter 4 sheds light on future access to dental personnel with different types of qualifications. The possibilities are discussed of guaranteeing access to qualified dental personnel all over the country and also of promoting efficient working methods and effective cooperation in the dental sector. The distribution of work among the various professional groups in dental services is also discussed.</p>
<p>The call for qualified personnel is affected by changes taking place in the world. Swedish health and medical services face major challenges and the same influencing factors that operate in those services also operate in the dental service. Several forces for a positive development are reported in the chapter and also counter forces.</p>
<p>The population trend towards a higher proportion of elderly people who retain their own teeth with an increasing need of oral health and oral comfort will contribute to a strongly increased demand for service. A continued favourable economic development will probably also mean more and more people can have access to highly specialised dental care, which in the long term will sustain a continued strong demand for dental services. However, there are several exacerbating factors as regards access to dental care. Dental resources are already unevenly distributed over the country as it is.</p>
<p>The major challenge to the Swedish dental service is probably supply of personnel. The chances are that the number of practising dentists will decline slightly in the next ten years at the same time as the demand for dental care in all likelihood increases. Supplementary teams that work around the patient, each member able to use his/her full skills is one way of managing the Swedish dental service so that the population will continue to have access to good dental care focusing on enhanced oral health, which are some of the dental service requirements set out in the Dental Services Act.</p>
<h2>Dental training</h2>
<p>Chapter five discusses the need for reformed dental training and the future need of specialist dentists will be reviewed. The role in the dental service of dental hygienists, dental nurses and dental technicians is discussed and the need for training for these professional groups.</p>
<p>In several contexts the committee stresses that future dental care will increasingly focus on treatment of the elderly and ill and disabled people. The committee considers this to be a task for the majority of practising dentists, dental hygienists and dental nurses. Training programmes for this sphere of activities must therefore be extended in all dental training, including specialist programmes.</p>
<p>Dentist training:</p>
<p>In recent years criticism has been expressed that newly qualified dentists do not have adequate training in clinical skills. This applies mainly to the objectives; to be able to cooperate with other personnel in dental care, to have training in the dentist’s role as leader of the dental team and to have acquired an economically efficient approach in terms of health and care. The introduction of compulsory on-the-job training for dentists following basic training has therefore been discussed.</p>
<p>The committee proposes that two months’ continuous extramural clinical training be introduced within the framework of basic training for dentists. The aim should be to acquire training in a dental care team in real conditions and an economically efficient approach before obtaining a professional qualification as a dentist. To promote a better distribution of dentists across the country, the committee recommends that basic education to qualify as a dentist be extended by 20 places and that these be based at Umeå University.</p>
<p>Regarding specialist training the committee proposes that a provision be introduced into the Dental Services Act clearly defining the county councils’ responsibility for specialist training programmes.</p>
<p>A national dental nurse’s training programme:</p>
<p>The dental nursing profession is changing. The work previously mainly consisted of lending assistance, but developments are now moving towards a broader range of duties. Work is delegated to many dental nurses and they have advanced assignments based on the real skills they possess. The dental nurses’ trade union organisations have expressed a desire for a professional qualification for dental nurses.</p>
<p>The committee has stated in many contexts that there is a need for competent dental nurses in the dental service. According to the committee’ prognoses, more than 3 000 dental nurses will retire up to 2011. Since in principle there is no formal training for this group, it will not be possible to replace them.</p>
<p>The committee proposes that a training course for dental nurses be established in local authority administered adult education qualifying the student for further studies at university level.</p>
<p>A training programme for dental hygienists with the possibility of supplementary advanced courses:</p>
<p>The dental hygienist’s profession has radically changed since it was established in Sweden in the 1960s. At that time dental hygienists were mainly occupied with non-surgical treatment of periodontoclasia diseases. Today their role is considerably broader and includes additional assignments. It is chiefly in dental care for children and young people that there has been a broadening of work and a similar development is on the way in dental care for the elderly.</p>
<p>The committee is of the view that basic training for dental hygienists should continue to comprise 80 credits. In addition different types of advanced courses should be available. These may be of varying length depending on their focus but they should be at university level. In the committee’s view, further training for dental hygienists should primarily be the responsibility of the employer.</p>
<p>Organisational changes that are necessary if greater efficiency in the dental service is to be achieved are discussed in several contexts. The dental hygienist plays a key role here provided that the dentist allows the dental hygienist to work on the basis of his/her full skills. Unfortunately many dental hygienists are not given the opportunity today to tackle the comprehensive assignments for which they are formally qualified.</p>
<p>Through basic training and the opportunity for deeper studies through advanced courses, the committee considers dental hygienists will be given the same development opportunities as dental practitioners. In a future organisation, a model of this type could be developed to the benefit of both the individual and the employer who on the basis of diversified operations will be able to adapt the cutting-edge skills needed in dental hygiene.</p>
<p>As far as dental technicians are concerned, the committee considers the number of places in training courses for dental technicians is adequate to provide Swedish dental laboratories with personnel. Additional personnel in the form of newly qualified dental technicians cover forecasted depletion through retirement up to 2011.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 discusses economic subsidies to the dental service.</p>
<p>The starting-point for the design and extension of future subsidies to the dental service should be that support is given in the first instance to primary dental care which is necessary in order to achieve and maintain good oral health and to prevent the occurrence of major damage in the future. In addition, there should be high-cost protection so that those who are in need of extensive prosthetic dentistry in the form of crowns, bridges and implants can afford the treatment required. The committee also proposes substantially improved subsidies to dental care related to illnesses or disabilities.</p>
<h2>Dental care in connection with illness or disability</h2>
<p>The committee recommends that all dental care that is a consequence of a substantially increased need due to illness or disability be brought together in one and the same system of benefits and in the committee’s estimation the county councils should be responsible for all such dental service and it should be financed by the same level of charges as in the case of open health and medical services. The special rules in the dental insurance system that apply to people with a persistent and essentially increased need of dental care due to chronic illness and disability can thereby be abolished.</p>
<p>The committee also recommends that surgical treatment of infection in the case of periodontal illness and the appurtenant cleaning of root surfaces be included in the county councils’ area of responsibility and charge system.</p>
<p>The proposal represents a considerable improvement in financial support to patients who have a persistent and essentially increased need of dental care due to chronic illness or disability. This applies particularly if prosthetic measures are needed. A change of this nature probably means that considerably more such measures will be performed than previously resulting in increased costs. It is therefore essential that, in connection with their assessments of recommendations for treatment and costs, the county councils see to it that only treatment caused by an essentially increased need due to illness or disability may be charged at health and medical service rates.</p>
<p>Regarding the county councils’ responsibility for outreach activities and dental care necessary for patients with special needs, the committee recommends, inter alia , that Section 8a of the Dental Services Act be clarified so that it is evident that it is the individual need for treatment and care that entitles patients to free outreach activities and the necessary treatment at the same level of charges as for open health and medical services.</p>
<p>In spite of considerable information campaigns on the part of the county councils concerning application of the Dental Services Act and Dental Services Ordinance, differences between the rules and regulations of the different county councils are so great that the National Board of Health and Welfare considers there is legal uncertainty. And many county councils have requested clearer directions.</p>
<p>The committee considers complete up-to-date information should be available regarding what should be included in outreach activities and necessary dental care for residents of nursing homes. Legal certainty will thereby increase and the county councils’ desire for clearer directions accommodated.</p>
<h2>Young adults</h2>
<p>The committee proposes that people leaving the free dental service for children and young people be given a voucher valid as part payment for a dental subscription with an optional dentist or dental hygienist or for individual dental care procedures. The voucher should be distributed with information from the social insurance office at the beginning of the year the individual reaches 20. The voucher should be worth SEK 600 largely to cover the cost of an examination and a minor preventive measure.</p>
<p>The main reason for the committee’s proposal is that young adults are a financially weak group. Many have no income because they are continuing their studies and unemployment is relatively high among young people. The committee also wants to create a system to make the transition easier from organised free dental care for children and young people to adult dental care. The system should on the one hand reduce costs for young adults in the first years after they are no longer entitled to free care and, on the other, promote continued regular contacts with the dental service.</p>
<h2>Primary dental care</h2>
<p>To reinforce the focus of dental insurance on primary dental care the committee proposes that</p>
<p>N  The benefit for examination and preventive measures and for pulp surgery be adjusted upwards.</p>
<p>N  A benefit for examination procedures for the age group 30– 64 be introduced.</p>
<p>N  The benefit for preventive measures be raised for all to one and a half base amounts.</p>
<p>N  The benefit for pulp surgery procedures be raised for all to one and a half base amounts.</p>
<p>N  Acrylic splints be included in primary dental care.</p>
<p>One of the problems the committee wants to try to solve is ensuring that no one will need to forgo regular visits to the dentist because of the cost. The longer a relationship between care provider and patient, the more favourable are the effects. It is of the utmost importance that patients do not need to delay treatment for so long that the damage has become irreparable and teeth have to be extracted or extensive repair work involving crowns, bridges and implants has to be performed.</p>
<p>The committee considers that the dental benefit payable for everyday dental care designed to promote health is important in a long-term perspective both for the individual purely in terms of costs and dental health and for the Swedish economy through lower costs for the dental service.</p>
<h2>Extended high-cost protection for prosthetics</h2>
<p>The committee considers high-cost protection should be introduced for all who are in need of major prosthetic treatment aged 20 and above as soon as government finances and dental service resources so permit.</p>
<p>In its interim report the committee has already stated it to be desirable that all people with high dental costs should enjoy the increased support recommended for elderly patients. The reason why it was not proposed that this support should apply generally was that this could not be accommodated within the then available cost framework.</p>
<p>The decision by the Swedish Riksdag to introduce high-cost protection for all prosthetics such as crowns, bridges and implants for the age group 65 and above, where the cost for permanent prosthetic replacements, excluding the cost of material, and primary dental care during a course of treatment amounts to SEK 7 700, may be seen as a first step towards putting dental care on a par with other health care. Since this support will probably require extensive resources a careful evaluation of the effects should be carried out. The evaluation must include both cost trends for the insurance and how this benefit system will affect the behaviour of the care providers and the patients. The necessary changes can then be made before these subsidies are introduced.</p>
<h2>Patients’ security</h2>
<p>Chapter 7 discusses patients’ rights in dental care and the activities of the regional patients’ committees. The dental insurance system is analysed from a gender equality perspective and the possibility of introducing a dental credit system is discussed.</p>
<p>To find out to what extent the county councils’ patients’ committees deal with dental matters and what problems have been given attention in this context, the committee carried out a poll among the country’s patients’ committees. The results show that complaints and dissatisfaction with dental care very often concern financial matters. The committee considers the activities of the regional patients’ committees should be extended to comprise all dental care financed by county councils. The committee does not consider these activities should cover other dental sectors also. As far as private dental care is concerned there are supervisory boards under the auspices of the private dentists’ associations. Regarding dental benefits there is the possibility of formal appeal under the National Insurance Act, and the National Board of Health and Welfare and the Medical Responsibility Board (HSAN) receive complaints against dental personnel. The committee does not think it would improve the patients’ possibilities of receiving support and assistance if there were yet another institution to apply to.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 also contains an analysis of subsidies to the dental service from a gender equality perspective. It is established that in several respects there are differences between women and men as regards the incidence of disease and utilisation of the dental service. However, the committee has found that neither the dental insurance system nor the forms of support administered by the county councils treat either of the sexes unfairly except in one respect. Regarding a substantially increased need of dental care as a result of chronic illness or disability within the framework of the dental insurance system, certain illnesses are strongly genderrelated, for example rheumatoid complaints and eating disordors. For both these groups there is often a need for dental care in the form of extensive prosthetic replacements at high cost. The qualifying amount before benefit may be claimed, which is SEK 3 500, is not deducted from the dental benefit and this is the extra subsidy in the dental insurance system for such measures. Thus, no matter what the costs of the prosthetic measures, the extra support is maximised to this amount.</p>
<p>The committee recommends that charges be paid for all dental care relating to illness or disability on the same basis as for open health and medical services, that is to say not more than SEK 900 per twelve-month period. The proposal means that women will no longer be unfairly treated as regards financial support for dental care.</p>
<p>The committee proposes a credit guarantee system be introduced. A considerable number of people forgo dental care for financial reasons. Several investigations have shown a convincing connection between poor finances and forgoing dental treatment. In the long term oral health can seriously deteriorate so that extensive and expensive prosthetic reconstructions will be necessary.</p>
<p>The committee is of the view that no one should need to forgo treatment for financial reasons. In spite of the improvements made in social services and which are proposed for the dental insurance system and in spite of the credit possibilities that are already available today in the dental service, there will still be financial obstacles for a large group of people to receiving the dental care needed in order to attain and maintain good oral health in the long term. The committee therefore considers a state credit guarantee system for dental health should be introduced. However, it has not been possible within the remit of the committee to clarify in detail matters concerning state credit for dental care and the committee proposes that the Government instruct the National Social Insurance Board to draw up, in consultation with the care providers’ organisations, a proposal for a credit guarantee system.</p>
<h2>Cost trend</h2>
<p>The committee was also instructed to analyse price trends for dental care and make an assessment of future cost development in the next five years. The committee’s analysis and standpoint regarding cost trends in dental care are included in Chapter 8.</p>
<p>The committee considers that continuing price increases in dental care are of great concern. The average price increase in the National Dental Service in this country between 1998 and 2002 amounted to about 40 per cent and private care providers have followed the price increases in the respective county council although their prices are generally at a higher level. The average price increase in the National Dental Service between January 2001 and January 2002 was 8.4 per cent. Thus, there is no sign of a decline in the rate of price increases.</p>
<p>All care providers have a major responsibility to rationalise and make their operations effective so that price rises are restrained in future. If they continue to rise at the same rate as up to now, among other things the extension of the high-cost protection for prosthetics to include all age groups will be in jeopardy. The design of support in the form of one hundred per cent allowance for fees in excess of SEK 7 700 means that the care providers’ price increases have full effect on state costs for the insurance. Although both the Government and the Riksdag have previously rejected proposals for price regulation, the committee still considers totally free pricing is unreasonable when the state or the county councils pay the full cost. It is not in the interest of either the care provider or the patient to limit costs. Experience tells us that extensive third-part financing leads to cost increases.</p>
<h2>Follow-up</h2>
<p>It is established in Chapter 9 that there is a great need to improve the statistical material required to follow up dental care regarding both the efficiency of subsidies to dental care and personnel resources. At the request of the Government, the National Social Insurance Board and the National Board of Health and Welfare have drawn up a proposal.</p>
<p>The committee does not consider the recommendations of the two authorities should be carried out without further ado, inter alia  because the administrative and economic consequences for the care providers who submit the information are not yet clear. The committee also questions whether some of the information desired could not be reliably collected in a simpler way than that proposed. The committee therefore considers that the Government should further discuss the matter before statutory amendments are carried out.</p>
