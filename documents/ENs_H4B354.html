<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The digitalisation of society has led to changes in communication patterns. Throughout the 2000s, the postal markets – both in Sweden and the rest of Europe – have been characterised by a constant decrease in letter volumes. To ensure the future of a quality postal service throughout the country that is cost-effective and meets household and business needs as far as possible, the Inquiry has conducted a review of the Swedish postal legislation. The Inquiry’s objective is to devise rules based on the review that ensure the continued existence of a quality universal postal service.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the scope of this universal service should be clarified with regard to the exemptions from five-day delivery and where post can be delivered. The proposals enable the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority to regulate this in provisions when necessary. A clearer regulation on where the universal postal service’s last outpost should be will make it easier to define the role of the postal service with regard to state measures to guarantee service in sparsely populated areas.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Inquiry proposes that postal service providers should submit to the Government or a government-appointed agency information about their finances and activities required for following up and monitoring the postal market. Currently, the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority is not able to request documentation from, for example, parcel distributors that do not have a licence to conduct postal operations. This documentation is essential for the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority to be able to continuously examine and analyse the need for changes to the state’s obligations.</p>
<p>Finally, the Inquiry proposes that the postcode system shall be available at a cost-oriented price on the provider’s website. Making the postcode system available at a regulated price could help make it simpler for small business owners to start a business in the eCommerce sector.</p>
<h2>The remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit in the final report mainly comprised the following elements:  Surveying the postal market and assessing the likely future developments at national level, and summarising ongoing developments in the EU.  Conducting a socioeconomic analysis of the postal market and the effects of digitalisation on it. On the basis of this analysis, any shortcomings in the existing legislation hindering the development of the market are to be investigated.  Analysing and assessing whether the existing postal legislation meets current and future needs in a digital society. The Inquiry is to analyse in particular the needs and demand in various parts of the country, the postal service’s role when it comes to central government measures to ensure service to sparsely populated areas and the impact of joint distribution.  Drawing up necessary legislative proposals, analysing the need for amendments to the Postal Services Directive and proposing such amendments.</p>
<h2>Survey and socioeconomic analysis of the postal market</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s survey of the postal market is divided into a letters market and a parcels market. However, postal operators are moving increasingly towards handling letters and parcels in the same flows to exploit the synergies as far as possible. As eCommerce grows, the boundaries between letters and parcels are becoming blurred. Goods weighing less than 2 kg and of low value are often sent as letters instead of parcels.</p>
<p>The socioeconomic analysis shows that competition in the letters market has grown considerably as a result of digitalisation. Initially, digitalisation had an impact on the market in that the possibility of sorting letters by machine created new business opportunities. However, over the past decade, competition from other communication means has had a more far-reaching impact than competition from other companies.</p>
<p>To prevent profit erosion, companies in the letters market have been successful in adapting their activities and costs. This, in turn, has had a restraining effect on prices, which has also slowed the decline in volumes, by international standards. In recent years, companies have become established in the first production stage of postal operations by developing new sorting and postage optimisation programmes. Postal operators have also developed new partnerships that have created joint operations advantages in the delivery stage.</p>
<p>The Swedish parcels market has never been regulated and the level of competition in different parts of the market has been more or less high. The onset of eCommerce has given actors that previously operated in the B2B market greater business opportunities in the quickly growing B2C market . The margins for most services are low and coverage throughout the country is relatively good, which suggests that competition in the market is relatively effective. No major new start-ups have been established in recent decades; instead, the growing competition is due to existing companies expanding their areas of operations.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has also tried to identify the problems and shortcomings experienced by the actors in the postal market. Given the nature of the problems and the results of the socioeconomic analysis, the Inquiry has chosen to go ahead with proposed amendments to certain parts of the Postal Services Act (2010:1045).</p>
<h2>Clarifying the scope of the universal service</h2>
<p>Chapter 3, Section 1 of the Postal Services Act describes the scope of the universal postal service. Under this section, the Government or government-appointed agency also gives authorisation to prescribe which services should be included in the universal postal service and which delivery times must apply. Under Chapter 3, Section 1, point 1 of the Postal Services Act, at least one collection and one delivery of post must be made every working day and at least five days a week, apart from under circumstances or geographical conditions that the permit authority considers to constitute grounds for exemption.</p>
<p>In its survey of the distance of users from postal services, the Inquiry has observed that the accessibility of postal services is good, not least considering the fact that Sweden is a sparsely populated country. There are clear differences between the most sparsely and the most densely populated municipalities in Sweden. The average distance from postal services is about three times higher in typical sparsely populated municipalities compared with major cities. For a typical sparsely populated municipality, this means on average close to six kilometres to the nearest post office, compared with just under two in major cities. For almost 98 per cent of post recipients in Sweden , the nearest personal or communal letter box (known together as post facility) is less than 500 metres away. For over 4 600 post recipients, the nearest is more than five kilometres away – this corresponds to 0.06 per cent of all post recipients.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has found that according to needs analyses, postal service needs are different for private individuals, companies and actors that carry out essential functions in society. These needs are not always compatible with the cost savings that may be necessary to address trends in volumes in letter delivery services. To still be able to meet as far as possible users’ needs, the regulatory framework must be as flexible as possible so that the postal service can be adapted to the different needs that exist in different parts of the country and in different user groups.</p>
<h2>Delivery five days a week</h2>
<p>As the postal market in Sweden is under a great deal of pressure to change, Postnord has been forced to review and rationalise its production activities. These changes may, in the future, have an ever greater impact on the conditions for postal services in sparsely populated and rural areas. There is therefore reason to clarify how the provisions on exemptions from five-day delivery are to be interpreted and applied.</p>
<p>Several European countries have established regulations on the objective situations in which exemptions may be made, which differs from the situation in Sweden, where the regulations are not as clear. The Inquiry therefore proposes that the authorisation to issue regulations in Chapter 3, Section 1, second paragraph of the Postal Services Act should be expanded to also cover exemptions under point 1. Moreover, the Inquiry proposes the introduction of a new first paragraph in Section 8 of the Postal Services Ordinance giving the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority the right to issue regulations on when exemptions may be made from five-day delivery.</p>
<p>Regulations should allow services in individual cases to be adapted to the overall needs of the users so that these can be met in a cost-effective way. Further, the Inquiry considers that clearer regulations concerning the situations in which the appointed provider may refrain from delivering post five days a week will increase legal certainty and facilitate supervision. In the Inquiry’s view, the practice that has applied so far should form the basis of the new regulations.</p>
<h2>Regulating current delivery practice</h2>
<p>The provider’s rationalisations, for example in the form of changed delivery routes for postal workers, may affect the conditions for universal postal services. With regard to where post is to be delivered, there is therefore reason to clarify in the regulations how the provisions should be interpreted and applied.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes the introduction in Chapter 3, Section 1, second paragraph of the Postal Services Act of a new authorisation for the Government or government-appointed agency to decide to issue regulations on the terms of delivery. Moreover, the Inquiry proposes the introduction of a new first paragraph in Section 8 of the Postal Services Ordinance giving the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority the right to issue such regulations.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the regulations concerning delivery need to be modernised in light of the pressure for change that exists in the Swedish postal market and that will probably increase in the future. Considering the fact that general advice is not binding, the Inquiry considers that, when it is deemed necessary, the Government or the supervisory agency should be able to issue regulations on how deliveries should be made within the universal postal service.</p>
<h2>Providers of postal services to submit data</h2>
<p>At present, the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority is not able to conduct any comprehensive analysis of the Swedish parcels market. Transport Analysis, the agency in Sweden responsible for statistics in the postal area, collects some statistics from parcel distributors.</p>
<p>This data is not linked to the Postal Services Act’s definition of postal services or postal operations. This means that it tends to be incomplete and not sufficient to enable useful analyses in the postal area.</p>
<p>The Swedish Post and Telecom Authority should be able to determine the future scope of universal services, how competition is functioning and in which areas a provider of universal postal services needs to be appointed. Postal regulations should enable increased opportunities to collect data.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the most suitable solution would be to allow Transport Analysis to collect data and disclose relevant data at the request of the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority. If the regulatory framework that Transport Analysis follows does not enable satisfactory data collection for the Swedish Post and</p>
<p>Telecom Authority, and if the European Commission’s coming regulation cannot be coordinated with this data collection, the Inquiry considers that the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority should be able to collect data from parcel distributors.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore proposes the introduction of a new second paragraph to Chapter 3, Section 5 of the Postal Services Act containing the requirement that a postal service provider must, upon request, disclose to the Government or governmentappointed agency such data about its finances and activities that is necessary for follow-up and monitoring under the first paragraph.</p>
<h2>Regulated access to the postcode system</h2>
<p>In Sweden, Postnord has been appointed by the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority to provide and manage the postcode system. According to the legislative history to the current Postal Services Act, it is important that postal operators have access to the postal infrastructure, including postcodes, in a way that promotes efficiency. The Inquiry considers that it is equally important that companies in the area of eCommerce and digital services, for example, have easy access to the postcode system at a cost-oriented price. The aim is to facilitate competition and the establishment of new businesses. The price should only cover the costs that arise in connection with the final delivery to the user. This may, for example, be the price of a CD, paper printouts and any postage. This should normally be free of charge if the information can be downloaded from the Postnord website.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes the introduction in Chapter 4, Section 1 of the Postal Services Act of a second paragraph stating that the postcode system should remain available at a cost-oriented price on the provider’s website. This proposal is in line with the Government’s objectives for administrative policy. Government agencies should actively increase opportunities for the use of public information to facilitate the development of an information market, strengthen people’s autonomy and ability to exercise their citizens’ rights, and support the development of the new digital society.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposals Clarifying the scope of the universal service</h2>
<p>Clarifying the scope of the universal service will mainly have consequences for the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority, which may need to set aside resources to draw up clearer regulations concerning exemptions to five-day delivery and where deliveries are to be made. These proposals will lead to greater clarity for users and a reduced risk of arbitrariness.</p>
<p>A clearer boundary for the last outpost of the universal postal service will enable better coordination with other public services in sparsely populated areas, e.g. through procurement. Depending on how the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority in the future uses its authorisation to issue regulations as the Inquiry proposes, these may lead to greater socioeconomic efficiency.</p>
<h2>Data disclosure</h2>
<p>Each year, the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority requests various data from postal operators for analysis of the letters market and as a basis for setting fees. The Inquiry’s proposal on collecting statistics will enable more thorough analysis of the Swedish postal market. This, in turn, will provide the supervisory authority with better opportunities to ensure that the universal postal service is adapted to users’ needs. The parcel distributors questioned by the</p>
<p>Inquiry do not see any immediate problems with disclosing relevant data and already report a certain amount of data to Transport Analysis. It is therefore not clear whether their administrative burden will increase as a result of the proposal.</p>
<p>Depending on which agency the Government appoints to collect data – Transport Analysis or the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority – the administrative tasks for the two agencies would differ in scope.</p>
<h2>Regulated price for access to the postcode system</h2>
<p>A regulated price for access to the postcode system will probably mean that users will need to pay less for access to this system. This will make it cheaper to check address and reference databases and keep them up-to-date and correct, which should increase business efficiency. It would also enable more price-sensitive small companies to establish activities that rely on up-to-date information about the postcode system, for example in the eCommerce sector.</p>
<p>The Inquiry estimates that Postnord’s increased net costs as a result of the proposal will amount to a maximum of SEK 6 million. The Inquiry considers that the socioeconomic benefit in Sweden will exceed Postnord’s extra costs for providing this information almost free of charge.</p>
