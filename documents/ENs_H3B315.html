<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Sweden has good prospects for a competitive and sustainable production of foods. Major resources are available in terms of land and water, research of good quality and a stable economy. Swedish food production is known for its high level of safety and good animal welfare. The food production chain is important to Swedish employment. Robust agricultural and horticultural production is an important part of the country’s management of natural resources and a prerequisite for achieving several of the environmental quality objectives. These industries also provide important ecosystem services.</p>
<p>Since joining the EU, Swedish production has lost market shares. Consumption has increased and demand is met to a greater degree by means of imported products.</p>
<p>Reduced production in Sweden leads to environmental consequences in both Sweden and other parts of the world.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the agricultural and horticultural sector faces great challenges to achieve increased competitiveness and production. The Inquiry therefore makes the following proposals:</p>
<p>• That the Government present a proposal to the Riksdag of a vision for 2030 on a sustainable, attractive and innovative agricultural and horticultural sector. To achieve this vision, the Inquiry proposes a strategy for growth and value creation. The strategy should be divided into interim targets, along with measures for achieving them.</p>
<p>• That the strategy should be based on four focus areas. Together, the proposed measures in these areas are to contribute to the goal of a sustainable, attractive and innovative agricultural and horticultural sector.</p>
<p>• That a national council be set up to help implement the strategy. The council should strengthen cooperation among the relevant actors. The Government should also instruct relevant government agencies to cooperate and contribute to improving competitiveness in the sector. This should be done by means of a review of instructions and appropriation directions.</p>
<p>The Inquiry particularly wishes to emphasise the following assessments:</p>
<p>• Positive developments that lead to better competitiveness should be based on a clear political goal. This goal is an important foundation for the attitudes in both the sector and the surrounding community.</p>
<p>• The role of central government is primarily to create favourable circumstances through means such as conditions and regulations on a par with competitor countries and through the knowledge and innovation system.</p>
<p>• The sector bears a great responsibility to make market adjustments, develop and formulate its own strategies. In this context, the development of productivity is considered crucial.</p>
<p>• There is reason to analyse whether the Swedish position concerning the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy can be adapted so that it can be of greater benefit to the interests of Swedish industrial policy.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals for action in the strategy for growth and value creation are based on four focus areas.</p>
<h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>
<p>Profitability, regardless of the size of the business in the agricultural and horticultural sector, is necessary for positive development and competitiveness. An analysis commissioned by the Inquiry shows that major companies are generally more effective, in economic terms, than small companies. The Inquiry therefore considers that structural change will continue and benefit competitiveness.</p>
<p>Today’s productivity development is insufficient to maintain or increase productivity in the primary line. The Inquiry therefore considers that productivity must be increased. This will be accomplished by increasing expertise and focus on production processes, markets, business management and entrepreneurship. The Inquiry emphasises that it is the business operator who is responsible for company decisions and thus has the ultimate influence over the process.</p>
<p>Capital supply, risk management and change of ownership</p>
<p>Investments are necessary for growth, but will not be forthcoming if expectations regarding profitability are low. Building costs play an important role in this.</p>
<p>Market and price risks in the agricultural and horticultural sector, as in other companies, are significant and must be managed in an efficient manner to ensure profitability, confidence in the future and investments. The Inquiry therefore makes the following proposals:</p>
<p>• That the Swedish Board of Agriculture, together with other relevant stakeholders, be instructed to summarise knowledge and identify knowledge gaps on construction in the agricultural and horticultural sector.</p>
<p>• That research funds and innovation measures be allocated for developing knowledge on  cost-effective construction in the agricultural and horticultural sector. The Swedish Board of Agriculture, together with market actors, will be instructed to describe models for various forms of changes of ownership and profit sharing between property owners and operators.</p>
<p>• That educational measures be implemented to increase knowledge about risk management on market terms, and how exposure to risk can be reduced when companies expand.</p>
<p>Land acquisition and leasing legislation</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that land acquisition legislation, in its current form, impedes external supply of capital, complicates transfers and sales of agricultural land and results in administrative costs. Increased dynamics and new categories of owners will be necessary to allow transfers and investments in agricultural and horticultural companies. Transfers must be carried out in an efficient manner for the large and capital-intensive companies that represent the majority of production.</p>
<p>In addition, the Inquiry considers it important that leasing is an attractive form of tenure and that the leasing market functions well. The Inquiry therefore makes the following proposals:</p>
<p>• That the Government initiate an examination of the consequences of amending land acquisition legislation so that it is easier for limited companies to acquire agricultural land.</p>
<p>• That the Government take account of the proposals of Inquiry on leasing (Swedish Government Official Reports SOU 2014:32) concerning improved security of tenure regarding nontenant leased land. Unlike the Inquiry on leasing, this Inquiry proposes that full freedom of contract should apply when establishing rents.</p>
<h2>Regulations and conditions</h2>
<p>Membership of the EU in 1995 meant a new competitive situation for the sector, and differences in the conditions and regulations between different Member States gained greater significance. The Inquiry notes that costs for labour, taxes on means of production, animal and plant health legislation, permit applications pursuant to the Swedish Environmental Code and application of regulations have a major impact on the competitiveness of the agricultural and horticultural sector. The Inquiry considers that the basis for the way society is governed should be the common legislation in the EU. National rules and requirements that go beyond this should be well motivated, rest on scientific grounds and be carefully considered in terms of their impact on competitiveness.</p>
<p>Taxes on means of production and costs of labour</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that taxation of various means of production is a factor that greatly affects the competitive situation of the agricultural and horticultural sector. The costs of labour are also of great importance to the sector’s ability to grow. The Inquiry therefore makes the following proposals:</p>
<p>• That national decisions concerning taxes on the means of production should be based on an analysis of the impact on competitiveness. An analysis of this kind should be conducted within the framework of follow up of the Riksdag’s climate and energy policy decision of 2009.</p>
<p>• That employer and leadership training be offered to business operators in the agricultural and horticultural sector.</p>
<p>Animal welfare</p>
<p>Good animal welfare has strong support in Swedish society. However, Swedish livestock production has fallen dramatically in recent years. Consumers have increasingly chosen imported foods despite the fact that less stringent requirements concerning animal welfare may be in effect in the countries from which the import comes. The Inquiry considers that legislation is not the only way to accomplish good animal welfare. The Inquiry therefore makes the following proposals:</p>
<p>• That the Government push for tighter EU legislation and promote equal application of animal welfare legislation at EU level.</p>
<p>• That a review of animal welfare legislation be carried out, based on a balance between good animal welfare and competitiveness.</p>
<p>• That the Swedish Board of Agriculture be instructed to investigate the possibilities and consequences of removing the obligatory requirement concerning a preliminary examination for new construction, alterations or extensions of livestock buildings and fixtures and fittings for animals.</p>
<p>Plant health</p>
<p>The Inquiry notes that in some cases, Sweden has access to fewer pesticides of significance to production than other competitor countries. The Inquiry considers it important that Sweden use the opportunities for simplification that mutual recognition represents and, to a greater extent, accept the approval processes of other Member States. The Inquiry therefore makes the following proposals:</p>
<p>• That the Swedish Chemicals Agency be instructed to report on how processing of cases concerning the approval of pesticides can be simplified.</p>
<p>• Continued initiatives to ensure access to pesticides for crops cultivated on a small scale and for limited areas of use.</p>
<p>Permit applications</p>
<p>Under the Swedish Environmental Code, environmentally hazardous activities are required to have permits and provide notification. The Inquiry notes that the examination process is long and expensive. The Inquiry therefore makes the following proposals:</p>
<p>• That the Swedish Board of Agriculture, together with the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management, be instructed to produce a new guidance document for handling permits and notification of activities with livestock production.</p>
<p>• That the Government consider removing the requirement of consultation procedures for activities required to provide notification.</p>
<h2>Market opportunities</h2>
<p>To achieve the vision, better use must be made of market opportunities than at present. This requires a strategic and longterm effort in primary production and its associated stages.</p>
<p>Food industry and the marketing stage</p>
<p>The cost-effectiveness of the slaughterhouse industry has been deemed equivalent to comparable competitor countries. However, it is considered that the Swedish food industry could be better at obtaining maximum value from all product parts.</p>
<p>Companies in primary production currently have limited influence over the market for input products, the food industry and the marketing stage. One reason for this is that companies are often small, while there are actors with extensive market power in the rest of the chain. The Inquiry therefore makes the following proposals:</p>
<p>• That the Swedish Competition Authority be instructed to regularly analyse the market concentration of the food production chain.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>More exports are considered to be an important way forward for creating new market opportunities, including for obtaining revenues from all product parts. The Inquiry therefore makes the following proposals:</p>
<p>• That priority be given to efforts aimed at increasing the number of country approvals.</p>
<p>• That there are food attachés for markets of strategic importance.</p>
<p>• That skills development measures be introduced to facilitate exports for small and  medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p>Consumption and public procurement</p>
<p>The Swedish market is important to the competitiveness of primary production. Swedish consumers demand products that are reasonably priced and of high quality, but qualities such as origin, animal welfare and food safety are also important. The Inquiry proposes:</p>
<p>• That the Swedish Board of Agriculture and the National Food Administration be instructed to compile facts on Swedish food production.</p>
<p>In addition, the Inquiry particularly emphasises the following assessments:</p>
<p>• That municipalities, central government and county councils should make greater use of the Swedish Competition Authority’s procurement support.</p>
<p>• Public procurement should be used for seeking new solutions and thereby contribute to innovation.</p>
<p>• Product origin marking can help consumers and it is useful for market actors to develop a common national product origin marking system.</p>
<h2>Knowledge and innovation</h2>
<p>Being able to compete requires regularly acquiring new knowledge, innovation and updating of products, methods, processes and organisations. It places great demands on actors in research, advisory services, education, the business sector and development. It also places demands on the knowledge and innovation system. It must be attractive for private Swedish and foreign actors to invest time and money in research and development. Account of this should be taken in the next research and innovation bill.</p>
<p>Needs-driven research and priority areas</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that more public funds should be allocated to needs-driven research to strengthen competitiveness in the sector. Better production processes, entrepreneurship and market knowledge are examples of prioritised knowledge areas. The Inquiry therefore makes the following proposals:</p>
<p>• That the instructions of the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas) be amended so that, to a greater degree, the Council can help ensure that research contributes to increased competitiveness.</p>
<p>• That the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) be instructed to more clearly report on the share that goes to  needs-driven research and what needs are met by this research.</p>
<p>Increased private involvement, more collaboration, etc.</p>
<p>Private companies and industry organisations need to increase their involvement in the knowledge and innovation system and improve procurement skills. The institute sector needs to become stronger in the agricultural and horticultural sector. The Inquiry considers that greater strategic cooperation is needed among actors in the knowledge and innovation system. There needs to be more cooperation between the business sector, higher education institutions, institutes, advisory services and government agencies. The Inquiry proposes:</p>
<p>• That the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences be instructed to report the scope and effect of cooperation with the business sector, and also the tasks of the institutes.</p>
<p>• That the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, together with relevant business and public sector organisations, be instructed to produce a special programme for  industry-based doctoral students.</p>
<p>• That the Government engage the OECD to analyse the Swedish knowledge and innovation system in the agricultural and horticultural sector, including the future role of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences</p>
<p>Skills provision and advisory services</p>
<p>Companies providing advisory services play an important role in the knowledge system as a bridge between academia and the business sector. To strengthen competitiveness, the advisory services must function better. The Inquiry therefore makes the following proposals:</p>
<p>• That the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, together with Swedish and international experts, be instructed to analyse and present proposals on how higher education can strengthen skills provision for primary production.</p>
<p>In addition, the Inquiry emphasises the following assessments:</p>
<p>• Companies providing advisory services should develop skills in areas that are strategic to both expert knowledge and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>• Skills provision should be facilitated by improving the opportunities for admission to vocational higher education institutions, including for those changing profession.</p>
<p>• It is important that it is possible to combine natural resource use programmes at upper secondary schools with postsecondary studies, at the same time as practical knowledge remains important.</p>
<p>• It is important that there is a higher degree of national coordination of skills development and advisory measures in the Rural Development Programme.</p>
