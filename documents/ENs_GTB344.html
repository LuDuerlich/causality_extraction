<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Today, food safety reports from official controls are not published on a regular basis. The competent authorities themselves decide whether and how they want to publish results. A number of competent authorities have now started to publish results on their websites and several municipalities in Skåne have jointly drawn up a basis for coordinating a system for publication.</p>
<p>Commercial driving force</p>
<p>It may be seen from municipalities’ reports to the National Food Administration for 2003 that on average deviations from food legislation were noted in half the establishments inspected.</p>
<p>Food poisoning involves both considerable suffering for consumers and major costs to society. More people go down with food poisoning than may be seen from the number of reported cases. The National Food Administration estimates that there may be as many as 500 000 cases every year.</p>
<p>Food safety control results and the annual number of cases of food poisoning show that a tool needs to be introduced to raise the level of ambition of food business operators regarding food safety in the food chain.</p>
<p>Concern about getting a bad reputation has proved to have influenced some food business operators to invest in good food handling. The level of ambition would be even higher if a possibility were introduced of making the companies that receive a positive overall control result visible to consumers and other interested parties, that is to say a commercial incentive for food business operators to fulfil the requirements of food legislation to a greater extent.</p>
<p>Official control requirements</p>
<p>The National Food Administration currently recommends that each establishment should be controlled once a year. It has proved that all establishments are not controlled at yearly intervals.</p>
<p>In future, official controls must be based on risks and carried out regularly and as often as appropriate with reference to the risks defined, previous control records, the reliability of food business operators’ own checks and information indicating non-compliance with legislation.</p>
<p>A model for classification of risks has been drawn up by a working group at the National Food Administration. According to this model, food business operators are placed in groups for frequency of controls following an assessment of the risks the business operations constitute if they are not inspected and the authority’s experience of the company. This means frequency of controls may vary for different businesses even though their operations are considered to involve the same risks.</p>
<p>Regular publication of results will make demands on authorities to adhere to the frequency of controls decided and to carry out consistent controls.</p>
<p>Making controls visible</p>
<p>For authorities, publication of reports of official controls offers an opportunity to make their work visible. It should be clear from the control report when the control was carried out, on whose initiative and the areas that were controlled.</p>
<p>Consumers and other interested parties will, more simply than is the case today, be able to see whether or not food business operators and authorities fulfil the requirements set out in legislation. This will inspire confidence in the work of the competent authorities and also in food business operators.</p>
<p>Consumers want to know</p>
<p>Consumers are entitled to information about food. A study carried out in Los Angeles, California shows revenue increased for companies that had received a good control result.</p>
<p>In consumer surveys carried out by the committee, 78 per cent of those asked replied that they would like the help of symbols for choosing restaurants or food stores. Thus, surveys show that consumers demand and use official control reports when choosing food business operators.</p>
<p>Access to information</p>
<p>An official control report is an official document when it has been completed and delivered. Today, the principle of public access to official documents already requires authorities to make control results available to the general public unless the Act on Secrecy applies.</p>
<p>Under a new Regulation (EC) 882/2004 laying down rules on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules, the competent authorities must guarantee a high degree of transparency in their activities. Relevant information must be made available to the general public as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The aim of the 24/7 agencies is that the public shall have access to more open administration in which service can be provided irrespective of office hours and geographic location.</p>
<p>The publication of the reports from official controls of food will enable the general public to easily and rapidly gain access to official documents.</p>
<p>Proposals for publication systems</p>
<p>The official control reports must be regularly published whether or not businesses sell directly to the final consumer or to other companies. The names of food business operators and their official control reports will be published on the Internet without consent following a statutory amendment clarifying that the Personal Data Act is not applicable to this information.</p>
<p>The result will be compiled in a comprehensive inspection report. The overall assessment will be divided into three levels. They are “no deviations”, “a few minor deviations” and “several minor deviations or one or more serious deviation”. The official control report will contain the results of the three latest controls.</p>
<p>For food business operators who sell directly to consumers, a sticker with a symbol will be used for the respective overall assessment. For other companies, the figures I, II or III will be used.</p>
<p>A food business operator who sells directly to consumers will be under obligation to post the comprehensive report immediately after receiving it in a place that is visible to consumers near the entrance to the premises. The sticker must be affixed to the comprehensive report and on the entrance to the establishment or on a window near the entrance. A food business operator who sells his goods via the Internet must publish the report on his website. Anyone who deliberately or through negligence breaches this obligation will be sentenced to a fine.</p>
<p>The comprehensive control report to be posted at the establishment must be signed by the inspector and by the food supplier. The inspector will make a note of whether and, if so, when the food business operator voluntarily undertakes to remedy deficiencies.</p>
<p>An operator will have an opportunity to comment on the comprehensive control report by filling in a box concerning whether he agrees or disagrees with the assessment, whether faults will be immediately remedied, or other matters. A form will also be available at the competent authority, which the supplier can use for more detailed comments.</p>
<p>The competent authority will publish the comprehensive report with the additional results from the three latest controls on its website. At the request of a food business operator, the authority will also publish the form for further comments on its website.</p>
<p>After a normal control activity, a food business operator may order an extra official control. When a few minor deviations, several minor deviations or at least one serious deviation have been noted, a food business operator is entitled to a control within a week of the date on which the authority received a request for control and the deficiencies claimed to have been remedied.</p>
<p>A food business operator may also order an extra official control without a previous normal control activity. A control of this nature must be carried out within four months of the date on which the request was received by the competent authority. In the case of a change of owner, a food business operator is entitled to a control within a month from the date on which notification of change of owner was received by the competent authority.</p>
<p>A food business operator will not be obliged to publish the latest official control report if the competent authority does not carry out an extra official control within the appointed time. In that case, the latest comprehensive report and additional information from the latest control will not be published on the authority’s website either.</p>
<p>The frequency of controls of a company will be decided according to the risk assessment. This assessment must not be influenced by the fact that the results will be published. On the other hand, the right to an extra official control may mean more frequent controls.</p>
<p>Gradual introduction</p>
<p>Competent authorities, consumers and other interested parties all use computers to a great extent today. Publication of control results on the Internet and access for the majority of the general public to the results there will probably not involve any technical difficulties or major costs.</p>
<p>Regular publication of official control reports will involve new tasks for the competent authorities. Among other things, the right to request an extra official control will demand increased resources or that controls become more effective.</p>
<p>However, as a result of the use of the computer-based inspection model, check lists and instructions, the administrative burden on both authorities and companies is lessening. A recent law amendment concerning opportunities for cooperation across municipal boundaries may also mean that controls become more effective. Food safety training and authorities’ entitlement in future to full coverage of costs for controls provide actual and economic possibilities of recruiting new food safety inspectors to cover any needs.</p>
<p>A compilation of several municipalities’ inspection projects in 2004 shows that more than half of companies received the overall result “failed” in connection with their first inspection. There is a danger that the intended commercial effect will not be produced if a system is introduced that means more than half of companies publish a negative result.</p>
<p>Consumers’ options will be limited and for that reason businesses will not be affected as much as would be the case if the</p>
<p>results were more evenly divided in the overall assessments. There is also a risk that confidence in certain parts of the food industry will be undermined and the controls considered too detailed.</p>
<p>Authorities, food business operators and consumers must be informed about the system and be given an opportunity to prepare themselves. The system for regular publication of control results must therefore be introduced gradually.</p>
<p>When results of the controls are published, consistent control is essential. For businesses where centrally produced check lists and instructions are available, it should be possible to apply the provisions from a specific date and for other business from a later date. In order to be able to grant authorities full coverage of costs for official controls, the provisions may enter into force on 1 January 2007 at the earliest.</p>
