<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s general remit is to implement the changes in national regulations that follow from the Tobacco Products Directive (Directive 2014/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 April 2014 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products and repealing Directive 2001/37/EC).</p>
<p>In addition to this, the Inquiry has instructions to consider a number of specific questions. The Inquiry is to analyse and, if necessary, submit proposals on appropriate national regulations for snus  (moist snuff) and chewing tobacco, as well as proposed regulations on the content of snus . The Inquiry is also to study and, if necessary, submit proposals for limiting the smoking of tobaccorelated products, such as electronic cigarettes and herbal products for smoking, in certain premises and spaces and certain outdoor areas, as is done in the case of tobacco smoke; to consider the advantages and disadvantages of introducing a permit requirement for selling tobacco; and, finally, to submit proposals on the national implementation of the WHO Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products.</p>
<p>In this interim report, the Inquiry proposes amendments to the Tobacco Act and the Tobacco Ordinance to implement the Tobacco Products Directive. However, proposed provisions on security features and tracking and tracing will not be presented until the final report.</p>
<h2>Prohibition of certain additives and characterising flavours</h2>
<p>New provisions will be introduced to regulate the contents of tobacco products. Cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco with characterising flavours will not be allowed to be sold to consumers. With the exception of snus  for oral use, tobacco products may not contain additives that are not necessary in manufacturing the tobacco product. The Public Health Agency of Sweden will determine which cigarettes and which roll-your-own tobacco are to be regarded as having a characterising flavour and which additives are to be prohibited in tobacco products. The Public Health Agency of Sweden will also be the supervisory authority, with the power to issue the orders and prohibitions required to ensure compliance with the provisions. Such orders or prohibitions may be combined with a conditional financial penalty.</p>
<h2>Health warnings and product presentation</h2>
<p>The Tobacco Products Directive contains tougher requirements for health warnings on tobacco packets than is currently the case. The warnings are to increase in size relative to the surface area of the packet, and certain tobacco products for smoking – cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco and waterpipe tobacco – are to carry combined health warnings, i.e. a combination of a text and a picture. The Commission has produced a library of texts and images that are now being rolled out. The design of health warnings was previously regulated by the Public Health Agency of Sweden. The Inquiry considers that it would be more appropriate in future to regulate this matter in an ordinance. Tobacco products for smoking other than cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco and waterpipe tobacco will be exempt from the requirement concerning information texts and combined health warnings. The Public Health Agency of Sweden and the municipalities should continue to be responsible for supervision of health warnings and should also exercise supervision of combined health warnings.</p>
<p>In view of the new rules on health warnings and the fact that the Directive prohibits the presentation of information about the tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide content of cigarettes, the provisions of the Tobacco Act and the Tobacco Ordinance on declaration of contents must be repealed.</p>
<p>Neither the labelling of tobacco product packets nor the tobacco product itself will be allowed to refer to taste, smell, flavourings or other additives.</p>
<p>Cigarettes for sale to consumers will not be allowed to be offered for sale in the form of individual cigarettes or in unit packets of less than 20 cigarettes. Roll-your-own tobacco, i.e. tobacco that can be used to make cigarettes, that is for sale to consumers will not be allowed to be offered for sale in unit packets containing tobacco weighing less than 30 grams.</p>
<h2>Herbal products for smoking</h2>
<p>Rules on herbal products for smoking that do not contain tobacco will be introduced in the Tobacco Act and the Tobacco Ordinance. Manufacturers and importers of such products will be required to place a health warning on the packet. Herbal products for smoking that do not carry a health warning, or that carry a health warning that is obviously incorrect, will not be allowed to be offered commercially to consumers in Sweden. The provisions of the Tobacco Act on product presentation of tobacco products will also apply to herbal products for smoking, in so far as this is required by the Tobacco Products Directive.</p>
<p>Herbal products for smoking will be supervised in the same way as tobacco products. This means that the municipalities will be responsible for direct supervision, while the Public Health Agency of Sweden will be responsible for supervision at central level.</p>
<h2>Increased requirements for emission measurements and the submission and making available of information</h2>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Sweden will have the authority to issue regulations on the obligation of manufacturers and importers to submit information about the ingredients and their quantities and health effects to the Agency, and to analyse additives in cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco and report the results of these analyses to the Agency.</p>
<p>Manufacturers and importers of novel tobacco products will be obliged to notify the Public Health Agency of Sweden of any tobacco product that they intend to place on the national market.</p>
<p>The Agency should be responsible for more detailed regulations on the form and contents of this notification. Supervision of the obligation to submit notification should be exercised by the Public Health Agency of Sweden, the municipalities and the Swedish Police Authority. There is no need at present to introduce a system for the approval of novel tobacco products.</p>
<p>Manufacturers and importers of tobacco products will be required to submit internal and external studies available to them on market research and preferences of various consumer groups, including young people and current smokers, relating to ingredients and emissions, as well as executive summaries of any market surveys they carry out when launching new products. This information must be submitted to the Public Health Agency of Sweden by 31 January each year. Furthermore, by the same date, manufacturers and importers will be required to report to the Agency their sales volumes for tobacco products in the immediately preceding calendar year. The Public Health Agency of Sweden will be the supervisory authority for the new reporting obligation.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Sweden will arrange to publish the reported ingredients and results of analyses of additives in cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco, as well as information on emissions, on a website. The Agency will also be responsible for ensuring that the information that manufacturers and importers report to it is stored electronically and made available to the Commission and the Member States.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and consequences</h2>
<p>The amendments to the legislation will come into force on 20 May 2016. Any additional costs arising for the Public Health Agency of Sweden from the expanded regulation of flavours and additives and the increased measurements can be financed by fees. Even if some of the proposals may initially entail extra work for the Agency, in the longer run it should be possible to finance these activities in this way. The proposals are expected to have only marginal consequences for other supervisory authorities. Consequently, no need for additional resources is foreseen.</p>
