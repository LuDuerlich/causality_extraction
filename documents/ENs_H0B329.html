<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Sweden’s present emergency management system is well organised to receive international assistance in the event of emergencies and other serious peacetime incidents. There is room for improvement in some areas. The Inquiry presents a number of proposals on ways in which Sweden’s ability to receive international assistance can be strengthened.</p>
<p>Analysing area by area, the Inquiry has found few real obstacles to receiving international assistance. In many cases it is more a matter of actors needing a more thorough knowledge of Swedish society, the emergency preparedness system and applicable legal regulations.</p>
<p>Responses by relevant government agencies and other actors to the Inquiry’s questions show that they have only pointed out a few structural and legal obstacles to Sweden’s ability to receive international assistance in the event of an emergency or other serious incident.</p>
<p>In many areas, actors at central, regional and local level now engage in international cooperation on a daily basis. However, the Inquiry’s remit refers not to everyday cooperation but to the assistance that may be needed in the types of emergency or other serious incident described in the examples given in the terms of reference, which occur rarely and demand substantial resources.</p>
<p>In January 2012, the EU adopted guidelines for host nation support. While not binding, the guidelines are intended to be seen as a supportive tool for EU Member States. The Inquiry’s proposals are in line with the EU guidelines.</p>
<h2>Receiving international assistance requires preparation</h2>
<p>The question of Sweden’s ability to receive international assistance was raised following Hurricane Katrina in the United States and the storm Gudrun in Sweden in 2005. These events made it clear that well-developed countries could also experience a shortfall of national resources and skills in connection with an emergency or other serious incident. As demonstrated by these experiences, to be able to receive international assistance effectively requires thorough preparation before an emergency or other serious incident occurs. Systems that are not prepared in advance are unlikely to work.</p>
<h2>Proposals for strengthening Sweden’s ability to receive international assistance Initiative to enhance skills in the area</h2>
<p>Sweden’s ability to receive international assistance can be impeded by inadequate knowledge of Swedish society, the emergency preparedness system and legal regulations.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) be instructed to conduct an extra skills development drive to enhance the level of knowledge and capability in the area over the next few years. In addition, existing relevant training programmes run by actors in the emergency preparedness system should be supplemented with modules on receiving international assistance in an emergency or other serious peacetime incident.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes  that an exercise should be carried out at regional and central level, say in spring 2014, to strengthen</p>
<p>Sweden’s ability to receive international assistance.</p>
<h2>Expert support for actors in an emergency or other serious incident</h2>
<p>Receiving international assistance requires special knowledge, which, for various reasons, not all actors can have. To prevent this becoming an obstacle, these actors need access to expert support in an emergency or other serious incident.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that the MSB, in collaboration with other relevant agencies, should develop such a function.</p>
<h2>Designated points of entry and exit for incoming international assistance</h2>
<p>To avoid delays in receiving international assistance, points of entry and exit must be designated in advance.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that the MSB, in collaboration with the county administrative boards, the Swedish Armed Forces, the LFV Group, the Swedish Transport Agency, Swedish Customs and other relevant agencies, should be tasked with drawing up a list, which will subsequently be updated each year, showing potential entry and exit points for the various modes of transport. This task should include ensuring means of manning these locations with additional staff who are trained and practised, and drawing up a manual covering the tasks that an entry and exit point should be able to manage.</p>
<h2>Identification of possible reception centres</h2>
<p>To avoid delays in receiving international assistance, reception centres must be specified in advance.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that the MSB, in collaboration with county administrative boards and relevant central agencies, be tasked with identifying sites in their county or area at which reception centres could be established.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that the MSB, in collaboration with Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions and other relevant agencies, be tasked with developing a staffing plan and a manual covering the functions and tasks that a reception centre should be able to manage and the capacity that may be required.</p>
<h2>Logistics and transport strategy</h2>
<p>To prevent difficulties in receiving international assistance, a strategy is needed for logistics and transport.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that the MSB, in collaboration with the agencies in the Cooperation Area Transportation (CAT) and other relevant actors, be tasked with producing a strategy for logistics and transport solutions in accordance with the EU Host Nation Support Guidelines.</p>
<h2>Ensuring communications between actors managing emergencies and international relief teams</h2>
<p>Effective communication between the actor managing the emergency and the incoming international relief teams is important to enable effective emergency management.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that incoming international relief teams should, if necessary, be supplied with Rakel equipment to ensure communications with the actor managing the emergency. The MSB should be instructed to draft guidelines for implementing this.</p>
<h2>Reserve staff for some functions</h2>
<p>Reserve staff need to be available for some functions involved in receiving international assistance.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that the MSB – in collaboration with other relevant agencies – be instructed to consider how the staff groups in the Agency’s staffing pool can be used to man functions and activities in connection with Sweden receiving international assistance.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that the MSB should be instructed, in collaboration with relevant agencies and NGOs, to consider the role and responsibility of NGOs in connection with Sweden receiving international assistance in the event of an emergency or other serious incident.</p>
<h2>Increased staying power in central staff functions</h2>
<p>Actors in central staff functions often have limited staying power, which can impair the ability to manage an emergency effectively over an extended period. When receiving international assistance, an emergency or other serious incident can require continuous management for a long time. Moreover, in the initial phase of an emergency or other serious incident there is a risk that a request for international assistance will be made too late because of inadequate central staff resources.</p>
<p>The Inquiry would like to particularly emphasise the importance of relevant actors involved in managing an emergency and if necessary reinforcing one another’s central staff functions. Certain actors also have an obligation to collaborate and to support one another under special provisions.</p>
<h2>National resource overview through collaboration conferences</h2>
<p>An actor must be able to quickly obtain a knowledge and overview of available national resources. If this take too long it can impede and delay a request for international assistance. The Inquiry would like to emphasise that it is important that the MSB – in collaboration with other relevant agencies – continues to use collaboration conferences as a tool for quickly obtaining an overview of available national resources.</p>
<h2>Division of roles and responsibilities</h2>
<p>Creating a uniform model for requesting international assistance is not a workable approach. A range of sectors and organisations have channels for requesting international assistance in the event of a situation arising in which all Swedish resources are exhausted. A request for international assistance can come from virtually any actor in the Swedish emergency preparedness system. Effective management and priority-setting for incoming international assistance requires a coherent picture of the national situation. The lack of such a picture of the national situation may impede effective reception of international assistance.</p>
<p>It is important that relevant actors work together and that they report as required by the Emergency Management and Heightened Alert Ordinance (2006:942) and the Act on Municipal and County Council Measures prior to and during Extraordinary Events in Peacetime and during Periods of Heightened Alert (2006:544). A coherent picture of the national situation regarding requests for international assistance is fully possible under the current legislation.</p>
<h2>Mass media and communications</h2>
<p>The EU guidelines emphasise the importance of drawing up a media and communications plan in advance, addressing situations and issues associated with a country receiving international assistance. In an emergency or other serious incident, media and communications issues are a major component of actual emergency management. An emergency or other serious incident in Sweden would attract a great deal of interest from international mass media.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes , given this situation, that the MSB, in collaboration with relevant agencies, develop a strategy for preparatory purposes so as to be able if necessary to quickly produce a communication plan when Sweden receives international assistance in an emergency or other serious peacetime incident.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that the MSB should – in collaboration with other relevant agencies – be tasked with ensuring that information in Swedish can quickly be translated to English in the event of an emergency or other serious incident.</p>
<h2>Funding is no real obstacle</h2>
<p>Having examined the area, the Inquiry’s assessment is that the issue of financing should not be a real obstacle in the event of a emergency or other serious incident in Sweden that is comparable to the emergencies described in the terms of reference. A number of possible financing solutions are available and should be sufficient.</p>
<p>However, an actor should not always be able to count on central government solving the issue of financing. In the long term this could weaken the principle of responsibility and reduce the will to take preventive measures. This could erode the ability of Swedish society to manage emergencies and other serious incidents when they arise. At the same time, the financing system must be clear enough not to delay decisions and make effective emergency management more difficult.</p>
<h2>Analysis of legal areas identified</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has identified the following legal areas for further analysis.  Access for international assistance  Residence permits and work permits  Requirements for bringing in goods  Liability issues   Approval of doctors with foreign training</p>
<p>In brief, it can be stated that the Inquiry has found few substantial legal obstacles in the legal areas identified. What is meant by legal obstacles here is an absence of legal conditions enabling international assistance to be received effectively. However, in practice a legal obstacle does not necessarily mean a genuine obstacle to</p>
<p>Sweden’s ability to receive international assistance.</p>
<h2>Relief personnel should be exempted from visa requirements</h2>
<p>International relief operations in the situations that the Inquiry has to consider often need to be undertaken at short notice, which may mean that the personnel involved do not have time to obtain necessary travel documents such as passports and visas. In the Inquiry’s assessment, existing regulations on passport and visa requirements do not prevent foreign citizens participating in relief operations in crises or other serious peacetime incidents.</p>
<p>In many cases, it can be assumed that international assistance will come from another Nordic country or a Schengen country, which means that the people concerned will not need a passport or visa to enter or stay in Sweden. It is also legally possible to grant an entry permit to a person without a passport. If a visa is required an ‘emergency visa’ can be issued at the external borders.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes , however, that foreign relief personnel in disasters and accidents should be exempted from visa requirements. There should be a general exemption of this kind to make it easier for foreign personnel to enter Sweden in such situations.</p>
<h2>Permit requirement under the Admission Ordinance is not an obstacle</h2>
<p>Granting permits under the Ordinance concerning the Admission to Swedish Territory of Foreign State Vessels and State Aircraft (Admission Ordinance) can be a complex process involving many actors. It therefore inevitably takes some time to process applications. However, in the situations that the Inquiry has to consider it will probably be possible to reach a decision on matters quickly. The Inquiry therefore does not consider that the permit requirement risks preventing international assistance in the event of an emergency or other serious peacetime incident.</p>
<h2>Relief personnel should be exempted from work permit requirements</h2>
<p>The existing regulations concerning requirements for residence permits and work permits do not affect Sweden’s ability to receive international assistance.</p>
<p>Citizens from other Nordic or EU countries do not need a residence permit or work permit to stay and work in Sweden. Citizens from other countries may stay in Sweden for at most three months without a residence permit.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes , however, that relief personnel should have a general exemption from the requirement for a work permit. Persons needing a work permit in order to be entitled to work in Sweden must have such a permit from the first day they work. To ensure that this does not delay or hinder action by relief personnel, there is reason to enact a general exemption for relief personnel working on a temporary basis in Sweden during an emergency or other serious peacetime incident.</p>
<p>According to the rules, applications for residence permits and work permits must be made before entering Sweden. However, it is legally possible to allow exemptions from this requirement in the event of an emergency or other serious peacetime incident.</p>
<h2>Customs clearance procedures for third country imports need to be revised</h2>
<p>Conditions should allow goods to reach the relief location in time, without being held up at the border by time-consuming customs procedures or import restrictions.</p>
<p>As a general rule, free movement for goods applies in the EU. In normal cases there are no border controls between Member States or customs duties for Community goods in the common market. Some categories of goods, however, are subject to import restrictions and must be reported to the Swedish Customs at the border. Nonetheless, in most cases goods from other EU countries can enter Sweden without being stopped at the border for customs clearance.</p>
<p>In the situations that the Inquiry has to consider, the provisions on temporary imports allow for duty and tax free import from third countries of equipment that can be returned in existing condition. It is also legally possible to import equipment, basic supplies, goods for disaster victims, etc. duty free from third countries. Sweden can also apply to the Commission for permission to introduce a special exemption from customs duties when entering into an international agreement on customs relief with a third country.</p>
<p>Non-Community goods from a third country have to be cleared at the border, which can delay the import of these goods.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that the Swedish Customs be instructed, in collaboration with other relevant agencies, to look over customs clearance procedures for imports of goods from third countries in connection with emergencies or other serious peacetime incidents, including the possibilities of simplifying and minimising requirements for documentation and controls concerning such imports.</p>
<p>Certain types of goods are covered by import restrictions, which means that their import into Sweden is prohibited or conditional on obtaining a permit or licence from a responsible authority. The Inquiry has briefly described and analysed the regulations in the following areas.  Flammable and explosive goods  Injection syringes and needles  Pharmaceuticals  Working dogs  Weapons and certain other dangerous objects</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s assessment in all these areas is that the requirements set for obtaining an import permit – for various reasons – do not pose a major obstacle to Sweden’s ability to receive international assistance in the event of an emergency or other serious peacetime incident.</p>
<h2>Liability issues</h2>
<p>Under the Civil Protection Act and the Act on liability for damages in international military cooperation and international crisis management, the Swedish state has rather extensive liability for compensation in the event of damages connected with the types of measures concerned here. However, certain types of damage fall outside the scope of state liability under those acts. This includes damage that arises without any connection with the operations and – in the case of operations other than rescue operations – injuries sustained by relief personnel in connection with relief operations. There may be reason to consider the consequences that the state’s limited liability for damages might have for Swedish citizens receiving international assistance in the event of an emergency or other serious incident and whether there might consequently be reason to extend the state’s liability.</p>
<p>Patients receiving care from foreign health and medical services staff authorised to practise in Sweden are covered by Swedish patient insurance. This means that a patient receiving care from a foreign doctor authorised to practise in Sweden in connection with a relief operation is entitled to request compensation from the patient insurance system.</p>
<p>Within the framework of international emergency management, motor vehicles belonging to a foreign state and not registered in Sweden may be brought into the country and used in traffic without Swedish road traffic insurance. The state is liable to pay the compensation for traffic injuries that would have been payable if the vehicles had been insured.</p>
<h2>Special appointments can give doctors trained in other countries the right to practise in Sweden</h2>
<p>It is legally possible to authorise a doctor who has trained in another country to practise in Sweden using the mechanism of a ‘special appointment’. In light of this, the authorisation required in order to practise as a doctor in Sweden is not a substantial obstacle to receiving international assistance in the form of doctors trained in other countries.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that the National Board of Health and Welfare be authorised to issue regulations on the use of special appointments to authorise doctors to practise in Sweden in the event of an emergency or other serious peacetime incident.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes  that the National Board of Health and Welfare should investigate the possibility of approving the qualifications of foreign health and medical services personnel in connection with the request for assistance.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has not been able to analyse the conditions – in every relevant sector – for giving relief personnel the authorisation required in the event of an emergency or other serious incident. Instead, this task may be considered to belong with the preparations to create an ability to manage a crisis for which certain agencies are specially responsible under the Emergency Management and Heightened Alert Ordinance.</p>
<h2>Work on identifying and removing obstacles should continue</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has focused on general and cross-sectoral structural and legal obstacles to strengthening Sweden’s ability to receive international assistance. There has not been time to identify and analyse potential obstacles in every single sector. To further strengthen</p>
<p>Sweden’s ability to receive international assistance it is important that the work on identifying and removing obstacles continues. Actors at regional and central level should therefore be enabled to continuously review the situation in their own area to identify any structural, legal or other obstacles to Sweden’s ability to receive international assistance. One means of doing this is to use risk and vulnerability analyses.</p>
