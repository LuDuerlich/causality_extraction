<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Government decided on 30 October 2008 to appoint an Inquiry Chair with a remit to analyse, in view of ongoing development in the area of vaccines, what measures may need to be taken with regard to regulations, decision-making processes, decisionmaking criteria, forms of funding and follow-up systems for vaccinations offered and reimbursed by society. Such vaccinations may, for example, form part of the public childhood vaccination programme or be reimbursed under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, i.e. through prescriptions dispensed in pharmacies. With regard to criteria for vaccination programmes, the Inquiry is to consider in particular whether there is a need to improve the usability of health-economic analyses as a basis for decisions in the area of vaccines.</p>
<p>The Inquiry is to identify changes in the world at large which have taken place or are in progress in the area of vaccination and assess how these affect the national vaccination programmes and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. In addition, a number of other issues linked to vaccination programmes are to be elucidated, such as information provided to individuals, the relationship between vaccination programmes and pharmaceutical benefits, funding issues and overall responsibility for vaccinations given in vaccination programmes. In the part relating to follow-up and evaluation of vaccinations, the Inquiry Chair is to consider whether a vaccination register under the Health Data Registers Act should be introduced.</p>
<h2>Vaccines</h2>
<p>The term vaccines is used below to mean medicinal products for human use which prevent infectious diseases by inducing endogenous production of antibodies or other protective mechanisms (‘active immunisation’). A closer definition of such vaccines is contained in the European Pharmacopoeia, which has been compiled in accordance with the Council of Europe’s Convention on the Elaboration of a European Pharmacopoeia from 1975.</p>
<h2>Current situation Terminology and regulation of vaccination programmes</h2>
<p>The term public vaccination programme  is generally used to mean the childhood  vaccination programme. This is intended for the whole population by being offered to all citizens in childhood according to a specified schedule. The childhood vaccination programme is now based on the National Board of Health and Welfare regulations  and therefore has to be followed by the care providers.</p>
<p>The term  targeted vaccination programmes usually means vaccinations offered to individuals who have what are known as highrisk diseases, for example cardiovascular diseases, diabetes etc. These vaccination programmes are not specified in regulations but are based on  recommendations from the National Board of Health and Welfare. Such recommendations have been issued, for instance, for influenza, pneumococcal infections, tuberculosis, diphtheria and tetanus. Recommendations issued by an authority, in contrast to regulations, do not require any statutory authorisation, and compliance with them by care providers is voluntary.</p>
<p>The term  national vaccination programmes appears to be used as a collective designation for the childhood vaccination programme and the targeted vaccination programmes which are offered both to children and to adults in groups at risk.</p>
<p>The National Board of Health and Welfare is the central government administrative and supervisory agency for activities relating to health care and social services. The right of the National Board of Health and Welfare to issue regulations on vaccinations binding on the health care system is based on the powers granted to it under the Communicable Diseases Act and the</p>
<p>Communicable Diseases Ordinance. These powers are kept very general in both statutory instruments and signify that the Government or, on the authority of the Government, the National Board of Health and Welfare, may issue “the further regulations required for appropriate protection against communicable diseases and for the protection of individuals”.</p>
<p>The currently applicable childhood vaccination programme is shown in Table 1.</p>
<p>Table 1 The Swedish childhood vaccination programme in spring 2010 * Haemophilus influenzae type b ** Human papillomavirus</p>
<p>The most recently added vaccinations relate to vaccination against pneumococcal infection, applicable from 1 January 2009, and against human papillomavirus (HPV), which is due to begin in 2010.</p>
<p>The National Board of Health and Welfare continuously monitors the development of the vaccines market and examines whether a vaccine should be included in the childhood vaccination programme, and if so at what age and how many doses are to be given. The examination takes place on the basis of a number of grounds of assessment or criteria. The following factors are valued prior to decisions on vaccination regulations: 1. The burden of the disease the vaccine is intended to protect against. Both the number of cases of disease and the seriousness of the disease in individual cases are assessed. 2. Risks and gains associated with the vaccination, for example how effective the vaccine is. 3. Any risks or gains for persons other than the target group for vaccination. 4. Public acceptance of the vaccine. 5. The risk of  side-effects, which must be weighed up against the threat of disease. 6. The relationship to existing vaccination programmes as a new vaccine may affect the efficacy of those used previously. 7. Environmental impact. 8. Financial aspects, i.e. the cost of the vaccination in relation to the gains from reduced disease burden.</p>
<p>According to the National Board of Health and Welfare the factors indicated should be valued in a weighted assessment  as they may affect one another. The systematic approach to assessment has been devised by the National Board of Health and Welfare and is not governed by statutory instrument, even in the agency’s own internal provisions.</p>
<p>Government agencies other than the National Board of Health and Welfare also have important roles to play in connection with vaccination programmes. The Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control  (SMI) is the national expert agency in the area of protection against communicable diseases. Its principal task is to monitor the epidemiological situation with regard to communicable diseases among humans and to promote protection against such diseases. SMI is also required to follow and analyse the immunity situation in selected population groups after vaccination programmes have been carried out and propose vaccinations.</p>
<p>The Medical Products Agency  is responsible for the approval and control of medicinal products, natural remedies and medical devices. When a medicinal product has been approved, the Medical Products Agency has important key tasks in safety surveillance, among other areas.</p>
<h2>Vaccines under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme</h2>
<p>The costs of medicinal products and certain other products are reimbursed in Sweden under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme . It has also been possible for the cost of vaccines to be reimbursed under the scheme since 2002 if they fulfil the statutory requirements laid down for such reimbursement. This reimbursement entails the individual paying a patient cost, on a reducing scale for each repeat prescription over a twelve-month period. The maximum charge over the period is SEK 1 800.</p>
<p>The Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency prepares cases relating to pharmaceutical benefits etc. on application from anyone who markets a medicinal product. Decisions are taken by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Board. For reimbursement to be possible, it is required that 1. the costs of use of the medicinal product, having regard to the provisions of Section 2 of the Health and Medical Services Act, appear reasonable on the basis of  medical, humanitarian  and economic  principles and 2. that there are no other available medicinal products or methods of treatment which are found to be significantly more suitable for the purpose.</p>
<p>Three cases concerning pharmaceutical benefits for vaccines have been considered to date, of which two relate to HPV vaccines and one relates to vaccine against rotavirus infection. Both the HPV vaccines are included in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The application relating to rotavirus vaccine was rejected.</p>
<p>There are important differences between vaccines given under vaccination programmes and vaccines funded from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The latter must be prescribed by a doctor. The vaccine then has to be collected from a pharmacy by the individual and kept at a carefully controlled refrigerator temperature at home. It may otherwise be destroyed. The vaccination must be carried out by qualified medical personnel at a health care centre or other medical facility. In addition there is the patient cost, which can amount to a maximum of SEK 1 800, and costs of visits to doctors and to health care centres.</p>
<p>Vaccines offered for example in the childhood vaccination programme are not dispensed on prescription. They are prescribed directly by the nurse who carries out the vaccination and are free of charge for the individual.</p>
<h2>Childhood vaccination activity</h2>
<p>The county councils  are responsible for health care in their area in Sweden. Like the municipalities, the county councils are governed by elected political assemblies. The municipalities  are responsible for most other community services provided locally, for example schools, social care for the elderly and disabled, municipal cleansing, emergency services, supply of housing etc.</p>
<p>Childhood vaccinations, according to National Board of Health and Welfare regulations, are given in the county councils’ child health care service and at school. The tasks of the child health care service, which is aimed at pre-school age children, are principally performed in child health care centres (BVC). The school health service is operated by school nurses and school doctors under the responsibility of the municipalities for school health care laid down in the Schools Act. This activity forms an integral part of municipal school administration and in practice is undertaken in the schools. Vaccination activity in the child and school health service is more precisely defined in the National Board of Health and Welfare’s regulations on childhood vaccinations.</p>
<h2>New vaccines</h2>
<p>Several new vaccines have been introduced onto the market in the past ten years. It is characteristic of these that they are not, like previous vaccines, intended to control widespread, severe childhood or common diseases such as measles, smallpox or polio. The distinctive feature of the new vaccines is instead that they counteract either</p>
<p>• severe diseases with few cases or</p>
<p>• diseases which are rarely severe but which affect large numbers of people.</p>
<p>Vaccine against pneumococcal infection is an example of a vaccine against a severe infection which affects fewer than 100 children annually in Sweden. The vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV) can be classified in the same category.</p>
<p>Vaccinations against shingles and rotavirus are examples of vaccines against diseases which affect many people, but which are generally uncomplicated and virtually never prove fatal or lead to severe persistent complications. The new vaccines are therefore not obvious cases for introduction into public vaccination programmes in the same way as the older ones. The new vaccines are also substantially more expensive than the older ones. This in any case applies, as for medicinal products in general, to the first few years following introduction.</p>
<p>No “wave” of new vaccines can be expected in the short or medium terms. This in any case applies to vaccines which may become relevant for introduction into European vaccination programmes. Extensive research is in progress in the area of vaccines and research breakthr0ughs can occur rapidly. However, there is a high failure rate in clinical testing of vaccines. It is therefore very difficult to assess how the development of vaccines will proceed in the future.</p>
<h2>The vaccine market</h2>
<p>The vaccine market is highly concentrated and is dominated by two large manufacturers. Another three manufacturers each have market shares of between 5 and 16 per cent of the world market. The barriers to entry are significant, with high investment costs for production facilities. Clinical studies are conducted in substantially larger populations and take longer than for medicinal products in general. The structure of the vaccines market can therefore be expected to persist. It should also be noted that the vaccine market exhibits several known risk factors for the formation of cartels. Attention should be paid to the risk of tendering cartels  in particular in the procurement of vaccines.</p>
<p>Research, development and manufacturing take place principally in Europe and the United States. There are vaccine manufacturers in Asia, but they are not expected to be able to offer any competition on the European market in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The individual product markets  for vaccines are more concentrated than the market at large. With the exception of the market for influenza vaccine, there are rarely more than two competing vaccines to choose between. In several cases there is only one vaccine on the market. This applies for example to Hib vaccine, which is included in the childhood vaccination programme.</p>
<p>The vaccines used in the childhood vaccination programme, or given following National Board of Health and Welfare recommendations, not sold through pharmacies. They are procured directly by county councils and municipalities from the manufacturers and are distributed through wholesalers, for example SBL Vaccines.</p>
<p>Vaccines which are issued on prescription and which are included in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme are distributed by the pharmacies and dispensed on prescription. A sale price of just over SEK 1 100 per dose applies to the two vaccines now included in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The same type of vaccine is included in the childhood vaccination programme and has been procured for the needs of the whole country for this purpose at a preliminary price of around SEK 200 per dose. However, an appeal has been lodged against this procurement.</p>
<p>There are no combined statistics on actual  prices and volumes for vaccines used in the childhood vaccination programme or offered in accordance with National Board of Health and Welfare recommendations. On the other hand, figures are available on the number of packs  sold and the pharmacy purchasing price  (AIP).</p>
<p>The costs of vaccine use in the childhood vaccination programme alone, measured in terms of AIP, total just over SEK 300 million per year. Large discounts are, however, applied, primarily for those vaccines which are used over a long period. Figures for the average level of discount on childhood vaccines in relation to AIP range between 30 per cent (according to the county councils) and 50 per cent (according to the industry). At a level of discount of 30 per cent, the cost of childhood vaccines can thus be calculated at between SEK 200 and 250 million per year.</p>
<p>Around a hundred public vaccine procurements have been conducted in the past ten years. There are wide variations between the procurements in several dimensions. Both the combined volume and the number of types of vaccine vary widely. A number of different constellations occur on the purchasing side, from individual smaller municipalities to larger forms of procurement cooperation between several county councils and municipalities. The smallest procurement relates to around a thousand doses of childhood vaccine for a small municipality at such a low cost that the vaccines could easily have been procured directly. The largest procurement to date is the national procurement of pandemic vaccine against influenza A H1N1 (swine flu). The quality of tendering documentation and other documents, for example specifications, is highly variable. The general impression is that much procurement documentation is formulated in such a way that the opportunities for competition which nevertheless exist are not exploited in an appropriate manner.</p>
<h2>Information to the public on vaccinations</h2>
<p>The judgement of the Inquiry is that the information provided by the National Board of Health and Welfare is objective and easy to assimilate. On the other hand, it is not entirely easy to find. In practice it is necessary to go directly to the agencies’ websites and search for the information there. The county councils provide virtually no general information at all on vaccines and vaccinations.</p>
<p>Anyone searching for vaccine information on the Internet without preconceptions will not, however, find entry points to objective information from government agencies among the first hundred hits. This is shown to be the case by the systematic searches using Google conducted by the Inquiry. Instead there are links to many websites where non-objective information on vaccines is disseminated.</p>
<p>A Google search on the Swedish term “svininfluensa” (“swine flu”) in October 2009 led into an “information corridor” of heavily distorted information, which in many cases was calculated to deter the public from vaccination. The Medical Products Agency and the National Board of Health and Welfare have confirmed that distorted, non-objective and scaremongering information was a great problem in the initial stage of pandemic vaccination. An important lesson learnt is that such “disinformation” can now spread very quickly through new social media and blogs. This does not only apply to pandemic vaccination. Experience from the childhood vaccination programme is similar. This is a new phenomenon. Blogging and the social media have developed in recent years and their use is increasing sharply, particularly in older age groups.</p>
<h2>Follow-up and evaluation of vaccinations</h2>
<p>Monitoring of a vaccination programme traditionally rests on four pillars: 1. Monitoring of the diseases the programme is intended to control (epidemiological monitoring). 2. Monitoring of vaccination coverage. 3. Follow-up of side-effects. 4. Sero-epidemiological studies, which are intended to assess the immunity situation in the population.</p>
<p>The Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control is responsible for compiling and analysing data on the coverage  of vaccines and for evaluations of the immunity situation. Analytical data are compiled in different ways in different parts of the country. Three county councils, those of Norrbotten, Värmland and Kalmar, and the child health care service in Västernorrland register vaccines through the SMI vaccination register (Svevac). Other county councils apply manual systems with forms, which are filled in by each child health care centre every year.</p>
<p>The diseases covered by the childhood vaccination programme are notifiable under the Communicable Diseases Act. However, in the case of pneumococcal infections and Hib only serious  cases of disease are notified. Reported cases of disease can be compared with the number of vaccinations against the disease. In addition, special studies are conducted to gauge the immunity situation.</p>
<p>The Medical Products Agency is responsible for the reporting of side-effects. Holders of authorisation for the marketing of medicinal products for humans have to notify side-effects which come to their knowledge. Since 2009 it has also been possible for individuals to report a side-effect directly to the Medical Products</p>
<p>Agency. The reports are registered for statistical purposes and research in the side-effects register (SWEDIS), which is now a health data register.</p>
<p>Current evaluation routines are judged by the government agencies affected to be inadequate. Reliable data are lacking on which individuals have been vaccinated in defined target groups, when they have been vaccinated and with what vaccine. Data are compiled in different ways in different parts of the country. When vaccination coverage falls, as happened when incorrect and misleading rumours were spread about side-effects of the measles vaccine in the early 2000s, it is crucially important to know exactly where in the county council and why this happens, so that it is possible to intervene. It is not possible to obtain such detailed statistics without effective computer-based follow-up systems. Immunity studies at present are conducted in statistical selections of the population without taking account of whether the individuals in the selection have been vaccinated or not.</p>
<p>Nor is it possible to quickly test different hypotheses, i.e. to confirm or refute claims on side-effects of vaccines. It took several years, for example, before the link between MMR vaccination and autism could be disproven through extensive multi-year follow-up studies. It would have been possible to obtain the necessary information far more quickly with a vaccination register capable of being matched with other health data registers.</p>
<p>The National Board of Health and Welfare’s register of medicinal products provides good options for various follow-ups for other medicinal products. However, only those vaccines for which prescriptions are issued are included in the register of medicinal products. This means that the options for follow-up are considerably poorer for vaccines than for medicinal products in general.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s considerations and proposals</h2>
<p>It has been stated in the introduction that the terminology relating to vaccination programmes is not entirely clear. National vaccination programmes are understood to be both the public childhood</p>
<p>Vaccinationer till barn – Skyddseffekter och biverkningar (Vaccinations for children – Protective effects and  side-effects),  Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment (SBU) 2009. See www.sbu.se/en</p>
<p>vaccination programme, which has  to be applied in the same way everywhere, and the ‘targeted’ vaccination programmes, which apply to individuals in at-risk groups, for example influenza vaccination for the elderly. The latter are based on recommendations and both application and charging vary across the country. The Inquiry considers that the recommended vaccinations cannot be designated as either national or as programmes . In the following only the term national vaccination programmes  is used, and is understood to mean vaccinations mandatory for the care providers, which are offered in organised forms free of charge to the public and on equal terms throughout the country.</p>
<p>Efforts to prevent spread of infection  are an important part of public health work and of great significance if the overall public health objective is to be attained. Protection against spread of infection  therefore represents a separate public health policy objective area. It is stated below that a high level of protection for society against infectious diseases must be maintained if the progress which has been made is not be lost. In the view of the Inquiry this necessitates effective vaccination activity which enjoys a high level of trust in the population and attracts high take-up in the target groups.</p>
<p>Flock immunity is an important aim with vaccines offered in national vaccination programmes. This means that unvaccinated individuals gain protection against disease as a result of other individuals being vaccinated. This is conditional on a certain degree of vaccination coverage. If the coverage falls below a critical level, flock immunity in the country, and internationally, will decline. This leads to people being affected by disease, caused by infective agents, for which there are no administrative boundaries between county councils, municipalities or countries.</p>
<p>National vaccination programmes are special for several reasons if they are compared with other activities and measures in health care. They are offered to healthy individuals without diagnosis or indication of the disease they are intended to protect against. They cover large groups of the population, sometimes the whole population and often whole age cohorts of young children. The overall purpose is to ensure good public health in a broad community perspective. The principal purpose of the national vaccination programmes is thus not primarily to prevent disease in a single indi-</p>
<p>vidual. Nor is the primary goal to relieve individual county councils or municipalities of a cost burden or health care responsibility. The vaccinations in the programmes also, however, have good effects in such a more limited, or purely individual preventive, perspective.</p>
<p>The overarching goal of national vaccination programmes is national or international and means that society has to be protected against infection and disease. They thus have a public health policy dimension, in a national perspective, which goes beyond what a Finnish municipality, a Danish region or a Swedish county council can reasonably be expected to take collective social responsibility of their own for.</p>
<p>At present it is the National Board of Health and Welfare that decides on both regulations and recommendations on vaccination. The most recent decisions on vaccination regulations relate to vaccination against pneumococcal infection and HPV. Altogether the decisions have been calculated to entail cost increases in county councils and municipalities of just under SEK 400 million per year. The principle of financing  is to be applied to such additional tasks for the municipal sector. This means that central government reimburses the net costs which central government decisions on municipal services signify for county councils and municipalities. In view of this situation the municipal sector has received around SEK 360 million in reimbursement of the costs of vaccinations against pneumococcal infections and HPV. Expansion of a national vaccination programme thus has direct and quite significant effects for the government budget.</p>
<p>The costs of a vaccination programme can be compared, and compete for public funds, with other investments in society which have the same or essentially the same purpose. In view of the fact that national public support is to be prioritised within financial limits, and as decisions on vaccination programmes have repercussions in municipalities and county councils, the investigation considers that such decisions should not be taken at a lower level than in central government. No individual government agency, nor particular decision-making councils within the agencies, can reasonably take such responsibility. The conclusion is that it is difficult to delegate decisions on the scope of national vaccination programmes to a government agency or to a decision-making council.</p>
<p>In view of the situation outlined above, a main principle should be that decisions on the principal orientation  of the vaccination programmes should be taken by central government based on criteria laid down by the Riksdag. It is proposed that a special expert council should be created within the National Board of Health and Welfare, tasked with presenting recommendations for decisions . Material on which to base decisions, as is the case today, should be prepared within the National Board of Health and Welfare.</p>
<p>The decisions should continue in the future to be based on a careful evaluation of the criteria which now precede decisions on vaccination programmes, both in Sweden and in other countries. However, the criterion regarding health economics  should be developed and clarified, so that a broader economic  analysis of the effects of the vaccinations takes place.</p>
<p>There is also reason to stipulate in law important principal criteria which should be preconditions for vaccination programmes. Clearer democratic endorsement of the decisions can be achieved as a result. It should thus be required of a national vaccination programme, in the view of the Inquiry, that it</p>
<p>1. effectively counteracts disease in society,</p>
<p>2. is  cost-effective in economic terms and</p>
<p>3. is tenable on ethical and humanitarian grounds.</p>
<p>The criterion of the economy  needs to be clarified in relation to the routines the National Board of Health and Welfare now applies. A main principle should be that the criterion of economic  cost-effectiveness  is assessed in a broad societal perspective , where account is also taken of expenditure and income arising outside the care sector, for example loss of production. The National Board of Health and Welfare should be instructed to draw up guidelines indicating how the economic analysis of national vaccination programmes should be conducted. A general (generic) model for economic analysis of national vaccination programmes should be developed in international cooperation. The National Board of Health and Welfare should be commissioned, in consultation with the Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care, among others, to initiate work on developing such a model.</p>
<p>Issues of  funding, implementation and  follow-up also arise under national vaccination programmes.  Information to the public on vaccinations is also a strategic issue if the vaccination programmes are to produce good results.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that county councils and municipalities should still be responsible for the activity of carrying out  vaccinations and for the costs arising in this part. There is no reason to remove vaccination activity from the school health service. On the other hand, there may be reason to review the overall responsibility for child and school health care.</p>
<p>Central government should be responsible for the costs of vaccines  and for vaccines used in national vaccination programmes being procured centrally . As a result, procurement activity can be made more effective and the competition strengthened as far as possible. A reasonable balance is attained with this sharing of responsibility between the interests of national public health and the benefits national vaccination programmes bring in county councils and municipalities.</p>
<p>The nature of the information efforts required is such that they should be handled at central government level, but in close cooperation with municipalities and county councils. The Inquiry proposes that a modern communication strategy should be devised in which account is also taken of the use of new media. Follow-up of vaccinations is already principally a central government responsibility today and should remain so.</p>
<p>In addition to principal criteria for national vaccination programmes, main principles for decision-making procedures and the principles just mentioned for sharing of responsibility in financing  and implementation  should be governed by statutory instrument. It is proposed that this be done by introducing a combined National Vaccination Programmes Act . This law would govern overarching issues relating to the decision-making powers of the Government and the government agencies on matters of various kinds concerned with the national vaccination programmes and with fundamental decision-making criteria and other issues of sharing of responsibility.</p>
<p>More detailed regulations on background information on which decisions are based should be issued in a separate National Vaccination Programmes Ordinance  enacted by the Government. This applies for instance to specific issues on which light needs to be shed under each of the three principal criteria. The Inquiry proposes that a separate expert council, the Vaccination Council , should be established within the National Board of Health and Welfare. The function of the Council would be to make recommendations to the Government for changes to national vaccination</p>
<p>programmes. The Council should include representatives of government agencies concerned and the municipal sector, as well as experts in affected specialist fields such as vaccinology, immunology and economics.</p>
<p>The proposed systematic arrangement means that the conditions for vaccinations not  included in the national vaccination programme, for example those recommended by the National Board of Health and Welfare, are regulated in the respects mentioned. This does not prevent it still being possible for vaccines to be recommended and offered to the public according to the routines now applied for recommended vaccinations. Compliance with such recommendations is voluntary for the care providers, who are also at liberty to wholly or partially finance the recommended vaccinations by charging fees. No statutory powers are required to enable recommendations on vaccination to be issued.</p>
<p>The proposals thus mean that a clear dividing line arises between national vaccination programmes, which have to be assessed and decided upon separately, and other vaccinations, which can be recommended by government agencies, employers and other actors. As is the case today, no special preconditions are specified in the proposals to enable the National Board of Health and Welfare to recommend a vaccination.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers it to be unnecessarily complicated and expensive, both for the individual and for central government, to reimburse vital vaccinations through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Experience gained to date shows that publicly procured vaccines become significantly cheaper for the public and for individuals than vaccines reimbursed through the pharmaceutical benefits scheme.</p>
<p>The follow-up systems play a key role for almost all the aspects of vaccinations touched on so far. It has been pointed out above that there is an inadequate basis for follow-up and evaluation. One area relates to vaccination coverage. Manually reporting and compiling vaccination data is now associated with considerable administrative effort. Several methods of reporting are used. The epidemiological evaluations of the protective effects of vaccines can also be made more efficient with better underlying data on vaccinations carried out.</p>
<p>It can additionally be noted that it must be possible to respond quickly to rumours of side-effects with statistically verified data, not just from clinical studies but from “live” use of vaccines and in</p>
<p>large population groups. It is at least as important to have a state of preparedness for any serious and unexpected side-effect that might arise. The risk of such a side-effect is low but can never be entirely ruled out. An early warning can be ensured with effective followup systems and the harmful effects can then be minimised. The Neurosedyn (thalidomide) disaster in the early 1960s was the direct reason for the introduction of the Birth Defects Registry in Sweden. There are currently no such specific warning systems for vaccines in Sweden. In addition there is a need for follow-up of the effects of the vaccinations from the points of view of public health policy, economics and government finances. There are no collated data at national level at present on actual volumes and costs in vaccination activities. In view of this situation the Inquiry considers there to be strong grounds for introducing registration of vaccinations in the way already applied for the use of other medicinal products.</p>
