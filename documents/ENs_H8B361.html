<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The new EU legislation</h2>
<p>The EU has adopted new legislation on covered bonds, consisting of a directive and a regulation amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (the Capital Requirements Regulation, CRR). This report contains the proposals for the legislative amendments needed to implement the new EU directive and adapt Swedish legislation to the changes made in the CRR. The proposed amendments mainly concern the Covered Bond Issuance Act (Swedish Code of Statutes 2003:1223).</p>
<h2>The Swedish market for covered bonds</h2>
<p>Covered bonds are an important funding source for many credit institutions and facilitate financing, mainly for mortgages. From an investor perspective, one advantage of covered bonds compared with other investment options is that the investor has a priority claim on the assets in the cover pool.</p>
<p>Today, Sweden has a large, liquid and standardised covered bond market. Measured in outstanding amounts, this market was the fifth largest covered bond market in the world in 2019. In September 2020, Swedish issuers had outstanding covered bonds totalling SEK 2 500 billion.</p>
<h2>Legislative amendments</h2>
<p>Swedish law already sets high investor protection requirements for covered bond issuance. However, there are, for example, no provisions concerning information and reporting requirements or a cover pool liquidity buffer. These additional requirements in the Directive are some of the main amendments that the Inquiry proposes to the Covered Bond Issuance Act alongside the amendments to the Loan to Value ratio (LTV) provisions and the overcollateralisation requirements. The amendments proposed by the Inquiry are intended to uphold the functioning of the covered bond market in Sweden and the current Swedish legislation.</p>
<h2>Assets in the cover pool</h2>
<p>According to the Inquiry’s proposal, residential and commercial mortgages, exposures to credit institutions and public loans can be included in the cover pool.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the provisions of the Covered Bond Issuance Act be amended to reflect the provisions of the CRR. Issuers should be required to meet the CRR’s requirements regarding exposure limits for credit institutions. The proposal amends the provisions of the Covered Bond Issuance Act on public loans and mortgages to reflect the provisions of the CRR. As a result, the provisions on issuance of covered bonds will correlate better with the CRR’s provisions on risk weights and capital requirements. This simplifies the application of the provisions.</p>
<p>When it comes to conditions regarding foreign countries, e.g. exposures to foreign counterparties and loans secured by property located in an EEA country other than Sweden, the Inquiry proposes inserting references to the relevant CRR provisions in the Covered Bond Issuance Act.</p>
<p>Amendments to the provisions on LTV levels are proposed in the Covered Bond Issuance Act as a part of harmonisation with the CRR. Only a part of the loan, up to a specific share of the market value of the collateral, can be included in the coverage calculation. The proposal changes the LTV for residential mortgages from 75 percent to 80 percent of the market value of the collateral. For commercial mortgages, the LTV is changed in certain cases.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the provisions on substitute collateral be repealed, since it is difficult to combine them with the new EU legislation. Instead, new provisions on exposures to credit institutions and provisions on a liquidity buffer are proposed in the Covered Bond Issuance Act, in line with the CRR rules. While these provisions partly have the same purpose as substitute collateral, they have a broader scope, since exposures to derivative counterparties are also included.</p>
<h2>Labelling</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the current provisions on labelling in the Covered Bond Issuance Act be replaced by provisions on three new labels:</p>
<p>• Swedish Covered Bond.</p>
<p>• European Covered Bond (premium).</p>
<p>• European Covered Bond.</p>
<p>Provisions on the use of labels liable to be confused with these labels are also introduced in the Covered Bond Issuance Act.</p>
<h2>Coverage requirements, overcollateralisation and liquidity buffer</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the requirements in the Covered Bond Issuance Act on overcollateralisation, i.e. the level by which the value of the assets in the cover pool has to exceed the value of the liabilities, be adapted to the main principle in the CRR of at least five per cent overcollateralisation.</p>
<p>As a result of the rules in the Directive, the Inquiry also proposes that provisions concerning a specific liquidity buffer should be introduced in the Covered Bond Issuance Act. It should cover the maximum cumulative net liquid outflow from the issuer over the next 180 days. However, the requirement should not apply to the first 30 days covered by the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirements of the so-called LCR Regulation, for as long as there is an overlap between the requirements.</p>
<h2>Maturity extensions</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that provisions permitting maturity extensions be introduced in Swedish law. These are conditions included in the terms of a covered bond contract stating that repayment can be postponed in certain circumstances. In the Inquiry’s proposal, such a maturity extension can only be subject to approval from Finansinspektionen (the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority).</p>
<p>According to the main principle, calculation of the liquidity buffer requirement for covered bonds allowing for maturity extensions should be based only on the original maturity date, unless Finansinspektionen has approved the maturity extension.</p>
<h2>Information, monitoring and supervision</h2>
<p>The provisions on an independent inspector in the Covered Bond Issuance Act should remain in place, in the view of the Inquiry. Therefore the Member State option in the Directive allowing for the appointment of a cover pool monitor should not be implemented.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that Finansinspektionen’s power to revoke an issuer’s authorisation for a covered bond programme be extended to include the situation where the issuer has acquired permission for a covered bond programme by making false statements or by some other irregular means.</p>
<p>As a complement to the provisions on sanctions for issuers and other credit institutions, the Inquiry proposes that additional provisions on sanctions for natural persons be included in the Banking and Financing Business Act (Swedish Code of Statutes 2004:297), in relation to breaches of certain provisions in the Covered Bond Issuance Act.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that new authorisations to issue regulations be introduced in the Covered Bond Issuance Act concerning the information to be provided by the issuer to investors and the information that the issuers have to submit to Finansinspektionen, when this has to be done and how the information has to be given. The Inquiry proposes that several of the authorisations to issue regulations in the current wording of the Covered Bond Issuance Act be repealed in the light of the new EU legislation.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions</h2>
<p>The legislative amendments are proposed to enter into force on 8 July 2022.</p>
<p>For a covered bond that has been issued before this date, the previous provisions of the Covered Bond Issuance Act will, as a main principle, continue to apply during the remaining part of its maturity. For tap issues made after 8 July 2022, certain transitional provisions will apply.</p>
<h2>Impact assessment of the proposals</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals will lead to increased costs, mainly for the issuers directly affected by the requirements and, to some extent, for Finansinspektionen, which supervises the issuers. The proposal of a specific liquidity buffer has the greatest financial impact. The size of these costs will depend on the issuer’s liquidity inflows and outflows during the period against which the requirement is measured, as well as on the interest rates levels available for funding and investment. However, the costs arising from the Inquiry’s proposal are limited since the requirement for a specific liquidity buffer does not apply to the period covered by the LCR requirements. Therefore, there is no dual regulation in this regard.</p>
<p>During a transition period, the issuers will be affected by the comprehensive transitional provisions proposed regarding tap issues.</p>
<p>The Inquiry makes the overall assessment that the proposed changes will not lead to a significant impact on the functioning of the Swedish covered bond market in the long run, which is positive also from an investor perspective.</p>
