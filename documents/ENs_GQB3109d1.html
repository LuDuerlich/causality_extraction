<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>The committee has been assigned to describe the current authority structure and the forms of co-operation that exist among the authorities in the area of electronic communications, to report and assess the experiences of the current organisation, and to propose any needed changes in that authority structure. We have conducted our deliberations in light of the reported experiences, technical advancements, our evaluations of the government’s responsibilities, and the legislation previously proposed by the committee in its interim report on the Swedish Electronic Communications Act / Lag om elektronisk kommunikation / (SOU 2002:60).</p>
<p>We have also been called upon to report on the statutory changes stemming from the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union directive 2002/58/EC of July 12, 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (communications data protection directive), Article 13, regarding provisions concerning unsolicited communications.</p>
<p>A summary of our deliberations and conclusions is provided below.</p>
<h2>Organisation of authorities, etc.</h2>
<p>There are currently two authorities in the area of electronic communications, each with its own particular duties. The Swedish National Post and Telecom Agency / Post- och telestyrelsen / (PTS) is the central administrative authority for radio and telecommunications, while the Swedish Radio and TV Authority / Radio- och  TV-verket/ (RTVV) has corresponding authority in the area of media. In addition, certain authorities have general areas of responsibility that are also relevant to the areas in question here. These authorities include the Swedish Consumer Agency / Konsumentverket / (KOV), which is responsible for consumer issues, the Swedish Competition Authority / Konkurrensverket / (KKV), which handles competition-related matters, and the Swedish Data Inspectorate / Datainspektionen / (DI), whose responsibilities include overseeing the handling and processing of personal data.</p>
<p>In our view, the current division of responsibility among the authorities in the area of electronic communications is working well. One contributing factor to this is that highly efficient forms of collaboration and co-operation have developed among the authorities. In our assessment, the current way in which these authorities are organised is also well-suited to ensuring that the Swedish Electronic Communications Act [EkomL] will function in the intended manner.</p>
<p>Upon reviewing the division of responsibilities entailed in the proposals presented in our earlier interim report, we find no reason to make any changes in the way these authorities are organised, other than with respect to certain minor details. In our opinion, one reason the authority structure should not be altered is the strong and rapid growth and development taking place in the communications and infrastructure areas. There is a strong need for initiatives to track and monitor this growth, and major changes in how the authorities are organised could lead to poor results in the near term. These same factors also lend support to the argument in favour of maintaining a coherent organisation of authority within this sector. We therefore propose that the current authority structure, i.e. with a sector authority which performs a co-ordinating function, be retained, and that PTS be entrusted with this responsibility. It is our position that PTS should also be the responsible authority for the EkomL. We have chosen to entrust PTS with both these functions because, at present, PTS possesses the greatest expertise and competency in the areas relevant to this sector.</p>
<p>According to our proposal, PTS would have both overall and operational responsibility in most matters. As the authority responsible for EkomL, PTS would resolve disputes, grant licenses, exert oversight and formulate and carry out the market definitions and market analyses cited in Chapter 7 Section 14 – 16 of the proposed bill. With respect to the latter issues, PTS would consult in particular with KKV, benefiting from KKV’s knowledge and experience in competition-related legal issues.</p>
<p>With respect to consumer issues bearing upon the area of electronic communications, we propose that KOV be the responsible authority, except in connection with those consumer issues that are expressly regulated in EkomL. PTS would be the responsible authority with respect to the latter.</p>
<p>Responsibility for environmental issues is currently divided among bodies such as the Swedish Radiation Protection Authority / Strålskyddsinstitutet /, the Swedish National Electrical Safety Board / Elsäkerhetsverket / and the Swedish Central Board of National Antiquities / Riksantikvarieämbetet /. It is our view that EkomL should not entail any changes in the prevailing division of responsibilities in this sector, nor in the prevailing oversight apparatus for dealing with questions as to whether negative environmental impact could result from the operation of enterprises covered by the proposed bill. The current apparatus should thus remain in place in this area.</p>
<p>DI should be the authority with oversight in matters pertaining to such handling of personal data as may occur within enterprises covered by EkomL. DI’s area of oversight must not, however, include the handling of personal data which are specifically regulated in EkomL. PTS will be the responsible supervisory authority in the latter cases.</p>
<p>According to our proposal, regulations regarding transmission should, to the greatest possible extent, be subject to a single authority. However, we do find reasons to make an exception to this, i.e. with respect to RTVV’s responsibility for the transmission-related regulations, including those pertaining to mustcarry obligations, that are set forth in the Swedish Radio and Television Act radio- och  TV-lagen/ (1996:844). Regarding the Swedish Standards for Broadcasting Radio and TV Signals Act / lagen (1998:31) om standarder för sändning av radio- och TVsignaler /, we further propose that RTVV be entrusted with complete responsibility for the tasks deriving thence. As a result of this, KOV would no longer have any supervisory responsibilities in this context.</p>
<p>In its capacity as sector authority in the area of electronic communications, and pursuant to the Swedish Ordinance with Instructions for the Post and Telecom Agency / förordningen (1997:401) med instruktion för Post- och telestyrelsen /, it is incumbent upon said authority to initiate the various co-operative procedures and consultations for which there may be need among the authorities. According to the instructions otherwise, PTS must take the initiative in an ongoing process of information exchange with affected authorities in matters pertaining to competition, consumers and sparsely populated areas. Forms of co-operation have already been worked out with regard to consumerand competition-related issues, as well as certain environmental issues. We propose that PTS and other authorities affected by EkomL should develop similar informal forms of co-operation.</p>
<p>We further propose that the instructions to PTS expressly provide that that authority must consult with and solicit comments from KKV in connection with the performance of market analyses as per Chapter 7 Section 14 – 16 of EkomL, and that PTS be responsible for the consultations that should take place with DI and RTVV. These authorities should determine how these forms of co-operation are to be structured.</p>
<p>According to our proposal, PTS should change its name to the Swedish Electronic Communications and Post Administration / Verket för elektronisk kommunikation och post / (V e kom).</p>
<h2>Unsolicited marketing</h2>
<p>We propose that a consent requirement in connection with the use of electronic mail in direct marketing be incorporated into the first paragraph of Section 13 b of the Swedish Marketing Act / marknadsföringslagen / (1995:450). It must be possible, pursuant to the second paragraph of the same section, to make exceptions if the marketing concerns goods of similar type in an established customer relationship.</p>
<p>According to our proposal, a prohibition should be incorporated into Section 13 c of the Swedish Marketing Act to prevent unsolicited marketing that fails to furnish a valid address to which the recipient can provide notice in the event that he is opposed to receiving further mailings. In the event that such marketing is sent out in contravention of Section 13 d, it must be possible to impose a market disruption fee as per Section 22 of said Act.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>EkomL will entail that V e kom will be responsible for more resource-intensive tasks than was PTS. For instance, EkomL’s provisions concerning obligations to furnish notice, the handling of cases involving the revocation of licenses or changes in license conditions, and concerning universal services will entail an increased workload. Moreover, V e kom will also be responsible for the market analyses that will have to be carried out pursuant to EkomL, and for decisions regarding any particular obligations associated with those analyses.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, EkomL will result in V e kom having greater needs than PTS in terms of both financial and human resources. However, we cannot speculate specifically as to the extent to which this will in fact be the case.</p>
<p>KKV and RTVV will also need more resources as a result of the proposed changes in their respective responsibilities, but here again we are unable to assess the extent of such increases at this juncture.</p>
<p>Finally, our proposed regulations concerning unsolicited marketing should entail no more than marginal costs. Such costs would be attributable first and foremost to the expanded supervisory activities that these regulations would involve for KOV.</p>
