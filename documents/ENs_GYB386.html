<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Inquiry on Future Personnel Provision in the Swedish Armed Forces was instructed to review and propose the necessary measures to adapt the Swedish Armed Forces’ personnel provision to the agency’s new tasks and needs.</p>
<h2>Swedish Armed Forces personnel and units</h2>
<p>In a decision of 19 May 2010 (Riksdag Communications 2009/10:269 and 2009/10:270), the Riksdag adopted the Government Bill Modern personnel provision for a functional defence  (Govt. Bill 2009/10:160), which suspends national military service in peacetime. The orientation of defence policy and operational capacity requirements mean that all parts of the operational organisation should be available for all of the Swedish Armed Forces’ tasks without the need for a prior decision on mobilisation or heightened alert, for example. In light of this, all parts of the Swedish Armed Forces’ personnel provision should be designed to serve the availability and functionality of the operational organisation in a cost-effective way.</p>
<p>The new system for personnel provision includes the introduction of two new categories of military personnel: periodically serving and continuously serving squad leaders, soldiers and sailors. Continuously serving personnel are employees whose post in the Swedish Armed Forces is their main employment. Periodically serving personnel are employees whose main employment is outside the Swedish Armed Forces.</p>
<p>Swedish Armed Forces units will in future be organised into two main types, permanent units and contract units, alongside the Home Guard, with the national protection forces. It will be possible to mobilise a reserve of units and personnel in case of any serious deterioration in the international situation.</p>
<p>Permanent units are units with a high level of availability, intended for military operations at all conflict levels. Their high level of availability and varying military operational environments require well-trained and experienced officers, specialist officers, squad leaders, soldiers and sailors.</p>
<p>Contract units are units with a lower preparedness level. They are fully functional and available to the Swedish Armed Forces, but are not intended to be used in operations at all conflict levels in the same way as the permanent units.</p>
<h2>International comparisons and conclusions</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has collected information via a questionnaire sent to eighteen countries. The questionnaires were dealt with by the Swedish Defence Attachés. The Inquiry has also used data collected by the Inquiry on National Total Defence Service and Voluntary Participation (SOU 2009:63).</p>
<p>Based on the responses, the Inquiry was able to garner certain general tendencies and trends.</p>
<p>Disseminating information</p>
<p>Generally speaking, information is disseminated and support for the armed forces fostered at an early age, often within the education system. Extensive information and awareness-raising initiatives are conducted separately from direct recruitment and marketing that take places further down the line.</p>
<p>Women in the armed forces</p>
<p>Special initiatives to reach out to women produce clear results. All of the countries surveyed report a significant gender imbalance, but those countries working actively to increase the proportion of women employ, on average, twice as many women as other countries.</p>
<p>Retaining personnel throughout their period of employment</p>
<p>Retaining personnel for their full period of employment is reportedly the greatest staffing problem. Several factors have a bearing on this and the measures the countries take to retain personnel vary. One recurring factor that contributes to personnel leaving prematurely is a high rate of operations requiring long absences from home and family. Individuals who do not feel that their period of service is meaningful and see the future as uncertain also leave prematurely.</p>
<p>Average period of employment</p>
<p>Employment on fixed-term contracts is common for armed forces personnel. Periods of employment vary widely between countries, but there is often a specified maximum period of employment. Countries have chosen such different solutions that it was difficult to draw any conclusions from the data. Those countries that have chosen to offer benefits at the end of an employment period, such as a pension, a bonus or an attractive career transition programme, tend to achieve longer average duration of employment.</p>
<p>Support to relatives</p>
<p>Support to family and relatives during operations differs somewhat from country to country. However, one thing the majority have in common is measures to support contact between families and personnel involved in operations. Priority is also given to helping form local networks and other groups.</p>
<p>Length of international operations</p>
<p>Among the countries surveyed, the most common length of operations was six months, a few reported shorter operations of four months. One possible lesson is that shorter operations make a higher individual rate of operations possible. Each absence from family is shorter in duration, and is therefore felt to be less trying. Operational effectiveness tends to increase with longer periods of service, particularly in certain posts.</p>
<p>Transition to a civilian career</p>
<p>Most countries report that an attractive and planned career transition programme is important. This is the case with regard to recruitment, as an incentive to retain personnel and to maintain a good reputation. Career transitions need to be planned early and should not be viewed as an adjustment measure to be introduced when the period of employment is nearing its end. Proximity to the civilian labour market, certification of training and appraisal of experience are important factors.</p>
<h2>Secure staffing</h2>
<p>There are two prerequisites for secure staffing. Firstly, the Armed Forces’ organisation must always be fully staffed with personnel with the right skills. Secondly, this personnel must be in the right place when they are scheduled for service in an operation. The Inquiry makes proposals intended to improve conditions in both of these respects.</p>
<p>Being a correctly staffed organisation means that the Swedish Armed Forces are able to predict their personnel needs and recruit, develop, retain and reduce their personnel in a way that balances needs and availability at all times. To achieve this, it is crucial that the Swedish Armed Forces are seen to be an attractive employer.</p>
<h2>Legislation</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that certain labour law issues concerning squad leaders, soldiers and sailors in the Swedish Armed Forces be regulated in a special act. It must be possible to agree derogations from the law in certain respects, through collective agreements concluded or approved by a central employee organisation.</p>
<p>The special act in its entirety is to be applied to Swedish Armed Forces personnel employed as squad leaders, soldiers or sailors. The special act’s provisions on the right to leave and employment protection, and on the right to interrupt or defer studies, are also to apply to reserve officers. The special act’s provisions on service in international military operations and on disciplinary responsibility when serving in such operations are to apply to all Swedish</p>
<p>Armed Forces employees serving in such operations. The special act is not to apply to locally employed staff in the area of operations.</p>
<h2>Obligation to work</h2>
<p>During their period of employment, personnel employed by the Swedish Armed Forces as squad leaders, soldiers or sailors will be obliged to serve in international military operations in accordance with their individual contracts of employment. The Inquiry does not propose any additional special provisions on an international obligation to work, over and above the obligation to work stated in the employment contract.</p>
<h2>Forms of employment</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that it be possible for the Swedish Armed Forces to employ squad leaders, soldiers and sailors on longer fixed-term contracts. It should not be possible for such fixed-term contracts to be converted into permanent employment.</p>
<h2>Specialist officers</h2>
<p>It is proposed that specialist officers be employed on permanent contracts. The Inquiry considers that the terms of employment for specialist officers should be harmonised with other professional and reserve officers, with the aim of promoting the transition from officer to specialist officer in the ongoing start-up phase of specialist officer posts.</p>
<h2>Periods of employment</h2>
<p>It is proposed that it be possible to employ continuously serving squad leaders, soldiers and sailors on fixed-term contracts for up to eight years, with the option to renew their employment. The maximum possible period of employment for this category is to be twelve years.</p>
<p>It is also proposed that it be possible to employ periodically serving squad leaders, soldiers and sailors on fixed-term contracts for up to eight years, with the option to renew their employment. The maximum possible period of employment for this category is to be sixteen years.</p>
<h2>Trial employment</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that it be possible for the Swedish Armed Forces to conclude agreements on trial employment for a limited period of no more than six months, if there is a need for a trial period. If either the employer or the employee does not want the employment to continue after the trial period has expired, this must be notified to the other party no later than at the end of the trial period. If this is not done, the trial employment is converted into a fixed-term contract in accordance with the proposed special act. Unless otherwise agreed, a trial employment may also be terminated before the expiry of the trial period.</p>
<h2>Termination of fixed-term contracts</h2>
<p>It is proposed that, under the terms of the special legislation, it be possible for the Swedish Armed Forces or the employee to terminate fixed-term contracts, following a given period of notice.</p>
<h2>Periods of notice</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a minimum notice period of three months, applicable to both the Swedish Armed Forces and employees. The Swedish Armed Forces are to be able to grant employees shorter notice periods.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Inquiry proposes that if continuously serving employees are given notice on the grounds of redundancy, they are to have the right to a period of notice longer than three months, depending on the length of their fixed-term contracts.</p>
<h2>Obligation to provide information</h2>
<p>It is also proposed that personnel periodically employed by the Swedish Armed Forces have an obligation, either when such employment is agreed or at the time of employment by a civilian employer, to inform their civilian employer of their employment with the Swedish Armed Forces. Personnel are also to have an obligation to keep their civilian employers informed of scheduled service for the Swedish Armed Forces.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that the Swedish Armed Forces have an obligation to inform employees of the length and location of service no later than three months before service commences.</p>
<h2>Recovery period</h2>
<p>It is also proposed that, under the proposed special act, continuously employed personnel have the right to a recovery period after serving in an international military operation. During the proposed recovery period, employees will not be relieved of their duties, but they will serve in Sweden. During such a recovery period, employees may only serve in an international military operation if the Swedish Armed Forces considers that there are exceptional grounds, or if the employee volunteers.</p>
<h2>Right to leave from civilian employment</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that employees have the right to full-time leave from civilian employment for a maximum of six months in order to try out employment as continuously or periodically serving personnel of the Swedish Armed Forces.</p>
<p>It is also proposed that personnel periodically employed by the Swedish Armed Forces have the right to full-time leave from civilian employment for such periodical service in the Swedish Armed Forces. Leave for periodical service is to be possible for a maximum of twelve consecutive months.</p>
<p>It is also proposed that employees be allowed to terminate their leave once it has begun and resume their civilian employment to the same extent as prior to their leave. If employees are forced to terminate leave once it has begun owing to circumstances that are due to the Swedish Armed Forces, and the civilian employer does not allow the employee to resume their work immediately, the Swedish Armed Forces are to pay their salary and other employment benefits until such time as they can return to work for the civilian employer, but for no longer than one month.</p>
<h2>Protection of civilian employment, etc.</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that if an employee is given notice of termination or dismissed from their civilian employment solely because they request or make use of their right to leave under the proposed special act, the termination of employment or dismissal is to be annulled if the employee so requests.</p>
<p>It is also proposed that an employee who requests or makes use of their right to leave under the proposed special act not be obliged on this ground alone to accept any other reduced employment benefits or poorer working conditions than are a necessary consequence of their leave from their civilian employer. Nor is the employee to be obliged on this ground alone to accept any transfer to another post other than is possible within the framework of their employment contract and is a necessary consequence of their leave from their civilian employer.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that an employee periodically employed by the Swedish Armed Forces may not on these grounds be treated unfairly when enquiring about or applying for work.</p>
<h2>Right to defer or interrupt studies</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that an individual who has been accepted into a university or university college is to have the right to defer commencing their studies or to interrupt their studies for six months in order to try out employment as continuously or periodically serving personnel of the Swedish Armed Forces.</p>
<p>It is also proposed that students of universities or university colleges who are periodically employed by the Swedish Armed Forces have the right to interrupt their studies to serve in the Swedish Armed Forces.</p>
<h2>Service in international military operations</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Act on Swedish Armed Forces Personnel in International Military Operations (2010:449), due to enter into force on 1 January 2011, be repealed and that virtually all of the provisions contained in it be contained in the special act proposed by the Inquiry.</p>
<h2>Disciplinary responsibility and coercive measures</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that provisions concerning disciplinary responsibility and coercive measures for employees of the Swedish Armed Forces serving in an international military operation be contained in the proposed special act.</p>
<p>It is proposed that any employee who intentionally or through negligence neglects the duties associated with their position when serving in an international military operation be liable to disciplinary sanctions for neglect of duty. The disciplinary sanctions are to be a warning and salary deduction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is proposed that matters of disciplinary responsibility be examined by the commander of the unit in which the employee serves or has served most recently. A legal adviser is to be available to assist the Swedish Armed Forces in dealing with disciplinary matters and assist the employee during the disciplinary proceedings.</p>
<h2>Damages</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that any employer who contravenes the proposed special act be liable to pay not only salary and other employment benefits to which the employee may be entitled, but also compensation for any damage that arises.</p>
<p>It is also proposed that any employee who does not observe the notice periods laid down in the proposed special act be liable to pay damages.</p>
<h2>Evidence</h2>
<p>It is also proposed that if a job-seeker or employee demonstrates circumstances that give cause to assume that they have been treated unfairly on grounds specified in the act, the civilian employer must demonstrate that no such unfair treatment has taken place, or that it is a necessary consequence of applying the proposed special act.</p>
<h2>Appeals</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that it not be possible to appeal against decisions of the Swedish Armed Forces concerning employment under the proposed special act.</p>
<p>It is also proposed that if an employee wishes to appeal against a decision to impose disciplinary measures when serving in an international military operation, they must bring legal action within three weeks of completing their service in the international military operation.</p>
<h2>Recruitment</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Armed Forces should encourage and develop ways to recruit personnel alongside civilian employers.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s assessment, the Swedish Armed Forces will need to make special efforts to recruit women and other groups that have previously been underrepresented in the agency.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Inquiry considers that the Swedish Armed Forces should offer workplace-based learning to several professional categories.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Public Employment Service should not be permitted to instruct people to apply to positions in the Swedish Armed Forces that involve an international obligation to work.</p>
<h2>Information on the Swedish Armed Forces</h2>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the Swedish Armed Forces should offer targeted education programmes about the total defence and it’s role in society to students and teachers in upper secondary schools.</p>
<h2>Information, support and communication</h2>
<p>In the Inquiry’s assessment, the Swedish Armed Forces should develop the ways to ensure continuous dialogue with periodically serving personnel and other key figures. The Inquiry also considers that a special information support in connection with service should be developed.</p>
<h2>Bonuses</h2>
<p>In the Inquiry’s assessment, the Swedish Armed Forces can consider bonuses for completed international military operations and on completion of an employment contract. However, this is a matter for the parties of the public labour market to decide within the framework of the pay structure.</p>
<h2>Employer support</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that a special function for employer relations be established centrally within the Swedish Armed Forces. This function is to work strategically to develop contacts between the Swedish Armed Forces and civilian employers.</p>
<h2>Responsibility for follow-up and support to individual employers</h2>
<p>In the Inquiry’s assessment, the Swedish Armed Forces should hold continuous dialogue with civilian employers and offer active support measures that are necessary to care for and rehabilitate employees with physical or mental health problems due to service in international military operations.</p>
<h2>Civilian value of qualifications</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Armed Forces should establish a central function to assess qualifications and certify experience and completed training. Efforts to develop personnel’s civilian qualifications should be carried out in close cooperation with other actors in the civilian labour market and education system.</p>
<h2>Career transition</h2>
<p>Furthermore, it is proposed that continuously serving squad leaders, soldiers and sailors should have the right to draw up an individual career transition plan at an early stage of their employment, in cooperation with the Swedish Armed Forces. The plan should contain measures to be taken at the end of the employment period to prepare the individual for a civilian career.</p>
<h2>Costs and consequences</h2>
<p>The Inquiry estimates that the costs of the inquiry’s proposals will be accommodated within the current budgetary framework for the Swedish Armed Forces, based on the financial planning that was the basis of the Riksdag’s decision in the spring of 2009 (Govt. Bill 2008/09:140, rep. 2008/09:FöU10, Riksdag communication 2008/09:292). The inquiry’s proposals does not therefore necessi- tate any change in the financial programming. However, the Inquiry would like to reiterate that it is difficult to estimate the total cost of transition for the kind of change the Swedish Armed Forces are now undergoing.</p>
