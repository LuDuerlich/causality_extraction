<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Sweden’s Video Surveillance Act ( Kamerabevakningslagen ) regulates some uses of open video surveillance in our community. Under this Act, as a general rule a permit is required for the authorities to carry out video surveillance in places to which the general public have access. Furthermore, the Act requires that the public are informed of the video surveillance. The Act does not regulate covert video surveillance, which is covered by other legislation.</p>
<p>Our task is to propose measures to simplify video surveillance that falls within ambit of the Video Surveillance Act being carried out for law enforcement purposes. This task also includes investigating the need for simplified rules. Based on this investigation, we are to propose simplifications, the purpose being to ensure that the authorities are able to prevent, hinder or detect criminal activity or to investigate crimes; and to protect against, prevent and hinder threats to public safety; flexibly and appropriately for the activity.</p>
<p>The starting point for our task is that the permit requirement for video surveillance is to be abolished and replaced in the first instance by a notification requirement.</p>
<p>Our task also includes analysing the need for privacy protection measures once it becomes easier to use video surveillance. Finally, we are to analyse what impact making it easier to carry out video surveillance for law enforcement purposes will have for effective oversight.</p>
<h2>Fundamental rights</h2>
<p>Video surveillance constitutes a violation of fundamental rights and freedoms. The rights which are primarily of interest for our task are the right to protection of privacy and personal integrity and the right to the protection of personal data. These rights are guaranteed by the European Convention, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, and the Instrument of Government of Sweden. There are two sides to the fundamental rights of individuals: the right of individuals to be protected from violations by the State, and the duty of the State to guarantee individuals a protection against violations by other individuals. The State is obliged to establish a framework that provides for these, in part, competing interests. A permit requirement for the kind of video surveillance carried out by the authorities has applied for a long time in Swedish law. The permit requirement is intended to guarantee the individual a strong protection against surveillance while giving the authorities appropriate options for video surveillance.</p>
<h2>The need for simpler rules</h2>
<p>Our investigation shows that the Swedish Police Authority in particular but even the Swedish Coast Guard, the Swedish Security Service, and Swedish Customs need simplified rules for the video surveillance they carry out within the ambit of Sweden’s Crime Data Act ( brottsdatalagen  2018:1177) or equivalent regulation applicable to the Swedish Security Service. Society today is faced with a number of challenges in law enforcement activities, for example in matters pertaining to organised crime, criminality in particularly vulnerable places or areas, and terrorist threats. Video surveillance constitutes an increasingly important tool in law enforcement activities.</p>
<p>The permit procedure results in many problems. The biggest problems are that the procedure entails a considerable administrative burden; that the use of video surveillance for law enforcement purposes is hindered; and that the effectiveness of law enforcement activities is frustrated at the national level as well as in international cooperation. Furthermore, the permit procedure complicates law enforcement cooperation. From the European perspective, a permit requirement seems to be unusual.</p>
<p>The need for simplified rules exists primarily in the kind of video surveillance carried out as part of law enforcement activities. However, the line between law enforcement and other activities is very often fluid. Our proposals therefore also target video surveillance carried out for other purposes, such as in border and control activities.</p>
<h2>The permit requirement to be abolished for some law enforcement authorities</h2>
<p>The permit procedure has a number of negative effects on law enforcement activities. By extension, this impacts the community at large, since effective crime prevention leads to a safer, more secure community. Furthermore, since the permit requirement was introduced, the needs for video surveillance in law enforcement activities have changed. Privacy protection has been further strengthened through the new data protection rules enacted in EU law. One objective of these rules is to protect fundamental rights and freedoms in connection with personal data processing. These rules provide far-reaching preventive and corrective privacy protection. They also provide strong privacy protection during the period in which video surveillance is in progress. Furthermore, the privacy protection interest is not always in conflict with the video surveillance interest, but on the contrary can strengthen it.</p>
<p>All in all, the reasons against now outweigh the reasons for a permit procedure for the kind of video surveillance that in particular the Swedish Police Authority but also the Swedish Coast Guard, the Swedish Security Service, and Swedish Customs carry out in law enforcement activities. We therefore propose that the permit requirement is abolished for these law enforcement authorities. In order to avoid demarcation and adjudication problems, the permit requirement ought also to be abolished for the kind of surveillance carried out for purposes other than those that fall within the ambit of the Crime Data Act or equivalent regulation applicable to the Swedish Security Service.</p>
<p>However, once the permit requirement is abolished, there will be no clear regulation to ensure that video surveillance may only be carried out if the public interest in carrying out such surveillance outweighs the individual’s interest in not being subjected to surveillance; in other words, the ‘preponderance’ principle. We therefore propose that this principle should continue to apply in the future for the relevant authorities. See more about this below.</p>
<h2>A notification requirement is not proposed</h2>
<p>An important aim of the permit requirement is to guarantee a high level of privacy protection in the use of video surveillance. Once the permit requirement is abolished, it could entail certain risks from the privacy perspective. The purpose of replacing the permit procedure with some form of notification requirement thus ought to be to compensate for and by extension to minimise these risks to privacy through effective oversight. However, for a notification requirement to fully serve this purpose, according to the Swedish Data Protection Authority a notification would need to contain in principle the same information as an application for a permit. From the administrative point of view, such a notification requirement does not entail any simplification for the relevant authorities and does not offer a solution that is appropriate for the activity. Neither the relevant law enforcement authorities nor the Swedish Data Protection Authority are of the opinion that such a notification requirement ought to be introduced. We share this view.</p>
<p>A notification requirement could also be designed in such a way that the notification contains only a few details about the video surveillance. Such a notification requirement would mean less of an administrative burden for the relevant authorities and could provide the regulatory authority with a good overview of the surveillance being carried out. On the other hand, the regulatory authority can obtain this overview by directly approaching the relevant authorities. Furthermore, in most cases a simpler form of notification requirement would not mean that the Swedish Data Protection Authority can act quickly in its oversight activities. The benefits for privacy of such a notification requirement are thus limited, and such a notification requirement ought not to be introduced either.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that a notification requirement does not offer any solution to the lack of a clear preponderance principle once the permit procedure is removed. Consequently, we do not propose any form of notification requirement.</p>
<h2>On the other hand, we do propose retaining the preponderance principle which strengthens privacy protection overall</h2>
<p>The purpose of the preponderance principle in the Video Surveillance Act is to ensure that a proportionality assessment is carried out for each case of video surveillance. The principle makes it clear that privacy aspects are an integral part of assessing the permissibility of an instance of video surveillance. Furthermore, it guarantees that the interest served by the video surveillance has been balanced against the privacy interests of citizens for the video surveillance carried out by authorities for example. The regulation also contains criteria for how these legitimate interests are to be balanced. This balancing of legitimate interests is done today by the Swedish Data Protection Authority as part of the permit procedure.</p>
<p>Even if data protection regulation entail strong protection for privacy aspects, as described above it lacks an explicit equivalent of the preponderance principle. The preponderance principle provides for transparency and predictability in video surveillance, and this is important from the perspective of privacy as well as from the operational perspective. The preponderance principle strengthens privacy protection in the context of video surveillance in relation to the protection that applies generally to personal data processing. Furthermore, the principle provides reference points for when video surveillance is a permissible method to use, thus providing an assurance that video surveillance is being used in a balanced way.</p>
<p>We therefore propose that the preponderance principle shall continue to apply in the future. A condition for the relevant authorities to be permitted to carry out video surveillance should thus be that the public interest in such surveillance outweighs the individual’s interest in not being subjected to surveillance. In balancing these legitimate interests, criteria equivalent to the criteria used in today’s permit procedure are to be observed. The difference is that in the first instance, the authorities themselves are to weigh up these legitimate interests. Furthermore, we propose that the authority carrying out the video surveillance should be required to weigh up these legitimate interests again before implementing any significant changes with respect to any ongoing video surveillance. Such a change might be extending an area in which video surveillance is currently operating, or where new technologies are to be used, provided that these changes entail increased risks to privacy. Similarly, a new balancing of legitimate interests should be done if the circumstances surrounding the video surveillance change significantly in any other way. For example, criminal activity at the place may have reduced in a way that is expected to be lasting even without video surveillance.</p>
<p>It is further proposed that this balancing of legitimate interests should be documented, thus creating a solid foundation for oversight activities.</p>
<p>In order to further strengthen privacy protection in relation to what applies under data protection regulation, and to create a solid foundation for video surveillance being used in the future in a balanced way, we propose that a penalty payment be associated with the balancing of legitimate interests itself. That it can be very costly for an authority to neglect to balance the legitimate interests involved in itself constitutes a further protection of privacy.</p>
<p>Provisions on retaining the preponderance principle with documentation requirements and penalty payments should be included in the Video Surveillance Act.</p>
<p>In order not to hinder the authorities in being able to carry out video surveillance, we propose certain exemptions from the regulation in the Video Surveillance Act that we have proposed above. These exemption circumstances correspond to those that currently apply in relation to the permit requirement.</p>
<h2>Additional privacy protection measures are not necessary</h2>
<p>As described above, the right to respect for privacy is guaranteed in the European Convention, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU and the Instrument of Government of Sweden. Privacy protection in cases of video surveillance has recently been strengthened by data protection regulation, in particular concerning the rights of individuals and through more powerful oversight. In addition, privacy protection is also regulated in for example Sweden’s Video Surveillance Act (as signage requirements) and the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (Swedish Code of Statutes – SFS 2009:400). All in all, this regulation along with our proposals on retaining the preponderance principle with documentation requirements and penalty payments provide sufficiently farreaching privacy protection. Therefore, we do not propose any further privacy protections.</p>
<h2>Effects on effective oversight</h2>
<p>Effective oversight guarantees that video surveillance will continue to be used in a balanced way, and is essential for the implementation of our proposals. Once the permit procedure is removed, the Swedish Data Protection Authority’s oversight will change in that it will involve a higher degree of inspection and correction rather than prevention. However, where the provisions in data protection regulation governing prior consultation are applicable, it is assessed that oversight activities will not change significantly in relation to what currently applies. Beyond this however, the Swedish Data Protection Authority will need to allocate more resources to checking that ongoing video surveillance is compliant with the law; something that is checked in advance as part of the current permit procedure.</p>
<p>That an instance of video surveillance complies with the law also includes compliance with the preponderance principle. The proposal that the balancing of legitimate interests should be documented creates a solid foundation for the Swedish Data Protection Authority to check this. In the context of its oversight activities, the Swedish Data Protection Authority may have a different view on the outcome of the balancing of legitimate interests than the authority in question.</p>
<p>In its oversight activities, the Swedish Data Protection Authority will have the same powers to take steps against improper video surveillance as it has already today under data protection regulation. Thus, through advice, recommendations or remarks, the Swedish Data Protection Authority can attempt to persuade the authority that is the controller of personal data to take corrective action. The Swedish Data Protection Authority can also order a controller of personal data to take action to ensure that the processing is compliant with statute, or prohibit the continuation of the video surveillance if the irregularity is serious. In certain cases, the Swedish Data Protection Authority is also able to make decisions on administrative penalty payments.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposals</h2>
<p>The proposals simplify the relevant authorities’ work with video surveillance, since they will no longer need to apply for a permit before they begin video surveillance. The law enforcement authorities will be able to use video surveillance in a more flexible way that is suited to the purpose of the activity than is currently the case. The proposals lead to increased responsibility for the authorities. The proposals will have positive effects for law enforcement cooperation at the national and international levels. The proposals will also have positive effects for crime prevention activities, and for the prevention of crime in general and for the rule of law. However, removing the permit procedure can also pose certain risks for individuals, including privacy risks. However, these risks are minimised primarily through the protection afforded by data protection regulation, and through the proposal to retain the preponderance principle in the Video Surveillance Act. To the extent that our proposals result in fewer crimes and enhanced security, they also mean greater protection of the individual’s privacy.</p>
<p>The proposals are not expected to lead to increased costs for the relevant authorities, since scope exists within existing financial frameworks.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and provisional regulations</h2>
<p>It is suggested that these proposals enter into force on 1 July 2019 at the same time as permits for the relevant authorities are to expire.</p>
