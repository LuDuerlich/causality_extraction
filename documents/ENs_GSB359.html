<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>On 8 May 2003 the Swedish Government decided to authorise Cabinet minister Mona Sahlin to appoint a Commissioner to analyse and evaluate government grants for the core activities of women’s organisations. The Commissioner’s remit also included proposing changes to adjust this funding to developments in society and women’s organisations since the grants were established.</p>
<p>The Commissioner was to analyse this category of government support in terms of aiding a popular movement, and to evaluate its influence on women’s will and scope for self-organisation, and the democratic merits of the same.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commissioner was instructed to investigate the gender-equality requirements that popular movements and associations must generally meet to be eligible for government funding.</p>
<h2>1 The Commissioner’s assignment</h2>
<p>Under the directives, the Commissioner was assigned to analyse and evaluate the Swedish central government’s grant funding of the core activities of women’s organisations in Sweden. The Commissioner was instructed to propose modifications to adapt this funding to the ways in which society and women’s organisations have developed since the funding was established.</p>
<p>The Commissioner’s remit was to analyse current government support in terms of the women’s popular movement and evaluate its impact on women’s will and capacity to organise themselves, and the democratic merits of this self-organisation.</p>
<p>The Commissioner was also assigned to investigate the genderequality requirements that popular movements and associations must generally meet to be eligible for government grants.</p>
<h2>2 Women’s self-organisation as a democratic force</h2>
<p>Several chapters deal with the analysis of government support for women’s organisations in terms of their function as a popular movement, and the evaluation of how far this support affects women’s will and scope for self-organisation, and of its democratic benefits. However, these topics are covered primarily in the first chapter, concerning women’s self-organisation as a democratic force.</p>
<p>In this chapter, by way of introduction, the Commissioner defines various terms that will be used in ensuing chapters. Among these are civil society, the non-profit sector and non-profit organisations, popular movements, social movements, the women's movement and women’s organisations.</p>
<p>In an overview, the Commissioner also describes how the women’s movement emerged as part of the struggle for democracy at the end of the 19th century. During the 1960s and ’70s, a new type of women’s movement emerged. This challenged the traditional organisational forms both of popular movements and of associations in Sweden. Furthermore, the Commissioner outlines the various categories of women’s groupings contained in the present-day women’s movement. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the need for women to organise themselves in contemporary society.</p>
<h2>3 New forms of women’s self-organisation</h2>
<p>According to the directives, owing to social changes and the manner in which women’s ways of organising themselves have developed, it is now imperative to adapt the forms of support for women’s organizing to new conditions.</p>
<p>Here, the Commissioner therefore considers the scope for broadening the basis of the government grant to include “umbrella organisations”, new forms of organisation such as networks, and various minor women’s groups that need support to influence society and improve their own situation.</p>
<p>This chapter opens with an account of the Government’s policy of assisting democracy and popular movements. A report on material documenting the development of non-profit organisations in civil society follows. Topics covered include the use of associations and foundations.</p>
<p>In a section on alternative forms of organisation, the Commissioner discusses various aspects of the network concept and the impact of the networking culture on Swedish popular movements. The formation of women’s umbrella organisations is described. The chapter concludes with a report on a study of how women organise themselves at local level and on the Internet.</p>
<h2>4 Government grants for non-profit organisations</h2>
<p>The Commissioner’s remit under the directives also includes comparing the size of government grants for women’s organisations with that of such grants for other types of organisations, in relation to member totals in the various types of organisation.</p>
<p>In this chapter, the Commissioner starts by overviewing the various official investigations of government grants for non-profit organisations that have been carried out in the past few decades. With these investigations as their point of departure, a group of researchers at the Stockholm School of Economics have analysed the notions that gave rise to government funding of non-profit organisations in its present form. An account of the group’s analytical model is given.</p>
<p>The bulk of this chapter consists of a review, based on the Commission’s own survey, of the allocation of government grants to non-profit organisations. Various types of grant, and their respective providers and recipients, are described. The providers have replied to the question of how many members constitute the basis of the official funding. They have also replied to the question of whether gender-specific statistics based on government-grant accounts exist.</p>
<h2>5 Government support for women’s organisations</h2>
<p>In this chapter the Commissioner begins by reporting on the motives for establishing official funding of the core activities of women’s organisations, and on the investigation that preceded the government bill to establish this support.</p>
<p>An account of the current nature of government grants and their administration, and of the financial development of women’s organisations that have received these grants, follows. In this context, the Commissioner also describes an evaluation that includes a report on women’s organisations that have forfeited their official funding.</p>
<p>Most of the chapter focuses on the survey, which addresses women’s organisation that receive no government support. In this context, the questionnaire survey that served as an opinion poll on the funding is also described. An account is given here, too, of the umbrella organisations and foundations identified by the Commissioner.</p>
<p>To permit comparison with government funding for women’s organisation in the other Nordic countries, a minor survey on this matter is reported. By way of conclusion, there is a section about women’s organisations formed according to ethnic criteria. The Commissioner reports questionnaire replies from, and viewpoints gathered at a special seminar with, these organisations. Included here, too, is an account of the survey carried out by the Swedish Integration Board to provide a picture of how national organisations formed along ethnic lines work to promote gender equality.</p>
<h2>6 Gender equality in popular movements and associations</h2>
<p>The Riksdag (Swedish Parliament) and Government have laid down the principle that gender equality should be a high-priority policy objective and one that permeates the whole of society. Accordingly, under the directives the Commissioner was instructed to investigate the requirements relating to gender equality that are generally imposed on popular movements and associations for their eligibility to receive government grants. In particular, the Commissioner was to survey and compare the eligibility requirements that organisations must meet to obtain grants, and the accounting requirements to which they must conform.</p>
<p>The Commissioner’s remit was to put forward proposals, based on the conclusions in this analysis, on future treatment of genderequality requirements in state funding for popular movements and associations.</p>
<p>In this chapter, the Commissioner first reports on the emergence and evolution of gender-equality policy. The relationship between this policy and the popular movements is then discussed. One conclusion is that gender equality is regarded by many popular movements as a “non-issue”. This may be because the genderneutral approach adopted by many popular movements has obscured the gender issue.</p>
<p>One section deals with men and women in civil society. Here, the determinants, scope and emphasis of women’s and men’s involvement in portions of civil society are explored. The focus is on gender-role patterns.</p>
<p>The greater part of the chapter is, however, about gender-equality requirements and accounting of state funding for non-profit organisations. Local and regional grants are also examined from a gender-equality point of view.</p>
<h2>7 The Commissioner’s deliberations and proposals Proposed new government grant for women’s self-organisation</h2>
<p>The Commissioner proposes that the current government grant for core activities of women’s organisation be replaced by a new government grant for women’s organising. The purpose of the new grant is to support women’s efforts to organise themselves in groupings of their own. The grant is also intended to promote women’s participation in the democratic process and in society, and to make it possible to monitor women’s rights and pursue women’s demands.</p>
<p>Forms of new government funding</p>
<p>The Commissioner’s premise has been that the existing structure of government grants should be used as far as possible. The Commissioner therefore proposes that government funding for women’s self-organisation should comprise the following elements: ─ Organisation grants to fund the overall activities of women’s organisations, on the grounds that the association’s activity is regarded as being of general interest to society as a whole. ─ Start-up grants to fund newly formed women’s organisations, networks, committees or equivalent bodies that are included in some other non-profit organisation, and which seek to establish themselves as independent associations. ─ Activity grants to fund associations that are to perform certain tasks in return for the support.</p>
<p>Recipients of government grants for women’s self-organisation</p>
<p>The Commissioner proposes that government grants to enable women to organise themselves should be payable to a women’s organisation or other group that includes a women’s network, committee or equivalent body with the function of strengthening the status of women in society, and which fulfils the conditions for official funding.</p>
<p>Legal form of women’s organisations</p>
<p>The Commissioner proposes that women’s organizing should be eligible for government grants to enable women to organise themselves. By “women’s organisations”, the Commissioner means nonprofit associations in which female members are in a majority and the function of the organisation is to bolster women’s status in society.</p>
<p>Women’s self-organisation according to ethnic criteria and national minorities</p>
<p>The Commissioner proposes that women’s organisations, but also other bodies that are not independent women’s organisations, should be able to apply for government grants. They must be legal entities with a women’s committee or corresponding group, such as a women’s network, that forms part of the organisation. The body must fulfil the conditions for government grants in other respects.</p>
<p>Umbrella organisations and foundations</p>
<p>The Commissioner considers that organisation support should not be paid to joint bodies. In the Commissioner’s estimation, these bodies’ spending on coordination measures should be accommodated within the increased organisation support. Collaboration between various national organisations should be the responsibility of the organisations themselves. A foundation does not, in a legal sense, include members as individuals. Accordingly, foundations cannot apply for government funding for women’s self-organisation. On the other hand, the Commissioner considers that the state should be able to support joint bodies and foundations through direct contributions in the form of activity grants for various projects.</p>
<p>Funding party-political women’s organisations</p>
<p>The Commissioner proposes that part of the general activity support in the central government’s grants for political parties be set aside to fund activities in the women’s associations, or equivalent organisations, belonging to the political parties. The Commissioner’s assessment is that channelling funds for party-political women’s organisations through grants for the political parties will help to finance the overall increase in support for women’s organisations as a whole. Since the party-political women’s organisations receive support in other ways, this will contribute to an increase in support for other women’s organisations as well.</p>
<p>Conditions for organisation grants</p>
<p>The Commissioner proposes that the following conditions be applied to the provision of organisation grants. To receive such grants, organisations must: ─ conduct the kinds of activities that satisfy the purpose of the government grant ─ have members who are individually affiliated and who share the basic values and objectives of the organisation ─ be democratically constructed, i.e. have a structure that enables the members to demand accountability ─ have a national organisation with activities that have local or regional roots or are of nationwide interest ─ have conducted activities for at least three years before the grant application.</p>
<p>Extra organisation support for international contacts</p>
<p>The Commissioner proposes that organisation grants may, following a special application, be provided for the international contacts of organisations receiving this form of support.</p>
<p>Conditions for start-up grants</p>
<p>The Commissioner proposes special start-up grants for newly formed organisations that do not fulfil all the requirements for obtaining organisation grants. These start-up grants should be payable for a maximum of three years. They may, for example, enable a women’s committee or equivalent body within another organisation to test, for a three-year period, whether it wishes to establish itself as an independent organisation or remain part of the national organisation.</p>
<p>Conditions for activity grants</p>
<p>The Commissioner proposes that activity grants be payable for women’s self-organisation for activities that are, first, aimed at involving women for specific purposes and, second, of general interest to the whole of society. Activity grants should also be payable to organisations that do not fulfil all the requirements for organisation grants, such as umbrella organisations and foundations. Activity funding should be based on a dialogue and agreement between the grant provider and the women’s organisation.</p>
<p>Financial implications of the Commissioner’s proposals</p>
<p>The Commissioner estimates that, besides the 18 organisations receiving support at present, some 20 women’s organisations will apply for grants. The Commissioner calculates that each organisation needs basic financial support of some SEK 400,000. If 35 organisations receive grants of SEK 400,000 each, it would entail a cost of SEK 14 million.</p>
<p>The Commissioner’s estimate of support for international contacts is SEK 1 million. Each start-up grant would be for an estimated SEK 100,000 annually, so if 20 organisations applied for start-up grants the cost would amount to SEK 2 million.</p>
<p>The Commissioner calculates that activity grants cost SEK 350,000 per organisation. If activity grants were to be approved for 37 organisations, it would entail a cost of SEK 13 million. On these assumptions, the cost of the new government funding is estimated at SEK 30 million, distributed among 35 − 60 women’s organisations.</p>
<p>When it comes to calculating support for the women’s organisations of the political parties, the Commissioner estimates that 10 per cent of the parties’ official funding should be used to support their women’s organisations. This would represent SEK 14 million.</p>
<h2>8 Proposed administration of the new governmentgrant system</h2>
<p>Administration in the Government Offices</p>
<p>Under the directives, the Commissioner was charged with investigating the scope for delegating administration of funding issues relating to women’s organizing to a public agency other than the Government Offices, and to present the advantages and disadvantages of doing so. The Commissioner’s remit also included clarifying the financial implications of delegating this administration to another agency.</p>
<p>The Commissioner’s assessment is that the current administration of the support is unsatisfactory. The Commissioner considers that there is no reason why support for women’s organisations should be dealt with within a ministry. In other contexts, it is usually deemed inappropriate for the Government to assume the role of a public authority.</p>
<p>Administration by another agency</p>
<p>The Commissioner has examined the scope for entrusting other existing agencies with responsibility for future grant administration. However, the Commissioner has not found that any of these options is suitable for the task. The following bodies have been considered as possible candidates for the task of administering and distributing government support for women’s self-organisation: ─ the Equal Opportunities Ombudsman (JämO) ─ the National Board for Youth Affairs ─ the Swedish National Council of Adult Education</p>
<p>Administration at the National Board of Health and Welfare</p>
<p>The Commissioner has also assessed the scope for a delegation at the National Board of Health and Welfare (NBHW) to administer, and decide how to distribute, government funding for women’s self-organisation. In the Commissioner’s view, there are ample reasons why NBHW should be able to administer the support. However, the Commissioner’s assessment is that support for women’s organising is not a natural component of NBHW’s sphere of responsibility.</p>
<p>Administration at a newly formed agency for gender equality</p>
<p>The Commissioner proposes that a special gender-equality agency, when such an agency is set up, be made responsible for administering the new government grant for women’s self-organisation. The Commissioner considers that the agency form is essential, given the need for a capacity to monitor gender-equality issues more continuously and carry out strategic follow-up studies.</p>
<p>Administration at a board</p>
<p>The Commissioner’s assessment is, however, that the setting-up of a “Gender Equality Agency” is an issue that lies several years ahead in time. The Commissioner therefore proposes, pending the establishment of the new agency, that plans for distribution of government support for women’s self-organisation be prepared and adopted by a special board. Once setting-up of the agency is completed, the information can be transferred from the board to a department at the new agency.</p>
<p>The Commissioner’s assessment is that the costs of administration and a secretariat for the board would amount to SEK 3.5 million a year. This expense includes the Ministry of Justice’s current cost of administering the support, which is estimated at SEK 500,000.</p>
<h2>9 Proposed  gender-equality requirements for state funding of popular movements</h2>
<p>Requirement of gender equality in grant ordinances</p>
<p>The Commissioner’s view is that a key element in the further strategy for gender-equality integration is that considerations of gender equality, and gender, must be integrated into popular-movement policy and government funding. The Commissioner therefore proposes, as a means of clarifying the stipulation of democratic organisation laid down in most ordinances on government grants, that the requirement of a gender-equality perspective be inserted into ordinances and official appropriation documents.</p>
<p>The Riksdag and Government have laid down the principle that gender equality is a high-priority policy objective that should permeate the whole of society. The Commissioner has found that, with a few exceptions, the grant ordinances impose no special requirements that organisations should work for gender equality.</p>
<p>Proposal on systematic reporting of gender equality</p>
<p>According to the Commissioner’s proposal, agencies that distribute government funding to organisations should systematically report on their gender-equality efforts by disclosing ─ figures on gender distribution in the  grant-receiving organisations ─ figures on age and gender distribution in the central governing boards of the  grant-receiving organisations ─ the  grant-receiving organisations’ ways of implementing a gender-equality perspective</p>
<p>Implications of the Commissioner’s proposals</p>
<p>One implication of the Commissioner’s proposals is thought to be that the grant providers must introduce and clarify special feedback requirements for organisations and associations that receive government grants. However, the Commissioner considers that it is insufficient for organisations merely to disclose gender-specific figures. They must also develop methods of making visible the organisations’ internal distribution of public funds.</p>
<p>One consequence of the grant providers introducing and clarifying special feedback requirements as a condition for obtaining government grants will be that the recipient organisations and associations, to obtain official support, will be obliged to carry out qualitative, as well as quantitative reporting on their own activities from a gender perspective.</p>
<h2>10 Proposed financing of the new government grant for women’s  self-organisation</h2>
<p>Conceivable sources of finance</p>
<p>The Commissioner has considered various possible sources of finance for the new government grant for women’s self-organisation. As a principal option, the Commissioner proposes that a certain proportion of the surplus from the state-owned AB Svenska Spel, Sweden’s largest gaming company, be spent on support for women’s self-organisation.</p>
<p>The Commissioner also propose that 10 per cent of the parties’ official funding should be used to support their women’s organisations. This would represent SEK 14 million.</p>
<p>The Commissioner has also considered the option of transferring to the appropriation for women’s self-organisation a defined share of the appropriations – amounting to SEK 30 million – for the following recipient categories:</p>
<p>─ popular education</p>
<p>─ gender-equality projects</p>
<p>─ development assistance</p>
<p>─ voluntary defence organisations.</p>
<p>Funding the special board</p>
<p>The Commissioner has also considered how best to finance the board that would, as proposed, perform the function of distributing government funds for women’s self-organisation. In the Commissioner’s view, it should be possible to use the amount saved on this year’s appropriations for the Government Offices etc to finance the proposed board, since it may be regarded as part of the Government Offices’ activities.</p>
