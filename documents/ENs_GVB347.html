<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit of the Inquiry</h2>
<p>The original remit of the IT Standards Inquiry, set by the Government in April 2006, was to submit proposals on ways of improving the coordination of IT standardisation. This applied both to the necessary coordination of standardisation work in response to EU decisions on standardisation and to internal coordination within the Swedish public administration. The Inquiry was also instructed to consider whether and how open software, i.e. applications based on open source software, should be promoted.</p>
<p>In supplementary terms of reference issued in November 2006, the Inquiry was further instructed to consider and propose ways of speeding up the introduction of e-government, enhancing egovernment security and promoting electronic procurement, and to examine the legal implications of open source software.</p>
<p>A brief summary of the Inquiry’s findings is presented below.</p>
<h2>Some basic observations</h2>
<p>The title of the present report “The Invisible Infrastructure” is a reference to the fact that standards – including IT standards – are unnoticeable when they are in place and functioning properly. It is only when they are lacking that their absence is noticed and problems arise. To a large extent, they are also invisible to those responsible for operations in the course of the decision-making process. Although operational decisions, e.g. procurement of e-services, often involve choosing standards, these do not seem to be taken separately or expressly, at least at this level, but are a tacit outcome of operational decisions of different kinds. The purpose of our report is therefore to make IT standards visible and to spotlight some of the consequences of their selection.</p>
<p>Another basic observation we have made is that IT standards must be viewed in several aspects. IT standards in the public administration cannot be coordinated from a single vantage point or from within one and the same body. We have identified the following arenas for discussion of IT standardisation in the public sector:</p>
<p>Swedish coordination in response to EU decisions e-government industrial policy gaining an overall view of IT standardisation as an organisational system.</p>
<p>Basically, the summary is structured into three levels: government responsibility for IT standardisation at national level and coordination at international level, responsibility for IT standardisation as part of the operational tasks of government agencies, municipal and county councils, public bodies concerned with standardisation, etc.</p>
<p>The role of the Swedish Administrative Development Agency and other government authorities responsible for developing common specifications for the public administration and the coordination of IT standardisation work.</p>
<p>It should be noted that in certain areas, e.g. information security, our proposals could have been divided into a number of categories, to be dealt with at several levels. However, such issues are best addressed where their centre of gravity lies – primarily within the agencies’ operational responsibilities in the case of information security.</p>
<p>However, we begin with a discussion of overall policy issues arising in connection with the choice of standards.</p>
<h2>Policies concerning choice of standards</h2>
<p>The Inquiry began by examining the various sets of standards currently in place and how these are developed and applied in different types of organisation. The term ‘standard’ was understood both in its everyday sense of a commonly accepted or approved example of something against which other things are judged or measured, and in a more specific sense, namely the outcome of a standardisation process. The term embraces all types of standards as well as agreements on how a thing is to be constituted, embodied in a specification.</p>
<p>In its latest IT Bill (2004/05:175), the Government has declared that the use of open standards should be promoted. Examples of the above include formal standards established by recognised EU standardisation bodies such as the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN), the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (CENELEC). However, there are numerous other standards, some of which are essential to the operation of the internet, that meet stringent requirements of openness. All standards exhibiting a reasonable degree of openness are normally referred to as open standards.</p>
<p>Provisions governing the invoking of standards, where formal standards are the principal alternative, are set out in the current Public Procurement Act. Despite this, proprietary software applications predominate in public procurement. Given the existence of effectively functioning open standards in a range of areas, efforts should be made to apply these in public procurement. Such an aim should also be reflected in framework procurement contracts.</p>
<p>The need to refer to informal standards in regulations based on EU directives and procurement legislation can give rise to problems. This is possible in principle provided it can be shown that the choice of standards is not discriminating. The legal position is unclear and requires further elucidation. However, Sweden should actively seek – and for its part adopt an interpretation that will make it possible in practice – to promote direct reference to IT standards developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) and similar bodies.</p>
<p>A number of other countries have laid down guidelines on the use of document formats based on formal standards, the so-called open document format. Belgium, Denmark, Australia, Norway and the US state of Massachusetts are examples of places where software formats for ordinary office documents used in public administration or to communicate with citizens, such as word processing, spreadsheet and presentation programs, must be based on</p>
<p>ISO standards. At present, the few formats regarded as applicable that meet these requirements, are specific versions of the Portable Document Format (PDF) and the Open Document Format (ODF).</p>
<p>In our view, public authorities should be able to receive all types of documents that normally occur in the market, are widely used by the general public and have been designed in accordance with technical specifications based on formal standards – referred to in everyday parlance as ‘open document format’. Whether authorities also choose to use the open document format in other contexts, i.e. when communicating with citizens, is, in our view, a matter for them. If authorities are to be required to offer open document formats in communications with citizens, the Government will need to ensure that support for the development of suitable products is available in this area.</p>
<p>The National Archives are currently drafting a regulation on technical specifications for automatic processing, i.e. document storage facilitated by IT. The regulation, which is concerned inter alia with the use of open document formats in the public administration, is based on provisions in the Archives Act (1990:782) and the Archives Ordinance (1991:446). Prescribing the formats in which public authorities must save incoming or newly created electronic documents ensures that the former have access to the necessary software applications and can communicate with members of the public with their help.</p>
<p>Proposals</p>
<p>• That the use of formal standards for electronic information management be promoted in the case of authorities accountable to the Government.</p>
<p>• That the Government also instruct the Administrative Development Agency to attach particular importance to the longterm implications of using standards with a high degree of openness when drafting tender model specifications for framework contracts. If this proposal is adopted, the agency should be required to report annually on progress in this area.</p>
<p>• That Sweden actively seek the adoption of an EU position on public procurement that allows reference to be made to other than formal standards. Such a position, which would apply at national as well as EU level, would make it possible in practice to refer to IT standards developed by the IETF, OASIS, W3C, UN/CEFACT and other, similar bodies that provide widely adopted standards but are not recognised in the sense understood in Community law.</p>
<p>• That the Government commission the National Archives to issue regulations permitting authorities covered by the Archives Act to store electronic documents which are in a widely used format based on standards provided by recognised standards bodies.</p>
<h2>The Government’s national responsibility</h2>
<p>Coordinating the preparation of EU standardisation matters</p>
<p>Our remit includes drafting up proposals for coordinating the preparation of standards-related matters more effectively, in accordance with directive 98/34 EC. The purpose of the directive is to prevent national IT standards, regulations and administrative provisions from creating trade barriers and thereby restricting the free movement of “goods, persons, services and capital” in the single market.</p>
<p>We have found that it is difficult for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, which deals with these issues in collaboration with the National Board of Trade, to obtain supporting data and material on matters proceeding from the EU from the relevant sectors and experts in the public sector, despite efforts to create networks in government ministries and agencies. One reason for this may be the lack of a permanently established group of administrative officers and experts, owing in turn to the varied nature of IT standardisation issues and the fact that these are often so specific that the possible number of experts is always likely to be inadequate. We have attempted to solve this problem by proposing a network or council made up of people representing different activities and pursuits in the community affected by IT standardisation. Such a network in our view could more easily locate the parties concerned and elicit opinions on the issue in question.</p>
<p>Proposal</p>
<p>• That an IT standardisation council be set up with a view to improving the preparation of matters referred to in Directive 98/34 EC. The council should be composed of representatives of the most important government, municipal and county council authorities and organisations, people in the industry/trade sector directly concerned with standardisation and other experts, e.g. from standardisation bodies, including the ITS and SEK, ministries, etc. As matters proposed for comitology procedures may also be  standards-related, consideration should also be given to the inclusion of experts in such areas, e.g. from Geographical Information Systems (GIS).</p>
<p>To ensure reasonably effective physical meetings with all present, the number of council members (excluding the chair) should not exceed 30. However, members will communicate principally via e-mail. Should the need arise, assessors with special expertise, would of course be able to take part in council meetings. The council would be tasked with assisting the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the National Board of Trade in framing Swedish positions on international IT standardisation issues. It would also be required to take part in discussions and exchanges of information on issues relating to international IT standardisation.</p>
<p>The administrative work – referring proposals for comment, receiving and collating comments from referral bodies and the administration of council affairs – could in our view be handled by a single officer.</p>
<p>The council’s composition, tasks and financing should be decided by a special agreement between the Government and the Swedish Standards Council, in which case the council should form part of the latter organisation. If an agreement with the Swedish Standards Council cannot be reached, however, the council should be established under the National Board of Trade, in which case its chair and members would be appointed by the latter.</p>
<p>IT standardisation as an organisational system</p>
<p>There is at present no clear division of roles and responsibilities among the various actors concerned and thus no clearly designated body with overall responsibility for issues arising in connection with IT standardisation, task allocation and general financing. There are many actors involved: ministries, government agencies, The Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions, municipal and county councils, companies, industry/trade organisations and other cooperation bodies, the Swedish Standards Council, the Swedish Standards Institute, the Swedish Centre for Terminology, etc.</p>
<p>While it is in the interests of all the above that overall assessments are undertaken, no single player seems to have been assigned a sufficiently overarching role. What is needed is a cross-sectoral, inter-ministerial body tasked with monitoring the entire organisational system for IT standardisation, especially that part of it concerned with the public sector. The Swedish Standards Council would be the obvious candidate for such a role.</p>
<p>Proposal</p>
<p>• That the Swedish Standards Council be assigned to inquire into the following matters in collaboration with the Swedish Standards Institute and the Administrative Development Agency:</p>
<p>• How can financing be arranged to improve access to standards developed by the Swedish Standards Institute, particularly in the IT sphere, e.g. in cases where reference is made to standards prescribed in regulations?</p>
<p>• In what areas of the public sector can the Swedish Standards Institute be advantageously employed to develop standards, e.g. requirements common to the public administration as a whole and concept standards?</p>
<p>• What changes in the working methods of the Swedish Standards Institute would facilitate closer overall cooperation between it and public authorities?</p>
<p>• The establishment of a coordinated system of standards registers, requirements common to the public administration as a whole, etc. with a view to meeting the need for a centrally administered standards inventory classified by area of application and providing an overview of the purpose and content of each standard.</p>
<p>• What other special inquiries should be undertaken to provide background data for proposals on how standardisation in general – with particular reference to IT standardisation – can be made more efficient and effective?</p>
<p>Implications for Swedish industrial policy</p>
<p>With regard to electronic communications, i.e. IT delivered by the telecoms sector, the physical IT infrastructure and the services directly associated with it, the relationship between service design and development and the structure of the market has been clearly established, partly through a special law, the Electronic Communications Act, whose main purpose is to safeguard competition in the market. The National Post and Telecom Agency is the authority responsible for these matters.</p>
<p>However, in the case of IT services higher up the value chain, e.g. e-government services, market functions and similar industrial policy issues are not accorded the same level of attention. Other examples of industrial policy issues and questions:</p>
<p>• should the main costs be borne by enterprises or the public sector?</p>
<p>• the degree of involvement by the Swedish Standards Institute,</p>
<p>• the significance of IT standards for innovation and research,</p>
<p>• the need for more information on IT standards, in particular among SMEs,</p>
<p>• the need to boost competition, inter alia in the computer consultancy market, and between document formats through the introduction of open standards and open source code,</p>
<p>• growth promotion through wider use of IT standards,</p>
<p>• measures to prevent municipal and county councils from getting locked into supplier solutions.</p>
<p>Proposals</p>
<p>• That the Government commission the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth and the Institute for Growth Policy Studies to monitor industrial policy aspects of IT standardisation, as follows:</p>
<p>• The Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth: the importance of IT standards to small enterprises and their development in certain markets, and</p>
<p>• The Institute for Growth Policy Studies: the effect of standards on the market and competitiveness.</p>
<p>These tasks can be assigned on a regular basis in the agencies’ annual appropriation directions. The agencies would be required to submit outcome reports to the Government.</p>
<p>• That the Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems be assigned to continuously monitor the industrial policy implications of IT standardisation in the spheres of innovation and research.</p>
<h2>Agencies’ operational responsibilities</h2>
<p>Agency responsibility for interoperability</p>
<p>To ensure continued development of IT support in the public administration, it will be necessary to promote closer cooperation between and within agencies and municipal and county councils, and to focus on improving conditions for interoperability, that is effective methods of information exchange. We have provided a number of examples of the need, both in local government and among citizens, for interoperability between government agencies’ information systems. Above all, the terms and concepts used in IT applications must be standardised.</p>
<p>Although enhancing interoperability is a costly undertaking, it enables wider use of IT. To ensure that interoperability is given due prominence in agency operations, each government agency should have an information exchange officer responsible for ensuring that effective methods and procedures for information exchange are in place. We mean by the latter everything contained within the concept of interoperability – a term unfortunately considered too alien to the Swedish language to be used in legislative contexts – including responsibility for access, e.g. by people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Interoperability must be embedded at all levels of the system – technical, semantic, organisational and judicial – as its absence at any one level could be sufficient to impair its overall effectiveness. The judicial level is included to emphasise that development of the legal system must keep pace with that of the other three levels if interoperability is to be realised in practice.</p>
<p>In order to ensure a fair and reasonably uniform assessment of developments, all public actors should be required to map and document their collaboration with other agencies and, in particular, any opportunities for electronic information exchanges already taking place or that need to be introduced. At the Administrative Development Agency, such a survey is already under way as part of its government assignment to coordinate the automation of case handling. This will focus on interoperability, i.e. communication between agencies’ information systems.</p>
<p>Proposals</p>
<p>• That every government agency appoint a person to be responsible for promoting electronic information exchange in the public administration (information exchange officer).</p>
<p>• That all government agencies be tasked with mapping and documenting activities involving the exchange of information, including associated information structures, communication solutions and regulatory frameworks, with a view to facilitating a coherent overall picture of the sector’s need for common solutions in this sphere.</p>
<p>Information security</p>
<p>Every government agency and public body is accountable for its own information security as part of its overall operational responsibility.</p>
<p>The vision of a coherent e-government environment presupposes greater scope for communication between agency registers and IT applications, inter alia to make it easier for citizens, businesses and municipal and county councils to communicate with the complex government administration. However, increasing the number of links between administrative systems also heightens the vulnerability of the system as a whole as security problems in one part of the system spread to other parts. Thus the more coherent egovernment becomes the more attention must be given to security issues. Greater consideration must therefore be given to IT security standards.</p>
<p>Authorities should ensure that information security is handled appropriately, either through more stringent controls of its own or through certification accredited under ISO/IEC Standard 27001 and the corresponding official Swedish version, Information Security Management Systems (LIS). This would not only be a confidence-building measure for e-government but would also help improve security among IT suppliers. While LIS is a standard for a system that specifies what needs to be monitored from an organisational perspective, the Swedish Emergency Management Agency’s Basic Level for IT Security (BITS) is a set of recommendations on security measures at IT systems level. Smaller agencies may find BITS a suitable first stage before moving on to LIS. However, for agencies whose information security requirements are less stringent, LIS certification is probably too radical a measure.</p>
<p>A number of government authorities have an important part to play here. Cooperation between these agencies takes place under the auspices of the Joint Action Group on Information Security (SAMFI). Overall responsibility for information security in Sweden rests with the Swedish Emergency Management Agency. The role of the Administrative Development Agency in this context is to monitor the development of e-government standardisation in the information security domain, submit policy proposals and be responsible for the dissemination of knowledge and information concerning standards, a task that needs to be defined with increasing clarity in terms of direction and delimitation.</p>
<p>Proposal</p>
<p>• That the Administrative Development Agency be commissioned to conduct a detailed examination of how cost considerations affect the dissemination and use of  e-government information security standards in government agencies.</p>
<p>Assessment</p>
<p>• Agencies taking part in procurement of  e-government IT services and equipment should define their own organisation’s security requirements in relation to what is to be procured.</p>
<p>• The Administrative Development Agency should pursue efforts to draw up a regulation that specifies ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 (LIS) respectively as bases for agency efforts to improve information security, and possibly also develop an improved version of the Swedish Emergency Management Agency’s methodological tool, BITS, as a platform for establishing a basic level of information security.</p>
<p>Open source software</p>
<p>In its IT Bill (2004/05:175), the Government declared that the use of open standards and open source software should be promoted and that developments in the open source software domain should be followed up on a regular basis. These measures would, in the Government’s view, provide opportunities to reduce the cost of IT use and encourage competition in the software sphere.</p>
<p>The Administrative Development Agency's analysis (commissioned by the Inquiry) led it to the conclusion that open standards and interfaces, not open source software, should be promoted as a first priority. Another conclusion was that in normal circumstances open source software must be able to compete in the market on its own merits. The exceptions are software applications especially adapted for use in areas of the Swedish public administration such as childcare planning. In certain cases, getting such applications up and running may require support. It may be necessary to promote the features common to programs of this kind. Also important is the presence of a maintenance organisation that is sustainable over the long term.</p>
<p>One way of ensuring that programs developed in house are reused is to encourage government agencies to contribute to the open software repository provided by eGovforge, a project concerned with open software and open software development in the public sector. The project was initiated by the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions with the aim of promoting closer collaboration and more efficient use of IT. This is an effective way of stimulating the development of open software, not just in the municipal sector but throughout the public sector.</p>
<p>Other repositories, such as SourceForge, can also be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>Assessment</p>
<p>• Government agencies should contribute open software developed in house to eGovforge and other similar repositories, provided this is permitted under relevant licensing terms and conditions.</p>
<p>• A guidance should be drawn up with recommendations on how agencies should go about acquiring and developing open software and procuring support services for the latter, and how they should proceed so as to facilitate  re-use of the programs they have developed.</p>
<h2>The Swedish Administrative Development Agency’s coordinating function</h2>
<p>A central expert unit responsible for interoperability and IT standardisation at the Administrative Development Agency</p>
<p>Improvements in the handling of EC IT standardisation matters with the help of a new coordinating body have been proposed above. This should be clearly distinguished from the coordination of IT standardisation in the Swedish public administration, the other principal concern of the Inquiry. We are dealing here with two distinct coordination processes, and it is essential to preclude any suspicion that Sweden’s handling of EC matters might be influenced by the public administration’s own interest in standards that could take on national characteristics.</p>
<p>New development of the IT structure, which has accelerated since the turn of the millennium, presupposes a centrally coordinating body supported by central experts, if standardised development is to be achieved. The larger central agencies have already begun building up central expertise, and inter-agency collaboration networks have been created. Our proposal is that central IT stan-</p>
<p>dardisation and interoperability expertise at the Administrative Development Agency be strengthened to a corresponding degree.</p>
<p>The agency’s main task in this connection is to act as “roof” i.e. to ensure that matters relating to standards and standardisation in e-government do not get lost in the decentralised public administration, but that where necessary responsibility for initiatives is taken at some level so that there is an unbroken chain of responsibility.</p>
<p>Coordination can be undertaken on a voluntary basis; there is no need to give the agency regulatory powers beyond those which already exist. In some cases, this central coordinating role may be a matter of pursuing a specific standardisation matter, e.g. a certain adaptation or a profile. The agency has proposed the term ‘common specification’ or ‘administration-wide specification’ to denote this need for coordination within the administration.</p>
<p>To support efforts to develop shared specifications for the coordination of agency interoperability, the Administrative Development Agency can develop a common interoperability structure or architecture. Work on this has already begun. This means that agencies voluntarily agree, after negotiations have taken place, that such a structure should serve as reference framework.</p>
<p>Even in cases where common specifications are not aimed at the development of a new standard, or an advanced profiling of an existing standard, an opportunity should be provided at some stage for all interests to be heard. This applies particularly to specifications which are not exclusively intended to be used in connection with the management of public sector operations. Other interested parties, such as the industry sector and stakeholder groups can bring their influence to bear in at least two ways. When necessary and appropriate, the Administrative Development Agency can turn to an official standards body, such as the Swedish Standards Institute, with a call for expressions of interest. Agencies themselves can also choose to address IT standardisation matters of relevance to their sector in special groups where they and other interested parties, such as enterprises, stakeholder groups, other authorities, municipal and county councils, etc. can prepare the matter in question, a Swedish adaptation of the Danish approach.</p>
<p>The distribution among government agencies of expert resources in architecture and standardisation is an important issue. Although there is a stronger perceived spirit of collaboration, and participation in joint networks is considered to have increased sig-</p>
<p>nificantly in recent years, the tendency towards sectorisation will be difficult to counter as long as a number of big agencies each dispose of more expertise than the authorities at cross-sectoral level. If the expert unit is to function effectively it must above all work closely with industry and with agencies with large experts staffs as well as practical IT standardisation experience in the field.</p>
<p>Proposals</p>
<p>• That a central administrative unit (an interoperability and standardisation secretariat) be set up within the Administrative Development Agency with responsibility for developing and promoting interoperability, coordinating, establishing, publishing and maintaining common specifications, and providing methodological and expert support in IT standardisation matters, particularly concept standards in the public administration. A procedural framework for the promotion of interoperability in the public administration should be developed and managed as a guide for this undertaking. An open  web-based catalogue service should be created to implement the common specifications.</p>
<p>• That where possible and appropriate technical specifications and similar requirements governing the handling and exchange of information be developed within a forum open to all parties such as the Swedish Standards Institute. Such standardisation work should be promoted by the Administrative Development Agency.</p>
<p>Forms of procurement</p>
<p>Although many individual actors among customers and suppliers alike may well see the need for agreement on how something should be constituted, none has the energy, time or expertise to undertake the work needed to achieve this sort of consensus. On the supplier side, this may be due to reasons of competition. On the agency side, initiatives may be hampered by budgetary, time and other constraints.</p>
<p>One solution could be the introduction of a unifying actor. Companies should not need to turn to more than one agency for</p>
<p>help. The aim here is to coordinate the procuring authorities before the procurement process begins. It is important that the task of coordinating the specification of procurement requirements assigned to the Administrative Development Agency is kept separate from the agency’s work on framework contract procurement, not because the two are mutually contradictory but because each has a different focus: in the former case, the emphasis is on the agency’s own interest in coordinating its requirement specification, while the development of framework contracts is a centralised expert function.</p>
<p>Assessment</p>
<p>• A special unit with responsibility for coordinating public IT procurement should be set up at the Administrative Development Agency with the task of promoting  inter-agency coordination of the development of common procurement requirements specifications, which can subsequently be used in tender dossiers in the IT domain.</p>
<p>Electronic procurement</p>
<p>Work on electronic commerce was focused initially on parts of the procurement process following the awarding of contracts, i.e. price list management, suborders (i.e. call off against framework agreement), ordering and invoice management. One reason why efforts were concentrated on elements of the procurement process subsequent to the contract allocation stage was that suborders are the most important part of the process in terms of volume. They involve many users and it was expected that more efficient requisitioning and invoice management would yield substantial savings. Another reason was that functional e-commerce was not possible under then existing legislation.</p>
<p>Work on the subsequent stages of the procurement process, i.e. from suborders to receipt of invoice – here referred to as ecommerce – was undertaken as part of the Single Face to Industry project. The Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions, the Administrative Development Agency (then the Swedish Agency for Public Management) and the National Financial Mana-</p>
<p>gement Authority have continued to collaborate within this project on standardisation and other processes aimed at promoting ecommerce, along with suppliers of goods and services and systems suppliers. Some work on the procurement process prior to the contract allocation stage has also been undertaken within framework of the Single Face to Industry project.</p>
<p>There is an expectation that e-commerce will get under way of its own accord. However, given the unexpectedly high threshold at which the self-sustaining mechanism is set to kick in, attention must be given to the entire procurement process and not merely to the final ordering and invoice stage.</p>
<p>This entails establishing conditions conducive to the re-use of information in different stages of the process by clarifying the information structures. In the case of certain parts of the procurement process, the tendering and award process , it may be opportune for the public sector, working in collaboration with interested parties in industry, to develop common specifications setting out functional requirements e.g. with regard to processes and concept and information structures. Preparations for the development of common specifications and preparatory standardisation can already be started and any necessary adjustments made as conditions, in the form of new legislation, grow clearer. The actual standardisation work can be undertaken as part of the Single Face to Industry project.</p>
<p>Proposal</p>
<p>• That the Government commission the Administrative Development Agency, acting in collaboration with the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions and interested parties in industry, to draw up an action plan for the introduction of common specifications for the electronic procurement process as it relates to the tendering and award process, and that the following preparatory work be undertaken:</p>
<p>• Preparation of a guidance on the design of tender reception procedures.</p>
<p>• Clarification of terminology and information structures at the initial stage of the procurement process.</p>
<p>• Development of common specifications for certain parts of the procurement process, setting out functional requirements, e.g. with regard to processes and concept and information structures.</p>
