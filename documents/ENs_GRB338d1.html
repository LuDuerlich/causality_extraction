<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Terms of reference</h2>
<p>The Swedish Government resolved in April 2001, with the work of realising the strategy to bring about a further green tax shift in prospect, to convene a special committee. The resulting Swedish Committee on Energy Taxation of the Business Sector, which was parliamentary in composition, was assigned to investigate the form of regulations governing reductions in tax on energy used for heating purposes and operation of stationary motors, in sectors exposed to international competition. The Committee’s terms of reference included proposing suitable criteria for what should be regarded as activities subject to competition, and analysing how far such activities should warrant energy-tax reliefs. The Committee was also assigned to investigate alternative definitions, other than those in use at present, of activities eligible for energy-tax reliefs in the sectors subject to competition.</p>
<p>One of the Committee’s tasks is to monitor developments in the EU and adjust its analysis according to the requirements of Community law. Particular attention is to be paid to Community regulations concerning state aid.</p>
<p>Another of the Committee’s tasks is to carry out a review of the regulations concerning collection of electricity taxes.</p>
<h2>Current system of energy taxation</h2>
<p>In Sweden, fuels are currently subject to energy and carbon dioxide (CO ) taxes, with specific rates for each energy carrier. Biofuels are tax-exempt, but crude tall oil is taxed for industrial-policy reasons. Electricity is subject to energy tax, at rates varying both among and within different sectors of society.</p>
<p>The tax base of the business sector is currently divided into three sectors: industry  (agriculture, forestry, pisciculture and greenhouse cultivation; mining and quarrying; and manufacturing industry), energy  (electricity, gas, heating and water supply) and other sectors  (building, public-sector activities, transport and other services).</p>
<p>In the current energy-tax system, a relatively low tax level (compared with ‘other sectors’) is applied to energy used for heating and operation of stationary motors in manufacturing industry, and also in agriculture, forestry and pisciculture. For manufacturing industry (including mining and quarrying), the reduction regulations cover the energy used in the actual manufacturing process in industrial activities. For other energy use in manufacturing industry, taxation is the same as for the ‘other sectors’. Broadly, the following reductions apply:</p>
<p>• General reduction for the industrial sector (‘industrial tax rate’); no energy tax and only 25 per cent of the CO tax are paid on fuels used for purposes other than operation of motor vehicles, and no energy tax is paid on electricity.</p>
<p>• The 0.8 per cent rule applies throughout the industrial sector: a reduction is granted for the portion of CO tax that exceeds 0.8 per cent of sales value, and the tax rate on this excess portion is 24 per cent.</p>
<p>• The 1.2 per cent rule applies to certain industries: for manufacture of goods from  non-metallic minerals (e.g. cement, limestone, stone and glass), an additional reduction is granted for tax on coal and natural gas. These companies are exempt from the portion of CO tax that exceeds 1.2 per cent of sales value.</p>
<p>Further, regarding energy taxation of the industrial sector, ‘energy raw materials’ are exempt from taxation. If fuel is used other than as motor fuels or for heating purposes, or in a process where the fuel is used for other than these purposes in all essentials, no tax is levied. A similar regulation applies to electricity, although –– owing to the zero tax rate –– it currently serves no function.</p>
<p>In the energy-conversion sector, fuels used to produce electricity are tax-exempt. Tax is charged, instead, at the consumption stage through energy tax on electricity. Full energy tax and CO tax are paid on fuels used to generate heat in district heating plants. For heat production in combined heat and power plants, the energy tax is reduced by 50 per cent while full CO tax is payable. Industrial</p>
<p>CHP, i.e. industrial combined heat and power production, is subject to the industrial tax rate and thus exempt from energy tax, but 25 per cent CO tax is paid on input fuels. However, the Government has proposed making the tax regulations concerning CHP in district heating the same as those applying to industrial CHP production. For electricity, there is a slightly lower tax rate than that applied in the ‘other sectors’.</p>
<p>Finally, the ‘other sectors’ are burdened, like the ‘household sector’, with the full level of energy tax, as well as CO tax.</p>
<h2>Problems of present energy-tax structure</h2>
<p>The biggest problem with the current model of energy taxation in the business sector is the sectorial classification. Sweden’s EU membership means that Community regulations concerning state aid apply, one key rule being that a Member State may not apply differentiated tax levels within the business sector. These state-aid regulations have recently, and since this Committee’s directives were adopted, increasingly come into focus and must  be taken into account in the design of a new energy-tax system. One consideration governing this focus has been the European Court of Justice’s judgment in the Adria-Wien Pipeline case. In brief, this judgment – – which was issued on 8 November 2001 and related to the application of Community state-aid regulations –– laid down that selecting certain segments of the business sector and giving them fiscal advantages over others amounts to state aid. The judgment has enhanced awareness of the rules in the EC Treaty and the problems undoubtedly associated with drafting special regulations of the type this Committee has been assigned to investigate.</p>
<p>Among the various unclear implications of the Adria-Wien Pipeline judgment is the question of whether the energy-conversion sector must be subject to the same regulations as the rest of the business sector. In a preliminary ruling regarding a German power company, the Court of Justice referred to the fact that the electricity market was not yet, in the case concerned, fully deregulated and that some barriers to trade between the Member States were, accordingly, still acceptable. On the other hand, the energyconversion sector is undergoing radical transformation, with extensive liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets. Since deregulation of the Swedish electricity market, electricity production has been just as subject to competition, and exposed to the same risks, as other industrial sectors. In an electricity market subject to competition, electricity production is in the nature of a capitalintensive process industry, with no special technological or market features that could justify special treatment. The outcome of a Court of Justice review of special treatment of the energy-conversion sector in a Europe of deregulated electricity markets therefore appears highly uncertain. In the Committee’s view, it is, for that reason, highly desirable for a long-term system of energy taxation also to include the energy-conversion sector.</p>
<p>The Swedish sectorial classification of the business sector in terms of its energy taxation thus constitutes ‘state aid’. In a decision of 11 December 2002, the European Commission granted a time-limited approval for the Swedish model. However, at present there is no approval for the whole model, but only for the part relating to CO tax. There are no guarantees whatever that the energy-tax part will also be approved.</p>
<p>Besides the problems vis-à-vis Community Law to which the sectorial classification gives rise, it also means that businesses not defined as industrial are excluded from the application area for tax reduction, even if they in fact engage in energy-intensive activities. One illustrative example is the laundry trade, which is part of the service sector. On the other hand, all companies defined as conducting industrial activities benefit from the low industrial tax rate, regardless of how energy-intensive these activities actually are.</p>
<p>These implications mean that the present Swedish energy-tax model for the business sector cannot be deemed to fulfil the requirements that the Committee considers should be imposed on such a model. Because the design of the present Swedish model means that it constitutes ‘state aid’, every significant change in the model is subject to assessment by the European Commission. Although such changes may  be approved under certain specified conditions, approvals of this kind are, first, time-limited and, associated with extremely demanding work inputs to meet the Commission’s information requirements before every new assessment. These recurrent assessments entail an uncertainty that may have an inhibiting effect on the energy-intensive part of the business sector, regarding long-term investments and other matters. This uncertainty contributes to the characteristic ‘stop-go’ nature of the Swedish energy-tax system, which predated EU entry.</p>
<p>Finally, there is reason to question the current selection criteria for sectors entitled to tax reductions. Besides the application problems and other sources of bias stemming from these criteria, they are not in line with the directive relating to energy taxation on which the EU finance ministers reached a political agreement in March 2003. In this directive the approach chosen has been, instead, to use objective criteria to decide which companies are energy-intensive and may thus be eligible for tax reduction. Continuing to apply the present sectorial classification once the directive relating to energy taxation has entered into force would appear even more untenable.</p>
<p>Summing up, the Swedish Committee on Energy Taxation of the Business Sector, based on the above considerations, considers that the present Swedish model of energy taxation of the business sector is inadvisable as a conceivable option for the future. Accordingly, a new model must be devised.</p>
<p>As mentioned above it is incumbent on the Committee, under its directives, to analyse and propose suitable criteria for distinguishing what should be regarded as activities subject to competition and how far this competition should warrant energy-tax reliefs. Analysis of the effects of energy taxation on the business sector show that there are grounds, in terms of both regional policy and long-term environmental policy, for certain companies to be granted energy-tax reliefs.</p>
<p>Regional variations in the structure of energy and labour costs in the industrial sector reflect the structure of Swedish industry, with a great deal of light engineering in Stockholm and a substantial portion of basic industry, especially the forest industry, in the north of Sweden. Owing to the current reduced-rate regulations, the employment impact of current energy taxation in the industrial sector is small but, without reduced-rate regulations of this kind, major regional employment effects may be expected.</p>
<p>The Committee’s analyses also illustrate the major bearing of electricity prices on Swedish companies’ choice between locating their operations in Sweden and moving them abroad. From a macroeconomic point of view, there are therefore very sound reasons for not exceeding the Community’s minimum tax rate on electricity for the business sector. Introducing green electricity certificates with a quota obligation for the greater part of the business sector would also, de facto, entail an electricity tax on businesses that would probably exceed SEK 10 per MWh (€ 1.10) even in the first few years. In environmental terms, a tax on electricity entails a (relative) reduction in CO tax. This would make it more profitable for companies to increase their fuel consumption in the short term and, for new investments in the long term, choose more electricity-saving but simultaneously more CO-intensive technology. In both cases, this would result in a global increase in emissions of CO .</p>
<p>In terms of long-term environmental impact, there is also a cogent case for reliefs in CO tax for the most energy-intensive enterprises, since a high CO tax can be directly counterproductive. This counterproductive effect would arise because it would contribute to an inefficient elimination of energy-intensive industry and its relocation outside Sweden, to countries with lower environmental taxes and higher environment-degrading emissions. The elimination would be inefficient in the sense that Swedish heavy industry may be expected to increase  its market shares in the event of a joint Community climate policy. Only on the assumption that the rest of Western Europe cannot be expected to follow a groundbreaking Swedish policy is it rational, in long-term macroeconomic terms, to let domestic climate policy eliminate CO - intensive Swedish industry.</p>
<p>This should not, however, be taken as grounds for asserting that Sweden should not lead the way in climate work. On the other hand, the way in which  Sweden opts to lead the way is highly significant. It is not through costly but globally inefficient measures that Sweden can make the best contribution. It is by being a driving force in international discussions, since the Swedish economy stands to make massive gains from an internationally co-ordinated climate policy, while the comparative expense of an isolated Swedish climate policy is very high.</p>
<h2>The Committee’s proposal: a new energy-taxation model</h2>
<p>The model proposed by the Committee covers all business activity.</p>
<p>The Committee’s starting point is thus that all business activity, legally speaking, is exposed to competition, and energy taxation should therefore treat all business activity equally.</p>
<p>In drafting its proposal, the Committee has striven to shape the new energy-taxation system in such a way that it would be sustainable in the long term and, owing to its general nature, not classifiable as ‘state aid’ under Community law, while functioning in such a way as to preserve the competitiveness of the business sector. Another point of departure has been the aim of shaping the proposal, as far as possible, to conform with the provisions of the forthcoming directive relating to energy taxation. Moreover, the new energy-taxation system should afford a good balance between various objectives: macroeconomic efficiency, long-term efficiency in environmental policy and regional-policy aims.</p>
<p>The model that, in the Committee’s view, fulfils these requirements is described in the report as the ‘business-sector model’. Other models analysed show, according to the Committee, such severe shortcomings and weaknesses as to rule them out as the basis for a reformed  energy-tax  system. The implications of the businessector model are that:</p>
<p>• Energy taxation in the business sector will be kept separate from household energy taxation.</p>
<p>• The business sector (commercial activities) will be burdened only with environmental (‘green’) taxes (on CO and sulphur), unlike non-commercial activities (households and public administration), which will also be subject to fiscal taxes (energy tax). Pursuant to the new directive relating to energy taxation, however, an energy tax corresponding to the minimum tax rate will apply to the business sector’s electricity consumption.</p>
<p>• The business sector’s rate of CO tax will be set initially at 19 öre (€ 0.0209) per kg of CO (25 per cent of the rate for households and public administration).</p>
<p>• A general limitation rule will apply to  energy-intensive enterprises. This rule limits the CO tax levy on these companies’ fuel consumption or the energy-tax levy on their electricity consumption, as the case may be, to 0.7 per cent of the company’s sales value. One requirement, however, is that the</p>
<p>Community’s minimum tax rates must be observed, even after the limitation rule has been introduced. For the rule to be applied, companies must fulfil the definition of ‘energy-intensive activity’ in the directive relating to energy taxation.</p>
<p>• The previous definition of the sectors entitled to tax reductions will be abolished, making the whole business sector subject to the same  energy-taxation model. One implication of this is that the notion of ‘the manufacturing process’ in industrial activity is to be removed from the legislation.</p>
<p>• The  energy-conversion sector will be taxed in accordance with the rest of the business sector. The energy tax currently levied in the energy-conversion sector will be abolished. Instead, the Committee proposes that an energy tax be introduced on consumption of district heating outside the business sector.</p>
<p>The new model of energy taxation in the business sector is general in the sense that it includes the entire sector. It covers all legal entities and physical persons engaged in commercial activities. Just as under current regulations, taxation is assumed to relate solely to energy used as motor fuels and for heating, but not other purposes (raw materials, process energy).</p>
<p>The precise definition of the business sector will be extremely important in the new tax system. The previous tax-reduction limit for the manufacturing process is now to be superseded by the dividing-line between the business sector (commercial activities), on the one hand, and households and public authorities on the other. One issue thereby brought to the fore is whether the wording of the definition of ‘commercial activities’ should, for competition reasons, refer specially to certain activities in the public sector. These could, for example, be those conducted by independent schools and private hospitals that are run in competition with those under public management. Since energy costs are of limited relevance to this type of activity, and since in Sweden competing private-sector activities are also largely funded by the public sector, it appears simpler to adjust any distortions via the funding system than via the tax system. On the other hand, the Committee considers that the energy-conversion sector should operate under the same conditions, and that the kind of activities that are conducted in the form of municipal administrations should be placed on a par with commercial activities with respect to energy taxation.</p>
<p>The previous dividing line in the property stock between the manufacturing process and other activities, and between agricultural operation and private homes, is now to be replaced by a general distinction in the property stock between the business sector, on the one hand, and households and public administration on the other.</p>
<p>The size of the public sector is not affected by the choice of model. This means that although the proposals involve changes in the tax levy from public authorities, municipalities and county councils owing to changes in payroll tax and energy taxes, this is to be compensated for by means of changes in the award of appropriations and government grants for municipalities and county councils.</p>
<h2>The Committee’s proposal: a new general limitation rule (the ‘0.7 per cent rule’)</h2>
<p>Function of the limitation rule</p>
<p>Although the Committee recommends a generally lower level of energy taxation in the business sector than for households and public authorities, a need for further tax reduction nonetheless persists for a finite group of companies. These are, above all, those in energy-intensive industry, but certain other energy-intensive companies will also be able to apply the limitation rule.</p>
<p>The purpose of the limitation rule is, as the name implies, to restrict the tax levy to a certain defined proportion of companies’ sales value. In estimating the size of their tax reduction, companies can be credited both with the CO tax on fuels and the energy tax on electricity. The rule is not, however, a pure ceiling, since the Community’s minimum tax rates must be complied with. These minimum tax rates will, with the new directive relating to energy taxation, apply not only to mineral oils but also to coal, natural gas and electricity.</p>
<p>Nature and level of the limitation rule</p>
<p>One initial question is whether the limitation rule, as such, should be based on sales value or value added. The choice is not selfevident and the implications for companies vary, of course, depending on what is chosen. Although value added, broadly speaking, makes up roughly half of production value in the business sector, the spread between different sectors and at company level is very large.</p>
<p>If the purpose of a limitation rule is to protect technologically energy-intensive enterprises, a rule based on sales value appears most suitable. If, on the other hand, the purpose is to protect companies with low profitability from going out of business because of higher energy taxes, a rule based on value added seems most appropriate. In the latter case, it is a combination of energy intensity and profitability that determines which companies qualify for tax reduction. Since profitability varies considerably more than sales value from year to year, the number of companies qualifying under the limitation rule will vary greatly in the course of one business cycle. It is quite conceivable that some companies protected by the limitation rule would not, in normal parlance, be termed ‘energy-intensive’ at all but, rather, characterised as hardly profitable service enterprises. In the Committee’s view, a limitation rule based on sales value best reflects the fundamental purpose of  energy-tax  reduction. The Committee therefore proposes that the limitation rule be based on sales value .</p>
<p>As for the choice of level at which the limitation rule should apply, this is determined mainly by the need to avoid excessive tax levels for the energy-intensive enterprises. The Committee has, in particular, considered levels of between 1.0 and 0.5 per cent, and after careful consideration proposes a limitation rule at the level of 0.7 per cent.</p>
<p>Definition of energy-intensive enterprises</p>
<p>The forthcoming directive relating to energy taxation will clarify the forms under which reduction of energy tax and, accordingly, differentiated tax levels may be applied by Member States.</p>
<p>One requirement of this reduction (and thus application of the limitation rule) is that it is applicable only to companies conforming to one of the definitions of ‘energy-intensive enterprises’ in the directive. A company must have either a total energy cost, including tax, of at least 3 per cent of its production costs (sales value) or a 0.5 per cent minimum ratio of energy tax to value added.</p>
<p>However, on average, the Community’s minimum taxes must always be paid.</p>
<p>Thus, when the directive relating to energy taxation comes into force, only companies complying with one of the two definitions of ‘energy-intensive enterprises’ will be eligible for limitation of the energy-tax levy. The Committee’s analysis shows that if only one of the criteria of energy intensity is used, the probability is very high that certain companies will not qualify to benefit from the limitation rule. The Committee therefore proposes that the criterion for classification as an  ‘energy-intensive  enterprise’, which must be fulfilled in order for the limitation rule to be applied, should be optionally based on either value added or sales value.</p>
<h2>The Committee’s review of regulations concerning collection of electricity taxes</h2>
<p>Deregulation of the electricity market has changed both the conditions and the terms of the market. Customers have, for example, greater scope for choosing their electricity supplier. The regulations and system for levy of energy tax on electricity, on the other hand, have not been changed.</p>
<p>The Committee now proposes that the role of electricity suppliers as liable to tax on their deliveries to consumers be assumed by the network owners. The main reason for this proposal is that, owing to the deregulated market, electricity suppliers’ local knowledge of customers’ business activities and previous consumption is steadily decreasing. The electricity suppliers’ scope for checking and monitoring their customers has therefore radically deteriorated, and they are now basically reduced to the particulars they can obtain from the network owners. Since the network companies possess knowledge of the customers’ circumstances and, in particular, their consumption, it is also natural for these companies to assume responsibility for the tax collection.</p>
<h2>Implications for public finances</h2>
<p>Changes in energy taxation in the business sector have, of course, implications for public finances. Broadly speaking, extending the energy-tax structure of manufacturing industry to the whole of the business sector would entail a loss of some SEK 5 billion (€ 550m) net in tax revenue, i.e. when various indirect effects are taken into account.</p>
<p>One central issue is therefore how a model that yields a substantial loss of tax revenue is to be financed. The Committee considers, in view of its directives, that its remit does not include proposing a further green tax shift. Instead, in its view, it should ‘only’ propose financing of the tax shortfall that arises from the business-sector model, with various aspects, especially those relating to equity and income distribution, taken into account. The Committee thus refrains from having opinions on the form of the further tax shift within the framework of the ten-year programme. This programme, for a total of SEK 30 billion (€ 3.3bn), was presented by the Government in the Spring Fiscal Policy Bill in 2000. However, it is in the nature of things that, in large measure, financing of the tax reform must take place within the energy sector.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s view, it is reasonable for the business sector to join in financing a reorganisation of energy taxation to a large extent, since this would result in substantial tax reliefs for the business sector as a whole, even if the reliefs arise only for the service sector. Since the service sector is the big winner from the tax reform, a marginal rise in taxes on wages and salaries through a rise in payroll tax appears to be an attractive option in terms of both equity and financing. Moreover, a reversal of the latest increase in tax-allocation reserves appears to be favourable.</p>
<p>The energy tax on electricity that, due to the directive relating to energy taxation, is to be introduced for the whole business sector will contribute to this financing to some extent.</p>
<p>The tax shortfall from the energy-conversion sector is relative high: it is estimated (with some uncertainty) at roughly SEK 1,500 million (€ 165m) gross. A consumption tax on heating may therefore also seem reasonable from the equity point of view, i.e. it appears unreasonable for the entire tax shortfall from the energy-conversion sector to be offloaded on the other sectors. In addition, since some 70 per cent of district heating is owned by municipalities, a substantial share of the tax reliefs for the energyconversion sector will benefit municipal residents either directly, through lower heating prices, or indirectly through lower local tax.</p>
<p>When it comes to the distribution of the tax burden on households, it is imperative for the terms of competition between district heating, electricity and various heating fuels not to be affected. The</p>
<p>Committee therefore proposes small but uniform rises in household tax rates on electricity, oil and natural gas, and also –– as mentioned above –– the introduction of an energy tax on district heating. Since electricity and fuel taxes are regressive in nature, introducing an energy tax on heating represents a burden on households that is slightly more neutral in terms of income distribution and regional impact.</p>
<p>From an environmental point of view, raised taxes on petrol and diesel are attractive. Unless heavy industry, through large-scale elimination of plants, is going to be obliged to bear much of the burden of the climate policy, emissions from the transport sector will also have to be reduced. This will hardly take place without substantial tax increases on vehicle fuels. It may be noted here that the business sector accounts for some 25 per cent of revenue from a rise in petrol tax and roughly 90 per cent of the revenue from raising tax on diesel.</p>
<p>Given the above considerations, the Committee proposes financing of the business-sector model according to Table 1.</p>
<p>Table 1.  Proposed financing of the Committee’s draft model of energy taxation</p>
<p>With the above distribution, the business sector accounts for some 60 per cent (SEK 3 billion/€ 330m) and households for some 40 per cent (SEK 2bn/€ 220m) of the financing. On the other hand, the municipal sector’s costs diminish by at least 70 per cent of the tax shortfall from the energy-conversion sector (approximately SEK 1bn/€ 110m). Municipal residents benefit from this, either directly via lower heating prices or indirectly from lower local income tax. The net financing contribution of the household sector is thus around 20 per cent (SEK 1bn/€ 110m). The burden on the household sector will presumably diminish further thanks to price reductions resulting from the lower costs for the service sector.</p>
<h2>Other consequences</h2>
<p>The Committee’s proposal covers the whole business sector, i.e. all individuals and enterprises engaged in business activities. According to available information from Statistics Sweden’s Business Register for 2002, there are 842,358 companies in Sweden. Of these, 835,840 companies may be regarded as SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises, i.e. with fewer than 50 employees).</p>
<p>Companies must be enabled in some way to benefit from the lower energy-tax level for the business sector. In brief, the regulations proposed by the Committee are intended to function as follows. Initially, companies will, when they purchase energy, pay the same energy taxes (energy tax and CO tax) as households and public authorities. Since the overall business-sector level is lower, a refund entitlement thereby arises. Companies must accordingly, in conjunction with regular tax assessment, specify the annual payments of energy tax. By entering this information in their tax returns, a company claims a refund of the difference between the various tax levels. Additional tax reductions granted to companies under the ‘0.7 per cent rule’ will also be accounted for within this system. The repayment is thereafter administered by means of a refund through a tax account.</p>
<p>The Committee’s proposal requires companies to specify in their tax returns certain particulars about energy taxes they have paid. If, for liquidity reasons, companies wish to incur a continuously lower energy-tax burden, they must fill in preliminary tax returns enabling the tax authorities to decide on a modified tax computation. Certain companies will be assured of their right to purchase energy (electricity, heat and fuels) at the correct tax rate from the start. Finally, it is proposed that the system of tax-exempt consumers be retained for greenhouse growers, i.e. they will also be able to purchase fuel at the correct rate from the start.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s estimation, the new regulations concerning energy taxation in the business sector will entail some increase in companies’ obligation to submit information. The Committee is aware that all extra information required is a burden, especially on SMEs, but it deems this additional work manageable, especially since the information is to be provided for the purpose of obtaining tax reliefs.</p>
<p>In environmental terms, the business-sector model is inherently relatively neutral. Its main effect on energy demand would probably consist in, first, rising service-sector competitiveness and relatively falling industrial-sector competitiveness owing to the energy-tax reductions and, secondly, the shift of relative prices in the service sector between electricity and fuel prices, with fuel prices roughly doubling in relation to the price of electricity. Both effects should result in an overall reduction in demand for fuel and, by the same token, somewhat decreased emissions of CO . The financing of the business-sector model would also help to curb demand for petrol and diesel slightly, which would have a favourable environmental impact. Here too, however, the effects would be relatively small.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>It should be possible for the changes proposed by the Committee to enter into force on 1 July 2004.</p>
