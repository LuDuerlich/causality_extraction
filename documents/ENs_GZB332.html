<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The report proposes a new copyright act to replace the present Act on Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works (1960:729), which came into force in 1961. The proposal means that the provisions of the 1960 copyright act are transferred to the new copyright act, with editorial and linguistic amendments. No new or amended regulations are proposed in this report, only changes of a linguistic and editorial nature. However, the proposals include the changed or new provisions proposed in the Inquiry on Copyright’s interim report Avtalad upphovsrätt  (SOU 2010:24). Furthermore, it is proposed that all provisions in the International Copyright Regulation (1994:193) be included in the new copyright act.</p>
<p>It is proposed that, compared with the 1960 copyright act, the new copyright act will receive a new division of chapters with new section numbering in each chapter, and that the sections and chapters will be given clarifying headings. Further, it is proposed that the new act, for the sake of clarity, receives a new structure and a more logical internal organisation and structure. It is also proposed that the introductory provisions of the new copyright act contain easily accessible information on the main features of the legislation, so that those using the act can immediately get an overview of the act’s content. Generally, the language of the act is modernised and all provisions expressed with uniform terminology.</p>
<p>The purpose of this proposal is to make the new copyright act more understandable and easily accessible not only to those who have to apply the act, but also to the general public, right holders, organisations, businesses and others who need to reflect upon the act.</p>
<p>The first chapter of the proposed new copyright act contains overall provisions and a table of contents. This chapter is intended to serve as an introduction to the entire act. Basic provisions on copyright (chapter 2), provisions on the rights of performing artists,</p>
<p>photographers, etc. (chapter 3), and provisions on copyright restrictions (chapter 4) then follow. Chapters 2–4 therefore contain the framework for the protection the act gives to literary and artistic works and other achievements that do not come under actual copyright but are in many respects equal to copyright. This is followed by provisions on the transfer of copyright to others (chapter 5), extended collective licences (chapter 6), the right to special compensation (chapter 7), protection for technical measures, etc. (chapter 8), criminal liability, prohibition subject to conditional financial penalty, damages, etc. (chapter 9), information orders and infringement investigation (chapter 10), other provisions (chapter 11), the scope of the act (chapter 12) and the scope of the act in relation to other countries and intergovernmental organisations (chapter 13).</p>
<p>The proposal for a new copyright act involves both regulatory simplification and structural reorganisation which, if implemented, are intended to facilitate the application of the copyright provisions. These amendments benefit society in general by making it easier to obtain information about the content and significance of the provisions of the copyright act.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the new copyright act and other legislative amendments enter into force on 1 January 2013.</p>
