<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The terms of reference</h2>
<p>The terms of reference of the Commission were to evaluate the Cohabitees (Joint Homes) Act (1987:232) (the Cohabitees Act). The evaluation has, in accordance with the directive, been directed particularly at the issue of whether the main purpose of the Act has been achieved, i.e. to provide a minimum level of protection for the weaker party on the dissolution of a cohabitee relationship. The terms of reference of the Commission also included deliberations as to whether the differences in the legal treatment of homosexual cohabitees compared with heterosexual cohabitees are justified and, if they are not to propose how these may be eliminated in an appropriate manner. The terms of reference also included the survey of whether it is necessary to extend the legal protection to forms of common households other than those that are governed by legislation today, particularly if the parties do not have the opportunity to enter into marriage or to be registered as partners. In this connection, particular attention has been paid to people who are entitled to housing allowance.</p>
<h2>The Cohabitees Act</h2>
<p>Generally</p>
<p>With the view to surveying whether in the overall objective of the Cohabitees Act – to provide the weaker party with a minimum level of protection in the event of the dissolution of the cohabitee relationship – has been attained, the Commission arranged two hearings. On the basis of, inter alia, these hearings, the Commission drew the conclusion that the main aim of the Cohabitees Act was not completely satisfied. The Commission therefore proposes certain amendments to and clarifications of the Cohabitees Act, which are described in outline below. One of the most important proposals is that one and the same Cohabitees Act should be directly applicable to cohabitees irrespective of sex.</p>
<p>The title of the Act</p>
<p>The Cohabitees (Joint Homes) Act is generally known as the Cohabitees Act. Even lawyers usually simply refer to the Act as the Cohabitees Act. This alone suggests that the title to the Act should be changed. However, it may be argued that the existing title provides more information about the scope of the Act than the title Cohabitees Act. However, in accordance with the information obtained by the Commission, knowledge of the Cohabitees Act among the general public is so inadequate that the information aspect cannot be viewed as a justifiable reason to retain the existing title. The Commission therefore proposes, against the background of that stated, that the title of the Act should be the Cohabitees Act.</p>
<p>The preconditions for the existence of a cohabitee relationship</p>
<p>According to the present system, the Cohabitees Act applies to such relationships where a man and a woman live together under circumstances resembling marriage. By a reference in the Homosexual Cohabitees Act (1987:813), the Cohabitees Act also applies to cohabitees of the same sex. Even if it was stated in opinions stated in the travaux préparatoires (Government Bill 1986/87:1) what is meant by ‘living together in circumstances resembling marriage’, it has transpired that difficulties can arise in relation to determining whether a cohabitee relationship exists. In order that the Act should also be directly applicable to cohabitees of the same sex and in order that the legal wording should be more informative and more easily understood, a new definition of the concept of ‘cohabitee’ is proposed. The definition contains the fundamental conditions that, in line with the previous statements in the travaux préparatoires, are required in order that two persons should be regarded to be cohabitees. In addition to it being a question of two persons who permanently live together as a couple, it is required that they have a joint household.</p>
<p>The preconditions for a cohabitee relationship being regarded as having ceased</p>
<p>There is no express rule in the Cohabitees Act stating when a cohabitee relationship ceases. Despite this, several of the legal effects of the Cohabitees Act are linked to the date when the cohabitee relationship ends. The Commission proposes that the Act shall exhaustively define when a cohabitee relationship ends. The Commission’s opinion is that no legal effect should be linked to either of the party’s view on a cohabitee relationship ending so far as this has not been manifested in a manner apparent to outsiders. A cohabitee relationship ends when the cohabitees or either of them get married or enter into a registered partnership, when the cohabitees move apart or when either of them dies. In addition to this, the Commission proposes that a cohabitee relationship should be considered to have ended when a cohabitee’s or both cohabitees’ application for the appointment of a division of property administrator or for the right to remain resident in the dwelling is received by the court or when a cohabitee or both cohabitees institute proceedings to take over a dwelling that is not subject to the division of property. A cohabitee may by such an application to the court cause the cohabitee relationship to end, without the participation of the other party, in a manner that can be verified by outsiders. Such a system may be of importance for, for example, women who are subject to abuse or otherwise vulnerable in a cohabitee relationship. Even for those cohabitees who are agreed that a cohabitee relationship has ended but who for various reasons have not moved apart, such an application in accordance with the above can have the consequence that the cohabitee relationship ends.</p>
<p>Property subject to the Cohabitees Act and cohabitee-right</p>
<p>According to the current legislation, the Cohabitees Act applies to the cohabitees’ joint dwelling and household goods. In the view of the Commission, a car often has as great importance for the finances of the cohabitees as the dwelling and household goods. A car that is not primarily used for leisure purposes is often used as a means of transport to and from places of work or to day care homes, schools, other activities for the children or for shopping or other business connected to the household therefore has a natural connection with the basis for the Cohabitees Act, i.e. what is necessary for the joint household. In some parts of Sweden, other motor vehicles or means of transport have the same area of application as a motor car. For example this applies to motor boats and snow scooters. The Commission proposes that the joint motorised means of transport of the cohabitees should be subject to the Cohabitees Act. However, this does not apply if the means of transport is mainly used for leisure purposes.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that such joint property as is stated in the Cohabitees Act, i.e. dwelling, household goods and motorised means of transport that are not primarily used for leisure purposes, and which are kept by the cohabitees for joint use should be referred to as "cohabiteeright property". However, property does not comprise cohabitee-right property if the parties have agreed in writing that the property should not be subject to a division of property or the property is acquired by one of the cohabitees by inheritance, will or as a gift with a condition that the property is separate.</p>
<p>The Commission has also deliberated upon a system whereby joint ownership rights to property that is not subject to the cohabitee-right can be dissolved on a division of property. At the hearings of the Commission, many participants have emphasised that, for practical reasons, it would be advantageous for the parties if the community of property between them could be dissolved on one and the same occasion. However, such a system would require extensive alterations to the rules on division of property, the consequences of which must be deliberated upon carefully. In addition to this, there is probably also a need for corresponding amendments to the Marriage Code. These amendments may also require coordination with the rules in the Joint Ownership Act. Consequently, the Commission considers that the issue lies outside the terms of reference of the Commission but wishes to emphasise that it is of great importance that this matter is investigated by other means.</p>
<p>Contracts that certain property should be excepted from the division of property</p>
<p>It is today doubtful whether cohabitees can in accordance with the Cohabitees Act conclude contracts that only certain cohabitee-right property should be included in the division of property while other property, which would otherwise be subject to a division, should be excluded. The view of the Commission is that cohabitees, like spouses, should be able to enter into such contracts. Furthermore, cohabitees are in the same way as spouses able, by a new agreement, to reintroduce the right to a division that they have previously excluded by contract. The Commission proposes that the Act is made more clear regarding this item.</p>
<p>Possibility of concluding pre-cessation contracts</p>
<p>For those cohabitees who are agreed that a cohabitee relationship has ended without this having been manifested to outsiders in a visible way, there is a need to be able to conclude pre-cessation contracts. The Commission proposes that cohabitees in preparation of an immediately pending cessation of the cohabitee relationship should have the possibility, like spouses, to contract on the forthcoming division of property and otherwise on matters connected with it. The need for a time limit for the final date for submitting a request for a division of property.</p>
<p>The need for a time limit for the presentation of division of property requests</p>
<p>A division of property under the Cohabitees Act is, contrary to that applicable under the Marriage Code, not mandatory. However, neither the Cohabitees Act nor the Marriage Code contains any final date for when an application for division of property should take place when both of the parties are alive. In order to increase the certainty for cohabitees, the Commission proposes that such a time limit is introduced into the Cohabitees Act. Unless a division of property is called for within a set period, any entitlement to a division of property is lost. In order to avoid undesirable results, this time limit should not be fixed too narrowly. At the same time, it is of importance that a request for a division of property is presented as soon as possible after the end of the cohabitee relationship. The Commission considers that a time limit of one year after the cessation of the cohabitee relationship is sufficiently generous in order to avoid unfair results.</p>
<p>The need for a rule on duty to report</p>
<p>If property that comprises the cohabitee-right property is sold, given away or in another way disposed of after the end of the cohabitee relationship but before a division of property takes place, the value of that property is not included in the division of property. In order to alter this the Commission proposes that a division of property under the Cohabitees Act should have the property situation on the date of the cessation of the cohabitee relationship as a starting point. In this way the value of the cohabitee-right property that exist at this time will be included in the division of property irrespective of whether the property is kept or not. In order to ensure that the cohabitee-right property – or the value of such property – is administered in the best possible manner, the Commission proposes that the Cohabitees Act should also be supplemented with a provision concerning a duty to report. This duty to report also relates to the cohabitees’ joint dwelling that is held by one of the cohabitees as a tenancy right or tenant-owner right (condominium) and which may be the subject of a takeover under the Cohabitees Act.</p>
<p>Procedural issues</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the Cohabitees Act should afford an opportunity for a court to issue interim decisions on a right to remain resident in the dwelling even in respect of dwellings included in the division of property. Furthermore, the Commission proposes that it should be possible to appeal separately against an interim decision under the Cohabitees Act. Finally, the Commission proposes that issues concerning taking over dwellings and the right to remain resident in dwellings should be capable of being determined in cases between cohabitees relating to custody of children and the residence of children.</p>
<p>Information</p>
<p>The Commission considers that information about the Cohabitees Act must be improved. The contents of this information should be clear and easy to understand and directed to both cohabitees of the opposite and of the same sex. In order that information about the Cohabitees Act should reach out to as many people as possible, the information should be presented and disseminated in many different ways. Targeted information efforts should be directed particularly at cohabitees of the same sex but also at young people and immigrants.</p>
<h2>Cohabitees of the same sex</h2>
<p>The Homosexual Cohabitees Act states which acts and provisions are applicable to cohabitees of the opposite sex and which shall also be capable of application to cohabitees of the same sex. The intention is that the Act should contain an exhaustive list of the provisions that shall also be applied in relation to the cohabitee relationship of homosexual persons.</p>
<p>The Commission, working on the basis that equality should prevail between heterosexual cohabitees and homosexual cohabitees in the same way as between lawful spouses and registered partners, has examined whether or not the legal differences that exist between cohabitees in the various groups are justified. The Commission has in this connection been able to conclude that the legal differences between cohabitees of the opposite and of the same sex are far greater than the differences between lawful spouses and registered partners. The great number of enactments and statutory provisions stated in the Homosexual Cohabitees Act mean that it is difficult to maintain the requirement for clarity and transparency. There is also a risk that the legal situation is misunderstood as it is not stated in every individual act or provision which cohabitee the enactment refers to. It has also transpired that cohabitees of the same sex have been overlooked in various legislative work that affect cohabitees.</p>
<p>Against this background, the Commission´s assessment is that there is a need for a new system of rules to avoid unjustified legal differences between cohabitees of the same and of the opposite sex. Only to the extent that the legal differences between homosexual and heterosexual cohabitee relationships correspond to the legal differences between registered partnerships and marriage can they be considered justified.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes, as mentioned above, that all cohabitee relationships are governed in one and the same Cohabitee Act and that the definition in the Cohabitees Act of the concept of cohabitee is amended. Furthermore, the Commission proposes that it should be indicated by every enactment or statutory provision which cohabitee is referred to in the legislation. The concept of cohabitee shall in the future relate to cohabitees of the opposite and of the same sex.</p>
<h2>Other joint households</h2>
<p>Generally</p>
<p>The terms of reference of the Commission relating to joint households, include the task of explaining which groups of cohabitees may be in need of increased legal protection and also surveying what these needs are.</p>
<p>The Commission has made an inventory of the differences existing between the legal effects of living together in marriage/registered partnership, cohabitee relationships and other joint households as regards some central fields of law. With the assistance of Statistics Sweden (SCB) the Commission has produced information about how many people with households there are who are referable to the group ‘Other joint households’. On the assignment of the Commission, SCB has also conducted an interview investigation by telephone with just over 500 people who in a previous investigation stated that they were single with another person in the household other than a child under 21 years.</p>
<p>The Commission has drawn the conclusion from these investigations that people who live together with a person other than a spouse/partner, cohabitee and/or minor child comprise a relatively small group. It is not possible to state exactly how many households there are with persons living together that are referable to the respective groups. It can be estimated that there are about 80,000 households where adult children</p>
<p>(21 years and above) and parents live together, almost 20,000 households where brothers and sisters without parents live together and approximately 20,000 households where other persons live together. The group ‘other’ includes, among others, relatives, workmates, student colleagues and lodgers. In the majority of cases it is a question of temporary cohabitation that, above all else, has practical causes. The cohabitees who intend to remain are thus actually in fact rather few. It is above all else cohabitation between older brothers and sisters and also between adult children and parents that is permanent. However, the economic community that arises in this long-term cohabiting seldom appears to correspond to the interweaving of finances that often occurs between lawful spouses/registered partners and cohabitees as a result of the building up of a joint home. The majority of the interview subjects who were asked about the need for legal protection adopted a negative view to the same.</p>
<p>Against this background, the Commission does not consider that there is any need for legal regulation of the mutual relationship between people who live together in other joint households. Nor does the Commission consider that there is any reason to introduce any special regulations concerning the social security legislation for people who live together in other joint households.</p>
<p>People entitled to housing allowance in particular</p>
<p>As regards the question of the group of people entitled to housing allowance, the background to the Commission’s directive was a pronouncement by the Riksdag [Swedish Parliament]. The Standing Committee on Housing had actually pointed out that spouses and partners who live together and cohabitees of the opposite sex should jointly apply for housing allowance. In the view of the Committee, the group of people entitled to housing allowance should be extended to comprise persons who live together, irrespective of the form of cohabitation (Committee Report 1995/96:BoU 11, p. 18).</p>
<p>In the view of the Committee, the starting point should be that other cohabitees are equated as regards housing allowance with cohabiting men and women in accordance with the rules that apply today under the Housing Allowances Act (1993:737).</p>
<p>The Commission has interpreted the directive – and the opinions expressed by the Committee – so that the extension only relates to joint applications for young people under the age of 29 who live together and for people in households where there are no children; in both cases subject to the precondition that no more than two persons applying for</p>
<p>housing allowance live in the household and that the persons applying for housing allowance are registered as resident at the same address. When the pronouncement by the Riksdag was made and when the terms of reference of the Commission were written, cohabitees of the same sex did not have any possibility of jointly applying for housing allowance. However, such a system entered into force on 1 January 1998. Thus, the rule now is that spouses and partners who live together and cohabitees of the same or opposite sex shall apply for housing allowance jointly.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the Commission, one fundamental reason why spouses/partners and cohabitees should apply for housing allowance jointly is that there is considered to be in these households a broad financial community. The interview investigation of the Commission established that, for the majority of the people who live in the same dwelling without being spouses/partners or cohabitees, it is a question of provisional housing where those cohabiting do not have any financial community except housing expenses. In the opinion of the Commission, it is not reasonable that all persons living together – irrespective of the economic community that exists between them – should apply for housing allowance jointly. A system where there was instead a requirement imposed on persons living together having to apply jointly for housing allowance only if they have a more extensive joint household with economic cooperation would, in the view of the Commission, involve enormous evidential difficulties.</p>
<p>The information that the Commission produced indicates that a joint application for housing allowance for persons in other joint households could not generally be said to result in either a greater or smaller allowance than an application for a housing allowance under the existing system. However, it should be noted that some people who receive housing allowance today are single persons who could completely lose their entitlement to an allowance if they were compelled to apply jointly with others in the household. For example, this applies to a young person with a tenancy contract for a dwelling who lives together with a person who is 29 years or older. Furthermore, in many cases single parents with children would receive a lower allowance on a joint application with another person in the household. The consequences now reported constitute strong reasons, in the view of the Commission, for not introducing a system of joint applications for housing allowance for other joint households.</p>
<p>Against the background of that stated, the conclusion of the Commission is that there should not be any further extension of the group of cohabitees who should apply for housing allowance jointly. The Commission therefore refrains to present any proposal concerning this.</p>
