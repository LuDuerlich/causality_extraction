<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>During the spring and summer of 2014, Directive 2014/91/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 amending Directive 2009/65/EC on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) as regards depositary functions, remuneration policies and sanctions (the UCITS V Directive, see annex 4) was adopted.</p>
<p>The Directive regulates UCITS that have the general public as their target group and are characterised by a high degree of consumer protection. The Directive has been implemented in Swedish law chiefly through the Swedish UCITS Act (2004:46). This Act uses the terms värdepappersfond  (‘Swedish UCITS’) and fondbolag  (‘Swedish management company’) for funds and companies that in the UCITS Directive are termed ‘UCITS’ and ‘management company’ respectively.</p>
<p>The UCITS Directive, which dates back to 1985, has been amended several times and was recast in 2009 (the UCITS IV Directive). The present amendments are in response to developments in the market and aim to increase the level of investor protection, to harmonise the rules for management companies with the rules that apply in other parts of the financial markets area as regards remuneration policies and sanctions, to clarify the duties and liabilities of depositaries and to reduce the discrepancies between national provisions.</p>
<p>As a first part of its remit, the Inquiry has had the task of considering and proposing the changes required in the Swedish regulations to implement the new and changed rules in the UCITS Directive. The remit also includes a number of other tasks that the Inquiry will address in its upcoming final report (see Terms of Reference, annexes 1–3).</p>
<h2>Starting points for the Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that necessary adaptations of Swedish law in response to the new and amended rules in the Directive be implemented chiefly in the Swedish UCITS Act.</p>
<p>When the UCITS Directive was first implemented in Swedish law, the general approach was to place the regulations on a level with the Directive. The Inquiry has not found any reason to adopt a different approach than the one previously applied, and our proposal is that the legislative proposals should generally keep to the level directed by the EU legal instrument. This approach has also governed the Inquiry’s line in relation to the terminology used in the Directive. Terms and expressions used in the EU legal instrument are also broadly proposed for use in the Swedish provisions, and for this reason the term straffavgift  (‘fine’), for example, will be replaced by sanktionsavgift  (‘pecuniary sanction’). However, the Inquiry does not propose that the concept of ‘management body’ should be used in the Swedish legislative text and the definition of ‘financial instrument’ used in the Act should remain unchanged until further notice. Furthermore, no changes are proposed in the established terms värdepappersfond  (‘Swedish UCITS’) and fondbolag  (‘Swedish management company’).</p>
<h2>Rules on remuneration</h2>
<p>The new rules in the UCITS Directive require management companies to establish and apply remuneration policies with respect to their staff. The rules contain detailed requirements regarding the contents and application of such policies.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that a framework provision be introduced in the Swedish UCITS Act stating that Swedish management companies must have remuneration policies and practices that are compatible with and promote sound and effective risk management and that the Government or the authority designated by the Government be authorised to issue regulations that govern the design of remuneration systems in greater detail, and in accordance with the rules on remuneration in the UCITS Directive. The proposed arrangement will result in cohesive Swedish regulations regarding remuneration and remuneration systems in financial companies. Furthermore, it is proposed that existing legal provisions on the contents of the prospectus, annual report and simplified prospectus be supplemented to state that these documents shall also contain certain information concerning remuneration and the management company’s remuneration policy.</p>
<h2>Duties and liabilities of depositaries</h2>
<p>The new provisions in the UCITS Directive concerning depositaries state which entities may constitute depositaries, the duties the depositary is expected to perform, the circumstances in which duties may be delegated and the rules regarding damages that are to apply if the depositary loses instruments or causes other damage.</p>
<p>While the basic principles and the duties of depositaries are the same as previously, the new rules in the Directive are considerably more detailed and require both that existing legislative provisions regarding depositaries be supplemented and that new provisions be introduced in the Swedish UCITS Act. The Inquiry proposes that it should be made clear that it is the management company that is responsible for ensuring that a depositary is appointed and that the depositary should keep its activities as a depositary separate from activities whose interests could come into conflict with the interests of the management company, the UCITS or the unit holders. In addition, it is proposed that the duties of the depositary to monitor the cash flows of the UCITS and to hold the UCITS assets should be clarified by means of new provisions in accordance with what is prescribed in the Directive. The provisions mean, among other things, that the depositary shall hold in custody all financial instruments that may be registered in an account for such instruments and all financial instruments that can be physically delivered to the depositary, and – as regards other assets – verify the ownership by the UCITS of these assets, maintain a record of these assets and keep this record up to date. The Inquiry also proposes the introduction of new provisions on the freedom of depositaries to entrust to another party the tasks of holding in custody, verifying ownership and keeping records of UCITS assets (delegation and sub-delegation). The proposed provisions also clarify that a depositary, or a company to which duties have been delegated, may not reuse UCITS assets, unless this is done for the account of the UCITS, on the instructions of the management company, for the benefit of the UCITS and in unit holders’ interests, and the transaction is covered by high-quality and collateral received by the UCITS under a title transfer arrangement.</p>
<p>Finally, it is proposed that a provision be introduced in the Act to the effect that a depositary is liable to the UCITS and the unit holders for the loss by the depositary or a third party to whom the custody of financial instruments held in custody has been delegated. However, the depositary shall not be liable if it can prove that the loss has arisen as a result of an external event beyond its reasonable control, the consequences of which would have been unavoidable despite all reasonable efforts to the contrary.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that the existing Swedish provision on damages – that the depositary shall compensate UCITS unit holders and management companies for damages caused by the depositary infringing the Swedish UCITS Act or fund rules – should be amended so as to make the depositary liable to the UCITS and unit holders for intentionally or negligently caused damages, over and above the liability for verification in the event of loss of financial instruments described above. Under our proposals, these rules of liability will also apply to depositaries for special funds.</p>
<h2>Supervision by competent authority and ‘whistleblower’ systems</h2>
<p>The amended and new provisions in the UCITS Directive broaden the supervisory powers of the competent authority and also require the authority, management companies and depositaries to have effective systems for reporting infringements of the rules.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that provisions on the duty of the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (Finansinspektionen) to establish effective procedures for receiving and following up reports on infringements should be given in the form of regulations at ordinance level (secondary legislation). Further, the Inquiry proposes the introduction in the Swedish UCITS Act of a provision stating that management companies shall have appropriate systems for dealing with reports from staff concerning any irregularities in the companies. This requirement has been implemented as regards depositaries through the provision to this effect in the Banking and Financing Business Act (2004:297) (Chapter 6, Section 2a). In the Inquiry’s opinion, the requirement under the Directive that an employee who reports serious infringements shall be protected against retaliation, discrimination and other types of unfair treatment is satisfied by existing legislation. The same applies to the protection of identity required by the Directive.</p>
<p>A person who has reported a suspected infringement of regulations to the competent authority shall not be held liable for disregarding professional secrecy. Provisions on this will be introduced in the Swedish UCITS Act, the Banking and Financing Business Act and the Securities Market Act (2007:528).</p>
<h2>Interventions</h2>
<p>The new provisions in the UCITS Directive on sanctions and administrative measures in the event of infringements of regulations represent a minimum level. The provisions, which are considerably more detailed than the previous provisions, largely tally in design and content with the regulations concerning interventions given in other EU legal instruments in the financial markets area.</p>
<p>The proposals in this area entail broader powers for the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority. The generally formulated provision on interventions against management companies (Chapter 12, Section 1 of the Swedish UCITS Act) will be supplemented to make it also applicable to depositaries that have infringed against certain provisions designed to implement the UCITS Directive, so as to make them subject to broadly the same types of sanctions and other administrative measures that can be imposed on management companies.</p>
<p>Further, the Inquiry proposes the introduction in the Act of new provisions that will make it possible to impose sanctions on members of the governing board of a management company or a depositary, and the managing director, or persons substituting for any of these, for an infringement by the company or the depositary. However, this presupposes that in the event of intention or gross carelessness, the way in which the natural person has acted has led to the infringement by the company and this infringement is of a serious nature. A provision will also be introduced in the Act to the effect that no intervention shall be made if the infringement at the same time constitutes an act that is subject to prosecution. The sanctions that may come into question for persons belonging to the management of a management company are a decision on a pecuniary sanction and a ban against exercising management functions in a management company. An intervention against a person belonging to the management of a depositary can be made by imposing a pecuniary sanction. Such a sanction can be set at an amount of at most the equivalent on 17 September 2014 of EUR 5 million, or an amount equivalent to twice the profit obtained or the cost avoided as a result of the infringement, in cases where these amounts can be calculated. The pecuniary sanction may not be set at an amount below SEK 5 000. The new proposed provision on determining pecuniary sanctions is also applicable to natural persons who have conducted UCITS business without being entitled to do so or have disregarded their obligation to notify or inform the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority of acquisitions of, changes in and disposal of qualifying holdings in a management company.</p>
<p>For management companies, the sanctions that may come into question are the same as under established law. The provisions of the Act on fines, and the enforcement of decisions imposing such fines, and other decisions, will, however, be amended editorially by replacing the term ‘fine’ with the term ‘pecuniary sanction’. In addition, the ceiling on pecuniary sanctions will be brought into line with the minimum requirement in the Directive. This means that the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority may order a pecuniary sanction up to an amount in Swedish kronor (SEK) that on 17 September 2014 was equivalent to EUR 5 million, or else an amount equivalent to ten per cent of the company’s or, where relevant, the group’s total annual turnover during the preceding financial year, or an amount equivalent to twice the profit gained or the cost avoided as a result of the infringement of the regulations, in cases where these amounts can be calculated. The lowest level remains SEK 5 000.</p>
<p>In the individual case, then, pecuniary sanctions will be set within the parameters specified in the relevant sections of the law. Furthermore, it is proposed that new provisions be introduced in the Act clarifying – by means of an illustrative list – the factors on which to base the choice of a sanction or another administrative measure, and the size of pecuniary sanctions.</p>
<p>In accordance with the new provisions in the Directive, it is also proposed that the powers of the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority to impose pecuniary sanctions be broadened to apply in the case of certain specified infringements, including if a person has obtained permission to engage in business by giving false information or by some other improper means.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, as previously, should take decisions on sanctions and other administrative measures concerning legal persons, and also in matters concerning the failure by natural persons to give notice of acquisitions of, changes in and disposals of qualifying holdings in a management company. With regard to sanctions against natural persons belonging to the management of a management company or a depositary in the event of infringements on the part of the company, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority shall adjudicate the matter of sanctions through sanctions orders. If such an order has not been accepted within the prescribed time, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority will be able to apply to Stockholm Administrative Court for the sanction to be imposed. Under the Inquiry’s proposal, a decision by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority on a sanctions order will not be subject to appeal. However, a sanctions order that has been accepted shall be set aside after complaint, if the approval of the order cannot be regarded as a valid expression of a person’s will, if such an error has occurred during the processing of the matter that the order should be regarded as invalid, or if the order is not in conformity with the law for some other reason.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the legislative amendments enter into force on 18 March 2016.</p>
