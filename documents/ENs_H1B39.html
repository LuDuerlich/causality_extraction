<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The commission’s proposals in a broader context</h2>
<p>The proposals of the commission of inquiry into the Riksbank’s financial independence and balance sheet should be seen in a broader context.</p>
<p>Various measures have been taken to make the financial system more resilient as a consequence of the financial crisis. At the international level, stricter regulations on banks’ capital requirements, liquidity reserves and funding will be imposed. In Sweden, additional liquidity reserves in dollars and euros are required. Government guarantees for banks’ funding can now be given at short notice. A government commission has recently proposed strengthening of macroprudential supervision and how responsibilities for financial crisis management should be divided between the government, its agencies and the Riksbank.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the proposals are designed to fulfill the requirements of European Union law on central bank independence.</p>
<h2>The proposal is that the Riksbank´s interest free capital be SEK 75 billion, including SEK 30 billion in equity capital. The capital is to be protected against inflation and restored after losses</h2>
<p>The proposal is that the Riksbank has an interest free and inflation protected capital of SEK 75 billion. The capital should give a return that is sufficient to cover the Riksbank’s costs over time with a safe margin.</p>
<p>The interest free capital includes SEK 30 billion in equity capital. Losses smaller than SEK 10 billion should be compensated by withholding profits until the equity capital is restored. Larger losses require that the equity capital is restored by injection of new equity capital.</p>
<p>In addition to equity capital, the interest free capital consists of bills and coins in circulation. At present, bills and coins in circulation amount to SEK 95 billion. Together with the equity capital of SEK 30 billion, the interest free capital amounts to SEK 125 billion. This means that the Riksbank will have a larger than sufficient interest free capital for many years. The supply of bills and coins in circulation is expected to continue to decline and the interest free capital is therefore expected to decline to SEK 75 billion.</p>
<h2>The Riksbank should be given the right to increase its foreign currency reserves so that its borrowed and interest free capital can amount to SEK 200 billion</h2>
<p>The Riksbank is charged with the task of providing emergency liquidity assistance in foreign currency to Swedish banks and other financial institutions. In order to fulfill its task, the Riksbank should be given the right to increase its foreign currency reserves when needed so that the total of interest free and borrowed capital may reach SEK 200 billion. The limit of 200 billion should be indexed to the GDP in current prices.</p>
<h2>When it has used its reserves for emergency liquidity assistance, the Riksbank should be given the right to restore its foreign currency reserves by borrowing to the required extent, without any limit</h2>
<p>It is impossible to ascertain beforehand how much foreign currency that will be needed if one or several banks need emergency liquidity assistance and financial stability is threatened. Therefore, it is proposed that the Riksbank be given the right to finance its lending in foreign currency by borrowing to the extent required, without any limit.</p>
<p>The borrowing should be carried out through the National Debt Office, which can borrow very large sums in foreign currency at short notice. The foreign reserves of the Riksbank and the liquidity reserves now required to be held by banks should be sufficient to bridge a short period of liquidity stress in foreign currency, until the National Debt Office has borrowed foreign currency for the Riksbank and the government has had time to take other measures to safeguard financial stability.</p>
<h2>The financial independence of the Riksbank is strengthened</h2>
<p>The financial independence of the Riksbank is strengthened by a number of different measures. The interest free capital and the equity capital are determined by law and are protected against inflation. Equity capital is protected against losses. The Riksbank is given the legal right to increase its reserves in advance when needed within a given limit and to restore its foreign currency reserves by borrowing to the extent required when it has used its reserves to lend to banks in need. The distribution of profits is determined by law.</p>
<p>Sweden has undertaken to lend foreign currency corresponding to a maximum of SEK 180 billion to the IMF. These undertakings are now partly on and partly off the Riksbank’s balance sheet. Fulfillment of the undertakings can require use of the Riksbank’s foreign currency reserves and can therefore impinge on the bank’s ability to carry out monetary policy and to provide emergency liquidity assistance. It is therefore proposed that the IMF undertakings are put on a separate balance sheet, and that the government and parliament should be made responsible for any losses.</p>
<h2>The costs of at least the borrowed part of the foreign currency reserves should be covered by fees on banks</h2>
<p>Banks and other financial institutions are covered by an implicit insurance against a liquidity squeeze in foreign currency. The government offers the insurance without any cost through the Riksbank. This can give banks incentives to lend and borrow more in foreign currency than they otherwise would. Banks that lend and borrow in foreign currency should therefore be required to take part of a mandatory insurance scheme that guarantees emergency liquidity assistance in foreign currency.</p>
<p>The details of such an insurance scheme should be worked out.</p>
<h2>The currency risk that follows from holding foreign currency reserves should be eliminated by transfer to the National Debt Office</h2>
<p>The proposed size of equity capital assumes that the foreign currency risk inherent in holding foreign currency reserves is hedged. Without hedging, it is estimated that additional equity capital of SEK 27 billion is required.</p>
<p>Transferring the risk to the National Debt Office does not affect the Riksbank’s ability to fulfill its tasks. It does not place any costs on the National Debt Office, since the office does not have to hold a buffer against exchange rate losses, in contrast to the Riksbank. The proposal in fact diminishes the currency risk inherent in the National Debt Office’s own borrowing in foreign currency for the government, since the two risks cancel each other.</p>
<h2>The social economic gain from keeping less capital on the Riksbank’s balance sheet is estimated at SEK 430 to 645 million with increased currency reserves and SEK 180 to 270 million in normal times</h2>
<p>The proposals mean that less capital will be tied up in the Riksbank. The proposed size of the balance sheet will currently be at least SEK 125 billion and – with maximum borrowing – at most SEK 200 billion. The actual size of the Riksbank’s balance sheet, including SEK 200 billion borrowed in foreign currency, is approximately SEK 415 billion (excluding IMF-related items). The reduction of capital tied up in the Riksbank would in other words be approximately SEK 215 billion with increased currency reserves and approximately 90 billion in normal times.</p>
<p>The cost of tying up capital in the Riksbank is approximately 0.2 to 0.3 per cent of the amount per year. A reduction of SEK 215 billion means that the government gains SEK 430 to 645 million per year, and a reduction of SEK 90 billion means a gain of 180 to 270 million per year. If the annual gains are discounted at an assumed real discount rate of 2 per cent, the present value in normal times is SEK 9 to 14 billion.</p>
<p>The gains above are fiscal as well as social economic gains. If part of or the entire currency reserves are financed by fees paid by the banks, a corresponding cost is transferred from the government to the banks, but the social gain remains.</p>
