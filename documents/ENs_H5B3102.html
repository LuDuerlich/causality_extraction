<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes two new acts on taxation:</p>
<p>– an act on taxation of cadmium in certain products</p>
<p>– an act on taxation of chemical plant protection products.</p>
<p>It also proposes that the Act relative to taxation on pesticides (1984:410) be repealed. It is proposed that the two new acts on taxation enter into force on 1 July 2019, at the same time as the existing pesticide tax act is proposed to be repealed.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that a tax on cadmium may be appropriate as an additional control measure to reduce the input of cadmium to arable land and, accordingly, to the human body via food. Sources that should be taxed are:</p>
<p>– sewage sludge used in agriculture, to the extent that the cadmium concentration exceeds the average cadmium concentration in lavatory water;</p>
<p>– animal feed and feed ingredients from mineral sources;</p>
<p>– lime used in agriculture and other food production – with the exception of sugar factory lime; and</p>
<p>– mineral fertilisers containing phosphorous.</p>
<p>The net positive socio-economic impact of the tax proposal is contingent upon the tax having a sufficient effect on cadmium input to arable land, and upon the negative side effects not being too substantial.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s conclusion is also that additional control measures are needed to reduce environmental and health risks when using plant protection products. Changes to the taxation of chemical plant</p>
<p>protection products may be appropriate as an additional control measure. The tax on chemical plant protection products will be differentiated and include three risk-based product categories, of which chemical plant protection products containing only low-risk active substances will be tax-exempt. The tax base for levying the tax is to be the maximum allowable dose per hectare. This tax proposal will change the relative prices between product categories and should lead to reduced environmental and health risks.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the tax on any biocides covered by the existing pesticide tax act be abolished, and that the matter of taxation be reconsidered after more progress has been made on the ongoing implementation of the EU Biocidal Products Regulation.</p>
