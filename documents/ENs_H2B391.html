<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit is to investigate whether the age limit for recognising changes of gender should be amended. The reason for this is that in many cases, not least among young people, being transgender causes mental suffering for those concerned due to problems they encounter in their everyday lives.</p>
<p>On 1 July 2013, the sterilisation requirement was removed from the Act concerning recognition of gender in certain cases (1972:119). This means that medical intervention is no longer required for a change of gender to be recognised. One consequence of removing the sterilisation requirement is that changing a person’s gender is seen as a two-part process. The first part is the administrative procedure for legal recognition of the change, i.e. changing a person’s legal gender in the population register. The second part comprises the gender reassignment care and treatment that, with the exception of certain specific procedures regulated in the Act concerning recognition of gender in certain cases, are regulated in the Health and Medical Services Act. Under the Inquiry’s terms of reference, the administrative change, i.e. the change to a person’s legal gender, is the focus of its remit.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s interpretation is that the removal of the sterilisation requirement formed the basis of the remit to investigate the age limit for recognising changes of gender. The Inquiry therefore considers it to be within the framework of its remit to make proposals based on drawing a distinction between the legal and medical parts of the process of changing gender. As the medical part is hugely significant to transgender people, we could not neglect to consider that aspect and make proposals, even though the focus of the Inquiry’s remit is the legal aspect. This report addresses the following issues:  the conditions for changing legal gender in the population register;  the conditions for approval for certain surgical procedures that are a part of gender reassignment care and treatment of transgender people; and  the conditions for children and young people to change their legal gender and/or be approved for certain surgical procedures that are a part of gender reassignment care and treatment of transgender people.</p>
<p>In proposing age limits on the possibility to change gender, the Inquiry is to survey and analyse the consequences of the current age limit of 18 for the child, for custodial parents and for the prospects of ensuring quality and reliability in the assessments on which decisions are based. Human rights and freedoms, and particularly the rights accorded to children in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, must be taken into account. Articles 3 and 12 of the Convention are particularly relevant. These state that the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration in all actions concerning children, and that every child has the right to express his or her own views and be heard in all matters affecting the child. The child’s views must be given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child.</p>
<h2>Proposal for a new act on changes of legal gender</h2>
<p>Changing a person’s legal gender is a prerequisite if that person is to be able to access official documents (such as passports or other identity documents) that reflect the gender with which they themselves identify. Living with a legal gender that does not reflect the gender with which a person identifies causes numerous problems. In Sweden, it is necessary to show ID or give your personal identity number in the most mundane situations: buying a train ticket, renting a film or seeing a doctor. Transgender people living as the gender with which they identify but without corresponding identity documents often encounter problems when they have to give a female or male personal identity number or name that does not correspond to their own gender identity. There is a risk that the person is doubted, or is treated in a degrading way. The daily life of transgender people is fraught with situations in which they risk not being able to prove their identity.</p>
<p>Changing a person’s legal gender in the population register means, in practical terms, changing their personal identity number. A new personal identity number makes it possible for the person in question to obtain new identity documents, for example. This in turn enables that person to produce identity documents that correspond to their gender identity, which is significant in terms of both their health and wellbeing and their prospects of participating in society.</p>
<p>The living conditions of transgender people as a group raise issues of human rights protection and protection from discrimination. The question of changing legal gender attracts attention in the international arena where the focus is on human rights and discrimination. In the Inquiry’s assessment, respect for the private life of the individual and the right to self-determination and privacy means that individuals should be free to change their gender as recorded in the population register. The process of changing legal gender should be rapid, straightforward and transparent. Moreover, it is important that the laws regulating the legal change do not lay down any indirect or direct requirements of medical care or treatment before the individual is able to change their legal gender. No one should be forced to undergo any kind of medical or psychological treatment, process or assessment on the grounds of their gender identity.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s survey and analysis of the Act concerning recognition of gender in certain cases shows that the legal and medical aspects of the process of changing legal gender are still closely linked, despite the removal of the sterilisation requirement before changing gender. A medical examination is still the basis of the assessment of whether the conditions for changing gender under Section 1 of the Act concerning recognition of gender in certain cases are fulfilled. Contact between the individual and health and medical care services plays a crucial role in that individual being able to change their gender. The requirements in the Act concerning recognition of gender in certain cases are, in reality, medical in nature and aim to ensure that a person’s decisions with respect to irreversible surgical procedures are well-considered. Furthermore, a decision on a change of gender is a requirement for an individual to be approved for certain surgical procedures, namely surgery on the sexual organs or the removal of sex glands. The Inquiry’s overall assessment is that the Act concerning recognition of gender in certain cases aims to protect individuals against making incorrect decisions concerning future gender reassignment surgery and thus prevent incorrect care and treatment within the health and medical care system. The Act should therefore be seen as part of a medical decision-making process and can be likened to other special legislation in the area of health and medical care. Regarding human rights and protection against discrimination, the Inquiry takes the view that the current Act concerning recognition of gender in certain cases is not compatible with respect for the private life of the individual and the right to self-determination and privacy. The Act means that individuals are not free to change their gender as recorded in the population register. The requirements imposed in the process of changing gender mean that it is far from rapid, straightforward and transparent. From a human rights perspective, it is worth noting that the Act is, as mentioned above, part of a medical decision-making process. To change gender, an individual is forced to seek contact with the health and medical care system.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s assessment, human rights and the European</p>
<p>Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms mean that anyone who wishes to change their legal gender as it appears in the population register should be free to do so. Changes of legal gender should be fully recognised, and the process of changing legal gender should be rapid, straightforward and transparent. Furthermore, there should be no indirect or direct requirements of medical assessment, care or treatment before an individual is able to change their gender as recorded in the population register. The Inquiry proposes that the Act concerning recognition of gender in certain cases be repealed, and replaced with two new laws: an act on changes of legal gender and an act on approval for medical procedures on sexual organs and removal of sex glands. The act on changes of legal gender should regulate the conditions for changing the legal gender of an individual in the population register, involving the allocation of a new personal identity number to that person. The basic premise is that anyone who wishes to change their legal gender should be free to do so.</p>
<h2>Possibilities for children and young people to change their legal gender</h2>
<p>Under the Act concerning recognition of gender in certain cases, there can be no question of changing gender before the age of 18. The Inquiry takes the view that children and young people cannot be left without any possibility to change their legal gender on the sole ground that they are children. A child rights perspective, based on the best interests of the child, human rights and the principle of non-discrimination, means that young people’s need to change their legal gender must be recognised where applicable. However, the question of children and young people changing their legal gender requires special evaluation. The conditions for children and young people to change their legal gender must be analysed and tailored taking account of human rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the rights and responsibilities of custodial parents.</p>
<p>To be able to decide whether a young person should have the right, at any given age, to apply for their legal gender to be changed, the level of maturity at that age must be set in relation to the difficulty and significance of the decision to be taken. If young people of a given age can be considered sufficiently mature to take in information and comprehend the consequences of a decision to change legal gender, the young person could be entitled to make the decision. The Inquiry’s proposal of a new act on changes of legal gender involves a clear line being drawn between the legal and medical aspects of the process of changing gender. A decision to change legal gender is a purely administrative decision concerning the population register and, more specifically, a person’s personal identity number. This change has no link or connection with irreversible gender reassignment care and treatment within the health and medical care system. In the Inquiry’s assessment, therefore, the difficulty of a decision taken about a person’s legal gender is, in legal and formal terms, minor because it only concerns a change of personal identity number. The difficulty could rather be said to lie in a young person actively choosing to go against the norms and ideas that dominate in a heteronormative society. In terms of the significance of a decision to change legal gender, the Inquiry considers that this must be evaluated from a legal and a human perspective. The Inquiry considers that the legal significance of a decision to change legal gender is not a new issue, as it is already possible to change gender under the current Act concerning recognition of gender in certain cases. Any difficulties that arise following a change of legal gender, for example in applying legislation, could be resolved in the same way as for adults. Any legislation should be applied analogously. The possibility for children and young people to change their legal gender means that young people can obtain official documents that reflect the gender with which they identify, which in some cases is in the best interests of the child. This measure would make it easier for transgender young people to go about their business in public and could help improve the quality of life of this group, not least because the young person receives affirmation or legal recognition of the gender with which they identify. In the view of the Inquiry, a possibility to change legal gender can be considered hugely significant from a human perspective.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that young people aged 15 and over should be able to apply for a change of legal gender. They can be considered to have reached an age and level of maturity that they themselves – independently of consent from their custodial parents – can apply for a change of legal gender in the population register. This means restricting the rights of custodial parents to decide on the personal affairs of their children. The Inquiry considers that it is important that the parental perspective defers on matters concerning a young person’s gender identity, with reference to the best interests of the child.</p>
<p>For children and young people aged 12–15, the Inquiry proposes that the young person, together with a custodial parent, be allowed to apply for a change of legal gender. In such cases, a change to the young person’s legal gender would require the consent of both the young person and the custodial parent. If the young person has two custodial parents, the basic premise is that both of them must consent to the change of legal gender. To prevent disagreement between custodial parents affecting young people who have a clear need to change their legal gender, an addition to the Children and Parents Code is proposed. The proposed addition aims to make it possible for the Social Welfare Committee to decide that a change may take place without the other custodial parent’s consent, if this is necessary in the best interests of the child.</p>
<p>It is also proposed that the act on changes of legal gender contain a special provision on children and young people under the age of 12 with congenital disorders of sex development. In light of the young age of the children involved in such cases, a change of legal gender will require the submission of a certificate attesting that the change is in accordance with the development of the child’s gender identity and with the child’s wishes, taking account of the child’s age and level of maturity.</p>
<h2>Proposal for a new act on approval for medical procedures on sexual organs and removal of sex glands</h2>
<p>Part of the process of changing gender is, as previously outlined, the medical care and treatment of transgender people or people with gender dysphoria. As also outlined above, the Inquiry considers that the Act concerning recognition of gender in certain cases should be repealed and replaced with two new laws, one of them an act on approval for medical procedures on sexual organs and removal of sex glands. The proposal of this new act means that the procedures that require approval under the current Act concerning recognition of gender in certain cases would still be examined by the National Board of Health and Welfare. The reason for introducing a special law on these procedures is that surgery on the sexual organs and the removal of sex glands are a very special kind of procedure, and are irreversible. It is therefore very important that the quality assurance provided by the National Board of Health and Welfare approval procedure remains in place. The proposed act should be seen as special legislation in the area of health and medical care.</p>
<h2>Possibilities for young people to be approved for surgery on sexual organs or the removal of sex glands</h2>
<p>One consequence of the age limit in the Act concerning recognition of gender in certain cases is that young transgender people cannot access the same health and medical care as adults. The age limit is the sole deciding factor in whether surgical procedures are undertaken; it makes no difference if the young person, their custodial parent(s) and the medical team agree that a procedure is in the best interests of the child. It is particularly important to note in this context that there have been cases of young transgender people taking their own lives while waiting for surgery. However, this does not mean that medical procedures on sexual organs or the removal of sex glands constitute the right care for children and young people in all cases. The Inquiry considers that children and young people’s need for surgical procedures in some cases must be recognised, and that there should be a possibility for young people to be approved for such procedures.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a requirement whereby a young person must have reached the age of 15 to be approved for medical procedures on sexual organs or the removal of sex glands. The mere fact of having reached the age of 15 does not mean that approval will be granted by the National Board of Health and Welfare, however. For approval to be granted, the procedure must be compatible with science and tried and tested experience, the custodial parent(s) must give consent, and the young person must have a sufficient level of maturity to consent. The requirement that the young person must have a sufficient level of maturity to consent to the procedure should, in the Inquiry’s view, carry more weight than the age limit, where applicable. In cases where a young person has reached the age of 15 but is not considered to be of an age or level of maturity to consent to the procedure, approval should not be granted. The maturity requirement thus complements the age limit, offering scope to deny approval in cases where the age requirement is met but the maturity requirement is not.</p>
<p>If the young person has two custodial parents, both must consent to the procedure in question. To prevent disagreement between custodial parents affecting young people who have a clear need for the procedure, an addition to the Children and Parents Code is</p>
<p>proposed. The proposed addition aims to make it possible for the Social Welfare Committee to decide that approval may be given without the other custodial parent’s consent, if this is necessary in the best interests of the child.</p>
