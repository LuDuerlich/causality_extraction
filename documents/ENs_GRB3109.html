<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The task of the Committee</h2>
<p>The Committee has been instructed to analyse and consider the need for amendments principally to the Radio and Television Act (1996:844) (RTVL) and the Television Licence Fees Act (1989:41) and also to propose the statutory amendments resulting from the deliberations.</p>
<p>This interim report deals with the part of the Committee’s task that consists of deliberating on what statutory amendments are necessary to ensure that those living in properties connected to cable have access to a basic range of television programmes, even after the cessation of analogue terrestrial broadcasts.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The RTVL, Chapter 8, contains provisions on the obligations of holders of cable television networks to forward certain television programmes to the residents (‘must carry’). The network holders are, among other things, under an obligation to carry, in a cable network, certain programmes that are broadcast with the permission of the Government and which are intended to be received in the area without conditions for special payment. The must carry obligation entails a limitation in the network holders’ freedom of expression, according to the Swedish constitution, and the right to freely broadcast radio programmes by wire. However, the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression (YGL), Chapter 3, Section 1, second paragraph prescribes that such a limitation may be made. According to this provision, an obligation may be prescribed for network holders to provide space for certain programmes to the extent this is necessary, having regard to the public interest in the availability of comprehensive information.</p>
<p>The Riksdag  (Swedish Parliament) decided on 28 May 2003 that the analogue terrestrial broadcasts should be phased out no later than 1 February 2008 (Government Bill 2002/03:72, Report 2002/03:KU33 and Riksdag Communication 2002/03:196). The discontinuation of analogue television broadcasts will be implemented in stages and commenced at the earliest when the must carry legislation has been adapted to all terrestrial broadcasts being digital.</p>
<p>The substitution of analogue terrestrial broadcasts with digital broadcasts means, among other things, that the range of television broadcasts will be greater and have a different profile than before. Digitalisation and convergence development also entail that it is possible to distribute television broadcasts in wire networks other than traditional cable television networks, for example broadband networks, linked telecommunications networks and electrical networks.</p>
<h2>Deliberations and proposals</h2>
<p>The must carry obligation shall continue</p>
<p>The rules on the must carry obligation in cable networks are aimed at ensuring that those who live in a property that is connected to cable have access to the same range of programmes as they would have had if the property had not been connected to a cable network, and thereby alleviate the effects of the actual monopoly on cable broadcasting capacity within a particular area that the network holders have. These rules are justified by a strong public interest in the population throughout Sweden being reached by the range of programmes provided as a public service and which are funded via the television licence fee or which are broadcast under essentially the same conditions as public service. In this way, freedom of expression and freedom of information is promoted. Households are afforded access to a diverse range of programmes that, subject to demands concerning objectivity and impartiality, take into account the needs of different age groups, the interest in reflecting cultural diversity, the needs of disabled persons and other important social interests.</p>
<p>The Committee considers that the underlying reasons for the rules on the must carry obligation in Swedish legislation are still valid and will continue to be so even after the cessation of analogue terrestrial broadcasts. We consider that the other possibilities for safeguarding access, for those properties connected to cable, to a basic television range following digitalisation of the terrestrial network are inadequate. A statutory requirement for a must carry obligation is justified on the basis of a strong public interest in ensuring that all households have access to a basic range of television programmes and thereby complies with EC law. Our assessment is therefore that the must carry obligation should continue to apply.</p>
<p>The scope of the must carry obligation</p>
<p>The legislation on the must carry obligation regarding cable networks for certain broadcasts from the terrestrial network currently guarantees the access of cable television households to three television programmes that are broadcast by programme undertakings funded by fees, i.e. SVT1, SVT2 and, where available, SVT’s digital programme service 24, and at most one television programme that is broadcast by another licence holder, namely TV4. It should be observed here that the Swedish Educational Broadcasting Company (UR) broadcasts within SVT’s programme range.</p>
<p>According to the assessment of the Committee, there is no cause to change the main criteria for determining which programmes may come within the ambit of the must carry obligation. It follows, both from Article 31 of the USO Directive and Chapter 3, Section 1, second paragraph YGL, that the must carry obligation is founded on the interest of the public having access to comprehensive information. We consider that the requirements imposed under Chapter 8, Section 1, first paragraph RTVL – whereby must carry channels should be broadcast pursuant to a licence that prescribes impartiality and objectivity together with a diverse programme range, including news – correspond well to the requirements imposed by Article 31 of the USO Directive and Chapter 3, Section 1 YGL. We therefore propose that these requirements should remain in force.</p>
<p>Our starting point is that the must carry obligation should not encompass more frequency space than it does today, but that digitalisation affords scope to extend the number of television programmes that have a must carry status.</p>
<p>As long as SVT organises its range of programmes in accordance with its assignment to produce broadcasts in the public service, the</p>
<p>Committee considers that it is not justified, as regards the must carry obligation, to decide that certain parts of the range are of greater public interest than others. Public interest requires, in the opinion of the Committee, that the entire range of SVT’s digital programme services should be covered by the rules concerning the must carry obligation. We therefore propose that SVT’s entire range should be subject to the must carry obligation. This also includes UR’s programmes, as UR, as indicated above, when exercising its broadcasting rights, shall utilise SVT’s broadcasting space.</p>
<p>We also consider that the must carry obligation, even after digitalisation of broadcasts in the terrestrial network, should cover programmes that are broadcast by licence holders that are not funded by means of television licence fees. The broadcasting obligation shall only cover programmes broadcast pursuant to a broadcasting licence that contains requirements on impartiality and objectivity and also a condition on a diverse programme range, including news. Having regard, among other things, to the requirement of proportionality contained in Article 31 of the USO Directive, the must carry obligation should be limited to at most three such simultaneously broadcasted programme services.</p>
<p>The Committee considers that it should be open for everybody to apply for a broadcasting licence, with such conditions as are required to be subject to the must carry obligation. Nothing should prevent the grant of a broadcasting licence with such conditions relating to more than three programme services in addition to SVT’s range. A network operator shall, in such a case, not be obliged to carry more than three programmes in addition to SVT’s range and should thereby be free to choose which three programme services shall be distributed free of charge in the network.</p>
<p>The broadcasting obligation shall also comprise teletext services and also services in addition to the programme services themselves, provided they have a direct link to television programmes that are covered by the broadcasting obligation. This includes, for example, ancillary services that are aimed at increasing accessibility for disabled persons.</p>
<p>What forms of distribution should be covered by the must carry obligation?</p>
<p>The provision concerning the must carry obligation in cable networks shall, in our opinion, be technology neutral. The statutory text should furthermore reflect the fundamental requirements on the must carry obligation that are stipulated in Article 31 of the USO Directive. We therefore propose that Chapter 8, Section 1 RTVL, is amended so that it applies to everybody who owns or otherwise controls an electronic communications network, where the network is used for the transmission of television broadcasts to the public by cable and a significant number of households connected to the network use it as their principal means to receive television broadcasts. The provisions of the fifth paragraph concerning exemptions from the obligation for so-called ‘linked telecommunications networks’ will consequently become unnecessary and it is proposed that it is repealed.</p>
<p>We consider that, as with the current provision, there should be an obligation on the network operators to fulfil the must carry obligation.</p>
<p>Compensation issues</p>
<p>The protection of rights under the Copyright Act (1960:729) entails, in connection with carrying of television programmes by landline, first that the holders of rights (both the programme undertaking and other holders) must consent to the signal/programme being carried by wire, second that the cable operator may be obliged to pay compensation for the carrying. Up to this time, the holders of rights have refrained from requesting compensation for the material subject to copyright that is included in the programme services covered by the must carry obligation. However, the Committee has been informed by Copyswede, which represents the holders of rights on these issues, that it will in the future request compensation under the Copyright Act also for these programme services. This has led to the Committee presenting a proposal to govern the issue of compensation for rights.</p>
<p>We consider that, according to the provisions of the Copyright Act, it is in the first instance the network operators who should bear the costs of the compensation for rights. However, as such a system may in certain cases entail serious financial consequences, we propose that a provision is introduced into Chapter 8, Section 1 RTVL providing network operators with a right to reasonable compensation from a broadcasting undertaking for compensation costs under the Copyright Act, if the must carry obligation would otherwise be unreasonably burdensome. If the parties cannot agree on the matter, the Radio and TV Authority shall, upon special request, be able to decide on the allocation of the costs.</p>
<p>Transitional provisions</p>
<p>We propose that it is prescribed, by means of transitional provisions, that older provisions shall apply to areas where terrestrial broadcasts are made with analogue technology. However, the proposed new rules on the distribution of costs for compensation under the Copyright Act should be applied immediately. It should be possible, within the framework of the Radio and TV Authority’s powers under Chapter 8, Section 6 RTVL, to grant exemptions from the must carry obligation, to deal with the transitional problems that may arise if, after analogue terrestrial broadcasts in an area have completely ceased, there are still cable networks that are not able to distribute television broadcasts with digital technology. However, we consider that the underlying EC legal system of rules does not allow a special must carry obligation of analogue broadcasts in cable networks that forward television programmes, both analogue and digital.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>The fact that holders of rights will in the future no longer refrain from the right to receive compensation under the Copyright Act for the programmes subject to the must carry obligation means that the network operators will incur increased costs for rights clearances. Considering that the amount of the costs in question depends upon negotiations between the parties, it is very difficult to make more than a rough estimate of these costs. The increase in costs may also be said to be due more to the change in attitude of the holders of rights rather than the proposals presented by the Committee.</p>
<p>The proposed amendments to the Radio and Television Act involve both new tasks and an extension of existing tasks for the Radio and TV Authority. It is estimated that this will result in an increased need for resources corresponding to two manpower years.</p>
