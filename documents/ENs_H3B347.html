<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The remit of the Inquiry has been to examine how Swedish law relates to Directive 2014/26/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on collective management of copyright and related rights and multi-territorial licensing of rights in musical works for online use in the internal market, to propose the legislative amendments necessary to implement the Directive and to assess the effects and consequences for those concerned.</p>
<h2>The work of the Inquiry</h2>
<p>The Inquiry began its work in March 2014. The work has been conducted in consultation with the Government-appointed experts. The Inquiry has held six meetings involving the participation of the experts. In addition, the Inquiry has held several meetings with various stakeholders that contacted the Inquiry during the course of the work, such as representatives of commercial users and rightholders.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has kept itself informed of relevant ongoing legislative work at the Government Offices, including on the Föreningslagsutredningen  (Inquiry on the Economic Associations Act) reports (SOU 2009:37 and SOU 2020:90). In the final stage of its work, a draft proposal referred to the Council on Legislation for consideration was presented. It contained proposals for amendments to the Föreningslagen  (Economic Associations Act), which the Inquiry, as far as possible, has tried to take into account in its work.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the work on the considerations of the proposal on the choice of government agency (“competent authority”) to be responsible for the supervision of compliance with certain provisions implementing the Directive, the Inquiry has had contacts with responsible officials and agencies.</p>
<p>In an attempt to, as far as possible, achieve Nordic consensus on the question of implementing the Directive, the Inquiry has taken the initiative on, and participated in, several meetings with representatives of other Nordic ministries. The Inquiry has also kept itself informed about discussions between the European Commission and the Member States on the implementation of the Directive.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>The Directive contains requirements to ensure that collective management organisations manage copyright and related rights in a well-functioning way. The Directive also contains provisions on multi-territorial licensing of rights to musical works for online use.</p>
<p>In the main, the Inquiry has proposed an implementation that does not go further than that required by the Directive since more far-reaching regulations could lead to competitive disadvantage for organisations established in Sweden. The Inquiry’s starting point has been that the proposed new regulations should concur with the requirement level set by the Directive.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has assessed that the necessary regulations should be expressed in a new Act. The Inquiry has consistently endeavoured to find solutions that are compatible with existing Swedish principles and arrangements, both with regard to the regulatory framework and the practical arrangements on collective management.</p>
<p>The Directive on collective rights management contains requirements on i) governance and supervision of collective management, ii) the organisations’ collection of rights revenues, management and payment of collected revenues, iii) the organisations’ relations to other management organisations, iv) relations with users, and v) transparency, provision of information and reporting. In addition, the Directive contains conditions and requirements on multi-territorial licensing in certain cases and, finally, regulations on compliance and control.</p>
<h2>Governance and supervision of collective management</h2>
<p>The Directive’s provisions on governance and supervision of collective management organisations (Articles 4–10) aim to increase the possibility of individual members and rightholders to exert influence over the collective management of their rights. Some of these regulations have no equivalent in Swedish law and, to implement these, regulations with wording close to that of the Directive are proposed. In order to clarify that the new Act does not affect the regulations on the extended effect of an extended collective licence and mandatory collective management, special clarifications are proposed in the Act.</p>
<p>Other regulations on governance and supervision are primarily of a company law character (Articles 6, 8 and 9) and correspond in certain aspects to regulations in existing Swedish Acts on companies and associations. Here, the Inquiry has sought an implementation that, as far as possible, takes account of existing regulatory frameworks and arrangements, for instance with regard to powers and obligations of governing boards and general meetings. The proposed regulations are neutral and do not limit the possibility of organisations to choose their own legal form.</p>
<p>With regard to obligations of the persons who manage the business of the collective management organisation (Article 10), the Inquiry considers that the regulations are of a regulatory law character and that they extend beyond that set out in existing company law regulations.</p>
<h2>The organisations’ collection of rights revenues, management and payment of collected revenues</h2>
<p>The Directive’s provisions on collection of rights revenues, management and payment of collected revenues (Articles 11–13) aim to impose common requirements on collective management organisations, including with regard to the separation of accounts for revenues that concern collective management and other revenues at the organisation’s disposal. Furthermore, conditions and limitations are set on the ability of collective management organisations to invest collected revenues pending distribution to rightholders and on their ability to make special types of deductions, as are special regulations on distribution and payment.</p>
<p>These regulations are of a regulatory law character and overlap in part to existing regulations in the Copyright Act, such as the regulations on resale right, private copying and extended collective licences. In addition to necessary consequential amendments – to avoid regulatory conflicts – it is proposed that the regulations are implemented with wording close to that of the Directive. As far as possible, the implementation proposal has been adapted to the existing Swedish system of umbrella organisations and member organisations, whereby, for example, revenues are collected by the umbrella organisation but are finally distributed and paid out to rightholders by a member organisation.</p>
<h2>The organisations’ relations with other management organisations</h2>
<p>The Directive’s provisions on the collective management organisations’ relations with other management organisations (Articles 14 and 15) are of a regulatory law character and set out general requirements on non-discrimination, enable a possibility to make certain deductions and contain regulations on distribution and payment. The regulations have no equivalent in existing Swedish legislation. The Inquiry proposes that the regulations are implemented with wording close to that of the Directive.</p>
<h2>Relations with users</h2>
<p>The Directive’s provisions on the collective management organisations’ relations with users, including on licensing and the users reporting obligation (Articles 16 and 17) are primarily of a private law character. The provisions have no equivalent in existing Swedish legislation, even if some of them are inspired by case law from the Court of Justice of the European Union and decisions by the European Commission in the field of competition law. The Inquiry proposes that the regulations are implemented with wording close to that of the Directive.</p>
<h2>Transparency, provision of information and reporting</h2>
<p>The Directive’s provisions on transparency, provision of information and reporting (Articles 18–22) are primarily of a private law character, even if some of them contain significant public law elements, for instance the regulations on information that is to be provided to the public and the regulations on the annual transparency report and its auditing (Articles 21 and 22). Several of the regulations have no equivalent in existing Swedish law, even if the regulations on the transparency report largely have equivalents in existing Swedish accounting regulations. The Inquiry proposes that the regulations are implemented with wording close to that of the Directive.</p>
<h2>Connection to certain regulations on collective management in the Copyright Act</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Copyright Act provisions on which organisations may collect copyright remuneration, such as private copying remuneration and resale right remuneration, and enter into agreements on extended collective licences be supplemented with a requirement that the organisation has to be a “collective management organisation” under the Act on collective rights management. This proposal is not a direct result of the Directive, but it is strongly linked to the Directive’s aim of harmonising collective management in the EU.</p>
<h2>Conditions and requirements on multi-territorial licensing in certain cases</h2>
<p>The Directive’s provisions on requirements concerning collective management organisations engaged in multi-territorial management of online rights to musical works for use online (Articles 23–32) aim to set requirements on organisations that want to conduct such activities. These provisions have both civil law and public law elements. The Inquiry proposes an implementation in accordance with the exceptions allowed in the Directive with regard to multi-territorial services for providing access to musical works in sheet music form (see recital 40 of the Directive). These provisions have largely no equivalent in existing Swedish law. The Inquiry proposes that they are implemented with wording close to that of the Directive.</p>
<h2>Compliance and control</h2>
<p>The Directive’s regulations on complaints, different kinds of dispute resolution, monitoring and other forms of control of compliance with the Directive’s provisions, as well as cooperation and exchange of information with government agencies (competent authorities) in other Member States (Articles 33–38), allow for a fairly flexible implementation in Swedish law. The mechanisms for control can be adjusted according to the regulations’ civil or public law character, which enables implementation in which control of compliance with the provisions can to a large extent take place before the courts. For provisions that have considerable public (regulatory) law elements, the Inquiry proposes supervision via an administrative authority. The Inquiry proposes the Swedish Patent and Registration Office as the competent authority with responsibility for supervision of the collective management organisations.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposals</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes, with just a few exceptions, regulations that do not go beyond the requirements of the Directive. Even with this starting point, it may be noted that the proposed Act on collective rights management is fairly comprehensive. By and large, the Act contains regulations that have no equivalent in existing regulatory frameworks, both with regard to the material provisions on rights and obligations for different actors and the provisions on compliance control.</p>
<p>A general assessment is that the regulatory framework required to implement the directive generally seems better adapted to collective management as conducted in the music sector, compared with other areas. Outside the music sector, the proposed regulatory framework seems to create the greatest challenges with regard to (detailed) requirements on distribution and payment to rightholders, with accompanying requirements on reporting etc. Certain organisations are thus already largely adapted to the regulatory framework, while others may need to do much more – particularly initially – to meet the requirements. The Inquiry’s assessment is that certain smaller actors may have difficulties in achieving necessary economies of scale in collective management under the new regulatory framework, which may lead to restructuring and new cooperation structures.</p>
<p>A possible positive effect of the regulatory framework may be that a larger part of the collected amounts will be distributed on an individual basis. In general the legitimacy of collective management may increase. However, in some cases the benefits may come at the expense of increased costs, for example, for administration of distribution and payment of sums that were not previously distributed individually, which affects total payments to rightholders collectively. Indirectly, this can have a negative effect on the function of the organisations as promoters of cultural diversity.</p>
<p>It is proposed that supervision by the Swedish Patent and Registration Office be financed primarily through direct state funding (tax-financed) and secondly through fees (against revenue headings in the central government budget).</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>The Directive is to be transposed into national law by 10 April 2016. The Directive does not contain any general provisions on the application in time of its implementation. The Inquiry therefore proposes that the regulations that implement the Directive enter into force on the same day the Directive is to be implemented.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is proposed that the amendments to the Copyright Act enter into force at the same time as the new Act. However, the new regulations will not apply to measures taken or rights acquired before entry into force of the new Act. This means, for instance, that extended collective licence agreements that were entered into before the entry into force of the new Act will continue to be valid.</p>
