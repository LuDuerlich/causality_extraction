<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The remit of the Inquiry was to submit proposals aimed at reducing the use of pre-trial detention and restrictions. More specifically, the remit included the following:  considering and, if deemed appropriate, proposing new forms of coercive measures under criminal law as alternatives to detention;  considering and, if deemed appropriate, proposing time limits for the use of detention and restrictions;  identifying and proposing measures to limit the use of restrictions and counteract the isolation of detainees; and  focusing in particular on measures to limit the use of detention and restrictions for children and other young offenders.</p>
<h2>Starting points</h2>
<p>In combating crime, it is important to be able to use coercive measures against individuals suspected of an offence. It is also important, when necessary, to limit the contact these individuals have with the outside world. At the same time, it follows from the presumption of innocence principle that anyone suspected of an offence must be considered innocent until they are convicted.</p>
<p>The most intrusive coercive measure is detention. If detention is combined with restrictions, the detainee can be cut off from essentially all contact with the outside world, despite the fact that they have not yet been convicted.</p>
<p>Research shows that isolation is harmful to people after only a few days and that it can cause above all psychological, but sometimes even physical, harm. Isolation is particularly damaging for persons under the age of 18.</p>
<p>According to the definition of isolation that is most accepted and that we have chosen to apply, a person is isolated if they have been confined to their cell and deprived of all meaningful human contact for 22–24 hours per day. Based on this definition, most people who are detained with restrictions are isolated.</p>
<p>Our understanding is that restrictions are used to a greater extent than is justified, and there is reason to believe that in Sweden we overestimate the risk that a person who is detained without restrictions will act in an untrustworthy manner. Contact between inmates is an effective means of relieving the isolation of detention and, in our opinion, the opportunity for such contact needs to increase. The risk of a suspect coming in contact with the outside world through another inmate who also has restrictions, and influencing the investigation must, in reality, usually be extremely limited.</p>
<p>All in all, it is our opinion that a radical change is needed in the view of detention and the culture that surrounds, and has surrounded, this issue. Furthermore, we believe it is important that the number of children in detention centres decreases substantially. New legislation is needed to ensure this.</p>
<p>The proposals resulting from our work – which include new alternatives to detention, the limitation of detention periods, the expanded examination of restrictions by the courts, the statutory right to human contact, and special regulations for children deprived of their liberty – are presented below.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals Alternatives to detention</h2>
<p>Two additional alternatives to the existing detention options of travel bans and the obligation to report are house arrest and area arrest. House arrest and area arrest mean the suspect is prohibited from leaving their residence or a certain geographical area other than at certain set times and for specific purposes. The basic premise is that suspects should be able to retain any job, place on an education or training programme, or other daytime activity.</p>
<p>Compliance with the ban is supervised electronically, and the Swedish Prison and Probation Service is responsible for this supervision.</p>
<p>House arrest or area arrest must be deemed appropriate in order for these options to be considered. In order to make this assessment, the prosecutor or the court must request an investigation by the Swedish Prison and Probation Service. Following a hearing, the court then issues its decision on the matter.</p>
<p>If the prosecutor does not initiate prosecution proceedings within the specified period, the court must hold a new hearing on the matter after a period of at most one month.</p>
<p>Violation should, as a general rule, lead to the suspect being taken into custody or detained.</p>
<p>For house arrest or area arrest, the same time period should apply for a main hearing in the district court and court of appeal as when the defendant is detained, i.e. as a general rule two weeks from the institution of proceedings and eight weeks from the day the district court issues its judgment.</p>
<h2>Limitation of detention periods</h2>
<p>Detention periods should be delimited through the use of time limits. Suspects may, until prosecution proceedings are instituted, be deprived of their liberty such as detained, for a continuous period of at most six months. The period may be extended if there are special grounds to do so.</p>
<p>If the detainee is under 18 years of age, the time limit is instead three months. The period may be extended if it is absolutely necessary to do so.</p>
<p>If the prosecutor requests that the deprivation of liberty should continue longer than the time limit permits, the court must hold a hearing no later than on the day the time limit expires. A detention order may be revoked by both the court and the prosecutor.</p>
<p>Prior to or at each detention hearing, the prosecutor must present a timetable for the preliminary investigation. If the timetable is presented orally, it should be documented in the court record.</p>
<h2>Expanded examination of restrictions by the courts and statutory right to human contact</h2>
<p>The court should examine whether the prosecutor should receive permission to restrict the detainee’s contacts based on four specific restriction categories. These restriction categories are:</p>
<p>If the prosecutor receives permission to issue a certain type of restriction, the court must give the reasons for this in its decision.</p>
<p>Inmates must be entitled to spend time with another person for at least two hours every day. The Swedish Prison and Probation Service must also ensure that detention centres have a communal space for every 15 inmates and that units without communal areas have at least one full-time employee for every 15 inmates whose task is to work exclusively on measures to relieve isolation. For each one of these positions, a specific activity area should be established.</p>
<p>To make it easier for detainees to come in contact with family and friends, the Swedish Prison and Probation Service’s routines for obtaining consent from individuals the detainee would like to have contact with must be simplified and expedited. Police interception of detainees’ telephone conversations should normally be able to take place via conference calls, and detainees should have the opportunity to make and receive calls from mobile phones and telephones connected to IP telephone systems.</p>
<h2>Special regulations for children</h2>
<p>Detainees who are under 18 years of age must be held in special youth homes. The prosecutor may decide that the child should instead be detained in a detention centre if there are particularly strong reasons against being detained in a special youth home. The prosecutor must continuously review any such decision.</p>
<p>Detained children and children held in custody who are placed in a detention centre must be entitled to spend time with another person for at least four hours every day.</p>
<p>A person under the age of 18 may be taken into custody only if there are particular reasons for doing so. A person who is arrested or held in custody and is under the age of 18 may be held under police arrest only when absolutely necessary.</p>
<h2>Other measures to reduce detention</h2>
<p>The ‘two-year rule’, which involves a presumption of detention on suspicion of an offence which carries a penalty of no less than imprisonment for two years, is to be abolished.</p>
<p>The option of adjudicating a case ultimately through a combination of detention hearing and main hearing is to be expanded. It must therefore be possible to adjudicate such cases without a lay judge.</p>
<p>A prosecutor must provisionally be able to appoint a public defence counsel for a person in custody if there is otherwise a risk that the investigation is unnecessarily delayed. This regulation has particular significance in evenings and at weekends.</p>
<p>The potential pool of staff that may be tasked with reviewing items of mail to or from a detainee is to be expanded to also include employees of the Swedish Prosecution Authority and Swedish Customs.</p>
<p>The prosecutor must be able to inform the suspect of the issue of any summary imposition of a punishment consisting of a suspended sentence or suspended sentence and fines via video link or telephone instead of at a personal meeting if there are special grounds for doing so. This does not apply to suspects who are under 21 years of age.</p>
<h2>Implications of the proposals</h2>
<p>In our assessment, the proposals for new alternatives to detention, the limitation of detention periods and the expanded examination of restrictions by the courts will lead to shorter detention periods, the reduced use of restrictions and more efficient investigative work. All in all, this will bring about cost savings for public authorities.</p>
<p>The proposals for more employees to relieve isolation, rebuilding detention centres, holding detained children in special youth homes, and rebuilding these special youth homes will result in increased costs for public authorities.</p>
<p>Initially, the increase in costs will likely exceed the reduction in costs, primarily because of the one-off costs for rebuilding. Our view, however, is that the proposals over time, and likely even after a few years, will lead to annual cost savings for public authorities, primarily as a result of shorter detention periods, but also as a result of the more efficient flow of cases at the Police, the prosecution authority and the courts.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>Under the proposal, the legislative amendments concerning alternatives to detention will enter into force on 1 February 2018 and the other amendments on 1 April 2018.</p>
<p>In determining a date for entry into force, we have taken particular consideration of the National Board of Institutional Care’s need to adapt premises and routines at the special youth homes. We have also taken into consideration the Swedish Prison and Probation Service’s need to rebuild and recruit at detention centres, and the Service’s need to take measures ahead of the introduction of home arrest and area arrest. In determining the date for entry into force of alternatives to detention we have taken into consideration the need to be able to pass a decision on home arrest or area arrest before the regulations on the limitation of detention periods enters into force.</p>
