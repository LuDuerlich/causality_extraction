<p>Scope of the remit</p>
<p>The terms of reference for the Inquiry are limited in such a way that the Inquiry has been assigned to present proposals on how regulation relating to health and medical services for asylum seekers and undocumented migrants can be made more effective than at present. A key point of departure, according to the terms of reference, is that none of the Inquiry Chair’s proposals should have an adverse impact on the asylum process, including the reception of asylum seekers, and that availability of medical services should not contribute to more people staying and working in Sweden without the necessary permits to stay in the country.</p>
<p>The two categories of people covered by the Inquiry’s work are thus asylum seekers and undocumented migrants. There are no actual facts regarding how many asylum seekers and undocumented migrants are staying in Sweden. Information given to the Inquiry indicates that the number of asylum seekers is approximately 35 000 yearly and that the number of undocumented migrants range from 10 000 to 35 000 each year.</p>
<p>A fundamental principle to be met for aliens to stay in Sweden is that such persons have a permit to stay here. The Aliens Act (2005:716) contains provisions on the circumstances in which an alien is to be allowed to enter Sweden and take up residence and work in the country. The regulations are based on the principle that only Swedish citizens having the unconditional right to stay in Sweden, while aliens need a passport and some kind of permit, a visa or residence permit, or long-term resident status. An alien who stays in Sweden for more than three months has to hold a residence permit unless a visa has been granted for a longer period. An alien who enters Sweden can also apply for a residence permit citing grounds for protection.</p>
<p>The term asylum seeker  is understood to mean someone who has applied for a residence permit in Sweden as a refugee under Chapter 4 Section 1 or a person otherwise in need of protection under Chapter 4 Section 2 or 2 a of the Aliens Act.</p>
<p>The terms of reference for the Inquiry describe firstly persons who evade execution of decisions on refusal of entry or deportation under the Aliens Act and secondly persons who are in Sweden without having applied for the necessary permit to stay in the country. The former group is sometimes called people in hiding, while the latter group is usually referred to as undocumented migrants. A number of different designations have been used in the debate when talking about people who may be included in this group. The Inquiry has, however, chosen to use the collective term undocumented migrant  to designate a person who is in Sweden without the necessary permit to stay in the country. It is thus, in the view of the Inquiry, the stay in the country without a permit that is the key determinant in this context, not whether the person previously has been an asylum seeker or not.</p>
<p>Health and medical services are understood, in accordance with Section 1 of the Health and Medical Services Act (1982:763), to mean measures for the medical prevention, investigation and treatment of disease and injury. Health and medical services also include ambulance services and care of deceased persons.</p>
<p>Under the statutory provision referred to above, dental care falls within what is regarded as health and medical services. The statutory regulation of dental care is, however, contained in the Dental Care Act (1985:125). Section 1 of this Act states that dental care means measures for the prevention, investigation and treatment of disease and injury in the oral cavity.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit has thus been to propose regulation regarding health and medical services, including dental care, that are to be offered to asylum seekers and undocumented migrants who are staying in Sweden.</p>
<p>As indicated above, the Inquiry’s remit is limited with regard to the category of persons covered. The remit only covers persons who are staying in Sweden without a permit and asylum seekers. Other aliens who are staying legally in Sweden are thus not covered by the remit.</p>
<p>Availability of health and medical services for the category of persons covered by the Inquiry’s remit</p>
<p>With regard to access to health and medical services, including dental care, for those persons who are covered by the Inquiry's remit different rules currently apply depending on the category of persons concerned.</p>
<p>Availability of health and medical services for asylum seekers  is governed by the Health and Medical Care for Asylum Seekers and Others Act (2008:344, the 2008 Act) and the Communicable Diseases Act (2004:168). The 2008 Act states that asylum-seeking children , i.e. such persons below 18 years of age, are to be offered subsidised health and medical services to the same extent as permanently resident children (Section 5), while asylum-seeking adults,  i.e. such persons over 18 years of age, are to be offered subsidised care that cannot be deferred (Section 6), including maternal health care, abortion care and counselling for contraceptives. Access to health and medical services, including dental care, for undocumented migrants  is currently governed by Sections 4–6 of the 2008 Act, the Communicable Diseases Act, Section 4 of the Health and Medical Services Act and Section 6 of the Dental Care Act, depending on whether the person has previously been an asylum seeker or not.</p>
<p>It is stated in these provisions that an undocumented child  (who is under the age of 18) who has been notified of a decision on refusal of entry or deportation after having applied for a residence permit as a refugee or a person otherwise in need of protection (i.e. who is living in hiding ) is to have the same access to subsidised health and medical services as a permanently resident child. If the child has not previously been an asylum seeker, the child is not covered by the provisions of the 2008 Act, and instead has the same access to health and medical services as adult  undocumented migrants, which follows from Section 4 of the Health and Medical Services Act and Section 6 of the Dental Care Act, namely access to non-subsidised immediate care.</p>
<p>The charges paid by permanently resident patients for the care offered are principally governed by Section 26 of the Health and Medical Services Act. Undocumented patients who are not entitled to subsidised care are responsible for bearing the costs of all the care they are offered. Asylum seekers are obliged to pay health care charges according to certain regulations, defined by the government.</p>
<p>Asylum seekers and undocumented patients in Sweden</p>
<p>In light of the limited availability of health and medical services that asylum seekers and undocumented migrants currently have in Sweden, voluntary organisations operate their own clinics, which the Inquiry has chosen to designate as “grey” clinics, in some places around the country, where such persons are attended to as patients. These clinics are run on a non-profit basis and the care is provided free of charge to the patients. The staff at the clinics are often professionally active or formerly professionally active in public or private health care. Most of the care the patients need can be provided at these clinics, but it has come to the attention of the Inquiry that patients are passed on to the ordinary places of work of the staff and that examinations and treatments are performed there, at a cost that is charged to the ordinary employer. Some of these clinics have contacts with certain pharmacies that assist in ensuring that these persons also have access to prescription medicines which the clinics then largely pay for.</p>
<p>Most of the county councils in Sweden have found the existing regulation to be so unclear and difficult to interpret and relate to in day-to-day care activity that they have chosen to adopt their own guidelines on what is to apply with regard to what care asylum seekers and undocumented migrants are to be offered. In some county councils these guidelines mean that asylum seekers and undocumented migrants are given access to health and medical services to a greater extent than follows from the legislation.</p>
<p>Inventory of problems</p>
<p>The Swedish regulation of the availability of health and medical services for asylum seekers and undocumented migrants has been the object of criticism both within Sweden and internationally (see section 6.3).</p>
<p>In an inventory of problems, the Inquiry has assessed Swedish legislation on this issue as not fully complying with the international commitments regarding the highest attainable standard of health for everyone that Sweden has assumed by signing international conventions and agreements (see section 6.5.5). The Inquiry has also noted that in another context the Government has declared that the level of ambition must be raised for human rights</p>
<p>to be implemented and respected in full  in all the countries of the world (see section 3.3).</p>
<p>The Inquiry has further deemed that neither does the presentday regulation fully comply with the purpose of what is prescribed in national legislation on the keeping of records and patient safety and certain administrative principles concerning municipal activity. The latter is particularly the case in view of what has been revealed regarding the care that asylum seekers and, in particular, undocumented migrants receive at “grey” clinics run by the voluntary organisations (see section 6.5.6).</p>
<p>Finally, the Inquiry has found that the current regulation is not fully in agreement with the principles of professional ethics that apply to the health care professions, which in itself has created something that can be regarded as a working environment problem for these professional groups (see section 6.5.4).</p>
<p>Sweden’s commitments on the right to the highest attainable standard of health for everyone</p>
<p>The right to the highest attainable standard of health for everyone has long been regarded as a human right and is described in several of the relevant conventions that Sweden as a state has made a commitment to adhere to (see section 3.4).</p>
<p>This right is described in particular in the UN International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). In its interpretation of the article concerned, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has stated in two comments (General Comment no. 14 and no. 20) that this right should apply to everyone who stays within the territory of a state, irrespective of legal status. The Committee has also stated that the issue of whether a state is fulfilling its commitments with regard to offering the right to the best possible health for everyone can be assessed on the basis of four different criteria, the AAAQ criteria ( availability, accessibility, acceptability  and quality ).</p>
<p>The Inquiry has found in its analysis (see section 6.5.5) that while health and medical services in Sweden can be said to meet the requirements of quality and acceptability, as well as being available to an adequate extent, the requirement of accessibility is not met with regard to asylum seekers and undocumented migrants. This applies in particular with regard to legal and economic accessibility,</p>
<p>but also to some extent with regard to accessibility of information. The Inquiry has found, for example, that information concerning the fact that care is already available to certain undocumented children today has not always fully reached out to this group of patients.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s assessment that Swedish regulation does not fully meet Sweden’s international commitments is shared by the UN’s former special rapporteur on the right to health, Paul Hunt, who after a mission to Sweden in 2006 expressed criticism of Sweden on these aspects. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has also expressed criticism of Sweden on the same grounds (see sections 3.2 and 6.3.2).</p>
<p>Patient safety</p>
<p>The Patient Safety Act (2010:659) requires care providers to undertake active work on patient safety. The Patient Data Act (2008:355) governs issues of information management in health care and provides that a patient record with particular contents, including information on the patient's identity, must be kept during care of patients. The purpose of these provisions is, in part, to make it possible for the patient's care history to be followed so that adequate care can be provided on any particular occasion.</p>
<p>Asylum seekers and undocumented patients who are received in public health care are in some cases unable, or unwilling, to state their identity. In the absence of access to an official personal identity number or other personal identification, records have to be kept using what are known as reserve numbers, which are used for all patients whose identity cannot be immediately established, for example for patients who are unconscious and not carrying identity documents when admitted to a care facility. It has proved difficult to create appropriate documentation using this solution, and it is virtually impossible to follow up health care treatments and to trace other health care records. This also makes work on protection against communicable diseases more difficult.</p>
<p>Administrative principles</p>
<p>Activity that entails health and medical services being provided without the possibility of public inspection either of how the activity is undertaken or of the way in which public funding is used, which can be said to be the case at the “grey” clinics, can be described as incompatible with national legislation in several respects. This activity also means that the costs of care for asylum seekers and undocumented migrants to a certain, albeit small, extent are borne by the public health-care budget as a result of asylum seekers and undocumented patients being dealt with “on the side” in public health care.</p>
<p>There are a number of objections to such activity as described above.</p>
<p>Firstly it means that the stringent requirements for patient safety and quality that exist in relation to Swedish health and medical services cannot be maintained with certainty. The care offered to asylum seekers and undocumented migrants cannot be reviewed, revised and monitored, nor is it subject to the allocation of priorities that applies to "visible" health and medical services.</p>
<p>Secondly, the diverse nature of the contents of local guidelines adopted by several county councils regarding the availability of care to asylum seekers and undocumented migrants means that the availability of care differs across the country, which in turn may be assumed to have an impact on the uncertainty concerning the accessibility of care for these persons, an uncertainty that can also be questioned in relation to rule of law.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it can be questioned whether the contents of the local guidelines are entirely in agreement with the provisions concerning the general powers of the municipalities and county councils not to engage without statutory support in activity that has no connection to their members (the principle of location) or that entails the members being treated differently (the principle of equal status).</p>
<p>Professional ethics and working environment problems</p>
<p>Staff who work in the health and medical services are governed, in addition to legislation, by the rules of professional ethics (see section 2.6). These are expressed in slightly different ways by the various professional organisations that have formulated them, but a fundamental principle common to them all is that it is the patient’s</p>
<p>medical needs and nothing else that, after the allocation of priorities, should decide whether he or she is to receive care.</p>
<p>The situation health and medical staff often find themselves in under present-day legislation, where there is a need, with regard to certain patients, to investigate the patient’s legal status and sometimes also the patient’s ability to pay before proceeding to what should be regarded as the principal task of health and medical services, namely to alleviate and cure, has been described by several people as an ethical dilemma that can even be described as a work environment problem. The lack of clarity in present-day legislation means firstly that staff face the anxiety of risking incorrect treatment for the patient and secondly that the care finally provided might perhaps take place at the “wrong level” (see section 2.4.4.1), as it is difficult to decide which type of care the patient in question is actually to be offered under the legislation.</p>
<p>Impact on reception of asylum seekers and regulated immigration</p>
<p>As emphasised above, it has been stated in the interpretation of the term highest attainable standard of health for everyone that this human right applies to all persons who stay within the territory of a state, irrespective of whether they are citizens of the state or not and irrespective of whether they have a permit to stay there or not.</p>
<p>The terms of reference state that none of the Inquiry Chair’s proposals should have a negative impact on the system of the reception of asylum seekers or on the inclination to stay in the country without the necessary permits. Regarding the assessment of what impact the Inquiry’s proposals may have on people’s future inclination to enter Sweden in order to receive care, such an assessment for obvious reasons contains uncertainty. The Inquiry has therefore sought guidance, primarily in the international research on the issue, on what factors influence migration to and from a country and to what extent availability of health and medical services can be assumed to have the result that a person who leaves his or her home country tries to enter a certain other country (“pull factor”) or, if health and medical services are not available in the country of arrival, leaves this county (“push factor”), see also section 6.5. Notwithstanding the uncertainties that exist, the combined experience gained abroad, but also in Sweden in connection with previous legislative changes (see section 6.4.3), suggests that the availability of</p>
<p>health and medical services in the country of arrival does not have any major impact either on the decision to enter a particular country or the decision to leave a country where someone is staying without the necessary permit. There is inherent inertia for people to voluntarily leave their country.</p>
<p>With regard to the signal a change in the availability of Swedish health and medical services to asylum seekers and undocumented migrants would send, it is clear to the Inquiry that the proposed increased availability of care for certain persons on the one hand and the regulation of and conditions for the reception of asylum seekers and the migration processes on the other are two entirely separate matters, each of which must be respected on its own basis. A legally binding decision on deportation or refusal of entry must, as previously, be executed as quickly as possible. No one should be encouraged to stay in Sweden without the necessary permit. Pending execution of a decision on deportation or refusal of entry, either voluntarily or by coercion, however, health and medical services must be available to all persons who are in Sweden.</p>
<p>Fundamental principles underlying the Inquiry’s proposals</p>
<p>In light of what has been stated above, the Inquiry has based its proposals on the following principles.</p>
<p>1. The legislation should be so designed that it, in a better way than at present, fully complies with the international commitments Sweden has made with regard to respect of human rights. Particular attention should be paid to the rights of children.</p>
<p>2. Availability of health and medical services for asylum seekers and undocumented migrants should be dictated by the principle of the highest attainable standard of health for all, which means that it is to be available, accessible, acceptable and of good quality.</p>
<p>3. The legislation should furthermore be designed in such a way that health and medical services can be operated in compliance with the ethical rules that apply to the various groups of health professionals and that no lack of clarity persists or arises with regard to accessibility of care or whether the care is undertaken in accordance with the legal principles that apply to municipal activity.</p>
<p>4. Availability of health care and the associated obligations and benefits should be based on equal conditions for those who stay within a county, regardless of whether they have the necessary permit to stay in the country or not.</p>
<p>5. All health care undertaken in the country should be carried out on the same premises and on the basis of the same requirements for quality, documentation and possibility of supervision and other review.</p>
<p>6. All health and medical services in Sweden should be provided openly.</p>
<p>7. The principles for the reception of asylum seekers and regulated immigration shall not be subject to any change. Increased availability of care should not be interpreted as increased acceptance of staying in the country without the necessary permits. The remits of different authorities – such as the Swedish Migration Board on the one side and the health and medical services on the other – should not be mutually opposed, but the legislation should operate within the framework of these.</p>
<p>8. The costs that already exist for the provision of care to asylum seekers and undocumented migrants in the grey economy in health care should be made visible and the grey sector should be removed.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals</p>
<p>To comply with the principles indicated above, the Inquiry proposes that asylum seekers and undocumented migrants, regardless of age, are to be offered subsidised health and medical services by the county council of the area where they are living or staying. The care should be offered to the same extent and under the same conditions as that offered to permanent residents.</p>
<p>The Inquiry further proposes that asylum seekers and undocumented migrants, until the year in which they reach the age of 19, are to be offered subsidised good and complete dental care by the county council of the area where they are living or staying. Dental care is to be offered to the same extent and under the same conditions as that offered to permanent residents of equivalent age.</p>
<p>Costs of the implementation of the Inquiry’s proposals</p>
<p>Currently, the yearly cost for health care offered to asylum seekers and undocumented migrants is estimated to between 1 180 million and 1 540 million Swedish kronor.</p>
<p>There are a number of uncertainties when it comes to estimating the cost for the implementation of the Inquiry’s proposals. In the report from IHE that was commissioned from the Inquiry, this cost has been calculated to a maximum of 2 200 million Swedish kronor. The added cost of the implementation of the Inquiry’s proposal compared to the current cost is thus estimated to a maximum of 1 020 million Swedish kronor.</p>
<p>Complete health and medical services for persons who are staying in Sweden</p>
<p>In order to as far as possible tackle the problems identified in the inventory of problems, i.e. inadequate fulfilment of Sweden’s international commitments and the aspirations contained in national legislation, the ethical situation for health and medical staff and to clear away the legal uncertainties that exist in the present-day legislation, the Inquiry thus proposes that those persons who are covered by the Inquiry’s remit and who are staying in Sweden should be given the same access to health and medical services as permanent residents. This means, in the Inquiry’s view, that the same conditions, that is to say the same rights and obligations, should apply to everyone. Asylum seekers and undocumented patients should thus be subject to the same allocation of priorities in health care as permanent residents. They should also pay the same fees for health care received as are paid by permanently resident patients.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the proposal will benefit everyone in Sweden, as it means that responsible authorities will be able to obtain a more complete picture of the state of health of the whole population, preventive efforts can reach more people, and the spread of communicable diseases can be prevented. No detraining effects for those who today are offered health and medical services have been anticipated from the proposal (see also section 7.7).</p>
<p>Dental care for persons who are staying in Sweden</p>
<p>Dental care forms part of the health and medical services and the right to the best possible health for everyone. The considerations that have underpinned the Inquiry’s proposals with regard to availability of other health and medical services can thus also be cited with regard to the availability of dental care.</p>
<p>However, the Inquiry has not had the opportunity under its remit to propose rules that equate adult asylum seekers and undocumented migrants to residents with respect to availability of dental care. The principal reason for this is that the rules surrounding adult dental care are very detailed and not easy to apply with regard to deciding what dental care is to be offered to individuals. The present-day system also presupposes that those who seek dental care can be identified with certainty. The state dental care reimbursement scheme that compensates the care providers is difficult to apply and is administered by the Swedish Social Security Agency.</p>
<p>The fact that the Inquiry has chosen not to present any proposal regarding adult dental care is not, however, to be interpreted as meaning that the present-day regulation fully complies with the international commitments. Inadequate fulfilment persists in this respect. The Government should therefore continue with its work on an overhaul of availability of dental care for adult asylum seekers and undocumented migrants.</p>
<p>The regulation of dental care for permanent residents up to the year in which they reach the age of nineteen is completely different to that of adult dental care. Payments are made by the county councils, and the cost of reimbursing dental care is principally met through county council tax and government grants.</p>
<p>It is far simpler, in terms of systems, to present proposals for increased availability of dental care for asylum seekers and undocumented migrants under the age of 20 than it is with regard to adult dental care. The Inquiry therefore makes such a proposal and notes that increased availability of dental care for asylum seekers and undocumented children and adolescents in any case represents a step along the way (in accordance with the principle of progressive realisation of economic, social and cultural rights) to full availability of dental care for all asylum seekers and undocumented migrants.</p>
<p>Subsidies and health care fees for asylum seekers and undocumented migrants</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the expanded health and medical services that are to be offered to asylum seekers and undocumented migrants should be covered by the government subsidy. This applies both to expanded access to health and medical services and to expanded access to dental care for asylum seekers and undocumented migrants until the year in which they reach the age of 19. Compensation should be given the Swedish Migration Board for the increased costs that the proposal entails regarding care for asylum seekers.</p>
<p>Health care charges</p>
<p>Both asylum seekers and undocumented migrants should pay a health care fee for the health care they will enjoy. A health care fee for undocumented migrants should be paid in the same way as for permanent residents. The same applies with respect to health care fees for medicines prescribed in outpatient care. On the other hand, asylum seekers should, regardless of age, be obliged to pay the fees that they pay according to the present regulation.</p>
<p>In the same way as for permanent residents, regular complete dental care under the Dental Care Act for asylum seekers and undocumented migrants should be free of charge up to the year in which they reach the age of nineteen.</p>
<p>No health care fee should be paid for medical care provided pursuant to the Communicable Diseases Act.</p>
<p>Documentation of health care and register issues</p>
<p>It is very important that health care can be documented in order to meet the aspirations on patient safety contained in Swedish legislation. The reason for this is that health professionals have to be able to study the patient’s care history in order to be able to offer the best possible care in the individual case. For this reason it is crucial that every patient can be attributed an identity that follows him or her in contacts with health care. It is also essential to be able to identify patients in order to ensure availability of prescription medicines at pharmacies and to enable them to avail of the high-</p>
<p>cost protection scheme for medicines, medical care, and for adults also dental care, applicable to permanent residents.</p>
<p>From a public health perspective there is also a need to be able to document care provided and diagnoses made etc. to be utilised, for instance, in determining the needs for medical services of the population.</p>
<p>With regard to asylum seekers, the issue of identity in health care is generally not a particularly great problem as such persons are issued with what is known as an LMA card on arrival in Sweden. An undocumented migrant may also have an – invalid – LMA card if he or she has previously been an asylum seeker. This situation does not, however, apply to all undocumented migrants. People in this group can otherwise generally be assumed to be unwilling to state their identity to those who they regard as people in authority. In the light of what has been stated above regarding the importance of an identity linked to the patient, the Inquiry proposes that the Government should commission a review of the options for establishing a special scheme so that the care under the Health and Medical Services Act and the dental care under the Dental Care Act that is provided to asylum seekers and undocumented migrants can be documented and followed up in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p>How are the changes to be implemented?</p>
<p>In order to implement the changes described above, the Inquiry has chosen between regulating all health and medical services to be offered to patients in Sweden in the Health and Medical Services Act and in the Dental Care Act and retaining the regulation of health and medical services for asylum seekers under the 2008 Act.</p>
<p>In the light of the routines that have evolved regarding health and medical services for asylum seekers and the fact that a change in regulation with a transfer of responsibility from the Swedish Migration Board to another authority would entail substantial costs, and in consideration of the short period during which a person is in Sweden as an asylum seeker, the Inquiry has opted to retain the regulation of the care of asylum seekers in the 2008 Act. However, the care to be offered to undocumented migrants follows from the Health and Medical Services Act and the Dental Care Act.</p>
<p>The proposals concerning  increased availability of health and medical services and dental care should thus be implemented through</p>
<p>amendments to Section 3 and Section 4, first paragraph, of the Health and Medical Services Act, Section 7 of the Dental Care Act and Sections 5–6 of the 2008 Act. With regard to health care charges, amendments should be made to Section 26 of the Health and Medical Services Act, Section 15 a of the Dental Care Act and Chapter 7 Section 3 of the Communicable Diseases Act.</p>
<p>The proposals concerning subsidies  should be implemented with regard to care for asylum seekers through an increase in the government grant paid under the Ordinance (1996:1357) on government compensation for health and medical services for asylum seekers and with regard to undocumented migrants through an expanded general government grant under the Ordinance (1984:908) on certain government grants and insurance payments for medical services etc. and through amendments to the Act (2002:160) on Pharmaceutical Benefits etc.</p>
<p>The actions of non-profit organisations</p>
<p>Under the Inquiry’s proposals, the persons whom the Inquiry has been asked to investigate would in theory no longer need the voluntary clinics operated by the non-profit organisations. In practice, however, it can be envisaged that these may need to continue to exist for some time to come, in particular because it is likely that the new regulatory framework will not have an immediate impact among undocumented migrants, who are the most difficult people to reach with information efforts. Nor is it entirely out of the question that certain persons may, despite new regulation, nevertheless choose not to contact the public health care service for fear of being discovered. It can also be imagined that the non-profit organisations will assist in referring asylum seekers and undocumented patients to the right body to obtain care. The non-profit organisations may thus, in the Inquiry’s view, make a great contribution by informing asylum seekers and undocumented migrants about what is applicable with regard to health and medical services and provide them with continued support in connection with their contacts with the health and medical services.</p>
<p>Issues remaining to be investigated</p>
<p>Although the Inquiry proposes changes with regard to the availability of health and medical services for asylum seekers and undocumented migrants, a number of issues remain that the Inquiry did not have a mandate to consider or that the Inquiry found that it was unable to investigate during the appointed period of inquiry. The Inquiry has also identified a number of issues that can be said to be consequences of the Inquiry’s proposals.</p>
<p>In order to proceed along the way towards fulfilling the international commitments with regard to the right to the highest attainable standard of health for everyone in Sweden and to eliminate the legal uncertainties in the legislation and improve the working environment for health and medical staff, the Inquiry therefore proposes continued work on the following issues:</p>
<p>• Availability of subsidised, complete dental care for adult asylum seekers and undocumented migrants.</p>
<p>• Establishment of a national scheme for the identification and registration of asylum seekers and undocumented patients.</p>
<p>• Permanently ongoing work on values in the health and medical services.</p>
<p>Entry into force and transitional provisions</p>
<p>It is proposed that the statutory changes should come into force on 1 January 2013.</p>
<p>No transitional provisions are proposed.</p>
