<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit of the Inquiry</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit consists of two parts. Firstly, the Inquiry is to come up with legislative proposals for the reduction of value added tax on restaurant and catering services (excluding alcohol) from 25 per cent to the same level as for food (currently 12 per cent) and to report what the effects are expected to be for areas such as economic efficiency and long-term employment. The results of this part of the remit are reported in the Inquiry’s interim report, ‘Reduced VAT on restaurant and catering services’ (SOU 2011:24), which was submitted to the Ministry of Finance in March 2011.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Inquiry is to analyse whether a reduced level of VAT on the following services would be an economically efficient measure to increase long-term employment (the services included in the system of tax credits for household services are not to be included in a reduction of the tax rate as well). - Renovation and repairs of private dwellings; - window-cleaning and cleaning in private households; - minor repairs of bicycles, shoes and leather goods, clothing and household linen; - domestic care services, such as home help and care of children, the elderly, sick or disabled; and - hairdressing.</p>
<p>If the Inquiry comes to the conclusion – even after considering factors such as the administrative burden for companies – that the tax rate should be reduced for one or more of these services, the</p>
<p>Inquiry is to draw up legislative proposals for this part of the remit as well. The findings on this part of the remit are the subject of this report.</p>
<h2>Renovation and repairs of private dwellings</h2>
<p>Renovation and repairs of private dwellings are included in the system of tax credits for household services (the tax reduction is permitted for expenses for repair, maintenance and improvement work – ‘RMI’). However, the system of tax credits for household services does not cover rented or leased dwellings, nor does it cover single-family homes built less than five years ago. Further, the tax credit system for household services does not cover the installation of machines and other equipment, material costs or costs of labour for which insurance compensation has been paid or for which state grants or other state support have been provided.</p>
<p>As the legislator has chosen to limit the possibilities of tax reduction in a certain way, a supplement in the form of a reduced tax rate for areas that, as a result of the limitations, are not included in the tax reduction system does not seem appropriate. Moreover, the Inquiry considers that the services not included in the tax credit system for household services are only able to replace work in the home to a limited extent, and that no significant lasting employment effects can thus be expected. The Inquiry also sees major difficulties in the pure legal technicalities of designing a supplementary system of rules in a way that is sufficiently clear for taxpayers and the Swedish Tax Agency. In addition, the introduction of a supplementary system of rules would, in the Inquiry’s view, probably result in major application problems. A system of rules stating that a reduced tax rate is to apply to renovation and repairs, but not new-builds, rebuilds or extensions will be difficult to apply and result in demarcation problems.</p>
<p>In light of this, the Inquiry’s assessment is that there should be no supplement to the system of tax reduction for ‘RMI’ work with a limited possibility of a reduced tax rate for the renovation and repair of private dwellings. No legislative proposal is made in this respect.</p>
<h2>Window-cleaning and cleaning in private households</h2>
<p>Window-cleaning and cleaning in private households are included in the tax credit system for household services (the tax reduction is permitted for expenses associated with house-cleaning and other cleaning work carried out in the home). However, the tax credit system for household services does not include work for which insurance compensation has been received or for which state grants or other financial state support have been provided. As the legislator has chosen to limit the possibilities of tax reduction in this way, a supplement in the form of a reduced tax rate for areas that, as a result of the limitations, are not included in the tax reduction system does not seem appropriate. Moreover, the Inquiry considers that the area not included in the tax reduction system is so limited that a reduction in VAT would have no significant lasting employment effects. No legislative proposal is made in this respect.</p>
<h2>Domestic care services</h2>
<p>Domestic care services, such as home help and care of children, the elderly, sick or disabled are included in the tax credit system for household services (the tax reduction is permitted for expenses for care and supervision that a natural person needs and that is conducted in, or in close proximity to, the home). However, the tax credit system for household services does not include work for which insurance compensation has been received or for which state grants or other financial state support have been provided. The services that are included in the tax credit system for household services and for which it would be possible to introduce a reduced tax rate are services that, in many cases, are subsidised by the state. As the legislator has chosen to limit the possibilities of tax reduction in this way, a supplement in the form of a reduced tax rate for areas that, as a result of the limitations, are not included in the tax reduction system does not seem appropriate. Moreover, the services in question – where they are not included in the tax credit system for household services – are likely to be largely covered by the exemption from tax liability for social care contained in the Value Added Tax Act (1994:200). The actual scope of application for the reduced tax rate for domestic care services is therefore likely to be very limited. As households do not spend any significant proportion of their leisure time on activities that could be replaced by commercial services in this area, the Inquiry considers that a reduction in the tax rate cannot have any significant lasting employment effects. No legislative proposal is made in this respect.</p>
<h2>Hairdressing</h2>
<p>Employment cannot be expected to increase to a persistently higher level due to labour supply effects resulting from reduced work in the home or undeclared work in connection with reduced VAT on hairdressing services. However, as unemployment occurs among hairdressers due to disequilibrium in the labour market, measures that stimulate demand could be expected to increase employment in the hairdressing sector. This lasting increase in employment in the hairdressing sector would, however, be counterbalanced by a decrease in employment in other sectors as a result of the demand for goods and services in other services dropping when demand for hairdressing services increases. It is very difficult to assess to what extent employment would decrease in other sectors of the economy, but the Inquiry’s overall assessment is that we cannot expect any significant lasting employment effects throughout the entire economy as a result of reduced VAT on hairdressing services.</p>
<p>The redistribution of labour that would occur in the labour market cannot be expected to increase welfare; instead, it is likely to reduce welfare as it would increase existing distortions. This is because there are already signs of too many production resources being used to produce hairdressing services, and an increase in the number of employees in the sector would lead to an increase in welfare losses.</p>
<p>The long-term effect on public finances of reduced VAT tax on hairdressing services is not expected to be significantly less than the short-term effect on public finances, which means that the level of self-financing is not expected to be favourable. The fact that the long-term effect on public finances is not expected to be significantly less than the short-term effect is, above all, due to the assessment that the lasting employment effects are not considered to be significant. Another aspect that suggests that the long-term effect on public finances is not expected to be favourable is that the redistribution of consumption towards hairdressing services would result in lower overall VAT revenue for the state, as the rate of VAT would be lower for hairdressing services than for the average product or service.</p>
<p>Hairdressing services are not included in the tax credit system for household services. Today, those providing hairdressing services typically only deal with one VAT rate (the normal rate of 25 per cent). A reduction in the tax rate for hairdressing would mean that those providing hairdressing services would need to deal with two tax rates instead of one. The lower tax rate would then apply to services covered by the term ‘hairdressing’ (hair cutting, hair colouring, etc.). For services that may be offered at a hairdressing salon but that are not covered by the term ‘hairdressing’ (such as eyelash and eyebrow treatments) and for the sale of hair products (shampoo, conditioner, etc.) the normal rate of tax would apply. This would mean more work, not just for the companies concerned, but also for the Swedish Tax Agency. The increased administrative burden for companies and the Swedish Tax Agency associated with reduced VAT on hairdressing services has been estimated at somewhere in the region of SEK 0.1 billion.</p>
<p>Having weighed up these consequences, the Inquiry considers that VAT on hairdressing services should not be reduced. No legislative proposal is made in this respect.</p>
<h2>Minor repairs</h2>
<p>Employment is not expected to increase to a persistently higher level due to labour supply effects resulting from reduced work in the home or undeclared work in connection with reduced VAT on minor repair services. Nor can a reduction in VAT be expected to result in any lasting employment effects due to increased labour demand, as there is no unemployment that is a result of disequilibrium in the labour market for minor repair services.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the effect on economic efficiency of reduced VAT on minor repairs would, on the whole, be negative.</p>
<p>Minor repairs of bicycles, shoes and leather goods, clothing and household linen are not included in the tax credit system for household services. Today, companies that offer these kinds of</p>
<p>repairs typically only have to deal with one VAT rate (the normal rate of 25 per cent). A reduction in the tax rate would mean that these companies would need to deal with two tax rates instead of one. The lower tax rate would then apply to repairs of bicycles, shoes and leather goods (e.g. repairs of punctures and heels on shoes) and the normal tax rate would apply for everything that can be considered maintenance (e.g. oiling of gears). In cases where other services are provided (e.g. by a company that offers shoe repairs and key-cutting services), these other services (e.g. services involving keys) would be included in the normal tax rate. Repairs of and alterations to clothing and household linen would be included in the lower tax rate, but tailoring would not. This would mean more work, not just for the companies concerned, but also for the Swedish Tax Agency. The increased administrative burden for companies and the Swedish Tax Agency associated with reduced VAT on minor repair services has been estimated at somewhere in the region of SEK 0.01 billion.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that VAT on minor repair services should not be reduced as no positive lasting effects can be expected on employment, economic efficiency or the administrative burden. No legislative proposal is made in this respect.</p>
