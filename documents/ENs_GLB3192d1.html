<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Our terms of reference were to investigate whether Sweden should accede to the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, and if so which paragraphs it should apply. The purpose of the Charter is to protect and promote European regional or minority languages, given that they are a valuable element of Europe's multicultural and multilingual heritage. Which of the languages used in a state are regional or minority languages is decided in accordance with the definition provided in Article 1 of the Charter. Especially strong protection is provided for languages with a historical geographical base in the state, while weaker protection is provided for languages that cannot be identified with a particular geographical area, i.e. non-territorial languages. The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages may therefore be described as a cultural charter with a regional focus. The Charter has so far been ratified by five countries, i.e. Norway, Finland, Hungary, the Netherlands and Croatia. It will enter into force on March 1, 1998.</p>
<p>Historical regional or minority languages in Sweden</p>
<p>We have concluded that, of the languages used in Sweden, Sami (i.e. all varieties of Sami such as South Sami, Lule Sami and North Sami), Finnish (i.e. all varieties of Finnish such as Tornedal Finnish/Meän Kieli and standard Finnish) and Romany Chib (all varieties of Romany Chib) are historical regional or minority languages within the meaning of the definition laid down in Article 1 of the Charter.</p>
<p>Sami and Finnish have a historical geographic base within the meaning of the Charter, while Romany Chib is a non-territorial language in Sweden. Sami has probably been used in parts of the present territory of Sweden for several thousand years and Finnish for about one thousand years. Romany Chib has been used in this country ever since the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>The Committee has not found any evidence that Yiddish has been used for sufficiently long and to a sufficient extent in Sweden for it to be regarded as a regional or minority language traditionally used in Sweden. The fact that the language today is probably used by a rather small number of persons in Sweden is also an argument against applying the provisions of the Charter to Yiddish in Sweden. However, the aspiration among Jews to preserve Yiddish and Yiddish culture as an integral part of Jewish culture is promoted by the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, a matter which is dealt with by section II.</p>
<p>Does Sweden already satisfy the requirements of the Charter in respect of Sami, Finnish and Romany Chib?</p>
<p>For Sweden to be able to ratify the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, the requirements laid down in the provisions of Part II of the Charter must be fulfilled for Sami and Finnish, as well as Romany Chib (with certain restrictions since Romany Chib is a non-territorial language). The provisions of Part III of the Charter only apply to languages with a geographical base. In addition to ratifying Part II, Sweden can elect also to ratify Part III of the Charter in respect of languages that have a geographical base. If Sweden ratifies Part III, it must apply at least 35 paragraphs or subparagraphs from among the provisions of Part III in respect of each language.</p>
<p>Sweden has already enacted many provisions providing protection and support for regional or minority languages, both in acts and ordinances and other measures. After reviewing the requirements of the Charter, we have found that Sweden satisfies several of the requirements of Part II with respect to Sami, Finnish and Romany Chib and 33 paragraphs or subparagraphs of Part III with respect to Sami and 29 with respect to Finnish.</p>
<p>However, the existing Swedish provisions are selective. The requirements of the Charter can only be fulfilled in the context of a general minority language policy under which measures are coordinated and directed at the common objective of providing protection and support for regional or minority languages. There is no such policy in Sweden today.</p>
<p>What measures must be taken by Sweden before it can ratify the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages?</p>
<p>Measures at national level</p>
<p>For Sweden to be able to ratify the Charter, it will be necessary, in our view, to coordinate the measures currently in force and introduce some new measures for the purpose of establishing a general minority language policy in Sweden. The most important individual measure within the framework of such a policy is to recognize Sami, Finnish and Romany Chib as historical minority languages. It is also important to emphasize, in various policy areas at the national level, the fact that these languages and the cultures associated with them are a valuable element of Sweden's cultural heritage. There is also a need to disseminate information among the majority population about the history of these languages and cultures in Sweden.</p>
<p>To this end, we propose that the historical minority languages and the culture and history associated with them be made required knowledge in the curricula for all compulsory and upper secondary school pupils. This will ensure that information about Sweden as a historically multicultural and multilingual country is disseminated on a wide front. We also propose that at least one folk high school for each of the languages concerned receive government assistance on a long-term basis so as to be able to function as linguistic and cultural centres.</p>
<p>To ensure that the cultures associated with the languages receive sufficient opportunities and support and be accessible to the majority population, we also propose that the provisions governing the allocation of government assistance for various kinds of cultural programmes be amended so that Sami, Finnish Tornedal and Rom culture receive a sufficient share of these grants. We also propose that the National Council for Cultural Affairs, an authority which has a general and coordinating role in cultural policy, be instructed to take steps to ensure that Sami, Finnish Tornedal and Rom culture carry sufficient weight in cultural life.</p>
<p>Further measures must also be taken in order to strengthen these languages so that they can survive and develop in accordance with the provisions of the Charter. An essential condition for this is that children and adolescents receive tuition in their respective languages. We therefore propose that the National Agency for Education be instructed to monitor, on a regular basis, first language and bilingual education in the historical minority languages. We also propose that at least one university or college for each language be assigned the task of arranging education and research on the respective languages. Furthermore, we propose various measures designed to strengthen the status of Swedish regional or minority languages in the mass media, both radio and TV and the press. We also propose that sufficient support be provided for literature in these languages as well as support for activities involving the collection, archiving and scientific processing of linguistic material.</p>
<p>The Charter also includes provisions designed to ensure that those who use such languages have a say when it comes to measures that concern their use. In our view, it is important that the language users themselves should have the opportunity to give their views before such measures are taken and to participate in subsequent evaluation. We therefore propose measures that will give users of our historical minority languages influence over the use of the languages.</p>
<p>The Charter also contains provisions encouraging cross-border cooperation in strengthening regional or minority languages and the cultures associated with them both at national and regional level. Taking into account the fact that our minority languages are also used in the other Nordic countries, we propose that Sweden promote increased Nordic cooperation with a view to promoting these regional or minority languages and their cultures.</p>
<p>Regionally applicable measures</p>
<p>The Charter has a regional thrust. This means that most of the provisions, both of Part II and Part III, are to be applied in areas where regional or minority languages have traditionally been used and are still used to a sufficient extent. However, there is nothing to prevent a country that accedes to the Charter going beyond its requirements and also applying its provisions outside such geographical areas.</p>
<p>So far, most of the measures undertaken for Sami and Finnish (which are the languages with an identifiable historical geographical base in Sweden) have been applied at national level. Therefore, the rules concerning first language education and government assistance for various kinds of cultural programmes apply to the country as a whole. In considering what new rules are needed for Sweden to be able to accede to the Charter in respect of Sami and Finnish, we have concluded that most of these should also be applicable at national level so that they will benefit Sami and Finnish speakers throughout the country. In this respect, therefore, our proposals go beyond the requirements of the Charter.</p>
<p>However, we propose that some of our proposals concerning new rules on protection and support for Sami and Finnish should only be applied in the geographical areas where these languages have their geographical roots and are still used to a sufficient extent. As regards Sami, this area comprises the four most northerly municipalities in the mountainous region, i.e. Kiruna, Gällivare, Jokkmokk and Arjeplog, and as regards Finnish, the five municipalities in Tornedalen, i.e. Haparanda, Övertorneå, Pajala , Kiruna and Gällivare.</p>
<p>For these municipalities we propose new legislation under which individuals will have the right to use their own language vis-à-vis administrative authorities and courts of law irrespective of their knowledge of Swedish.</p>
<p>The authorities and courts would also be obliged to use Sami or Finnish for oral communication where an individual has chosen to communicate in one of these languages.</p>
<p>One reason why we propose that this legislation be applied regionally under the provisions of the Charter is that legislation which gives individuals an absolute right to use a language other than Swedish in their contacts with authorities and courts would be resourceconsuming. It would not be practically or economically feasible to apply such rules to the whole country. We therefore propose, in accordance with the Charter, that these rules should apply in areas where Sami and Finnish have a long historical tradition and are still a vital feature of everyday life. In these areas, the need to use these languages vis-à-vis authorities and courts is also likely to be greatest, as is the authorities' capacity for satisfying the requirement for communication in Sami or Finnish. The rules giving people the right to use their own language in public administration in parts of Norrbotten county are also a reflection of the fact that historically this area is, and remains, multicultural and multilingual.</p>
<p>For the purpose of evaluating the effects of the regionally applicable legislation and strengthening the status of the languages concerned in these areas, we propose that a committee be set up under the supervision of the Norrbotten County Administrative Board to carry out annual evaluations of the legislation and other regional measures and to submit proposals for further measures to strengthen the status of the languages and of Sami and Tornedal culture in these areas.</p>
<p>Our proposals for regional application also envisage the right for speakers of Sami or Finnish in certain circumstances to use their own language as a mode of communication in preschools and care services for the elderly. Our proposals on these matters are based on the findings of a questionnaire survey and visits to the municipalities concerned for the purpose of establishing the extent to which these municipalities are in a position to comply with a statutory obligation to ensure that preschooling and care services for the elderly have staff who speak Sami or Finnish, as the case may be.</p>
<p>Further national measures to promote and protect Sami and Finnish</p>
<p>We consider it very important that Sami and Finnish speakers throughout the country should have the right to be spoken to in their own languages in preschools and care services for the elderly.</p>
<p>To enable children who are native speakers of Sami or Finnish to become bilingual, it is very important for them to use their own language as a mode of communication as early as possible, starting at preschool level. We therefore propose that a survey be carried out of the extent to which these children are spoken to in their own language in municipal child care services. We also propose that measures be taken to persuade municipalities where there are sufficient numbers of parents who want their children to attend preschools with Samior Finnish-speaking staff to provide such facilities. We also call attention to the possibility of providing such facilities by opening private preschools.</p>
<p>An important reason for establishing the right to communication in one's native language in care services for the elderly is the fact that a large number of elderly people, especially those who speak Finnish, are likely to be in need of such care in the next few years, at the same time as experience shows that elderly people sometimes lose their ability to speak a second language. We therefore propose that a survey be carried out to establish which municipalities have sufficient numbers of elderly users of Sami or Finnish who are in need of care. On the basis of such a survey, we propose that the right to use one's own language in care services for the elderly be introduced in municipalities where there are sufficient numbers of elderly people with this need.</p>
<p>Sweden should ratify the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages</p>
<p>We consider that Sweden should ratify the Charter in respect of Sami, Finnish, including Meän Kieli, and Romany Chib on the grounds that they are historical minority languages in Sweden.</p>
<p>An important reason for this is that the historical regional or minority languages are a valuable element of Sweden's cultural heritage and as such they are entitled to and need support and protection in order to survive. Another very important reason is that those who use these languages have expressed a strong desire for official recognition of them as historical regional or minority languages.</p>
<p>There is widespread awareness today of the value of the cultural diversity resulting from immigration to Sweden. Sami, Finnish and Romany Chib and the cultures associated with these languages have existed in Sweden for many hundreds of years and have contributed to historical, cultural and linguistic diversity. It is therefore necessary to recognize these historical languages and cultures and acknowledge their place in a multicultural Sweden. Sweden should therefore ratify the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in respect of Sami, Finnish, including Meän Kieli, and Romany Chib, thus explicitly supporting and protecting the historical minority languages so that they can survive as an important element of Sweden's cultural heritage and modern society.</p>
