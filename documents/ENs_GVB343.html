<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Terms of reference</h2>
<p>The inquiry has been instructed to consider a number of issues related to the Work Environment Act. The contents of this final report deal with the following areas:</p>
<p>• The right of access of safety representatives and other issues</p>
<p>• Coordination – implementation of the EC Directive on minimum safety and health requirements at temporary or mobile construction sites</p>
<p>• Client responsibility for the work environment</p>
<p>• The obligation of those employing temporary workers (user companies) to provide information</p>
<p>• Supervision of foreign companies and companies that change identity</p>
<p>• Simplification of regulations</p>
<h2>The right of access of safety representatives and other issues (Chapter 2)</h2>
<p>Our instructions were to examine whether the provisions on cooperation in Chapter 6 of the Work Environment Act should be adapted so that they are more appropriate in light of developments in cooperation on work environment issues at workplaces. A report on some aspects of this area has been presented in the interim report. The question of whether amendments should be made concerning the regional safety representatives’ right of access is one of the issues discussed in the final report. We have also examined the possibility for safety representatives to take action on behalf of employees of temporary work agencies or other companies where the employees’ work environment largely depends on a user company or a client company.</p>
<p>The proposals presented in the final report briefly entail the following. Regional safety representatives are also to be appointed for workplaces where the employee organisation has no members but has a collective agreement with the employer. As has been the case previously, this is conditional on there being no safety committee at the workplace. A safety committee in this context is equivalent to the cooperation bodies under Chapter 6, Section 9 a of the Work Environment Act that are proposed in the inquiry’s interim report (SOU 2006:44).</p>
<p>In addition, through amendments to Chapter 6, Section 6 a of the Work Environment Act, where the right to request a decision by the Swedish Work Environment Authority is regulated, and Chapter 6, Section 7 (on the ‘right to suspend work’), it is also proposed that the safety representative be given some scope to take action to protect external workers as well.</p>
<p>We have also considered whether an obligation should be prescribed for the safety representative to contact an employer in connection with a visit. Since there is no great need for legislation on this issue, we have not presented a proposal to this effect. Finally we have examined whether it should be necessary for a safety representative to contact the safety committee before a request is made to the Swedish Work Environment Authority under Chapter 6, Section 6 a of the Work Environment Act. We consider that such an obligation should not be introduced.</p>
<h2>Coordination – implementation of the EC Directive on minimum safety and health requirements at temporary or mobile construction sites (Chapter 3)</h2>
<p>This chapter gives an account of the proposals linked with our instructions to implement more clearly the EC Directive on minimum safety and health requirements at temporary or mobile construction sites. It also deals with our instructions to review the rules on responsibility for health and safety coordination during rebuilding of existing workplaces and at workplaces that are geographically spread out.</p>
<p>The effect of the proposals is to extend Chapter 3 of the Work Environment Act with new provisions on construction and civil engineering work, primarily as follows. A definition of ‘developer’ will be given in the Act. At the same time, a regulation will be introduced stating that under certain conditions, the responsibility of the developer under the Work Environment Act can devolve upon a contractor who has been commissioned, on behalf of the developer, to take responsibility for project preparations and planning, or for execution of the construction or civil engineering work. The provisions of Chapter 3 will be adjusted to the concepts of project preparation and planning  in the Directive on the implementation of minimum safety and health requirements at temporary or mobile construction sites. It will also be clarified that, in all construction and civil engineering work, the developer is to appoint one or several work environment coordinators, if the developer does not assume this role himself. Work environment coordinators are to be appointed for both project preparation and planning and for execution of the work.</p>
<p>Rules on coordination of work environment issues in activities other than building and civil engineering work will also be changed in some respects, one effect being that it will not be possible to transfer responsibility for coordination so as to be relieved of liability. A special provision is also proposed on responsibility for coordination when construction and civil engineering work is undertaken at a permanently established place of operations.</p>
<h2>Client responsibility for the work environment (Chapter 4)</h2>
<p>Our instructions were to consider whether it was appropriate to introduce into the Work Environment Act provisions applying to the entire, or parts of the labour market, on work environment responsibility for private or public companies etc. who have ordered a service vis-à-vis those executing the work (client liability). Our instructions were also to include an examination of whether – alongside or as an alternative to rules on client liability – it would be appropriate to introduce an obligation for the procurer of a service to stipulate requirements for the work environment in the invitation to tender, and otherwise require account to be taken of the work environment of those undertaking the work.</p>
<p>We have decided to propose a new provision containing an obligation for those obtaining tenders for the performance of a service to draw attention to the work environment in their invitation to tender, and when designing this invitation, to ensure that the entrepreneur is able to fulfil his obligations under work environment legislation. This provision will apply to all procurement, both private and public, where the estimated value of a contract amounts to at least SEK 1 million, excluding VAT. The provision also contains a definition of what is meant by ‘obtaining tenders’ in this context. The Government or, by Government decision, the Swedish Work Environment Authority will be authorised to issue more detailed regulations on the content of invitations to tender and estimation of contract value. Chapter 7, Section 7 of the Work Environment Act will state that the Swedish Work Environment Authority may issue injunctions or prohibitions to a party obtaining tenders for the performance of services that does not comply with the new provision.</p>
<p>We have also considered whether provisions should be included in the Work Environment Act on a general work environment responsibility for private or public companies, etc. ordering services, but have decided that there is no fair way of limiting such responsibility to cases where it can really be considered justified. We therefore do not present any proposals to this effect.</p>
<h2>The obligation of those employing temporary workers to provide information (Chapter 5)</h2>
<p>In fulfilment of our terms of reference, we have considered whether an obligation should be prescribed in the Work Environment Act requiring a party making use of temporary workers to inform a party providing labour about risks in the work environment.</p>
<p>We can observe that regulations already exist that deal with the problem described in our terms of reference. Nothing has emerged during the course of our inquiry that would indicate that existing regulations are insufficient. Even if an explicit statutory obligation for user companies to inform companies providing labour of the risks involved in the work would more clearly emphasise the problem, this is hardly a sufficient reason for legislating on the issue. In our opinion, therefore, such a provision is not necessary.</p>
<h2>Supervision of foreign companies and companies that change identity (Chapter 6)</h2>
<p>Under our terms of reference we have considered whether any amendments need to be made to the Work Environment Act to specifically address work environment failings in companies that are not based in Sweden. To sum up, we have concluded that amendments to the Work Environment Act are not necessary in order to bring about more effective supervision of companies that are not based in Sweden. The problems to which attention has been drawn are mostly of a practical nature and a result of the fact that supervision cases are often extremely demanding in terms of resources. The problems are not due to deficient legislation. In our opinion, effective supervision of those companies can be conducted under current work environment legislation.</p>
<p>Nor do we consider that new provisions should be introduced into the Work Environment Act on the effect of injunctions or prohibitions relating to companies that change their identity by transferring to a new owner. Nor have we found reason to propose that injunctions and prohibitions could be linked with certain premises or specific facilities.</p>
<h2>Simplification of regulations (Chapter 7)</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s instructions were to define companies’ costs and conduct a review of the provisions of the Work Environment Act and the Work Environment Ordinance that involve direct requirements to compile, store or transfer information to government agencies and to propose amendments aimed at reducing the administrative burden on companies.</p>
<p>After reviewing the provisions, we have been able to note that there are only a few provisions in the Work Environment Act and Work Environment Ordinance that in themselves involve an administrative burden on companies. In order to reduce this administrative burden, we propose two amendments to Section 10 of the Work Environment Ordinance. The provision in Section 10, second paragraph of the Work Environment Ordinance, on the employer’s obligation to notify the Swedish Work Environment Authority in writing when appointing a safety committee, will be annulled. It is proposed to amend the provision in Section 10, third</p>
<p>paragraph so that the employer no longer needs to put up notices containing information on the names of safety representatives and members of the safety committee. Instead, the employer is to provide information on the names of the safety representatives and members of the safety committee via appropriate channels.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the inquiry has not found any possibility of eliminating any of the other provisions in the Work Environment Act and Work Environment Ordinance so as to reduce the administrative burden on companies.</p>
