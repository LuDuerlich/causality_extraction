<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>This study identifies four perspectives in the literature on the relationship between financial and industrial systems. The perspectives deal with explanations of growth and explanations of the development of the systems, as well as with phenomena at macroand micro level. Together these make up four combinations.</p>
<p>Within the first perspective, theories about endogenous growth and national systems of innovation are central. In addition to quantitatively oriented studies there is literature which compares varieties of countries’ “capitalist systems”. An Anglo-Saxon model is compared to a Continental European model, where the former seems better at reallocating resources among companies, whereas the latter seems better at long-term commitment by companies. Central to the study is the dilemma which the two “capitalist models” highlight, i.e. to find means of finance which enable long-term strategies while still making companies and capital easily movable among sectors. Deregulation, but also competition among strong owners, may be ways to handle this dilemma.</p>
<p>The second perspective gives attention to asymmetries of information in the relationship between lenders and borrowers. The situation can be analyzed as a game of Prisoners’ Dilemma, where the optimal outcome is only achieved when actors opt for long-term cooperation. For the regulator, the challenge is to create a structure which makes actors aware of their mutual dependencies and, hence, opt for long-term strategies. It may be optimal for regulators not to eliminate all risks for the actors.</p>
<p>The literature in the third perspective treats the two systems as each other’s determining factor, as well as searching for more general explanations, e.g. in terms of institutions. The key role of regulation as an institution is noted, especially the possibility of creating a regulatory environment which lays the foundation for strong development.</p>
<p>The fourth perspective identifies a special case where political action at micro level leads to unwanted consequences at macro level. Early regulation of the banks in the US caused a situation where companies lacked strong owners to take action during the crisis of the 90s. The risk of irrational politics implies that politicians should see themselves as creators of stable rules rather than as solvers of day-to-day problems. Reduction of obstacles may in this perspective be more important than trying to reach specific goals. To be successful in this role, politics must restrict itself under long-term rules of conduct (i.e. constitutions).</p>
