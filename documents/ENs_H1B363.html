<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The remit of the Inquiry is to analyse Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (the new Brussels I Regulation) and to identify similarities and differences in relation to Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (the original Brussels I Regulation) and other relevant EU regulations in the area. The Inquiry is to examine and propose legislative provisions that are needed in light of the new Brussels I Regulation.</p>
<p>The remit also includes examining the issue of a general transfer of the exequatur procedure from the Svea Court of Appeal to district courts. The Inquiry is to present the legislative proposals called for by these considerations.</p>
<h2>The new Brussels I Regulation</h2>
<h2>The Brussels I Regulations</h2>
<p>The original Brussels I Regulation has been in force since 1 March 2002. For EU Member States, this Regulation replaced the 1968 Brussels Convention.</p>
<p>To improve the application of certain of the Brussels I Regulation provisions, further facilitate the free movement of judgments and enhance access to justice, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the new Brussels I Regulation on 6 December 2012. The new Brussels I Regulation entered into force on 10 January 2013, and will mainly be applied from 10 January 2015.</p>
<p>Many of the new Brussels I Regulation articles reflect the original Brussels I Regulation, but the new Regulation also contains several new features. The biggest change in the new Regulation is that the requirement of a declaration of enforceability as a condition for enforcement in a Member State other than the one in which the decision was given has been abolished. Otherwise, the most important changes in the new Regulation are that agreements on jurisdiction have been made more effective and that certain additional protective provisions have been introduced for weaker parties, such as consumers and employees. An express provision has also been introduced stating that if a measure in the foreign decision is not known in the national law of the enforcing Member State, that measure is, to the extent possible, to be adapted to a measure known in the law of that Member State which has equivalent effects attached to it and pursues similar aims and interests.</p>
<h2>Recognition and enforcement</h2>
<p>As before, under the new Brussels I Regulation, decisions from Member States are to be recognised without the need for any special procedure. Regarding enforcement, the requirement of a preceding declaration of enforceability, i.e. an exequatur, has been abolished in the new Regulation. This means that decisions covered by the scope of the new Brussels I Regulation are directly enforceable in another Member State. However, the person against whom enforcement is sought may apply for refusal of the recognition or enforcement of the decision. This may be done if any of the grounds for refusal stated in the Regulation are present.</p>
<p>The abolishment of the exequatur procedure and the procedure for examination of the grounds for refusal under the new Regulation mean that supplementary provisions are needed.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that an application for the enforcement of a foreign decision under the new Brussels I Regulation is to be examined by the Swedish Enforcement Authority. Furthermore, the Inquiry proposes that a foreign decision covered by the new Brussels I Regulation is to be enforced as an equivalent Swedish decision. If there is no equivalent decision in Swedish law, it is proposed that the foreign decision is to be enforced as a judgment, provided that the Regulation does not stipulate otherwise. Under the Inquiry’s proposal, the provisions of the Debt Enforcement Code, or provisions referred to by the Debt Enforcement Code, are to be applied when implementing an enforcement procedure in Sweden.</p>
<p>The Regulation also contains requirements concerning service and, in certain cases, translation of documents before enforcement can be carried out. The Swedish Enforcement Authority is responsible for serving and, when necessary, translating documents. The Regulation does not regulate how service is to be carried out; it is instead to be determined in each individual case in accordance with the provisions of the Service of Process Act or, if applicable, the EU Regulation on Service.</p>
<p>Regarding the procedure for examination of the grounds for refusal according to the Regulation, the Inquiry proposes that such examinations be conducted by a district court as the court of first instance. Under the proposal, the competent district court is the district court that, under Chapter 18, Section 1 of the Debt Enforcement Code, examines appeals of decisions taken by the Swedish Enforcement Authority. The provision states that the competent district court is the district court stipulated by the Government in view of where the defendant has his or her habitual residence. Chapter 17 Section 1 of the Debt Enforcement Ordinance lists the 24 competent district courts. Jurisdiction is determined by the county (or former county) in which the defendant has his or her habitual residence. If the defendant does not have his or her habitual residence in Sweden, decisions taken by the Swedish Enforcement Authority are appealed to Nacka District Court (Chapter 17, Section 1, second paragraph of the Debt Enforcement Ordinance). The general principle is that the district court in the county seat has jurisdiction. However, the competent district court for Stockholm County is Nacka District Court. The term ‘defendant’ refers to the adversary party in the enforcement matter.</p>
<p>The choice of competent district courts has been made in order to take into account that an examination of an application for refusal of recognition or enforcement can often be expected at the same time as, or in close connection with, an examination of impediments to enforcement under Chapter 3, Section 21 of the Debt Enforcement Code and of any other enforcement issues that the Swedish Enforcement Authority may examine. The Inquiry considers that it is beneficial to the processing and to the parties if an application for refusal of recognition or enforcement is examined by the same district courts that orders concerning enforcement are appealed to.</p>
<p>When enforcement of a foreign decision is sought, a party, in addition to the grounds for refusal of recognition and enforcement listed in the Regulation, may also refer to the impediments to enforcement stipulated in national legislation (see Chapter 3, Section 21 of the Debt Enforcement Code). Objections of this kind are examined by the Swedish Enforcement Authority in the first instance. Since the Swedish Enforcement Authority is not considered competent to examine grounds for refusal under the Regulation, it necessarily follows from the provisions that parallel procedures can arise in situations where a debtor refers to both impediments to enforcement under Chapter 3, Section 21 of the Debt Enforcement Code and grounds for refusal under the Regulation. The Inquiry proposes that in situations where a debtor submits circumstances to the Swedish Enforcement Authority that can be perceived as a request for an examination of grounds for refusal under the Regulation, the Authority is obliged to inform the debtor, in writing and without delay, of the option of applying to a district court for an examination of the grounds for refusal.</p>
<p>In situations where a debtor chooses to apply directly to a court for an examination of the grounds for refusal under the Regulation, it is proposed that the court must inform the Swedish Enforcement Authority in writing that it has received such an application.</p>
<p>In a situation where a debtor, in the context of an application to a court for examination of refusal of recognition or enforcement, refers to circumstances that can be associated with an objection to enforcement under Chapter 3, Section 21 of the Debt Enforcement Code, it is incumbent upon the court, within the scope of its service obligation, to refer the applicant to the proper authority.</p>
<p>The new Brussels I Regulation also contains a provision on adapting foreign measures or orders. The Regulation entrusts the individual Member States with determining how, and by whom, the adaptation is to be carried out.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Enforcement Authority should be the competent authority for assessing issues of adaptation, and that such adaptation should be dealt with as an issue within the scope of the decision on enforcement that the Authority is to take. A special decision concerning adaptation is not required. However, the grounds for the enforcement order must clearly state that an adaptation has occurred and how it was carried out. Since the</p>
<p>Inquiry’s proposal means that a measure or order concerning adaptation will be a part of the enforcement order, it will be possible to appeal it within the scope of an appeal against the actual enforcement order. Under the proposal, processing and appeals of enforcement orders that contain an adaptation measure are otherwise to follow the provisions of the Debt Enforcement Code, or provisions referred to by the Code.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Court Matters Act should supplement the provisions of the Regulation when a Court examines the grounds for refusal under the Regulation. Appeals may be addressed to both the court of appeal and the Supreme Court, subject to the requirements concerning leave to appeal under the Court Matters Act.</p>
<h2>Translations, etc.</h2>
<p>Under the Regulation, the court in the Member State of origin is, upon request, to issue a certificate using the form annexed to the Regulation. This certificate is to be submitted by the party who invokes the judgment or requests enforcement of the judgment.</p>
<p>The Regulation allows each Member State to specify which of the official languages of EU institutions, in addition to its own, may be accepted as a translation of the certificate. In this area, the Inquiry proposes that Swedish authorities should accept forms using Swedish, Danish or English.</p>
<h2>Transfer of the exequatur procedure The exequatur procedure</h2>
<p>Enforcing foreign civil law judgments in Sweden usually requires that in an exequatur procedure, a court issues a declaration of enforceability. Rules on exequatur are found in several statutes.</p>
<p>One such is the Act with supplementary provisions on the jurisdiction of courts and on recognition and international enforcement of certain decisions (2006:74) (the 2006 version of the Act). The annexes to the instruments covered by the 2006 Act and the 2006 Act itself indicate that issues of exequatur are examined by the Svea Court of Appeal as the court of first instance.</p>
<p>The area of family law contains several instruments concerning court jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of judgments. Two EU Regulations are among the most important of these instruments – The Brussels II Regulation and the Maintenance Regulation. The supplementary legislation to these Regulations stipulates that in situations where exequatur is required under these Regulations, Svea Court of Appeal is to be the exequatur court.</p>
<p>There are a large number of other laws that specify Svea Court of Appeal as the exclusive forum for examining issues of recognition and enforcement of foreign decisions. Rules to this effect are found in e.g. the Act on Certain International Issues relating to Matrimonial Property Relations (1990:272).</p>
<p>The Act concerning Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Decisions relating to Custody etc. (1989:14) (the Enforcement Act) contains provisions on recognition and enforcement of decisions pertaining to the 1980 European Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions concerning Custody of Children (the 1980 Council of Europe Convention) and the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (the 1980 Hague Convention). Under the 1980 Council of Europe Convention, the competent court is the district court where the child is habitually resident. The 1980 Hague Convention gives Stockholm District Court exclusive jurisdiction in matters concerning the return of children.</p>
<p>The fact that Svea Court of Appeal is the court of first instance for exequatur procedures entails a deviation from the customary division of responsibilities among the courts. The appeals system has traditionally been based on a functional division between the different levels in the judicial structure, with the main focus of the administration of justice to lie with district courts. The primary task of the court of appeal is to review decisions taken by district courts.</p>
<p>The issue of a transfer of exequatur procedures to district courts as the court of first instance has been raised in various contexts. It was determined that a reform of this kind should await the review of the Brussels I Regulation.</p>
<h2>A general transfer of the exequatur procedure</h2>
<p>The fact that Svea Court of Appeal is the court of first instance in exequatur proceedings is contrary to the principles of the appeals system. The Inquiry considers that there are no compelling reasons why Svea Court of Appeal should continue to hear these matters as the court of first instance. On the contrary, it would be most appropriate for these matters, as with other cases and matters, to be heard by district courts as the court of first instance.</p>
<p>In light of this, the Inquiry proposes that exequatur proceedings that are currently handled by Svea Court of Appeal are to be examined by district courts as the court of first instance.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that where subsequent enforcement is carried out under the Debt Enforcement Code, an application for enforcement is to be submitted to the district court that, under Chapter 18, Section 1 of the Debt Enforcement Code, examines appeals of decisions taken by the Swedish Enforcement Authority. In certain situations where there is no actual defendant, the application is to be submitted to the district court, determined by Chapter 18, Section 1 of the Debt Enforcement Code, where one of the applicants has their habitual residence, or where the person or persons indicated in the application have their habitual residence.</p>
<p>In enforcement issues under the Brussels II Regulation that concern the person of a child where the subsequent enforcement is carried out under Chapter 21 of the Children and Parents Code, it is instead proposed that the district court that, under Chapter 21, Section 1 of the Children and Parents Code, can examine enforcement of a judgment or an order on custody, residence or access is to be the competent court. The same is proposed for decisions under the 1996 Hague Convention that concern the person of a child. It follows from this that all district courts in the country will be competent to examine such an application for enforcement. In situations where a decision contains both orders concerning the person of a child and other orders, such as orders concerning the property of the child, it is proposed that the court that examines an application under Chapter 21 of the Children and Parents Code is to be competent to examine enforcement regarding the entire decision. No changes are proposed regarding the jurisdiction rules in the Enforcement Act.</p>
<p>There are two different procedures for exequatur. Some instruments stipulate a procedure containing several steps. In the first step, only a formal examination is carried out and the opposite party is not given the opportunity to comment on the application. The parties can subsequently apply to appeal a decision on the basis of an application for a declaration of enforceability (step two in the process). Any grounds for refusal are examined at this stage. Other instruments stipulate a one-step procedure, where the proceedings are adversarial in nature from the beginning.</p>
<p>Regarding procedures that take place in several steps, the Inquiry proposes that district courts are to be competent to hear both the first formal examination and the examination of the application for an appeal. A party can subsequently appeal the district court’s decision to the court of appeal. The Inquiry considers that a solution of this kind means that the actual declaration of enforceability is transferred and that the principles of the appeals system are maintained.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that at the first formal hearing in an exequatur procedure that stipulates several steps, the district court is to be constituted by a single, legally trained judge. In an appeal of the declaration of enforceability, however, the court may consist of three legally trained judges if there are particular grounds with regard to the nature of the matter. Under the Inquiry’s proposal, a judge who has presided over the first, formal hearing is to be disqualified from participating in the hearing of an appeal of the decision.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is proposed that a judge who has participated in the first, formal hearing or an appeal is to be disqualified from dealing with any examination of enforcement of the decision.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Court Matters Act is to be applicable to the court’s examination of appeals (in procedures that take place in several steps) and for applications for enforcement (in onestep procedures). Appeals may be addressed to both the court of appeal and the Supreme Court, subject to the requirements concerning leave to appeal under the Court Matters Act.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposed supplementary provisions and proposed changes due to the transfer of the exequatur procedure should enter into force at the same time as the new Brussels I Regulation will mainly begin to be applied, i.e. from 10 January 2015.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposed supplementary provisions for the new Brussels I Regulation do not require any transitional provisions.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a transitional provision is proposed regarding the proposal of transferring the exequatur procedure from Svea Court of Appeal to district courts. This provision would mean that older provisions are to be applied to exequatur procedures initiated prior to the entry into force.</p>
