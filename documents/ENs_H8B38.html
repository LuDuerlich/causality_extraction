<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The smallest municipality in Sweden, Bjurholm, has 2 450 inhabitants, whereas the largest, Stockholm, has 962 154. Despite the differences in size, all municipalities have the same tasks and responsibilities. The municipalities provide welfare services such as education as well as child and elderly care. They also provide technical services. In addition, municipalities have a key role in societal development; they are responsible for physical planning, housing, infrastructure and community development. They also have supervisory and control duties across various areas, such as the environment and food security. Furthermore, municipalities are important employers; in 2017, the municipal level had 700 000 employees.</p>
<p>Municipalities in Sweden are facing major challenges due to demographic development and rapid urbanisation. Forecasts show that 18 of Sweden’s 290 municipalities will have under 5 000 inhabitants in 2040 compared to 14 of 290 currently. At the same time and according to the same forecast, the number of municipalities with a population over 100 000 inhabitants will increase from 18 to 27 by 2040. Differences between municipalities in terms of population, competence, financial conditions and thus capacity are clearly increasing.</p>
<p>The government has therefore appointed a parliamentary Committee to formulate a strategy aiming at strengthening the capacity of municipalities so that they can fulfil their assignments and handle future challenges.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Financial conditions and the provision of skills will become ever more pressing issues for most municipalities in the coming years. The municipalities will also face challenges when it comes to maintaining the quality of services, coping with demands for investment and dealing with the consequences of climate change. Small municipalities generally have a weaker level of capacity than larger municipalities and are also more vulnerable to demographic and financial changes.</p>
<p>All categories of municipalities, except the largest cities, are experiencing a reduction in their ability to finance services through tax revenues. This leads to a greater dependence on income equalisation between municipalities and financial support from the national level. The provision of skills in the municipalities is also increasingly challenging. There is in particular a lack of teachers, preschool teachers and trained staff in elderly care. Small and peripheral municipalities face the most difficulty when it comes to attracting employees, especially within the school and care sectors.</p>
<p>Urbanisation and demographic development lead to polarisation between large and small municipalities. Large municipalities are increasing in numbers and growing in terms of population. Small municipalities are also increasing in numbers and shrinking in terms of population. In small municipalities this development leads to weakening capacity, especially in terms of strategic capacity. In large municipalities the development leads to a mismatch between administrative division on one hand and functional area on the other. This will affect the capacity of these municipalities to deal with issues relating to physical planning, housing etc.</p>
<p>In sum, the municipalities are facing several types of challenges all of which are likely to be further exacerbated in the coming years:</p>
<p>• Difficulties in gaining access to needed skills and labour</p>
<p>• Integration of immigrants</p>
<p>• Increasing demands for investments</p>
<p>• Increasing demands for services and welfare</p>
<p>• Dealing with the effects of climate change.</p>
<p>These challenges tend to be more severe in small municipalities since the level of capacity and robustness both in terms of the economy and general and specialist competence are weaker in these municipalities.</p>
<h2>Basic principles Local self-government and state governance</h2>
<p>Compared to many other European countries, local self-government in Sweden is extensive and Swedish municipalities enjoy wideranging responsibilities. Despite this, state-level governance of the municipalities – not least through earmarked state grants – has increased in recent years.</p>
<h2>Municipal capacity</h2>
<p>According to the Committee’s terms of reference each municipality must have enough capacity to prepare, make and implement decisions in order to provide services based on national demands and citizens’ needs.</p>
<p>The Committee have chosen to differentiate between the municipalities’ operational capacity and their strategic capacity. Operational capacity relates to municipalities ability to deliver tasks and provide services to their citizens both in the short-term and longterm. Strategic capacity relates to a permanent and long-term ability to fulfil assignments and face societal challenges. According to the Committee operational capacity is not enough. From a long-term perspective the municipality also needs to display a sufficient level of strategic capacity. It is also crucial for both operational and strategic capacity that the municipalities have the ability to govern and manage their own organisation.</p>
<h2>Structural changes</h2>
<p>According to the terms of references, the Committee’s focus is on structural changes. The Committee is assigned to analyse four types of structural reforms: increased inter-municipal cooperation, municipal mergers, general change of tasks and responsibilities and asymmetric change of tasks and responsibilities. A key question here is to what extent the four types of structural changes can strengthen the operational and strategic capacity of the municipalities.</p>
<h2>Inter-municipal cooperation</h2>
<p>Inter-municipal cooperation has become more common over the past 20 years. The number of both municipal federations (legal entities with boards nominated by the member municipalities) and common committees (one municipality takes responsibility for tasks in a group of municipalities) has increased significantly over the past three decades.</p>
<p>According to the Committee, inter-municipal cooperation can enhance the ability of the municipalities to deliver tasks and provide welfare services. However, inter-municipal cooperation over time tends to be affected by changing conditions in the individual municipalities' politics and economy, potentially leading to tensions and increasing instability in the cooperation arrangements.</p>
<p>Limited empirical evidence exists showing that inter-municipal cooperation leads to increased cost efficiency and service quality.</p>
<p>The negative democratic aspects of municipal cooperation are less control and influence for individual municipalities, increased complexity for voters and politicians and reduced opportunities for voters to make the politicians accountable.</p>
<p>According to the Committee, the more strategically-focused inter-municipal cooperation option provides better continuity and better conditions for building trust between the municipalities. The Committee defines strategic inter-municipal cooperation as fixed constellations of municipalities cooperating within a wider range of fields and from a more long-term perspective.</p>
<h2>Municipal mergers</h2>
<p>Analyses from the Nordic countries show that a municipality should have at least 20 000 inhabitants to be able to efficiently deliver the wide range of tasks and services it is obligated by law to provide. Generally, larger municipalities have better operational and strategic capacity than smaller ones.</p>
<p>There is however no clear relation between municipal size and economic performance. Evaluations of the Danish municipal reform in 2007 show that there have been no cost savings in key welfare services, such as schools and elderly care. Nevertheless, financial results in respect of the merged municipalities have improved. According to a cost analysis undertaken by the Committee on Swedish conditions, merger was expected only to lead to marginal cost benefits.</p>
<p>Demography, sparse settlement pattern and long distances to larger cities are significant to municipal capacity. A small municipality close to a larger city for instance often has a better capacity level compared to a municipality of the same size with a sparse settlement pattern and peripheral location.</p>
<p>Municipalities in the same functional area (e.g. labour market or commuting area) could benefit from mergers but incentives for merger are often lower in these municipalities.</p>
<p>Municipal mergers might also have democratic implications. In a larger municipality, a greater distance exists between voters and politicians while the positive implications of such mergers can be that a larger municipality has a greater capacity to provide services to its citizens and to recruit politicians.</p>
<p>Strong arguments supporting municipal mergers are that larger municipalities are more robust, have a better financial capacity, a better investment capacity and a more favorable situation when it comes to recruiting needed skills. Generally, a larger municipality will also display a greater level of strategic capacity to deal with future challenges.</p>
<h2>General change of tasks and responsibilities</h2>
<p>A third example of structural change is to change the municipalities’ tasks and responsibilities, either through centralisation from the local to the regional or state level or through decentralisation from state or regional level to the local level. The driving force behind centralisation could be that the task or assignment in question has a more regional or national logic, e.g. rescue service or upper secondary schools. Another driving force behind centralisation is that the municipalities lack the capacity to provide services and deliver tasks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, decentralisation of tasks and responsibilities could be a way of strengthening the municipalities’ ability to attract skills as well as strengthening the municipalities’ operational and strategic capacity. However, new tasks and responsibilities mean that the municipalities will have to have new and increased competence. Since the smallest municipalities already lack the capacity to handle their current tasks and assignments, it will be difficult for them to handle additional tasks and assignments.</p>
<h2>Asymmetric change of responsibilities</h2>
<p>Since 1971, Sweden has had what can be termed, a symmetric system of local government, i.e. all municipalities have the same assignments and obligations. Asymmetry means that different categories of municipalities have different assignments and obligations. One implication of asymmetry is that it makes it more difficult for voters in a specific municipality to hold their politicians accountable, when responsibility is transferred from their own municipality to another municipality where they do not have the right to vote. If, however, responsibility is transferred to the state or regional level, voters can hold the politicians accountable in national or regional elections.</p>
<p>The Committee therefore assesses that asymmetry will have negative democratic consequences when a central democratic instrument, political accountability, is partially put out of play. It is also difficult to argue that asymmetry strengthens the municipalities’ operational and strategic capacity. Indeed, one effect of this can be that both the operational and strategic capacity of those municipalities with less tasks are weakened as their tasks are adapted to their changing capacity.</p>
<h2>Other ways of strengthening municipal capacity</h2>
<p>Digital tools can be used to maintain and increase quality in terms of municipal services and tasks, e.g. the automation of certain administrative tasks can create space for employees to focus on assignments which align more to their own key skills sets. This process of digital transformation however necessarily places high demands on the municipalities, particularly in terms of professional competence, governance and financial resources. Significant differences clearly exist between municipalities when it comes to their capacity to fully utilise the potential of digitalisation.</p>
<p>Another important tool to strengthen municipal capacity is learning and the exchange of experiences between municipalities.</p>
<h2>Strategy to strengthen the capacity of municipalities</h2>
<p>The Committee assesses that inter-municipal cooperation improves the conditions for strengthening municipalities’ operating capacity. The overall conclusion however is that, in future, there may be a need to change the municipal structure in order to safeguard the decentralised model. The Committee also wants to emphasise that a combination of various measures in both the short and long term is required for the municipalities to have enough capacity to fulfil their assigned tasks.</p>
<p>The measures may however look rather different depending on the geography of the municipalities and other structural conditions. For example, long distances make it difficult to achieve economies of scale in municipal activities, since municipal activities such as preschool, school and elderly care need to be delivered close to the inhabitants. This must be taken into account both when it comes to increased and more strategic inter-municipal cooperation and with regards to municipal mergers.</p>
<p>The point of departure in respect to municipal mergers is that these must be voluntary, which means that it is the municipalities themselves who decide if they wish to merge. Strategic inter-municipal cooperation may be considered sufficient in some municipalities, while other municipalities may see strategic cooperation as a step along the road to merger.</p>
<p>The state has a fundamental responsibility to ensure that all municipalities have sufficient resources and support to fulfil their tasks. The state needs to take overall responsibility to ensure that the financial conditions of municipalities are adequate. The state also needs to take measures to enhance recruitment in respect of needed skills and expertise in the municipalities. In addition, the state also needs to take measures to make it easier for municipalities to take advantage of digital solutions.</p>
<h2>Proposals and assessments Structural changes</h2>
<p>The Committee assesses that strategic inter-municipal cooperation can lead to a more efficient cooperation and that this in turn can strengthen municipal capacity. Municipal mergers can strengthen both operational and strategic capacity. In future perspective, a changed municipal structure may be necessary to safeguard the decentralised model. Municipal mergers should be voluntary.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes a state grant to municipalities wishing to initiate a process of more strategic inter-municipal cooperation or a municipal merger.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the state take over the debts of those municipalities that want to carry out a municipal merger.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes a project to establish a test bed for municipal experimentations allowing municipalities to test new measures to strengthen their capacity.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes the establishment of a Municipal delegation who in collaboration with the County governors will conduct a dialogue with the municipalities on measures to strengthen their capacity.</p>
<h2>State commitments and presence in all parts of the country</h2>
<p>The Committee assesses that the state’s commitments and the management of these commitments are of decisive importance in enabling the municipalities to have sufficient capacity to fulfil their tasks. The state should ensure the financing and implementation of state responsibilities, the state should follow the financing principle and should also be present with jobs, government agency services and a police presence throughout Sweden.</p>
<h2>The financial situation of the municipalities</h2>
<p>The Committee proposes that the state primarily uses means other than targeted state grants in order to govern municipal tasks and responsibilities.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the government sets up an inquiry to conduct a broad review of the municipal financial equalisation system. Furthermore, the Committee proposes an ongoing administration and follow-up of the municipal financial equalisation system.</p>
<h2>Provision of skills</h2>
<p>The Committee proposes that the government takes the initiative to investigate the possibility of reducing student loans for people living and working in municipalities with particularly difficult challenges in respect of the provision of skills.</p>
<h2>The digital transformation of municipalities</h2>
<p>The Committee assesses that the state should take long-term responsibility for the establishment of a common public sector infrastructure for basic data and the exchange of information to which the municipalities can connect.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the Government sets up an inquiry to assess the regulatory changes required in order to ensure that the process of digital transformation occurs smoothly.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the government gives the State Agency for digital government the assignment to support the municipalities in their digital transformation processes.</p>
<h2>Other proposals and assessments</h2>
<p>The Committee also assesses that the state should take measures to enable easier access for municipalities to national planning docu- mentation related to the effects of climate change.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the government sets up an inquiry to investigate whether special regulations on basic infrastructure are required, to enhance inter-municipal cooperation, concerning in par- ticular the issues of water and sewage and broadband.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the government gives The National Agency for Regional and Economic Growth the assignment – in collaboration with National Board of Housing, Building and Plan- ning and the Swedish Transport Administration – to support strategic planning in the municipalities with the aim of improving joint local and regional planning processes.</p>
<p>Finally, the Committee assesses that the government should take measures to facilitate the financing of new housing in municipalities where construction costs exceed market value.</p>
