<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The mandate of the Upper Secondary Education Inquiry</h2>
<p>The terms of reference and additional terms of reference (dir. 2015:31, 2015:82 and 2015:141) for the Upper Secondary Education Inquiry are extensive and span more than 20 different sub-areas concerning upper secondary education. The Government’s goals under its terms of reference are that all young people must start and complete upper secondary education.  This served as the starting point for the work of the inquiry, bringing with it a focus on the participation of young people in upper secondary education and on  drop-out  and completion rates in upper secondary education . On the basis of the above goals, the inquiry has conducted a broad examination of various issues and areas in upper secondary education.</p>
<p>According to the terms of reference, upper secondary education naturally needs to continue to be developed and adapted to a changing society. However, this work should build further on central aspects of the most recent upper secondary education reform. The inquiry is to consider whether upper secondary education is to be compulsory or whether other measures that motivate and engage young people in completing upper secondary education are preferable. Furthermore, the inquiry is to analyse a number of more specific issues, including reviewing the provisions on support, proposing how the right to eligibility for admission to higher education can be strengthened for vocational programmes and how introductory programmes can be developed, and investigating the opportunities to introduce subject grades in upper secondary education and upper secondary education for students with learning disabilities. The inquiry is also to suggest whether there is cause to modify the range of national programmes and orientations.</p>
<p>On the basis of the analysis carried out in relation to the different sub-areas, the inquiry proposes many and varied measures to ensure that all young people start upper secondary education and achieve its goals. Measures to ensure that everyone succeeds can be proposed based on several different levels of ambition. One starting point was that the proposals are to be appropriate, important for development and simultaneously manageable for the upper secondary schools to implement. The inquiry has not been afforded any financial scope for reform and sources of funding must be accounted for. Additionally, there is a lack of upper secondary school teachers, which has been taken into account by the inquiry in its proposals. Regarding the issue of subject grades, it is the view of the inquiry that this would additionally require a long-term perspective spanning several years. The inquiry’s analysis of problems and the proposals presented are set out below.</p>
<h2>The upper secondary education participation rate is high but the rate of completion is problematic</h2>
<p>Participation in upper secondary education in Sweden is very high and only very few young people do not start upper secondary education at all. Only approximately 0.7 per cent of young people have not started an upper secondary education programme within two years of completing compulsory education. Many young people arrive in Sweden as immigrants at upper secondary school age and start their studies at upper secondary school, initially on the introductory programme for language introduction.</p>
<p>However, although the majority of young people start upper secondary education, not everyone succeeds in attaining the goals set for their course of study. There is a certain amount of uncertainty in the statistics on drop-out rates, but a major difference can be seen between national programmes and introductory programmes. Of the students who commence their upper secondary school studies on a national programme, approximately 2 per cent only complete the first or the second year. This proportion is higher for those who begin an introductory programme, with approximately 24 per cent only attending for one or two years. In total it is estimated that approximately 5 per cent of all students do not start the third year of upper secondary education and deregister from their course earlier than this point.</p>
<p>The majority of students are thus in upper secondary education for three years but a large proportion, approximately 35 per cent , do not gain an upper secondary diploma during this period. After four years this proportion falls to approximately 30 per cent. A lower proportion of students on vocational programmes gain a diploma compared with students on higher education preparatory programmes. Students who start their time in upper secondary school on an introductory programme also often need more than three years if the aim is to attain an upper secondary diploma.</p>
<p>The fact that such a large proportion of students fail to attain the goals for their course of study is a major challenge for upper secondary education and creates difficulties for those students affected. It also means a greater risk of both unemployment and economic and social exclusion. The information gained by the inquiry, however, shows that a relatively large proportion of this group – approximately a quarter of those who do not gain a diploma – only lack passing grades in a few courses. It is therefore important to put concerted effort into improving the underlying circumstances for students to attain the goals of their education.</p>
<h2>Many factors affect the completion rate</h2>
<p>Much of upper secondary education works well and many students enjoy their education and have expert and committed teachers. The job of the inquiry, however, is to identify and shed light on problem areas with the aim of clearly establishing how more students can complete upper secondary education. Some of these areas are commented on below.</p>
<p>There is no simple answer as to what affects the completion rate in upper secondary education. The picture of what causes students to drop out or fail to progress is a complex one and over the course of the inquiry a number of areas in which various explanations may be found have been highlighted. These may involve individual as well as organisational factors. For example, the inquiry has highlighted deficiencies in terms of support, the structure of education, the structure of the introductory programmes, and different applications of students’ rights to education. There are also certain problems in terms of the level of teacher support and cases of students sometimes not being met with high expectations. The responsibility of schools for adapting teaching to individuals and supporting students does not appear to be as established in upper secondary schools as it is in compulsory schools. In some cases, the way upper secondary schools operate is also divided and fragmentary. The system, in which there are a large number of courses within the national programmes, contributes towards this. In certain cases, upper secondary education is also failing to ensure that all students receive sufficient teaching time. There are particular problems regarding students’ opportunities to study full time and the planning of education as a whole. A significant lack of trained teachers is another challenge facing upper secondary education. In some cases, different areas of expertise in upper secondary schools find it difficult to work together and are not given sufficient support in doing so. Student health care and study and career guidance are not used as strategic resources to a sufficient extent. Many newly arrived students have come to Sweden at upper secondary school age and some may take a long time to qualify to start national programmes.</p>
<p>Context, teacher support and a student-centred approach – success factors for preventing dropping out</p>
<p>The systematic review carried out by the inquiry points towards a consistent context for the pupils, and active teacher support as being crucial to ensuring that more students complete their studies. Facilitating participation and a sense of community, and working to ensure a student-centred approach are also examples of success factors, as is preventive student health care work. Sufficient teaching time and that this time being used well is also necessary in order for more students to succeed. The material of the inquiry also shows that good prior knowledge and skills from compulsory education are very important in ensuring that students attain the goals of a national programme.</p>
<h2>The development of the introductory programmes so far</h2>
<p>Over several years, the proportion of students who do not attain the qualifications required for the national programmes at upper secondary school has increased. In autumn 2015 14.4 per cent of students leaving compulsory education were not qualified to start a national programme at upper secondary school. The proportion of young people aged 16–18 who migrated to Sweden in 2015 was also equivalent to an increase of almost 8 per cent in this age group. In total, 22.6 per cent of students in the first year of upper secondary school were attending one of the upper secondary school introductory programmes in the academic year 2015/16. Language introduction is by far the biggest introductory programme.</p>
<p>Only a very small proportion of the students on an introductory programme gain a diploma from a national programme within three years. Programme oriented individual options is the introductory programme from which the greatest proportion gain a diploma; 23 per cent of the students who were beginners on the programme in 2011 gained a diploma within three years.</p>
<p>At the moment, it appears as though the introductory programmes are not always sufficiently well structured and that the amount of teaching time that students receive varies. Introductory programmes sometimes risk not giving students sufficiently varied educational content and there are also differences in terms of the length of time that students are permitted to attend an introductory programme.</p>
<h2>Student application patterns and youth employment</h2>
<p>Many young people view the labour market as uncertain and find it difficult to gain an overview of the job opportunities available. According to studies, many young people want to postpone their choice of career by choosing education options that are seen as general. Furthermore, a larger proportion of the parents of today’s young people have completed post-upper secondary education compared with previous generations, which is likely to affect these young people’s views of different educational choices. Application patterns show that students are increasingly choosing higher education preparatory programmes and there is an increasing demand for education with more general content. Young people’s interest in vocational programmes continues to fall, but 25.6 per cent (of students in year 1 in the academic year 2015/16) continue to choose a vocational course and some students are clearly interested in upper secondary education with an emphasis on vocational content. Several industries also offer good opportunities to find work immediately on obtaining a vocational diploma from upper secondary school.</p>
<p>There may be several reasons for the falling interest in vocational programmes, including attitudes in society in general. The trend for fewer students to choose vocational courses is also seen in other countries. However, this may also be due to higher education preparatory programmes being seen as more general in nature, and as providing more opportunities for continued study. Furthermore, there may be uncertainty among young people and their parents regarding the extent to which the vocational programme that a student wants to choose at a particular school grants eligibility to apply for university. Today there are many opportunities to attain the eligibility criteria for higher education on vocational programmes but this requires active choices being made. In many cases, this requires that the student receives information on the opportunities available at the school or schools to which the student is interested in applying.</p>
<p>The labour market is changeable and there is a great need for labour in certain areas while the demand is falling in others. It is vital for individuals that a good education equips them sufficiently well to be able to switch to a different job at the same level of qualification or higher. It is also important to have the opportunity to progress through the education system. Young people thus need upper secondary education that provides skills for the future and enables lifelong learning. Studies of youth employment show that complete studies, or having attended three years of upper secondary education, are essential for gaining a good footing on the labour market.</p>
<h2>The focus of the inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s proposals seek to facilitate all young people participating in and succeeding in their upper secondary education.</p>
<p>On the basis of the inquiry’s analysis, the proposals are focused on the following: – Upper secondary school being given a new mission to encourage young people to participate in upper secondary education, give them the opportunity to reach the goals of their studies and counteract dropping out. Several measures will highlight the expectation that all young people will complete upper secondary education. – A holistic approach to the structure of the education is emphasised, e.g. through proposals concerning subject grades and support. – Opportunities for students to continue in upper secondary education for longer should be improved. – Developing the introductory programmes to provide better structure and to better support transitions to national programmes. – Providing better opportunities for coherent support adapted to the individual for those students who need it. – Increasing focus on teaching time and how this time is reported and used. – Students’ rights to general eligibility for higher education on vocational programmes without making active choices should be strengthened and the students should also be offered an opportunity for specific eligibility while protecting the vocational content of their courses of study. – The number of orientations on national programmes is to be reduced and some programmes and orientations should be broadened. There is a need for vocational programmes and higher education preparatory programmes to move closer together to a certain extent. – Work towards subject grades in upper secondary schools and upper secondary schools for students with learning disabilities should continue. A basis for an inquiry is provided regarding the conditions for such work.</p>
<h2>Summary of the inquiry’s main proposals Upper secondary education that facilitates all young people participating in and attaining the goals of upper secondary education</h2>
<p>The inquiry recommends other measures above making upper secondary education formally compulsory. Several provisions are proposed that highlight the importance of all young people participating in upper secondary education. These provisions are judged to clearly serve as guidance for schools, parents/guardians and students and can give the same signals as a compulsory mandate.</p>
<p>Participation in upper secondary education is already very high but a group of students is actively dropping out, which needs to be prevented. Making education compulsory up to the age of 18 could be a possible alternative to further increase student participation and to emphasise society’s responsibility for the upper secondary education of students. However, such an obligation would at the same time be associated with problems, e.g. concerning certain opportunities to allow a dispensation for other education and any sanctions and tools that would need to be applied were students not to attend upper secondary education. The inquiry therefore judges that measures other than making upper secondary education compulsory are preferable. These measures would be clear and serve as guidance but are easier to address in dialogue with young people who are facing difficulties for various reasons.</p>
<p>Although young people of upper secondary school age are not legally obliged to attend school, it is reasonable that society’s responsibility to ensure that all young people complete upper secondary education is far-reaching. The inquiry considers that all young people should be guided towards upper secondary education and also given support in returning to such education in cases where they drop out of their studies. All students need a good start at upper secondary school and to be given an opportunity to attain the goals of their course of study. For the initiatives put in place to be effective, young people attending upper secondary school and their parents and guardians must be actively involved. The inquiry therefore proposes the following measures, among others: – A goal that all young people must start and complete upper secondary education is to be introduced in the Education Act . – The home municipality will be given a new mandate that involves an obligation to actively work to ensure that young people completing compulsory education start upper secondary education as soon as possible thereafter. – Schools must actively prevent students from dropping out. The head teacher is responsible for conducting a dialogue with students wishing to terminate their studies, and the school must always take steps to ensure that such students are motivated to complete their education. – A systematic handover is to take place when students transition from compulsory education to upper secondary education. – The responsibility of students and parents and guardians will be clarified. Parents and guardians must help to ensure that young people start and participate in upper secondary education. – The municipality’s responsibility for ensuring that young people between the ages of 16 and 20 are active is to primarily seek to ensure that young people start or return to upper secondary education. Newly arrived students are to be covered by this responsibility. – Making it clear that students are able to continue in education even if they do not attain the goals set. A student who has not received a diploma after three years is in some cases to be entitled to continue at upper secondary school, e.g. for a fourth year.</p>
<h2>Support and working methods need to be developed</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes new provisions to make schools more equitable in terms of how the upper secondary school works with support and the way courses are structured. This is needed in order to meet the needs of an increasingly heterogeneous student group. Students need to receive active support from teachers and individually adapted support measures. The school is responsible for monitoring each student and needs to work with a studentcentred approach so that students have the opportunity to receive support day to day. Full-time study opportunities should be provided for students and the teaching time must be used well. School providers, head teachers and teachers also need to receive greater support in working to improve the quality of teaching. The inquiry therefore proposes the following measures, among others: – The support that is required must be provided on the basis of the student’s education as a whole and using the variety of methods that the students need. A broad range of measures must be offered. – The regulation regarding structured teaching in compulsory education should also apply to upper secondary education. – The education must be planned across coherent school days and be spread evenly across these days. – All students must have a mentor who monitors the student’s development and studies as a whole. – The teaching time should be extended to a certain extent. In the long term, additional teaching time may be considered. It is proposed that teaching time must be followed up and reported better. – In-service training is needed when it comes to upper secondary schools’ work on guidance, stimulation, support and mentoring. – Successful examples of cooperation on study and careers guidance and student health care should be disseminated and serve as support for improvements through a special initiative on skills collaboration.</p>
<h2>The introductory programmes need to be developed</h2>
<p>The inquiry judges that the introductory programmes should be developed in order to make their structure clearer. The right to full-time studies must be safeguarded and programmes need to be able to offer greater breadth in terms of content. Supplementing with the compulsory school subjects that are needed continues to be important, but students should also be able to be offered more varied educational content. Clarification is particularly needed for language introduction so as to encourage different educational paths, including vocational ones. Programme oriented individual options is focused on as an important programme for students who have some passing grades and who are capable of progressing on to a national programme within a relatively short period of time. The documents issued following the introductory programmes need to be made clearer, partly for the individual student in order to show what the student has achieved, and partly so as to facilitate transitions. Support is also needed to continue to develop the introductory programmes, at national and local level. The inquiry therefore proposes the following measures, among others: – Minimum guaranteed teaching time must also be set for introductory programmes and the right to three years of study must be clearly set out. – It must be possible to study programme oriented individual options towards a higher education preparatory programme. The preparatory programme is to be abolished. – Adjustments will be made to ensure that students gain better opportunities to study more subjects on certain introductory programmes. This will pave the way for language introduction to contain different educational paths. – It must be compulsory for upper secondary schools to assess the knowledge and skills of newly arrived students. – Regulation of the documents for introductory programmes is to be clarified. – A national development council for the introductory programmes is to be set up to support national collaboration with the relevant expertise.</p>
<h2>Uniform eligibility requirements for admission to national programmes</h2>
<p>Grades from compulsory school are extremely important indicators of students’ capability of attaining the goals of upper secondary education. A lack of prior knowledge and skills increases the risk of school failure, which in turn increases the risk of dropping out. In the view of the inquiry, more students must be provided with better knowledge and skills, in compulsory schools or in introductory programmes, in order to be able to complete a national programme.</p>
<p>However, some students on the introductory programmes are very close to attaining the eligibility criteria at the point that they reach the age limit for starting a national programme, i.e. the first six months of the year in which they reach the age of 20. In some cases, the student, for example, may have studied a large proportion of their programme integrated with a national programme and may only lack one or two subjects in order to be eligible for the programme. The inquiry therefore proposes the following: – All national programmes should have equally high eligibility criteria. Twelve passing grades in compulsory school subjects should apply for both vocational programmes and higher education preparatory programmes. – It must be possible to make exceptions regarding certain eligibility requirements for students who are very close to attaining the eligibility requirement when they reach the age limit for starting a national programme, and who are judged capable of completing studies on a national programme.</p>
<h2>Vocational programmes will be developed so as to provide both vocational content and eligibility for higher education</h2>
<p>The right of students on vocational programmes to study the courses that lead to basic eligibility for higher education should be strengthened, in line with the inquiry’s terms of reference.</p>
<p>However, it is also important to protect the vocational content of the courses of study. In the view of the inquiry, the vocational programmes ought to be able to provide greater breadth by offering both vocational skills and basic eligibility as well as specific eligibility. The inquiry therefore proposes the following measures, among others: – The courses leading to basic eligibility for higher education must be included as a fundamental element of all vocational programmes. This will create greater clarity. This proposal has been designed so as to safeguard the vocational content as far as possible. Only a few vocational outcomes need to be modified. However, the student can opt not to study the courses that grant eligibility. – Reinforcement is also proposed in that students on vocational programmes are to be given an opportunity to study courses that lead to specific eligibility for higher education within an expanded programme. Training for degrees in engineering, teaching and nursing must be possible career paths, for example. Students who wish to must also be able to study additional vocational courses within an expanded programme.</p>
<h2>The range of national programmes and orientations is to be developed further</h2>
<p>The inquiry shows that today’s upper secondary schools contain many different paths of study with few students or with certain overlaps and that a certain amount of reduction in the number of orientations is therefore desirable. There should also be an opportunity for studying vocational courses as part of certain higher education preparatory programmes. The inquiry therefore proposes the following measures, among others: – The number of orientations is to be cut and some of the names of programmes will be changed. – An orientation with a vocational profile aiming towards the commercial sector is to be introduced in the Business Management and Economics Programme, and sales and service courses introduced in several vocational programmes. – Workplace-based learning should be included as part of the new orientation on the Business Management and Economics</p>
<p>Programme and an orientation with a vocational profile – Production engineering – in the Technology Programme. – An assistant nurse diploma will be introduced as part of the Health and Social Care Programme. – A national programme council is to be set up for higher education preparatory programmes. – A model is proposed for regularly assessing how programmes should be updated and constantly renewed.</p>
<h2>All national programmes must include one arts subject</h2>
<p>In line with its terms of reference, the inquiry is to propose how all the national programmes in upper secondary schools can incorporate an arts subject. One starting point is that vocational skills are to be protected as far as possible and the inquiry judges that the same should be true of higher education preparatory courses. The inquiry therefore proposes the following: – One arts subject must be included among the foundation subjects and students should be given an opportunity to choose an orientation in this subject within certain limits. The proposal means changes regarding the diploma project that no longer gives upper secondary credits but which is still required in order to gain an upper secondary diploma.</p>
<h2>Many measures to jointly improve opportunities for recently arrived students</h2>
<p>The inquiry largely submits general proposals that are to benefit all students. However, some proposals particularly apply to upper secondary school students who have recently arrived in Sweden or can be expected to benefit these students to a particularly great extent. This includes the following proposals: – Clarifying the right to  full-time studies and the right to education on introductory programmes. – The content for students on the language introduction programme is to be broadened. – It must be compulsory for upper secondary schools to assess the knowledge and skills of newly arrived students, and supporting materials are to be developed to make it easier to assess education completed abroad. – It must be possible to make exceptions regarding certain eligibility requirements for students on introductory programmes who are very close to attaining the eligibility requirement for a national programme at the point they reach the age limit for starting such studies.</p>
<h2>Work towards subject grades</h2>
<p>The inquiry was commissioned to analyse the advantages and disadvantages of course grades versus subject grades and judges that subject grades have considerable potential to provide better opportunities for students as well as teachers. Furthermore, the risk of early study failure might decrease, as fewer vital grades would be set at an early stage of the course of study. The inquiry judges that work towards introducing subject grades should continue and that there are important reasons to address the issue in more depth and draw up necessary legislative proposals.</p>
<p>The inquiry is also to assess the prerequisites and opportunities for introducing subject grades. We judge that the following prerequisites are important for introducing subject grades: – Development towards subject grades should take a  long-term approach with sufficient time set aside for the purpose. – The inquiry has analysed a model of subject grades limited to certain subjects and a model involving subject grades throughout upper secondary education in all subjects. The inquiry judges that a model that is consistent and covers all subjects would be clearer, more stable and more equitable for vocational programmes and higher education preparatory programmes.  The inquiry judges that a complete subject grade system is preferable and that it should be based on a  subject-based  upper secondary school. – An inquiry should be appointed to draw up necessary legislative proposals and shed light on additional consequences. The National Agency for Education should be commissioned to adapt subjects and programmes.</p>
<p>The inquiry is to submit proposals that reduce student stress. Introducing subject grades is a major change for upper secondary education but there is much to indicate that this kind of reform can be positive and important on the basis of the inquiry’s view that all students are to be given the opportunity to reach the goals of their education. Among other things, a focus on a subject instead of a course can help to reduce student stress, increase opportunities for in-depth study and make it easier to give students the support they need. Students will thus be able to develop their knowledge further. Subject grades may also make the work of teachers easier. The inquiry additionally submits further proposals that may help to reduce student stress, e.g. proposals for support, mentoring and coherent school days.</p>
<h2>Many proposals should also apply to upper secondary education for individuals with learning disabilities</h2>
<p>The starting point for the inquiry’s work with upper secondary education for individuals with learning disabilities was for regulation to be as consistent as possible in relation to upper secondary education. The inquiry has taken the view that a large number of proposals that apply to upper secondary schools should lead to similar changes for upper secondary schools for individuals with learning disabilities. However, a special overview is needed regarding some of the inquiry’s questions for it to be possible to judge whether adaptations also need to be made in upper secondary school for individuals with learning disabilities.</p>
<p>In addition to the proposals that would apply to upper secondary schools for individuals with learning disabilities in a corresponding way to upper secondary schools, the inquiry proposes the following. – It must be made clear that all students attending upper secondary education for individuals with learning disabilities are covered by the provisions of the Education Act on support. – Students are to have an opportunity to study compulsory school subjects in upper secondary schools for individuals with learning disabilities through individually adapted programmes.</p>
<h2>A consistent proposal of measures is to enable more people to succeed in upper secondary education</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes a number of measures that will together encourage all students to participate in upper secondary education and support them to attain the goals of their studies. The inquiry’s proposals will pave the way for a transition in which upper secondary education will provide good conditions for its entire target group in terms of support, teaching, teaching time, programme structure and a holistic approach. The inquiry has focused on giving all students sufficient knowledge and skills to attain the goals of upper secondary education, but the inquiry wishes to emphasise that many of the proposals are also of major importance for students wishing to progress further in developing their knowledge. All programmes must support and stimulate all students on the programme. This places the focus on all students achieving their goals and developing their knowledge and skills, which provides many benefits, for the individual, the job market and society as a whole. The upper secondary school of the future will give all students the grounding they need and the motivation to succeed.</p>
