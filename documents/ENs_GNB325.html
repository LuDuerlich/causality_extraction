<p>The Assignment</p>
<p>My assignment was to consider whether Sweden can ratify, that is, accede to, the ILO Convention No. 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries, and in that case what measures would be required to enable Sweden to comply with the provisions contained in the Convention (Terms of Reference 1997:103).</p>
<p>ILO and Convention No. 169</p>
<p>ILO stands for International Labour Organization. It is one of the UN's specialised agencies enjoined with the task of monitoring issues pertaining to working conditions, discrimination, etc. Within the framework of this brief, the ILO has monitored the living conditions of indigenous peoples for many years.</p>
<p>ILO drafts inter alia conventions. Convention No. 169 contains a number of provisions and undertakings designed to protect indigenous and tribal peoples. The Governments in the countries that have acceded to the Convention must ensure that the rights of the indigenous peoples are protected and that their integrity is respected. The Governments should consult with the peoples with regard to measures that affect them, and create conditions that will enable them to determine their own development as far as possible.</p>
<p>A fundamental principle of the Convention is that the indigenous peoples shall enjoy the full measure of human rights and fundamental freedoms without hindrance or discrimination. But in addition to taking measures to counteract discrimination, the states that accede to the Convention must also author special measures which promote the social and economic rights of the peoples concerned and protect their spiritual and cultural values. This means inter alia that steps must be taken to protect their land, culture and environment.</p>
<p>The Convention places special emphasis on the importance of land for indigenous and tribal peoples. Therefore, the Convention contains provisions intended to safeguard their right to certain tracts of land which they have owned or otherwise used for a long time.</p>
<p>The Convention entered into force in 1991, and so far 14 countries have acceded to it, including Norway and Denmark. The greatest obstacle to ratification by Sweden was previously considered to be the fact that Sweden does not fulfil the conditions set down by the Convention with regard to land rights.</p>
<p>The Sami – an indigenous people in Sweden</p>
<p>Indigenous peoples are defined as people who are descended from the populations which inhabited the country at the time when the present state boundaries were established and who have wholly or partially retained their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions. The decisive factor is not that these people historically speaking have inhabited a certain area for a longer period than anyone else. What is more significant is that their social and cultural situation is special.</p>
<p>The Sami are an indigenous people in Sweden. The Sami themselves identify themselves as an indigenous people, and a Sami population lived in what is now northern Sweden before the country acquired its present state boundaries. The Riksdag (Swedish parliament) has also confirmed the Sami people's status as an indigenous people.</p>
<p>The Sami population in Sweden is estimated to amount to approximately 17,000 persons and of this group, fewer than 2,500 persons are engaged in reindeer breeding and are members of a Sami village.</p>
<p>Conflicts in the reindeer breeding area</p>
<p>The geographical area in which the provisions of the Convention on land rights would apply is the reindeer breeding area, that is, the mountains and large parts of Norrland. Within the reindeer breeding area the Sami have an ancient prescriptive right to practice reindeer husbandry, a usufructary right which includes the right to reindeer pasture, hunting and fishing. Only the Sami who practice reindeer breeding are permitted to exercise these rights.</p>
<p>The reindeer breeding area is divided into year-round pasture lands and winter pasture lands. The Sami people's rights are stronger in the year-round pasture lands, that is to say in the interior of Norrland. The winter pasture lands lie further to the south, and in certain cases the boundaries are not clearly defined. In total, the reindeer breeding area covers approximately one-third of Sweden's surface area.</p>
<p>There are conflicts of interest within the reindeer breeding area. The Sami right, for example, to use land for reindeer herding, hunting and fishing applies to the entire area and thus, in many cases to land owned and used by other people. Ownership in the mountain regions is in part a controversial issue. Sami ownership rights to parts of the reindeer breeding area have only been examined by the courts in a few cases.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasise that the conflicts of interest that have arisen between the Sami and primarily landowners are the result of a series of circumstances for which neither party can be blamed. The root of the conflicts can be traced back a long way. Over the years – from the mid-18th century and late into the 20th century – the state has actively encouraged settlers and others to cultivate areas which the Sami had previously had exclusive use of for reindeer breeding, hunting and fishing. This led to competition for land and subsequently conflicts.</p>
<p>The regulations governing reindeer husbandry, hunting and fishing have evolved gradually. These rules have not been clearly defined, something which to my mind, has contributed to the conflicts which exist today. The rules on Sami hunting and fishing rights and the regulation of the size of the winter pasture lands serve as examples.</p>
<p>What is required to enable Sweden to accede to the Convention?</p>
<p>I have made a thorough study of the Convention and a careful analysis of the implications for Sweden. In my view, Sweden already fulfils the requirements set out in the Convention in most respects. The main stumbling block is the rules concerning Sami land rights. I have made an assessment of what measures must be taken and what rules amended so that Sweden satisfies the conditions stipulated in the Convention.</p>
<p>Sami ownership and possession rights</p>
<p>The Convention requires states to recognise the "rights of ownership and possession" of the peoples concerned over the land which they "traditionally occupy". "Traditionally occupy" denotes land which the indigenous people have traditionally had access to for their subsistence and traditional activities, that is, had predominant influence on.</p>
<p>With regard to land which the Sami according to this definition may be considered to occupy, I have come to the conclusion that this must primarily apply to the parts of the year-round pastures which the state has owned in modern times. However, the boundaries of these areas are unclear and must be established.</p>
<p>Although the Convention uses the expression "rights of ownership and possession" it is clear that this does not necessarily involve formal title to the land. However, the Convention does assume that the land rights reach a certain minimum level. In my estimation, this minimum level corresponds to right of use and possession of the land with strong protection under the law.</p>
<p>The Sami land rights which apply today do not reach that minimum level since the Sami are forced to tolerate considerable encroachments on their reindeer breeding rights. If Sweden is to fulfil the minimum requirements the Sami must be more strongly protected against such encroachment. The reindeer breeding rights must be protected in the same way as other land-user rights. To ensure that such protection is effective the Sami should be given an opportunity to submit their views in advance on measures that might constitute more than a minor encroachment on reindeer breeding rights. They should also be entitled to have such measures examined by an impartial body with knowledge of reindeer breeding and the land required for that purpose. If measures are taken that have an adverse effect on reindeer breeding rights the Sami should be entitled to compensation. The Sami must also be given the same possibility as other groups to transmit their hunting and fishing rights outside their own community in exchange for payment.</p>
<p>The Sami right to use land</p>
<p>The Convention also requires states to recognise the indigenous people's right to use land which they have traditionally used together with others, that is, for a long period.</p>
<p>Lands which the Sami have traditionally used together with others are the areas used for reindeer breeding, hunting and fishing. In my estimation, this primarily refers to land in the winter pasture area, that is, the areas close to the coast where other groups have also used the land for,e.g., silviculture and agriculture. Since the boundaries of the winter pasture lands are poorly defined and the subject of disputes, it must first be decided if the state would be able to recognise the Sami people's right to use lands in these areas.</p>
<p>The Samis people's prospects of continuing with reindeer breeding is highly dependent on access to winter pasture lands and whether their right to use this land is safeguarded. If Sweden is to fulfil the requirements contained in the Convention it is imperative to safeguard opportunities for continued reindeer breeding. Thus, in my estimation, it will be necessary to strengthen protection against infringements of reindeer breeding rights in these parts of the reindeer pasture area as well. This should be effected by giving the Sami the opportunity to comment on plans for land use which might be expected to lead to more than a slight encroachment on reindeer breeding rights in the area. If measures are taken which have a detrimental effect on that right the Sami should be entitled to compensation.</p>
<p>The conditions of the Convention also mean that the Government must ensure that the Sami have sufficient land to enable them to continue reindeer breeding in all the areas where reindeer breeding is practised today.</p>
<p>The right of the Sami to examination of land claims by a court of law</p>
<p>The Convention assumes that the indigenous peoples will have a real opportunity to have their land claims examined in a judicial process.</p>
<p>Proceedings which concern Sami claims to land often involve heavy legal expenses. It has been shown that the Sami in practice have only meagre opportunity to have their land claims examined in the courts since they do not have the financial resources to pay the legal costs. In my view, if Sweden is to fulfil the conditions of the Convention in this respect, the parties involved in cases concerning important questions of principle with respect to the Sami land claims, must be able to receive compensation from the state for legal expenses.</p>
<p>The right of the Sami to influence the use of natural resources</p>
<p>The Convention also stipulates that the indigenous peoples should be given the opportunity to exert influence on the use, management and conservation of natural resources when such measures affect them.</p>
<p>In my view, if Sweden is to satisfy this condition, the influence of the Samis on the natural resources to be found in the reindeer breeding areas must be strengthened. A number of measures are called for.</p>
<p>The Sami must have the right to submit comments on plans for land use in the reindeer breeding area when such plans might have a detrimental effect on breeding.</p>
<p>The general protection from exploitation of the reindeer breeding area should be strengthened. This could be done by amending the rules on land and water management in the Environmental Code so that the Sami Parliament (Sametinget) is entitled to submit its views before areas of national interest for reindeer husbandry in the reindeer breeding area are determined and before exploitation of land which is important in terms of reindeer breeding rights is permitted.</p>
<p>Fuller protection from exploitation should be conferred upon those parts of the reindeer breeding area which the Sami can traditionally be considered to occupy. This could be achieved by defining these areas as regions of national interest and protecting them as part of Sami culture.</p>
<p>In order to increase the influence of the Sami on the use of natural resources in these protected areas the Sami Parliament should also be given the right to comment inter alia before exploitation or measures according to the provisions of the Environmental Code are permitted. In these areas the Sami Parliament should not only monitor the need for land for reindeer breeding but also check that inter alia the Sami culture is protected in these areas.</p>
<p>The Convention places special demands on consultation with the Sami before studies or exploitation under the Minerals Act and the Peat Act are permitted. To fulfil these demands the current regulations will have to be amended so that the Sami are given the right to such consultation and Sami land interests can be taken into account.</p>
<p>Health and medical care based on the needs of the Sami</p>
<p>The Convention contains provisions which state that health and medical care should be organised and administered locally on the basis of the special needs of the indigenous community and with respect for its traditional methods of preventive care and healing practices etc. In my opinion, if Sweden is to be able to comply fully with these undertakings, local health and medical care services in those parts of the country where the majority of the Sami live, should be planned in consultation with the Sami Parliament.</p>
<p>The implementation of the Convention</p>
<p>The Convention also covers a number of other areas apart from the ones mentioned here. According to the Convention all measures which affect indigenous peoples should be planned, carried out and evaluated in cooperation with them.</p>
<p>In order to coordinate different matters in the way stipulated in the Convention it will in my view, be necessary to set up a special department at the Government Offices with responsibility for Sami issues. The department's tasks should include collecting the viewpoints of the Sami people and coordinating measures in this field.</p>
<p>Implementation of the Convention in Norway</p>
<p>Norway was the first country to accede to the Convention. My assignment included considering how the Norwegian Government has interpreted the Convention with regard to the provisions concerning Sami rights to land. In conjunction with ratification, the Norwegian Government's assessment was that the Sami usufructuary right to land in Norway which applied at the time satisfied the conditions of the Convention. Later, the Samerettsutvalget, a commission of inquiry appointed by the Norwegian Government, came to a different conclusion, and the issue does not appear to have been finally resolved in Norway.</p>
<p>Arguments for and against Swedish accession</p>
<p>During the course of this inquiry arguments both for and against Swedish accession have emerged. There are several reasons for accession. The Government has expressed a desire to be able to ratify the Convention which is a matter of some importance for the indigenous people. Sweden has a long tradition of commitment to weak, disadvantaged groups and has acceded to all the key conventions which seek to protect minority groups, etc. In international terms respect for the traditional ways of life of the indigenous peoples of the world has grown in recent years. It is clear that the Sami should be given the opportunity to develop within the framework of their own culture. The Sami themselves recommend ratification by Sweden and have commented in highly unfavourable terms the injustice of a system in which they do not have full control over their own hunting and fishing rights.</p>
<p>The arguments against Swedish accession are founded primarily on the contentious situation which prevails with regard to the use of land in large sections of the reindeer breeding area.</p>
<p>In the course of my work I have been in contact with both landowners and representatives of local communities within the reindeer breeding area as well as representatives of the competent government authorities. A clear majority of these people stated that they are extremely dubious about Sweden's accession to the Convention if this means that the Sami land rights are strengthened. In their view, practical solutions can be found at the local level via negotiations between them and the Sami people.</p>
<p>Swedish accession in five years' time</p>
<p>As stated earlier, I have analysed the implications of the conditions of the Convention and taken a position on the measures that must be taken to make Swedish accession possible. I also studied the Norwegian experiences of practical implementation of the Convention. Finally, I weighed up the views of the Sami, landowners and other parties concerned.</p>
<p>In summary, my assessment is that Sweden can accede to the ILO Convention No. 169, but that this should not take place until a number of steps relating to the Sami right to land have been effected. According to my reckoning this process will take approximately five years. I have drawn up the guidelines for how a Swedish accession might proceed. · Firstly, the land to which the Sami have rights under the Convention must be identified. This applies both to land which the Sami occupy traditionally and to land which they traditionally are entitled to use together with others. In my opinion, a boundary commission should be set up with the task of addressing these issues. · Secondly, the scope of the Sami hunting and fishing rights on the land which they traditionally occupy must be clarified.</p>
<p>When these matters have been dealt with, other measures can be taken which are essential if the Sami people's rights are to reach the level stipulated in the Convention. This primarily involves the following measures. · Protection against restrictions on the Sami reindeer breeding rights should be strengthened. On lands which are traditionally occupied by the Sami they should be granted the right to transmit their hunting and fishing rights to others in exchange for payment. The Sami Parliament should be empowered to submit its views before areas of national interest for reindeer breeding are defined and before exploitation of such land is permitted. Explicit protection against exploitation of such land should be incorporated into the resource management provisions of the Environmental Code along with a provision giving the Sami Parliament the right to state its views before exploitation is permitted. · On land which the Sami traditionally use parallel with other groups increased protection against restrictions on reindeer breeding rights is needed. The Sami Parliament should have the right to state its opinions before areas of national interest for reindeer breeding are defined and before exploitation of such land is permitted. · Measures should be taken to ensure that the Sami have sufficient land to enable them to continue with reindeer breeding. The Sami may lose some lands which they use today for reindeer husbandry inter alia as a result of legal proceedings currently under way. · It should be possible to receive compensation from the state for legal costs incurred in connection with important cases of principle involving Sami land rights. The situation today means that there is a risk that the Sami cannot have their claims to land examined and clarified in the courts owing to lack of funds. · There is one more measure which I consider to be important in preparation for Swedish accession to the Convention. A national information campaign about the Sami as an indigenous people and about the Sami culture should be launched. Information clarifiying the implications of Swedish accession for all parties concerned is also needed.</p>
<p>I regard all of these measures to be necessary to enable Sweden to accede to the Convention. In my estimation, these measures will certainly reduce conflicts between the Sami and landowners and create better conditions for cooperation. Therefore, I recommend that officials should carefully consider whether these measures might be regarded as so important that they should be effected regardless of whether or not Sweden ratifies the Convention.</p>
<p>Naturally it is also very important to take steps to find mutually agreeable solutions and create a dialogue between the Sami and other land users in the reindeer breeding area. However, the ILO Convention contains no instruments indicating how conflicts between indigenous peoples and other groups should be solved. The Convention aims to safeguard the position of the indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>Naturally, the Sami must also be prepared to consider others who pursue economic activities in the reindeer breeding area. However, it was not part of my assignment to weigh the interest of the Sami people against those of other groups and put forward proposals for mutually agreeable solutions. My assignment was directed towards examining the measures necessary to enable Sweden to accede to the Convention.</p>
<p>The committee appointed by the Government to study policies for reindeer breeding has a further assignment pertaining to the relationship of reindeer breeding to other economic activities which require land. Its terms of reference state that the committee is to submit proposals for provisions designed to minimise conflicts between reindeer breeding and other land users in the reindeer breeding area. The committee should therefore be able to propose measures that will facilitate mutually agreeable solutions.</p>
<p>Costs</p>
<p>The measures that must be undertaken to enable Sweden to accede to the Convention entail certain costs.</p>
<p>In the first phase this would involve the boundary commission and a commission of inquiry to look into the scope of Sami hunting and fishing rights.</p>
<p>New rules providing strengthened protection against restrictions on the reindeer breeding rights will also entail more administrative costs, for the landowners, the Sami and the authorities. There will also be certain increases in costs for landowners and other land users since greater consideration will have to be taken to the reindeer breeding rights.</p>
<p>However, in the long term the measures suggested mean lower costs in certain areas. The work of the boundary commission will most probably lead to fewer legal processes and hence lower costs for disputes about the boundaries of the winter grazing lands. Other measures that reduce the conflicts between the Sami and other landowners will lead to lower costs for both the state, the Sami and the landowners.</p>
<p>Obviously, in the initial phase net costs will arise in connection with the package of measures suggested here. These costs should be financed by the allocation of additional funds to policies relating to the Sami and reindeer breeding. If resources are simply redistributed there is a risk that other measures being effected today in the framework of this policy would be undermined. In turn, this could result in a situation where Sweden would not be in a position to fulfil all undertakings according to the Convention.</p>
