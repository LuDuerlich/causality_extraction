<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>On 1 November 2008 the “More modern court proceedings” reform entered into force. The reform includes a modernisation of the legal proceedings in general courts and changes to the rules, primarily in the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure and the Court Matters Act (1996:242). The main purpose of the reform was to create a modern system of judicial procedure that meets the requirements for legally secure, efficient and effective processing of cases and matters.</p>
<p>We have been tasked with evaluating this reform. The Inquiry is to examine how the rules have worked in practice and whether the aims of the reform have been achieved. The main purpose of the evaluation is to determine whether the reform has led to the intended modernisation of the legal proceedings and whether the new system meets the requirements for legally secure, effective and efficient case processing.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s main task is to identify and analyse how the new rules have been applied by judges, parties and other actors in the proceedings and the impact of the reform on quality, efficiency, trust, and costs. The Inquiry is also required to examine how the reform has changed the working methods of different staff categories in the courts and of prosecutors, representatives, counsels, defence counsels and others. Furthermore, the evaluation is to identify factors that may prevent or limit the effective and efficient application of the procedural rules that the reform includes.</p>
<p>The Inquiry will therefore evaluate</p>
<p>• the use of modern technology in the courts,</p>
<p>• the rules that aim to make processing more flexible,</p>
<p>• the system of leave to appeal to the court of appeal, and</p>
<p>•  the new system of presenting evidence in the court of appeal.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has also been tasked with examining whether the reform has led to the parties more often requesting that civil cases in a district court be decided by three judges and to consider whether there is reason to amend the quorum rules.</p>
<h2>An evaluation of the reform General</h2>
<p>Our evaluation has found that the reform has had positive effects for individuals and other actors, as well as for the judicial system. The introduction of more modern technology in the courts has been an important part of the reform efforts. As a result of the reform, the judicial procedure is better able to be adapted to meet the requirements of the individual case. Greater consideration to injured parties and witnesses has been possible. The new appeals court proceedings have make it clear that the emphasis in the administration of justice lies on the court of first instance. This has created the conditions for smooth and legally secure appeals court proceedings.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has thus found that the reform has gone very well, both on an overall level and as regards its individual components. The reform has led to a modernisation of proceedings in the general courts. Processing has become more effective and more efficient. Quality has improved in various ways. The requirements of predictable and legally secure processing have not been disregarded.</p>
<h2>Modern technology</h2>
<p>The reform has led to increased use of modern technology in the courts. As a rule, examinations in the district court must be audiovisually recorded. Inspections may also be documented in this way. Parties and others taking part in a session are able to do so via a videoconference.</p>
<p>The new audio and visual recording technology has worked very well. The technical equipment is appropriate for its purpose. The recording quality is very high. Examinations are audiovisually recorded in all essentials and these recordings are used to a very great extent in appealed cases.</p>
<p>The introduction of the possibility of videoconferencing has also been very successful. This possibility has contributed to increasing accessibility and reduced the risk of hearings being cancelled. This has consequently led to more flexible and efficient processing. The technology has particularly facilitated the processing of very extensive cases, for example through the use of adjacent rooms and video links. The technology has also enabled the courts to be more considerate of parties and witnesses.</p>
<p>To take full advantage of the opportunities offered by modern technology, access to equipment in the courts should be improved so that the use of video conferencing can be further developed. Moreover, the transmission quality can be further enhanced.</p>
<h2>More flexible rules and more responsibility for the parties</h2>
<p>More uniform rules were introduced for preparatory hearings of civil cases and the parties’ responsibility for moving cases forward was emphasised. New rules were also introduced strengthening the obligation on courts to draw up summaries and time plans during the preparatory hearings. The application of the amended provisions has been successful. However, certain rules could be tightened further.</p>
<p>An important element of the reform was a relaxation of the requirement of oral testimony at trial. Parties may now present case material by referring to documents in the case. The provisions have been applied to a relatively large extent and have contributed to more flexible, rapid and efficient processing. In the view of the Inquiry, the reference method could be used to an even greater extent.</p>
<p>The report proposes extended opportunities both to take evidence outside a main hearing, and – where appropriate – to reuse previous court examinations that have been audiovisually recorded. This would make processing more flexible and efficient and ensure that legitimate consideration is given to the interests of victims and other people heard in a case.</p>
<p>The greater opportunities to hold preparatory sessions in criminal cases have been used to some extent, and have then proven to be of benefit to the proceedings. The possibility of deciding summary offences on the basis of documents in the case has proven to be a real success and has been applied extensively. The change means that, in these minor cases, those who want to have their case heard do not necessarily have to appear before a court to be heard.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has not found any statistically significant evidence to suggest that the parties are increasingly requesting that civil cases be decided by three judges. However, the Inquiry proposes a more nuanced quorum rule under which the district court has a quorum of one, two or three legally trained judges, depending on the scope and nature of the case.</p>
<h2>Appeals court proceedings</h2>
<p>The reform has extended the system of leave to appeal to cover all judgments and decisions in civil cases and court matters. The reform has also led to changes in the procedure for presenting oral evidence in the court of appeal. As a general rule, oral evidence is to be submitted by playing back the audiovisual recordings of the examinations in the district court. If further questions need to be asked, an additional examination is to be held.</p>
<p>Initially, leave to appeal to the court of appeal was too seldom granted. While the application has become more generous, it still varies between individual courts of appeal and is not yet considered to correspond to the level envisaged by the reform. It is essential that the appeal courts continuously follow up the application. The new procedure for presenting evidence in the court of appeal by playing back audiovisual recordings and holding additional examinations has proven to be successful.</p>
<p>The reform has also made it clear in practice that the focus in the procedure should rest with the body of first instance. The task of the court of appeal is review, and its processing has been adapted to its position in the court hierarchy. The functional division between the different levels in the organisation of the courts has been clarified. This has created the conditions for smooth, legally secure and efficient court proceedings.</p>
<p>The reform has had an impact on the Supreme Court’s role in establishing precedents. The report therefore presents proposals to improve the conditions for establishing precedents. The Inquiry emphasises the responsibility of the courts of appeal to ensure that cases involving precedent-setting issues be examined in detail.</p>
<h2>Proposals in brief</h2>
<p>The “More modern court proceedings” reform has thus been successful and can be further developed. The Inquiry therefore proposes certain new ideas and changes. In brief, the proposals are as follows.</p>
<p>• Inspections should be audiovisually recorded to a greater extent. In terms of credibility, audiovisual recordings of what was observed at an inspection should be considered on par with an inspection held again in the court of appeal.</p>
<p>• The court should be given greater opportunity to take evidence outside a main hearing in connection with a cancelled hearing. It should thus be possible to hold an examination with witnesses and other people to be heard in the case who presented themselves at a trial that is cancelled due to, for example, the failure of the defendant to attend.</p>
<p>• The court should be able to reuse to a greater extent examinations that have been audiovisually recorded in connection with another hearing in the same instance.</p>
<p>• Provisions requiring the court to draw up a summary of the proceedings during preparatory hearings of civil cases should be tightened.</p>
<p>• Provisions that enable parties to present case material by referring to documents in the case should be clarified so that they explicitly state that they also apply to audiovisual recordings.</p>
<p>• New provisions concerning the quorum of the district court in</p>
<p>civil cases should be introduced. As previously, at the main hearing in civil cases the district court should have a quorum of one legally qualified judge if 1) the parties agree to it and the court deems it sufficient, 2) the case is of a simple nature, or 3) the main hearing is held in a simplified form. Otherwise, the court should consist of two judges unless the case, because of its scope or nature, should be tried by three legally qualified judges.</p>
<p>• The provisions concerning the possibility for the court of appeal to decide certain criminal cases on the basis of the documents in the case should be relaxed somewhat.</p>
<p>• The provisions on the absence of a party from a main hearing in the court of appeal should be changed. If a party has been ordered to appear in person, the appeal should lapse if he or she only makes an appearance by proxy, unless there are special reasons why the appeal should not lapse.</p>
<p>• The court of appeal should be able to refer a precedent case to the Supreme Court within the framework of exemption review. The Supreme Court will be able to directly examine a precedent case when the court of appeal has refused leave to appeal, in other words without the Supreme Court first granting leave to appeal in the court of appeal.</p>
<p>• The Inquiry also raises a number of minor issues that have been highlighted during the course of its work and that relate to the activities of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the legislative amendments enter into force on 1 January 2014.</p>
