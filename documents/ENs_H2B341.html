<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Inquiry remit</h2>
<p>We have been instructed to present proposals on the design of active measures that will serve as effective means of preventing discrimination and promoting equal rights and opportunities. The remit has included proposing requirements for active measures that are clear and appropriate and analysing the relationship between the regulations we propose and other regulations.</p>
<p>In addition, we have received supplementary terms of reference instructing us to propose means of implementing the Riksdag announcement concerning wage surveys and action plans to promote equal pay for women and men (bet. 2012/13:AU10, rskr 2012/13:260).</p>
<p>Moreover, we have been asked to take a position on whether requirements concerning active measures should be accompanied by sanctions and, if we find that such sanctions should exist, to present proposals on the sanctions that should be introduced and how they should be put into effect. The remit has also included proposing means of supervising active measures and the relationship between such supervision and the work of other authorities in this area.</p>
<p>Finally, we have been asked to take a position on whether requirements concerning active measures should be extended to other areas of society and, if so, which.</p>
<h2>Starting points for the Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>Starting out from the existence of discrimination and from reflections on the impact assessments that have been made, we have found that employers and education providers should continue to be subject to statutory requirements to take active measures. In our assessment, the issue of whether regulations requiring active measures can fulfil the purpose of counteracting discrimination and promoting equal rights and opportunities is so complex that it is difficult to prove anything either way by studies of one kind or another. Ultimately it is a matter of influencing attitudes and it seems obvious to us that reducing discrimination and giving everyone equal rights and opportunities depends on the interaction of a range of factors in society. In our assessment, an obligation for employers and education providers to take active measures may be one factor leading to progress.</p>
<p>Our conclusion is therefore that statutory regulations on an obligation to take active measures continue to be warranted, even if this involves a certain administrative burden and other costs for the establishments that are subject to this obligation. Our assessment has been that the advantages of prevention and promotion work outweigh the disadvantages.</p>
<p>Our overall objective has been to present proposals on how active measures can be conducted so as to serve as an effective means of preventing discrimination and promoting equal rights and opportunities. The following is a summary of our deliberations and proposals concerning the issues raised in the Inquiry’s terms of reference.</p>
<h2>The Discrimination Act and the Education Act should contain regulations on active measures</h2>
<p>We have investigated and analysed the relationship between the regulations on active measures in the Discrimination Act and other acts, and also the relationship between the supervisory work of the Equality Ombudsman and supervision by other authorities. Against the backdrop of this analysis, we have proposed that the work on active measures in working life and higher education should continue to be regulated in the Discrimination Act.</p>
<p>With regard to regulations on active measures in establishments subject to the Education Act, we have proposed that these should be transferred from the Discrimination Act to the Education Act for the sake of effectiveness and ease of application.</p>
<p>Consequently, we take the term ‘education provider’ in Chapter 3 of the Discrimination Act to mean an entity engaged in education under the Higher Education Act (1992:1434) or education that can lead to a qualification under the Award of Certain Degrees Licensing Act (1993:792).</p>
<h2>The Discrimination Act</h2>
<h2>Work on active measures should encompass all grounds of discrimination</h2>
<p>Work on active measures is intended to supplement the prohibitions against discrimination that apply to the following grounds of discrimination: sex, transgender identity or expression, ethnicity, religion or other belief, disability, sexual orientation and age. For historical reasons, the regulations on active measures have not applied to all grounds of discrimination. With the amendment of the regulations that we propose, we see no obstacle to letting the obligation to engage in active measures encompass all seven grounds of discrimination. We therefore propose broadening the regulations to this effect.</p>
<h2>Definition of ‘active measures’</h2>
<p>We propose the introduction of a definition of the concept of ‘active measures’ stating that active measures are prevention and promotion measures aimed at preventing discrimination in a given establishment and serving in other ways to promote equal rights and opportunities regardless of sex, transgender identity or expression, ethnicity, religion or other belief, disability, sexual orientation or age.</p>
<h2>The work must be conducted methodically – systematic work on active measures</h2>
<p>Under current law, the obligation to take active measures is formulated so that the regulations state that measures must be taken in order to achieve certain objectives. However, the regulations say relatively little about which specific measures are to be taken. This makes the regulations unclear to those who have to apply them and difficult to supervise. We have considered and analysed how work on active measures can be conducted so as to fulfil the purpose of being an effective means of preventing discrimination and promoting equal rights and opportunities. Against the backdrop of these considerations, we propose that the current regulations essentially be replaced by an obligation to use a method directing the conduct of active measures – a systematic approach to active measures.</p>
<p>Systematic work on active measures, as described in our proposal, means that employers and education providers are to conduct prevention and promotion work  by - investigating  the existence of any risks of discrimination or reprisals or any other obstacles to individuals’ equal rights and opportunities in the establishment in question; - analysing  the causes of any risks and obstacles discovered; - taking  the prevention and promotion measures that can reasonably be demanded; and - monitoring and evaluating  the measures.</p>
<p>Under our proposal, an employer’s obligation to carry out a salary survey would be a part of the systematic work.</p>
<p>We propose that systematic work on active measures be implemented continuously and that measures be scheduled and implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<h2>Systematic work to be conducted in cooperation</h2>
<p>In our view, successful active measures depend on cooperation with employees and students. We therefore propose that the systematic work on active measures in working life continue to take place in cooperation between employers and employees. In the area of higher education, we propose the introduction of a similar obligation to cooperate.</p>
<p>Employers should also continue to be required to provide information to employee organisations to which they are bound by collective agreements. This obligation should be expanded compared with current law and, according to our proposal, will include providing such an organisation with the information needed to enable the organisation to engage in cooperation in this area.</p>
<h2>Scope of systematic work</h2>
<p>The scope of systematic work should be specified in the act. We propose that employers  be required to conduct systematic work on active measures concerning the establishment’s - working conditions, - rules and practice regarding pay and other terms of employment, - recruitment and promotion, - training and other skills development, and - possibility of reconciling gainful employment and parenthood.</p>
<p>In addition, we propose that employers be required to have guidelines and routines for their establishment to prevent harassment, sexual harassment and reprisals referred to in Chapter 2, Section 18. We also propose that employers be required to promote gender balance in different types of work, among different categories of employees and in management positions, by means of training, skills development and other appropriate measures. The measures indicated in the Act are to be taken irrespective of any risks and obstacles revealed by the investigation included in the systematic work.</p>
<p>In the higher education area, we propose that the education provider  be required to conduct systematic work on active measures concerning the establishment’s - recruitment and admissions procedures, - methods and organisation of education, - examinations and assessments of students’ performance, - educational environment, and - possibilities of reconciling studies with parenthood.</p>
<p>We also propose that education providers be required to have guidelines and routines to prevent harassment and sexual harassment.</p>
<h2>Salary survey to be part of systematic work and conducted every year</h2>
<p>Under our proposal, the rules on salary surveys would remain largely unchanged. However, salary surveys would become part of the systematic work on active measures. In light of the Riksdag’s announcement, we propose that a salary survey be conducted every year .</p>
<p>We also propose that the analysis of pay differentials that employers are already required to conduct should be extended to refer to differences between categories of employees who perform work that is, or is generally considered to be, mainly women’s work and categories of employees who perform work that is considered of lower value as regards the demands of the work but who receive higher pay than the former category.</p>
<h2>Plan requirement to be replaced by documentation requirement</h2>
<p>Working life</p>
<p>Under current law, an employer with 25 or more employees at the beginning of the current calendar year is required to draw up two plans every third year: a gender equality plan and an action plan for equal pay. We propose that these two plans be replaced by a requirement that the systematic work be documented in its entirety each year . The documentation does not need to be collected into a plan and should be seen as support for the systematic work.</p>
<p>We propose that the documentation contain an account of all parts of the systematic work concerning the areas indicated in the Act. The documentation should also contain an account of how the statutory obligation to cooperate is fulfilled. Since the documentation we require will replace the action plan for equal pay, the documentation must also include the findings and analysis of the salary survey, a description of the pay adjustments and other measures that need to be taken to achieve equal pay for work that can be regarded as equal or of equal value, a cost estimate and timetable based on the goal that necessary pay adjustments should be implemented as soon as possible and within three years at the latest, and an account and evaluation of the implementation of planned measures in the previous year.</p>
<p>The obligation to document the systematic work in its entirety will apply, under our proposal, to employers who employed 25 or more workers as of the beginning of the current calendar year. Employers who employed between 10 and 24 workers as of the beginning of the current calendar year will come under the parts of the documentation requirement concerning salary surveys. Our proposal that employers who employ between 10 and 24 workers are to document their work on salary surveys represents a broadening of scope compared with current law.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>Under current law, education providers are to document their work on active measures in an annual equal treatment plan. We propose removing the plan requirement but continuing to require education providers to document their work on active measures in writing every year. As in the area of working life, the documentation must contain an account of all parts of the systematic work concerning the areas indicated in the Act and a description of how the obligation to cooperate is fulfilled.</p>
<h2>Regulations to be binding</h2>
<p>Under our proposal, the Act will state how work on active measures is to be conducted, i.e. it will indicate a working method. However, in the main the proposal does not indicate specific measures to be taken. In our view, it should not be possible to enter into agreements that remove the obligation to apply the indicated method and document the work. However, a more detailed plan for conducting the systematic investigation, analysis and follow-up efforts will need to be provided, preferably by means of collective agreement regulations. Achieving this, however, does not require that the regulations allow differing rules in collective agreements. In view of our proposals on the design of the regulations, we therefore propose that the regulations concerning systematic work on active measures should be binding.</p>
<h2>Equality Ombudsman to be supervisory authority for regulations in the Discrimination Act</h2>
<p>Our assessment is that the regulations on active measures should be subject to monitoring supervision with an ultimate possibility of sanctions.</p>
<p>We propose that the Equality Ombudsman be the supervisory authority exercising supervision of compliance with the Discrimination Act’s regulations on active measures, and that the Act explicitly state that as part of its supervisory activities, the Equality Ombudsman will provide advice and guidance.</p>
<p>We also propose the introduction of a definition of the concept of supervision in the Discrimination Act. For the purposes of the Discrimination Act, ‘supervision’ will mean an independent review aimed at checking that the establishments reviewed fulfil the requirements ensuing from laws and other regulations. This supervision will include taking decisions on measures that may be needed to ensure that those running the establishments correct failings revealed by the review. However, the Ombudsman should still try in the first instance to induce those to whom the Act applies to comply with it voluntarily.</p>
<p>The success of the regulations we propose depends in part on the Equality Ombudsman having resources to exercise effective supervision. In our assessment, the Equality Ombudsman will need additional resources for supervision in order to conduct effective supervision.</p>
<h2>Financial penalties to be kept as form of sanction</h2>
<p>With regard to the sanctions attached to the regulations, we propose that the possibility of imposing a financial penalty remain an available recourse. Consequently, if the employer or education provider does not comply with the regulations concerning systematic work on active measures or an employer does not fulfil the information requirement, the ordering and imposition of a financial penalty will continue to be an available recourse. It will be possible to order establishments that do not meet the documentation requirement to fulfil this obligation subject to a financial penalty.</p>
<p>A financial penalty order will also remain an available recourse for use against the State as an employer or entity responsible for educational establishments.</p>
<h2>Equality Ombudsman to be empowered to issue financial penalty orders and Board against Discrimination to be abolished</h2>
<p>Currently, the right to issue a financial penalty order for failings in the obligation to take active measures rests with the Board against Discrimination. We propose that the Board be abolished and the Equality Ombudsman instead be empowered to issue financial penalty orders concerning the obligation to conduct systematic work on active measures. The Equality Ombudsman will also still be able to require a person subject to the regulations on active measures to provide information that may be of importance for supervision, subject to a financial penalty.</p>
<p>Under our proposal, a decision of the Equality Ombudsman ordering a financial penalty will be subject to appeal to an administrative court. Appeal to the Administrative Court of Appeal will only be allowed if leave to appeal has been granted.</p>
<h2>Central employee organisations to be entitled to apply for a financial penalty order</h2>
<p>Under current law, central employee organisations have a subsidiary right in certain cases to apply to the Board against Discrimination for a financial penalty order to be issued. That right will disappear when the Board is abolished. We therefore propose that a central employee organisation to which an employer has binding commitments under a collective agreement be entitled to apply instead to the Equality Ombudsman for a financial penalty order to be issued against an employer that fails to comply with the regulations on active measures contained in the Act. Upon application, the Ombudsman will then examine whether to issue a financial penalty order.</p>
<p>We also propose that central employee organisations be entitled to appeal against decisions taken by the Equality Ombudsman following an application from an organisation.</p>
<h2>The Education Act</h2>
<h2>All work on active measures in establishments subject to the Education Act to be regulated in the Education Act and Swedish Schools Inspectorate to be supervisory authority</h2>
<p>As stated above, the obligation to conduct work on active measures to counteract discrimination and promote children’s and pupils’ equal rights and opportunities in establishments subject to the Education Act will be regulated by the Education Act instead of the Discrimination Act, and will be coordinated with efforts to combat degrading treatment. An amendment of the introductory section of Chapter 6 of the Education Act, which defines the purpose of the provisions in the chapter, is therefore proposed so as state that the purpose of the chapter, apart from combating degrading treatment of children and pupils, is to promote their equal rights and opportunities regardless of sex, transgender identity or expression, ethnicity, religion or other belief, disability or age. With regard to establishments subject to the Education Act as well, the regulations will be broadened to encompass all grounds of discrimination. The reason is the same as for the regulations in the Discrimination Act.</p>
<p>The Swedish Schools Inspectorate will be the supervisory authority concerning the obligation to engage in active measures under the Education Act.</p>
<h2>Systematic quality management to include work on active measures</h2>
<p>We propose that the work on active measures in establishments subject to the Education Act be conducted systematically just like corresponding work under the Discrimination Act. The Education Act already indicates a method, namely, the systematic quality management regulated by Chapter 4 of the Act. We therefore propose that all work on active measures be part of systematic quality management. The Act will state that the responsible entity is to ensure that in every individual establishment, prevention and promotion work is conducted to combat degrading treatment of children and pupils, to combat discrimination against children and pupils, and in other ways to promote their equal rights and opportunities regardless of sex, transgender identity or expression, ethnicity, religion or other belief, disability or age, and prevent their being subjected to reprisals.</p>
<p>As in the Discrimination Act, we propose that the Education Act should state that the responsible entity is to implement systematic quality management of active measures by identifying  risks and obstacles, analysing  the causes of any risks and obstacles discovered, taking the prevention and promotion measures  that can reasonably be demanded and monitoring and evaluating  the measures. The measures are to be scheduled and implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Systematic quality management also includes conducting active and general promotion measures in the establishment, regardless of any risks and obstacles discovered.</p>
<h2>Systematic quality management of active measures to involve children and pupils</h2>
<p>Already now, systematic quality management at unit level in the school system is implemented with the involvement of teachers, preschool teachers, other staff and pupils. Preschool children and their parents and guardians and pupils’ parents and guardians must be given the opportunity to participate in the work. Under our proposal, systematic quality management of active measures will apply to all establishments subject to the Education Act and we therefore propose that the regulations on cooperation be amended so as to direct that work on active measures is to be carried out with similar involvement.</p>
<h2>Systematic quality management of active measures to be documented in an equal treatment plan</h2>
<p>We propose that the responsible entity ensure that the systematic quality management of active measures is documented annually in a special plan, the equal treatment plan, for each establishment.</p>
<p>The equal treatment plan is to contain an account of all parts of the systematic quality management of active measures, a timetable, an account and evaluation of the implementation of measures planned in the previous year, and an account of procedures for involvement and participation.</p>
<h2>Implementation provisions</h2>
<p>We consider that our proposal on amendments to the Discrimination Act should be supplemented by regulations, or at least general advice. In our assessment, given the nature of the regulations that could be required, the Government could issue them in the form of implementation provisions, by virtue of the Instrument of Government. In our view, it could be reasonable, after authorisation by the Government, for the regulations to be issued by the expert authority that is best acquainted with the practical dimensions of these issues. Against this backdrop, we propose an information provision in the Act stating that the Government or the authority designated by the Government may, by virtue of Chapter 8, Article 7 of the Instrument of Government, issue more detailed regulations on the systematic work on active measures, cooperation and documentation.</p>
<p>If the Government concludes that the Equality Ombudsman should be empowered to issue implementation provisions concerning the systematic work on active measures in the Discrimination Act, in our view it should be considered whether the National Agency for Education should be given a corresponding right to issue regulations concerning establishments subject to the Education Act.</p>
<h2>Other areas of society</h2>
<p>In our assessment, the systematic work on active measures should be evaluated before any future expansion to encompass other areas of society.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>In our impact assessment we present the consequences that we expect to follow from our proposal. Our proposal mainly focuses on making the work more systematic and finding a method for work that is largely already required today. Our assessment, in light of this, is that our proposal will lead to more effective promotion work, not least by adapting it to the establishments concerned. This should lead to positive outcomes both for employers and education providers, and for employees and students.</p>
<p>Our proposals should be positive for gender equality, equal treatment, integration, and so on. They should also help make the working or educational situation of groups covered by any of the grounds of discrimination easier, or make it easier for them to enter the labour market.</p>
