<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Inquiry and its remit</h2>
<p>On 10 July 2003, the Government adopted the terms of reference for a government inquiry to review the Swedish military equipment legislation (ToR 2003:80). Anders Svärd, Adviser to the Ministry of Defence and member of the Defence Commission, was appointed to chair the inquiry. The inquiry has adopted the name KRUT (KRigsmaterielUTredningen).</p>
<p>The remit of the inquiry has been to conduct a broad though not comprehensive review of the Swedish regulations on exports of military equipment – the Act, the Ordinances and the Guidelines – and of the organisation for their implementation. The remit has also included an investigation into the need for regulations concerning imports and technical assistance. The current regulatory framework was drawn up at the end of the 1980s and entered into force on 1 January 1993.</p>
<p>The remit has been formulated in the context of the changes that have taken place in recent times in the areas of foreign, security and defence policy, changes that have led both the development, manufacturing and acquisition of defence equipment, and export controls, to increasingly become matters for international cooperation. The remit has also been formulated in light of the organisational reform that occurred in 1996 and that led to the examination of export licence applications being delegated from government to agency level.</p>
<p>The inquiry has carried out its work with the active participation of three advisers and eight experts and has been supported by a secretary. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Industry, Employment and Communications have each contributed an adviser. The experts have come from the Ministry of Justice, the Defence Matériel Administration, the Swedish Defence Research Agency, the Swedish National Defence</p>
<p>College, the National Inspectorate of Strategic Products (ISP), the Swedish Armed Forces, the Association of Swedish Defence Industries and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Stakeholders other than those who have been directly represented in the inquiry – the members of the Export Control Council, private companies and non-governmental organisations – have also been consulted in the course of the work. In addition, the inquiry has gathered information about export control issues in other countries by means of correspondence and visits. The website www.sou.gov.se/krut has served as an interface with the general public.</p>
<h2>Swedish export control in context</h2>
<p>The inquiry has identified factors that have changed since the current regulatory framework was developed. The results have been used as a starting point for the review of the regulations. The factors of change are summarised below.</p>
<p>• Since the end of the Cold War, Sweden has gradually expanded its participation in European and transatlantic cooperation structures. Exports as well as manufacturing and development of defence equipment have become important areas of cooperation. There is now no contradiction between  non-participation in military alliances and participation in these structures.</p>
<p>• Sweden has abandoned its previous aspiration to be selfsufficient in terms of defence equipment. Given developments in the threat picture, Swedish independence as regards equipment is neither necessary nor economically feasible. Instead, Sweden must share the costs of development and manufacturing with other countries.</p>
<p>• Sweden is participating in a number of intergovernmental projects concerning the development, manufacturing or acquisition of defence equipment. At corporate level there are numerous cooperative ventures with other countries, which vary in depth and nature. There is significant foreign ownership of the defence industry in Sweden. Meanwhile defence companies’ operations are becoming increasingly international and exportoriented as demand from the Swedish defence establishment declines.</p>
<p>• Sweden and the five other largest  arms-producing countries in the EU make up the “six nations cooperation” (FA/LoI), the aim of which is to facilitate the restructuring and operation of the European defence industry. The rules that have been agreed on are intended to simplify and guarantee deliveries between participants in individual cooperation projects. There are special rules for resolving questions relating to the export of jointly developed equipment to third countries.</p>
<p>• The future defence of states and their involvement in international missions create a need for continued defence equipment acquisitions, even if in smaller quantities than previously. The EU has established a common Defence Agency. The agency began its work in 2004 and has a broad mandate including research, acquisition, marketing issues and capabilities development.</p>
<p>• The EU is developing increasingly close cooperation on export controls. Sweden has adopted the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports and is working for its further development. The Code contains eight groups of criteria to be observed in  national-level examination of export licence applications, along with an undertaking to exchange notification of licence denials, etc.</p>
<p>• As the world’s leading producer of defence equipment, the United States has an influence on Swedish companies that use American technology or attempt to win part of the US market. This dependence puts pressure on Sweden to meet US demands regarding both security of supply and  re-exportation of technology to third countries.</p>
<p>• The concept of “export” is becoming broader. The question of conceivable export markets is sometimes already discussed when entering into cooperation agreements. In addition, it is becoming more common for companies to sell functions rather than isolated products. These functions can include  multi-year commitments on updates of software and hardware, as well as maintenance measures. Counterpurchases are becoming more common in large transactions, as are export subsidies.</p>
<p>• The dividing line between military and civil spheres has become less  clear-cut. Military technology is being spun off to civil sectors of society and conversely civil applications are being used by the defence industry. In addition, industrial cooperation, research programmes and security cooperation are being established for products with both military and civil areas of application, with a view to generating synergies and lowering costs.</p>
<p>• Non-proliferation, which has long been an objective of international cooperation on export controls, has come to focus on dubious regimes and non-state actors such as international criminal syndicates and terrorists. The threat from the latter category in particular has led to tighter regulations and has been a driver for enhanced cooperation on export controls.</p>
<h2>Switch to the concept ”defence equipment”</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the concept of “krigsmateriel” (literally ”war materiel” but now often translated as ”military equipment”) should be replaced by “försvarsmateriel” (“defence equipment”) in Swedish legislation. Defence equipment is a more modern concept, which is used alongside military equipment in export contexts and is an established term in the security and defence policy areas. In Swedish public administration, the determinant krigs- (“war”) has generally given way to försvars- (“defence”). Krigsmakten (the Swedish military), for example, has become Försvarsmakten (the Swedish defence, officially known in English as the Swedish Armed Forces). The modern equivalent of the Inspectorate of Military Equipment is the National Inspectorate of Strategic Products. The most recent defence policy bills talk about exports of defence equipment.</p>
<p>Defence equipment is also a more correct concept than military equipment technically speaking, since the products concerned are now used, and usable, in applications that have nothing to do with warfare or are not traditionally military, for example, in the civilian sector of national defence and in international humanitarian missions. In the longer term, this development is expected to be reinforced by changes in the threat picture, combined with states being more rarely willing to pay for the development and acquisition of equipment that can only be used in one type of activity. It is not anticipated that the proposal will lead to any increase or decrease in the number of products for which a licence is required.</p>
<h2>Switch to the EU common list</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the Swedish military equipment list should be replaced by the EU list, a revised version of which was adopted in November 2003 (2003/C 314/01) and is intended for use in association with the EU Code of Conduct when considering applications for export licences. The reason for having a common list is that the differences between the national lists act as an obstacle to harmonised application of the Code.</p>
<p>In the view of the inquiry, in the long run a switch to the EU list would both simplify the classification of products by the ISP and make it easier to exchange information with the other Member States. The European list uses a slightly different system of classification and does not differentiate between military equipment for use in combat and other military equipment. It is not anticipated, however, that this will lead to any increase or decrease in the number of products for which a licence is required.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, part C of the Swedish military equipment list, which enumerates chemical substances, will continue to be used so that the obligation to declare such substances will continue in future to be clearly indicated in the Ordinance.</p>
<h2>Organisational development</h2>
<p>The inquiry has evaluated the organisation of Swedish export controls, above all the division of responsibilities and work between the Government, the Riksdag (Parliament), the ISP and the Export Control Council. This evaluation has involved a study of the regulatory framework, interviews with individuals working in different parts of the organisation and comparisons with how other countries organise their export controls. The assessment comes to the conclusion that the Swedish organisation is well suited to its purpose and works well in all essential respects. Key observations underlying the inquiry’s assessment are listed below.</p>
<p>• Neither the Government nor individual ministers can formally be held responsible by the Riksdag for individual decisions taken by the ISP. However, the Government can be called to account if the Inspectorate fails to follow the line approved by the Riksdag when examining applications and if the Government fails to take measures in such a situation.</p>
<p>• Over and above its role as legislator, the Riksdag has expressed its support for the Guidelines. The submission of an annual report on exports gives the Riksdag an opportunity to monitor the implementation of policy. Parliamentary interpellations are another vehicle at the Riksdag’s disposal. The influence exercised by the representatives of the parties in the Riksdag via the Export Control Council gives the decisions of the ISP added legitimacy.</p>
<p>• The purpose of the 1996 delegation reform was to relieve the Government of business of an administrative nature. It can be said that this purpose has been achieved. The Government has made the final decision in 15 cases since 1996, as against some three thousand every year before the reform.</p>
<p>• The way in which applications are examined is not considered to have undergone any substantial change as a result of delegation, which was an important precondition for the reform. As far as the inquiry can judge, the decisions taken by the ISP have followed the line indicated in the Guidelines and in policy documents.</p>
<p>• The ISP should continue to occupy an independent position  vis-à-vis the Government, in accordance with the Swedish model of public administration. The Government’s policy instruments – instructions and appropriation directions, but also the right to issue additional regulations concerning the referral of applications to the Government – together allow necessary control over the Inspectorate.</p>
<p>• The Export Control Council has been able to exercise its advisory role and has influenced the ISP’s decisions. The Council has also been able to exercise its function as an observing body. It should be noted that in international terms, Sweden is unique in having a council composed of representatives of the parties in parliament with a mandate like that of the Export Control Council.</p>
<p>• The organisation and the regulatory framework enable effective control and governance of the defence industry’s exportoriented operations. The role of the ISP is to serve as control agency and licence application examiner and in this connection to provide service to companies in practical matters associated with the licensing process.</p>
<p>The evaluation made by the inquiry of the organisation of Swedish export controls has not found any reasons for proposing any change in the general situation. Nonetheless, there is scope for improvement and continued organisational development. The most important proposals are summarised below.</p>
<p>Extension of the ISP’s institutional memory</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the ISP, as a stage in extending its institutional memory, should document the deliberations behind decisions on applications that have been subject to consultation with the Export Control Council. Documentation is valuable in enabling the Inspectorate and the Government to follow developments in the application of the Guidelines over time.</p>
<p>Notification of denials in accordance with the EU Code of Conduct</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that Sweden’s undertaking in the EU context to notify other Member States when Sweden denies an export application, or cancels a previously issued licence, should be written into the ISP’s instructions. This would consolidate existing practice and clarify in what situations other Member States must be informed of a denial.</p>
<p>New requirements for decision-making background information</p>
<p>An equipment-specific approach places new demands on the background information on which to base decisions on applications. The inquiry proposes that the ISP should deepen its cooperation with the Government Offices, government agencies and intelligence services so as to obtain information about alternative areas of use and the intentions of the recipient. The ISP’s visits abroad – for the purpose of studying the prospective recipient’s export controls and to verify that the equipment remains in the possession of the end-user – should be developed.</p>
<p>Need for an integrated approach for export control assistance (outreach)</p>
<p>There is scope for increased coordination and planning of Swedish export control assistance. By way of proposal, the support may focus on new EU countries that are recipients of Swedish equipment. The support should concentrate on the application of regulations, including cooperation between government agencies and industry. The possibility of involving expertise from the Swedish defence industry should be made use of. The proposal aims to increase the long-term dimension of assistance measures.</p>
<p>Maintenance of the division of roles in international export control cooperation</p>
<p>The delegation of licence application examination to the ISP has consequences for how Sweden is represented in international export control cooperation. Often both government and ISP officials are required to take part in meetings and maintain their own networks. For the sake of coordinated Swedish action at international level it is important that the division of roles set in ordinances and appropriation directions is maintained. There should be early, structured coordination ahead of meetings at international level, giving consideration to the experience and views of all officials concerned.</p>
<p>Strategy for consultation will make the Export Control Council more effective</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the Export Control Council depends on the ability of its members to evaluate and take a position on the background information that is made available before and during meetings. The inquiry proposes that the ISP, in dialogue with the members of and advisers to the Council, should elaborate a strategy for further developing the process of consultation. Such a strategy could cover both practical issues, such as the volume and presentation of material, and a plan for deepening members’ knowledge of export control issues.</p>
<h2>Modernisation and further development of the Guidelines</h2>
<p>Decisions in every single case concerning exports or international cooperation are preceded in Sweden by an examination. Since the 1950s, Guidelines have guided the positions taken on the appropriateness of recipient or cooperation states. The Guidelines have evolved by means of textual revision and practical developments. The current Guidelines for military equipment exports and other collaboration with foreign countries were elaborated in the late 1980s and came into effect in 1993.</p>
<p>In its review of the current Guidelines, the inquiry has found that these should be further developed and modernised so as to retain their usefulness as a guidance document when taking political positions. The inquiry’s proposals are based in part on the observations below.</p>
<p>• In Sweden, exports and international cooperation involving defence equipment are subject to regulation and licence requirements. All decisions on export and cooperation applications are preceded by an examination. The companies or individuals that follow the regulations and whose applications are assessed positively receive a licence from the ISP. About a thousand export licences are issued each year.</p>
<p>• Security and defence policy motives for permitting exports and cooperation persist and have grown stronger as a result of Sweden’s augmented participation in European and transatlantic cooperation and the abandonment of the aspiration to be  self-sufficient in terms of defence equipment. Continued development of the hi-tech skills possessed by the defence industry, which benefit other industries as well, are an additional reason to allow cooperation and exports.</p>
<p>• The foreign policy reasons for denying licences for exports and cooperation persist and have also undergone further development. This is a result, not least, of international cooperation on export controls. When the European Code of Conduct for Arms Exports was adopted in 1998, this gave Sweden a number of additional principles and criteria to take into account when considering whether to grant a licence. There have also been developments in the rules of international public law that have been significant for the defence equipment area.</p>
<p>• The development of practical routines has been determined by the adaptation of the Guidelines by the Government and the</p>
<p>ISP to contemporary foreign, security and defence policies and to the specific circumstances in each case. The inquiry notes, among other things, that in practice developments have entailed that weight is given not only to the identity of the intended recipient state but also to the areas of use for the equipment.</p>
<p>• The structure and language of the current Guidelines do not meet present requirements. The overlapping principles, absolute and conditional obstacles to exports, positive and negative presumptions concerning different countries and different types of equipment, add up to a combination that is extremely demanding for anyone wanting to understand which rules apply.</p>
<p>Proposed Guidelines</p>
<p>Principles</p>
<p>Licences for exports and international cooperation involving defence equipment will be granted when there are foreign and security policy, defence policy or industrial policy reasons for doing so and provided there is no conflict with the principles and objectives of Sweden’s foreign policy or international obligations. This applies in particular when an application concerns an EU Member State, Norway, Switzerland, the United States or other states with which Sweden desires to strengthen its cooperation in the defence equipment area.</p>
<p>Sweden must fulfil its international obligations and undertakings in the area of export controls and must work internationally to promote effective export controls. When a licence application is examined, attention must be paid to any risk of the equipment being used for internal repression or of it being harmful to peace, security, stability or sustainable development.</p>
<p>When a licence application is examined, attention must be paid to the existence of any intergovernmental agreement that includes security of supply guarantees for the equipment in question or a clear connection with a previously approved supply of a system or subsystem. If this is the case a licence should be granted, provided that this does not conflict with Sweden’s international obligations.</p>
<p>Cooperation agreements must give Sweden the possibility of consulting with the state or states concerned in the cooperation regarding exports to third countries of jointly produced equipment. In connection with such consultations, a balanced assessment will be made of the national interest of cooperation, demands for responsible export controls and the significance of the Swedish contribution to the coming into being of the equipment.</p>
<p>On the basis of the principles just stated, the following criteria must be applied when granting licences.</p>
<p>Criteria</p>
<p>A licence may only be granted if the intended recipient or cooperation partner is: a state; a central government agency; an approved company; an intergovernmental organisation that intends to use the equipment concerned in a peace-support operation; a legal person or individual who is acquiring the equipment concerned for a museum or similar non-military purpose.</p>
<p>A licence should not be granted if there is a clear risk that the equipment concerned may be used by a different end-user than the one indicated or re-exported without Sweden’s consent. Before equipment leaves the country an end-user certificate or an own production declaration should be presented.</p>
<p>A licence must not be granted if the intended export or cooperation conflicts with an embargo decided on by the UN Security Council, the EU or the OSCE. Nor may a licence be granted if the equipment concerned is prohibited under international public law. International obligations relating to weapons of mass destruction and undertakings under multilateral export control regimes must be fulfilled.</p>
<p>A licence should not be granted if in the course of the past three years an EU Member State has denied the intended recipient an essentially identical transaction with reference to the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports. Should there nevertheless be reasons to grant an export, Sweden must first consult with the Member State concerned and then explain the reasons why a licence application may be approved.</p>
<p>Account must be taken of respect for human rights in the intended recipient or cooperation state. A licence must not be granted if there is a clear risk of the equipment concerned being used for internal repression. Special caution must be exercised when the application concerns a state where serious violations of human rights have been established.</p>
<p>Account must be taken of consequences for peace, security and stability. A licence should not be granted if there is a clear risk of the intended recipient or cooperation state using the equipment concerned for purposes other than legitimate security and defence purposes. Special attention must be given in the assessment to any risk that the intended export may impair the security of any EU Member State or other friendly state.</p>
<p>Account must be taken of the behaviour of the intended recipient or cooperation state with regard to the international community. A licence must not be granted for a state that supports terrorism or international organised crime. Account must also be taken of whether the state in question respects international humanitarian law in armed conflicts, is committed to non-proliferation and other forms of international arms control and disarmament and reports to the UN Register of Conventional Arms.</p>
<p>Account must be taken of consequences for the economic and technical development of the intended recipient or cooperation country. A licence should not be granted if there is an obvious risk that the export or cooperation would seriously hamper sustainable development. The right of states to self-defence and potential participation in international peace-support operations must be taken into account at the same time.”</p>
<p>Comments on more important proposals for change</p>
<p>In the proposal, licences are not made conditional on any need on the part of the Swedish Armed Forces. It is a necessary condition for the continued ability of the defence industry in Sweden to restructure and develop its expertise that the companies are also able to export products that the Swedish defence is compelled to reject on grounds of priority or does not intend to acquire. The inquiry also finds that because of defence equipment cooperation within the EU, it is neither meaningful nor even desirable to make licences conditional on specifically Swedish needs.</p>
<p>The criteria in the EU Code of Conduct have been integrated into the Swedish criteria. As the inquiry, after thorough deliberation, has chosen to integrate rather than replace criteria, the proposal contains new wordings in some areas. It is above all the operative provisions of the criteria in the Code that have been introduced into the Guidelines. Criteria found in the Code but not in the current Guidelines have been integrated, including the criteria concerning sustainable development and terrorism.</p>
<p>Industrial policy is given as a further reason for being able to grant a licence. This does not mean that employment or regional policy aspects are to be taken into account. There may, however, be reason to grant licences for the sake of promoting technological development in the defence industry, particularly in view of the defence industry’s role in generating new technology. Numerous civilian products and technologies have been successfully spun off from the military industry.</p>
<p>The different presumptions for military equipment for combat and other military equipment have been replaced in the inquiry’s proposal by the type of equipment-specific approach prescribed in the EU Code of Conduct. This approach entails that when an application is examined, not only is consideration given to the identity of the recipient country but a position is also taken on how the equipment concerned will be used by the end-user.</p>
<p>The provision that Sweden, in the event of the Government declaring the country neutral with respect to a conflict, must not export to the warring parties has been removed. This provision has never been used and in view of Sweden’s commitment to European cooperation it is becoming less and less likely that it will be put to use in the foreseeable future. Even if the provision has been removed from the Guidelines, it retains its validity.</p>
<p>The proposal reflects the relevance of the rules of international public law. International public law contains prohibitions of use and other regulations against certain types of ammunition, incendiary weapons, mines and blinding laser weapons.</p>
<p>In the proposal, the Guidelines are divided into principles and criteria. The purpose is to give the Guidelines a simpler structure, which will also make it easier to discuss and refer to individual provisions. The intention is also to make it easier for members of the public to identify the considerations on which decisions are based. Just as is now the case, certain applications will be relatively easy to decide on, while others will require extensive examination and consultation with the Export Control Council.</p>
<p>The United States has been added to the group of countries for which there are in principle foreign, security and defence policy reasons for exports and cooperation. This is motivated by Sweden’s substantial dependence on US technology and the aspiration to strengthen cooperation in the defence equipment area.</p>
<p>The fact that effective export controls in one country can be foiled by inadequate export controls in another country is underlined by pointing out that Sweden has a responsibility to work for effective export controls even outside the country’s borders. This addition ties in with the inquiry’s proposal in the section on organisation, concerning the possibilities of further coordinating and planning different assistance initiatives in the area (outreach).</p>
<p>The guidelines concerning “follow-on deliveries” and transfers within cooperation based on a state-to-state agreement are brought together in a new paragraph on security of supply. Given the increased importance of cooperation and exports as means of maintaining defence industry expertise, the need to be able to offer security of supply is expected to increase. Guarantees regarding security of supply must not, however, be an acceptable argument if exports or cooperation would conflict with international obligations.</p>
<p>The current guidelines concerning exports to third countries of products developed in cooperation, which are based on the feasibility of determining whether the product is Swedish or foreign in its identity, have been replaced by a guideline that assumes consultation with the states with which Sweden is cooperating. The reason for this is that at present there is no satisfactory method for determining the identity of products developed jointly with other countries. Future products will be multi-national.</p>
<p>The requirement that the Government confer with the Advisory Council on Foreign Affairs on ”foreign affairs that are of major significance” is written into the Constitution. There is therefore no need to regulate this in the Guidelines.</p>
<p>Agreement between the Act and the Guidelines</p>
<p>The Guidelines are anchored in the Military Equipment Act (1992:1300), in that the first two conditions in the Guidelines are summarised by Section 1, second paragraph of the Act. The need to tie the Guidelines to the legislation arose as a result of the delegation of the examination of applications to agency level in 1996. In order to harmonise with the inquiry’s proposal concerning the Guidelines, the relevant provision should be amended as follows:</p>
<p>Present wording</p>
<p>Licences under this Act may only  be granted for  security policy and defence policy reasons and provided there is no conflict with Sweden’s foreign policy.</p>
<p>Proposed wording</p>
<p>Licences under this Act may be granted when there are foreign and  security policy, defence policy or industrial  policy reasons for doing so and  provided there is no conflict with the principles and objectives of</p>
<p>Sweden’s foreign policy or international obligations.</p>
<p>When foreign and security policy is mentioned for the first time, the reference is to reasons to grant licences for individual countries. The purpose of adding ”principles and objectives” is to clarify that at this point what is involved is not Sweden’s foreign policy towards individual countries but rather values. The addition of the words ”or international obligations” clarifies Sweden’s duty to respect arms embargos, international public law and similar arrangements. The arguments for adding “industrial policy reasons” are presented above. The removal of the word ”only” does not imply any change in the licence requirement.</p>
<h2>Extended control and clarification</h2>
<p>In its review of the Swedish regulatory framework for export controls on military equipment, the inquiry has found that there is a need to extend official controls in certain respects and to clarify certain provisions. The following sections summarise proposals and deliberations regarding imports, provision of technical assistance abroad, and supplies and sales of hunting and competition firearms to other countries.</p>
<p>Licence requirement for imports of defence equipment</p>
<p>The inquiry has considered the need to regulate imports of defence equipment and has found that a licence requirement for individuals and companies would help prevent undesired proliferation in the country and abroad. Exceptions should, however, be made for companies that are licensed to manufacture equipment of the type that the import concerns, companies that are to supply the imported equipment to companies licensed to manufacture such equipment, and equipment that is to be supplied to Swedish central government agencies other than public enterprises. Imports that come under regulations laid down in the Weapons Act should be exempt from the import licence requirement set forth in the Military Equipment Act.</p>
<p>The inquiry also proposes a reporting obligation for everyone who brings defence equipment into the country, including government agencies and companies with manufacturing licences. Such an obligation is motivated in view of the need for simpler and more reliable means of fulfilling Sweden’s reporting commitments to the UN, the OSCE and the Wassenaar Arrangement. The ISP should be authorised to issue detailed regulations concerning the types of equipment that must be reported.</p>
<p>Licence requirement for provision of technical assistance abroad</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes the introduction of a licence requirement for provision of technical assistance involving defence equipment abroad. At present the ISP has no formal means of preventing technical assistance from being provided in a country that is not acceptable as a recipient of defence equipment, assuming the company concerned does not apply for a licence to export equipment for which a licence is required, or information covered by defence secrecy provisions that is needed to be able to carry out the measure concerned.</p>
<p>The proposed definition of technical assistance is ”any technical support involving defence equipment related to repairs, development, manufacture, assembly, testing or maintenance or any other technical service, and that may take forms such as instructions, transfers of working knowledge and skills or consulting services”. Certain exceptions from the licence requirement are justified and will be defined in the Ordinance. The ISP may issue export licences that include technical assistance.</p>
<p>Licences to supply firearms should only be granted under the Weapons Act</p>
<p>The provisions in Section 4 of the Military Equipment Ordinance that allow dealers in hunting and competition firearms that constitute military equipment to hold licences under both the Military Equipment Act and the Weapons Act should be amended. Mr Olof Egerstedt, who has assisted the Ministry of Justice in an inquiry on the Weapons Act, proposes that licences should only be granted under the Weapons Act (Ju 2003:U). The inquiry concurs with this view.</p>
<p>The Swedish Police should examine applications for supplies of firearms to all countries</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the authority of the Swedish Police to examine applications to supply hunting and competition firearms that constitute military equipment to other countries should be expanded from the OECD area to the entire world. The arguments in favour of these wider powers are positive experiences and the fact that the police are in a better position to assess individuals and companies without manufacturing licences, which are the main source of this type of application. Should an application concern the supply of 30 or more weapons to someone outside the EU, the police will be required to obtain an opinion from the ISP.</p>
<p>Only certain government agencies should be exempted from the licence requirement for supplies</p>
<p>Section 4 of the Military Equipment Act exempts Swedish government agencies that are not public enterprises from the general rule requiring a licence for supplies. This means that all such agencies, regardless of their field of activities, can freely sell equipment in Sweden to someone here in this country. The inquiry recommends restricting the exemption to agencies for which this can be considered justified and specifying these agencies in the Ordinance.</p>
<h2>Self-control in the defence industry</h2>
<p>The inquiry supports the endeavours of the ISP and the defence industry to further simplify the processing of routine applications. It is considered that simplifying the process for companies that have reached the requisite level of knowledge will enable the ISP to free up staff resources for difficult cases and activities that are more productive in control terms, such as international cooperation, education and training measures and visits to companies and to end-users abroad.</p>
<p>The sections below summarise proposals that are expected to increase the prospects of further processing simplifications, without thereby renouncing control over the export activities of the defence industry or hindering the examination of recipient or cooperation countries in accordance with the Guidelines.</p>
<p>Three types of export licence</p>
<p>The regulatory framework contains no provisions on how an export licence must be formulated. However, there are regulations concerning the information an application must contain and an established procedure that an end-user certificate should be presented prior to export. All export licences for military equipment issued by the ISP today are individual licences that allow a defined delivery (type of equipment and quantity) to a specified recipient and end-user. As the need has arisen, the Inspectorate has adapted the individual licence to the development of international cooperation projects and a number of different varieties now exist.</p>
<p>One variant of the individual licence is termed a ”project licence”, which can be valid for a longer period and allow repeated deliveries that are needed for implementation of an extensive transaction or an approved cooperation project. The exact scope and value of the export do not need to be stated but are reported to the ISP on an annual basis. As a result of Sweden’s accession to the FA/LoI agreement, the ISP will be able to issue ”global licences”, which resemble project licences and are defined as the only licence needed for transferring equipment within the framework of a cooperation project, with no limits on quantities and value.</p>
<p>For dual-use goods, the ISP, in accordance with EU regulations, issues three different licences: an individual licence, which allows the export of a specified product to a defined recipient in a certain country; a general licence, which allows the repeated export of listed products to defined countries; and a global licence, which allows unlimited exports to civilian buyers for civilian end use by an exporter making frequent exports to defined countries. A global licence presupposes a certain level of knowledge on the part of the exporter, which is normally checked by the ISP by means of a visit.</p>
<p>In view of the above, the inquiry proposes that the military equipment legislation should mention three types of export licence: individual, global and general.</p>
<p>The individual licence should be a possible option both for single transactions and for larger export transactions for which there is an approved cooperation agreement. The “project licence” will remain a variant of the individual licence, like the “global licence” for FA/LoI projects. A general licence should be a possible option for certain intended exports for which an end-user certificate if not now required, for example, repairs or replacement, or temporary exports of equipment. The global licence will presumably be used to a very limited extent, but could probably be used in certain situations in a similar way as for dual-use goods.</p>
<p>In the view of the inquiry, individual licences of the project licence type as well as general and global licences should only be issued to defence industry companies with good internal routines and ability to report their exports and imports. For this purpose, the Inspectorate should introduce a quality assurance process, which would include as two of its components visits to companies and education/training of the companies’ personnel. It is proposed that the ISP should be authorised to issue detailed regulations for the different licences.</p>
<p>Tender notification exemptions for the EU, Norway, Switzerland and the United States</p>
<p>In Sweden companies and government agencies are under an obligation to notify the ISP when they intend to submit a tender for supplies of defence equipment. This must be done before submitting a binding tender. The notification obligation makes it possible to forestall a transaction with an unacceptable country before the company applies for an export licence. Given that the ISP seldom prevents a tender and that the inquiry proposes to single out certain countries in the Guidelines, an exemption from this obligation is proposed in cases concerning supplies of equipment and provision of technical assistance within the EU and to Norway, Switzerland and the United States.</p>
<p>Obligation to report on marketing abroad will be adapted as necessary</p>
<p>No licence is required to market defence equipment abroad, but anyone who does so is obliged to report on marketing activities on a quarterly basis. Marketing reports enable the ISP to discover at an early stage when companies are marketing products in a country for which an export licence would probably not be granted. In the inquiry’s view, the possibility should be considered of introducing flexibility regarding the intervals at which reports are required. For certain companies each quarter may continue to be a suitable interval, while for others submitting data once or twice a year is probably often enough. Greater flexibility will enable the ISP to adapt the companies’ reports to the needs of both the Inspectorate and the individual company.</p>
<h2>Raising the maximum penalty for a gross offence</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes an increase of two years in the maximum prison sentence for a gross offence under the Military Equipment Act, from 4 years to 6 years. An increase is motivated by the consideration that the maximum penalty for a gross offence relating to supply, manufacture, foreign cooperation, provision of education or training with a military orientation or technical assistance should correspond to the maximum penalty for gross smuggling of military equipment, which is six years and is imposed under the</p>
<p>Smuggling of Goods Act. In the view of the inquiry, unlawful manufacture can be at least as punishable as unlawful export.</p>
<h2>Costs and consequences</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s assessment is that the proposals are cost-neutral for the state. On the one hand, the proposals concerning imports and technical assistance will entail a certain amount of extra work for the ISP. On the other hand, the proposals on extending selfcontrol by the defence industry are expected to reduce the Inspectorate’s work on routine cases. The increasing international cooperation by the ISP will drive costs irrespective of the inquiry’s proposals. For the defence industry, the proposals are expected to have a cost-saving effect overall. The extra work involved in applying for licences to provide technical assistance and reporting some imports will be offset by other factors, notably the exemption from notifying the ISP of intentions to tender for business in the EU and with Norway, Switzerland and the United States.</p>
