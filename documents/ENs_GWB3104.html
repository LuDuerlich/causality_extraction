<p>Proposals of the Swedish HEI Autonomy Inquiry</p>
<p>With a few exceptions, Swedish Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are public agencies. Prof. Daniel Tarschys was appointed by the Government to chair an inquiry on ways of extending the autonomy of Swedish HEIs.</p>
<p>Having considered and rejected three institutional models (continued public agency, modified public agency, and organisation based on private law, e.g. foundation or joint-stock company), the Inquiry Chair proposes the transformation of all public Swedish HEIs into a new form of organisation defined in this report. This model, entitled självständiga lärosäten (literally “independent seats of learning”), means that Swedish HEIs remain parts of the public sector but cease to be parts of the state. They acquire their own legal personality. This will allow them to engage in various activities and initiatives that are presently beyond their scope without ad hoc permission from the Government. The new framework will grant the HEIs considerable latitude to design their own internal procedures. The few HEIs that are presently non-public are not covered by the proposal.</p>
<p>The proposal can be summarised in ten points:</p>
<p>1. Public HEIs will cease to be government agencies and will instead be defined as autonomous organisations with a special public law status. The new model will be defined in a proposed Independent Seats of Learning Act which is to replace the present Higher Education Act. The reform should enter into effect on 1 January 2011. Though the proposed transformation is deemed to be compatible with the present Swedish Constitution (Instrument of Government), several constitutional changes are suggested to accompany the reform. These can be undertaken</p>
<p>in the revision of the Constitution that is expected to be carried out as a result of decisions before and after the 2010 election.</p>
<p>2. The HEIs will determine their own strategic programmes and academic profiles. As legal persons they will be entitled to receive donations, own property, set up enterprises and foundations, engage in housing for students and guest scholars, and cooperate with other domestic or international HEIs as well as enterprises.</p>
<p>3. Public funding will continue as before, but the relationship between the state and the HEIs will gradually become more contractual and less regulatory.  Multi-annual contracts are foreseen. The Swedish National Agency for Higher Education, the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Chancellor of Justice and the National Audit Agency will continue their supervision of HEIs. The principle of transparency and public access to documents (offentlighetsprincipen) will apply to the transformed HEIs.</p>
<p>4. Conditions will be established for energetic leadership within each HEI, while guaranteeing active collegial and student participation in  decision-making and individual autonomy. Every HEI will have at least one collegial body with a majority of teachers and researchers. The students will be represented in decision-making bodies at all levels.</p>
<p>5. The staff will no longer be government employees, but tenure and pensions will remain unchanged. As employers the HEIs will continue to be members of the Swedish Agency for Government Employers.</p>
<p>6. The Chair and most other members of the HEI Board will come from outside the institution. They will be appointed by the Government acting on nominations from a nominations committee appointed by the Collegial Body (or collegial bodies, if there are more than one). Other members of the HEI Board will be elected by the teaching staff and students respectively.</p>
<p>7. The Rector will be employed by the Board after consultation within the HEI.</p>
<p>8. Some provisions in the present Higher Education Ordinance will be retained in the new Act, but many others will be repealed. The design of degrees and certain access rules will continue to be regulated by government ordinance. A special Transitional</p>
<p>Act will make it possible to retain several of the present regulations on higher education until 2015.</p>
<p>9. The primary responsibility for evaluation and quality assurance will reside with the HEIs and be met both by internal routines and external examiners, e.g. evaluation teams and accreditation agencies. Oversight of this function will be exercised by the Swedish National Agency for Higher Education. The demands for accountability to students, the state and other stakeholders will be stepped up.</p>
<p>10. Ownership of the real estate company Akademiska Hus should be transferred from the state to a new holding company owned collectively by all HEIs. This would provide a capital base for the HEIs that could, among other things, facilitate borrowing for investments and guarantee the fulfilment of HEI obligations towards their staff and students in the unlikely event of insolvency. The operations of the real estate company would continue as before, but decisions on the use of its revenue for consolidation and dividends would lie in the hands of the new owners.</p>
