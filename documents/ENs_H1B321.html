<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The transfer of enforcement of sentences between different countries has long been part of international penal law cooperation. This cooperation builds on various intergovernmental agreements such as conventions and bilateral agreements. Sweden has also decided to cooperate in this area without an agreement in place, under certain conditions. Cooperation in the Nordic region is based on legislative harmonisation built on discretionary adaptation, and between EU Member States cooperation has been developed through various framework decisions. The fundamental aim of cooperation is to facilitate the social rehabilitation of sentenced persons by enabling sentences to be enforced in the country where the sentenced person is a citizen or resident. There are both criminal policy grounds and humanitarian grounds for this. In the case of fines and forfeiture, cooperation primarily aims to facilitate effective law enforcement.</p>
<h2>The remit in brief</h2>
<p>Several framework decisions have been adopted in the EU in this area, and two of them are part of the inquiry’s remit. These are Council Framework Decision 2008/909/JHA, on recognition and enforcement of custodial sentences, and Council Framework Decision 2008/947/JHA, on recognition and enforcement of probation sentences. The Riksdag has approved Sweden’s accession to these decisions. The inquiry’s remit is to propose how these Framework Decisions should be implemented in Swedish law. The amendments enacted through Council Framework Decision 2009/299/JHA on enforcement of judgments in absentia  must be taken into account in the implementation. The Framework Decisions are based on the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions. This cooperation implies an undertaking as an executing State to recognise and enforce the judgments of other Member States within a specific scope, and therefore differs from traditional cooperation.</p>
<p>The remit also includes reviewing the Act on International Cooperation in the Enforcement of Criminal Judgments (1972:260) and proposing clearer and more effective regulation. The Act, which covers both custodial sentences and fines and forfeiture, was originally developed to enable accession to the 1970 Convention on the International Validity of Criminal Judgments. It has subsequently been expanded and adapted to the various new international undertakings and agreements entered into by Sweden. This has resulted in structural problems, making the Act difficult to navigate and apply at present.</p>
<h2>Three new Acts</h2>
<p>We propose that the two Framework Decisions each be implemented in a new Act, and that the Act on International Cooperation in the Enforcement of Criminal Judgments be replaced with a new Act. We consider that this division among different Acts is most effective in light of the differences between traditional cooperation and EU cooperation, which is based on the principle of mutual recognition. Furthermore, there are significant differences between the Framework Decisions concerning the procedures for the transfer of custodial and probation sentences.</p>
<p>One starting point in drafting the Acts has been to find, as far as possible, common solutions to similar issues and to create a uniform, coherent and clear regulatory framework. This applies for example to the decision-making processes in the different Acts. Another starting point for the new regulations has been enabling the enforcement of sentences to be transferred from and to Sweden to the greatest possible extent. The aim is to achieve a procedure that is efficient but also legally secure, and that takes account of the interests of the individual. In drafting our proposals, consideration was also given to Sweden’s interest as a State in avoiding enforcing judgements and decisions that contravene fundamental</p>
<p>Swedish penal law principles. However, in certain individual cases such interests may need to be weighed against humanitarian grounds, i.e. the interest of allowing the sentenced person to serve his or her sentence in Sweden.</p>
<h2>A new decision-making process</h2>
<p>We propose a common decision-making process to apply in all enforcement matters covered by the remit.</p>
<p>At present, the Government plays a major role in international penal law cooperation outside the Nordic region. When custodial sentences are enforced in Sweden, the Government is the decisionmaking instance, and when sentences are enforced abroad, Swedish enforcement authorities’ decisions can be appealed to the Government. The development towards decentralisation speaks in favour of shifting decision-making to the level of government agencies and courts. This was also an explicit starting point of the inquiry’s terms of reference. In our assessment, if the Government’s role is reduced, the procedures could be streamlined and enforcement could be transferred to a greater extent than previously. We therefore propose that the decision-making process for enforcement in Sweden of foreign judgments be shifted from the Government to government agency/court level.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the enforcing authorities are best placed to act as decision-making bodies. This concerns the Swedish Prison and Probation Service for custodial sentences that can be expected to be enforced by means of imprisonment or institutional youth care and for probation sentences, the National Board of Health and Welfare for sentences that can be expected to be enforced by means of forensic mental care, and the Enforcement Authority for fines and forfeiture. These agencies already take decisions on the enforcement of Swedish judgments abroad. The proposals offer a comprehensive solution that can result in streamlining and effective use of resources.</p>
<p>In order to fulfil the requirement of a legally secure procedure, it should be possible to appeal the enforcing authorities’ decisions to a court. For the choice of superior instance, we propose that appeals should be addressed to a general court. It is primarily the general courts that deal with matters of international penal law cooperation. It should be possible to appeal to Stockholm District</p>
<p>Court against decisions of the Swedish Prison and Probation Service and the National Board of Health and Welfare. It should be possible to appeal to a district court against decisions of the Enforcement Authority, in accordance with Chapter 18, Section 1 of the Debt Enforcement Code.</p>
<h2>Proposal for a new Act on international enforcement of sentences</h2>
<p>A new Act</p>
<p>Under our proposal, the Act on International Cooperation in the Enforcement of Criminal Judgments will be replaced with a new Act on international enforcement of sentences. The new Act will be applicable to the extent required by any international agreement that is binding on Sweden. This kind of convention-neutral formulation means that the Act can also be applied to international agreements entered into in the future. The Act is primarily applicable to Sweden’s cooperation in this area with States outside the Nordic region and the EU. As previously, it will be possible to apply the Act without an agreement. We propose that this should be possible where there are special grounds to do so, which effectively corresponds to the general practice already in place. The Act lays down a number of general rules, but deviations may occur if required by an international agreement that is binding on Sweden.</p>
<p>Like the Act on International Cooperation in the Enforcement of Criminal Judgments, it is proposed that the new Act cover custodial sentences, fines and forfeiture. Unlike the old Act, the new Act deals with custodial sentences separately from fines and forfeiture. The Swedish custodial sentences for which the option of enforcement in another State is proposed are imprisonment, committal to forensic mental care, and institutional youth care.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, a new decision-making procedure is proposed whereby the Swedish Prison and Probation Service, the National Board of Health and Welfare and the Enforcement Authority would be the competent authorities for the transfer of enforcement of sentences both to and from Sweden. We propose that the current option for the competent authority to submit a matter to the Government for a decision be retained. We propose that this possibility apply across the board, meaning that it may also be applied to the transfer of enforcement to Sweden. It is proposed that this possibility only apply where there are special grounds, e.g. when there is no agreement between States and particular consideration should be afforded to Sweden’s relations with the other State.</p>
<p>The Convention on the International Validity of Criminal Judgments sets certain procedural requirements, e.g. a review by a prosecutor or court is required, and in cases to be transferred the foreign judgment must be replaced with a Swedish judgment. In practice, the Convention has very seldom been applied. The new Act therefore contains special provisions on the procedure for applying the Convention. These provisions largely correspond to those applicable today under the Act on International Cooperation in the Enforcement of Criminal Judgments.</p>
<p>Petitions and other documents under the Act should still be submitted via the Ministry of Justice. Direct communication is permitted if it is allowed under the international agreement adduced in the individual case.</p>
<p>Enforcement of a Swedish criminal judgment abroad</p>
<p>For custodial sentences, we propose that the Act make it clearer when a Swedish criminal judgment can be enforced in another State. These conditions are, however, already applied in practice. Sometimes, the international agreement applied in a given case may mean that other conditions apply. As a general rule, the sentenced person must be a citizen or resident of the other State and it must be possible to assume that his or her social rehabilitation will be facilitated by transferring enforcement to that State. The other State’s permission and the consent of the sentenced person are also usually required. Furthermore, the judgment must have become final and non-appealable, the sentenced person must be in Sweden or in the other State, and there must be at least six months of the sentence left to serve or special grounds for transferring enforcement there anyway. It is also a requirement that it can be considered appropriate to transfer enforcement to the other State. This can include considering any adaptation of the sentence in the other State or what form enforcement may take there. Enforcement may never be transferred if the conditions are such that there is an impediment under the Aliens Act (2005:719) to enforcing a refusal-of-entry or expulsion order to the State in question, or if it would contravene the Swedish Constitution or the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p>
<p>For transfers of Swedish criminal sentences of fines or forfeiture, the conditions may be assessed based on the agreements applied in a given case. In all cases, however, the judgment must have become final and non-appealable and the transfer of enforcement must be deemed to be advantageous. One new aspect in the new Act is that the Enforcement Authority is given the option of submitting an application for enforcement of Swedish criminal judgments to several States at the same time, in so far as this is possible under the applicable agreement. Moreover, enforcement may continue in Sweden even after an application has been made to another State, if this is possible under the relevant agreement. In such cases, the Enforcement Authority must monitor proceedings to ensure that the total value of the enforcement does not exceed the sum specified in the judgment.</p>
<p>Enforcement in Sweden of a foreign criminal judgment</p>
<p>The new Act also more clearly outlines the conditions that apply for transfers of enforcement to Sweden. For custodial sentences, the general rule is that the sentenced person must be a Swedish citizen or resident, and it must be possible to assume that social rehabilitation will be facilitated by a transfer to Sweden. The sentenced person’s consent is also usually required. Furthermore, the judgment must have become final and non-appealable and be enforceable, the sentenced person must be in Sweden or the sentencing State, and there must be at least six months of the sentence left to serve or special grounds for transferring enforcement anyway. The Act specifies the circumstances under which there are impediments to enforcement in Sweden. These largely correspond to those applicable today. One new aspect is that the grounds for refusal are formulated to be binding, but there is a possibility to enforce the foreign criminal judgment anyway, taking account of the attitude of the sentenced person and the circumstances in general. This provides the possibility to take account of special humanitarian grounds in individual cases.</p>
<p>If it is required in order for a foreign custodial sentence to be enforced in Sweden, the competent authority may itself issue regulations or request that the Swedish Prosecution Authority apply to Stockholm District Court for a new sentence to be determined. This corresponds to the possibility for adaptation of the sentence currently enjoyed by the Government. As is currently the case, the basic premise is that the foreign sentence should not normally be adapted in any way. The Swedish Prison and Probation Service may need to issue regulations when, for example, a sentence concerning a young offender in Sweden is to be enforced through institutional youth care. In exceptional cases there may also be reasons for adjusting the length of a foreign prison sentence. This may be the case for example where differences in parole rules mean that enforcement in Sweden would make a sentence substantially longer than in the issuing State, which may contravene the European Convention on Human Rights. There may be other exceptions where circumstances in individual cases are such that it would be objectionable to transfer enforcement without adaptation. As at present, the procedure for conversion of sentences should be used when considering the forms of sentences for mentally disturbed offenders.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the Act, the Enforcement Authority is to examine foreign criminal sentences of fines or forfeiture and decide whether they can be enforced in Sweden. This is a new aspect, as the provisions of the Convention on the International Validity of Criminal Judgments currently also apply to transfers under other international agreements. Procedural provisions in the Act on recognition and enforcement of fines within the European Union (2009:1427) and the Act on recognition and enforcement of forfeiture within the European Union (2009:423) have been used as a model for this procedure. Certain deviations were nonetheless deemed necessary.</p>
<h2>Proposal for a new Act on recognition and enforcement of custodial sentences in the European Union</h2>
<p>A new Act that implements the Framework Decision</p>
<p>In the second section of the report, we propose that the Framework Decision on recognition and enforcement of custodial sentences be implemented by means of a new Act on recognition and enforcement of sentences involving deprivation of liberty in the European Union. This Act is to be applied instead of the Act on international enforcement of sentences when transferring the enforcement of custodial sentences between Sweden and another Member State.</p>
<p>According to the Framework Decision, an obligatory cooperation area exists between the Member States. This means that the executing State is obligated to recognise and enforce a foreign judgment when the convicted person is a citizen and is residing in the executing State, or when the convicted person is a citizen and expelled to the executing State, unless a ground for refusal stated in the Framework Decision is applied. Furthermore, the Framework Decision entails another new aspect, compared with previous agreements, in that the consent of the sentenced person is not necessary for a transfer if he or she is a citizen and resident of the executing State. The proposed new Act is designed accordingly and therefore in practice offers greater opportunities for transferring the enforcement of Swedish judgments to another Member State and, at the same time, greater obligations to accept enforcement of foreign judgments.</p>
<p>We also propose that the obligatory cooperation area be expanded in one situation. This applies when the sentenced person is resident and has stayed legally for at least five years without interruption in the executing State. This expansion applies in relation to other Member States that have declared that permission is not necessary in equivalent situations.</p>
<p>The Framework Decision means that competent authorities in the various Member States are to communicate directly with one another. There is therefore no need for communications to go via the Ministry of Justice. In accordance with Annex 1 of the Framework Decision, a certificate is to be included with a judgment sent for recognition and enforcement. In principle, this certificate should contain all the information necessary to take a decision in the matter. The certificate is to be translated into the language of the executing State or into a language that State has declared acceptable.</p>
<p>Recognition and enforcement of a Swedish custodial sentence in another Member State of the European Union</p>
<p>The proposed Act means that the Swedish Prison and Probation Service, for imprisonment and institutional youth care, and the National Board of Health and Welfare, for committal to forensic mental care, may forward a Swedish judgment to another Member State for recognition and enforcement if it can be assumed that transferring enforcement there would facilitate the sentenced person’s social rehabilitation. In cases outside the obligatory cooperation area or the expanded obligatory cooperation area, the executing State’s permission is required for forwarding of this kind. In addition, the consent of the sentenced person is required if he or she is not a citizen and resident of the executing State, has been expelled there or has fled there. Furthermore, the judgment must have become final and non-appealable, the sentenced person must be in Sweden or in the executing State, and there must be at least six months of the sentence left to serve, or there are special grounds favour for transferring enforcement there anyway. Finally, a transfer must be deemed appropriate. This assessment includes considering the form that enforcement will take in the other State.</p>
<p>When a Swedish judgment has been forwarded to the executing State, enforcement of the sentence referred to in the request may only begin in Sweden if the sentenced person is in detention. However, the sentence may be enforced in Sweden if the competent authority has withdrawn the request for recognition and enforcement, or if the executing State has announced that the request has been denied or that enforcement cannot take place there.</p>
<p>If the sentenced person is in Sweden, he or she is to be transferred to the executing State as soon as possible after the decision of the executing State has become final and non-appealable, or no later than within thirty days. The transfer may take place at a later date if there are special grounds. The Swedish Prison and Probation Service is to ensure that the sentenced person is transported to the executing State.</p>
<p>In certain cases, enforcement of a Swedish judgment is to be transferred to another Member State as a consequence of a European arrest warrant. The conditions of the Act do not apply in such cases; however, the other provisions of the Act do apply.</p>
<p>Recognition and enforcement in Sweden of a foreign custodial sentence that has been issued in another Member State of the European Union</p>
<p>A foreign custodial sentence that is sent to Sweden for recognition and enforcement under the Framework Decision is to be addressed to and examined by the Swedish Prison and Probation Service, for sentences that can be expected to be enforced by means of imprisonment or institutional youth care, and the National Board of Health and Welfare, for sentences that can be expected to be enforced by means of forensic mental care.</p>
<p>In cases where the sentenced person comes under the obligatory cooperation area, the foreign judgment is to be recognised and enforced in Sweden if other conditions are also fulfilled. In other cases, the competent authority may examine whether it can be assumed that transferring enforcement here would facilitate the sentenced person’s social rehabilitation. A transfer of enforcement also requires the consent of the sentenced person if he or she is not a Swedish citizen and resident in Sweden, has been expelled here or has fled here. The foreign judgment must also have become final and non-appealable, the sentenced person must be in Sweden or in the issuing State and there must be at least six months of the sentence left to serve or special grounds for transferring enforcement anyway.</p>
<p>The Act also presents nine points that constitute impediments to recognition and enforcement. These correspond to the grounds for refusal listed in Article 9 of the Framework Decision. If such a ground for refusal exists, a request for recognition and enforcement is to be denied. Under the Framework Decision, a refusal may also be made if the enforcement of a foreign judgment would contravene the Swedish Constitution or Sweden’s commitments under the European Convention on Human Rights, or the general principles of European Union law and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. In some cases there may be humanitarian grounds for transferring enforcement of a foreign judgment to Sweden even though a ground for refusal exists. The Act therefore contains an exemption that makes it possible to recognise and enforce the foreign judgment if, in view of the sentenced person’s opinion and general circumstances, there are special grounds for the enforcement to take place in Sweden. In cases where the foreign judgment refers to two or more offences and there are impediments concerning any of these, the Act also provides an opportunity to partially recognise and enforce the judgment.</p>
<p>In cases where a Swedish court has decided, in a matter concerning a European arrest warrant, that a foreign judgment is to be enforced in Sweden, the competent authority is not to examine the conditions under the new Act. However, the Act’s procedural rules are also to apply in these matters.</p>
<p>The competent authority is to take its final decision no later than thirty days after having received a judgment and certificate. If special grounds exist, the decision may be announced later, i.e. if supplementary information is required. If the competent authority decides to recognise and enforce the foreign judgment, it is to be carried out through a declaration of enforceability. The declaration of enforceability is to make clear whether the sentence will be adjusted in any way or whether a court will examine whether to convert it. The basic premise is that no adjustment is to be made of the foreign sentence. In a similar manner as in the Act on international enforcement of sentences, the competent authority can, if necessary for the enforcement to take place in Sweden, issue regulations or refer the matter for conversion of the sentence.</p>
<p>In cases where the sentenced person is in the issuing State, the Swedish Prison and Probation Service is to ensure that he or she is transported to Sweden. Under the Framework Decision, the issuing State is to cover the costs for the transport.</p>
<p>Unless a new sentence is decided in Sweden, enforcement in Sweden is to take place in accordance with the applicable terms of an equivalent Swedish sentence. In certain cases, enforcement may be discontinued due to measures taken by the issuing State. It may be that the issuing State issues a withdrawal, grants the sentenced person a pardon or amnesty, or takes some other decision that means that the sentence may no longer be enforced, or that the sentenced person absconds from enforcement and the right to enforce the sentence should therefore revert to the issuing State.</p>
<h2>Proposal for a new Act on recognition and enforcement of probation sentences in the European Union</h2>
<p>A new Act that implements the Framework Decision</p>
<p>In the third section of the report, we propose that the Framework Decision on recognition and enforcement of probation sentences be implemented in a new Act on recognition and enforcement of sentences involving probation in the European Union. To all intents and purposes, cooperation on probation sentences is new, with the exception of the cooperation between the Nordic countries. In light of this, one starting point has been to limit the Act’s initial scope of application. This is also motivated by the ongoing reform efforts concerning the Swedish sentencing system proposed by the Sentencing Inquiry.</p>
<p>The new Act is to be applied to Swedish and foreign judgments and decisions involving sentences that are alternatives to custodial sentences and are not fines, or imprisonment after the sentenced person has been conditionally released. The Swedish sentences that could be transferred for enforcement in another Member State are conditional sentences, probation, youth service, and imprisonment after the sentenced person has been conditionally released. The foreign sentences to be included are to be determined on the basis of the definitions in Article 2.1 of the Framework Decision.</p>
<p>One aim of the Framework Decision is to avoid situations where foreigners are sentenced to imprisonment simply because a probation sentence does not appear to be enforceable. For a court, in an individual case, to have the option of choosing a probation sentence rather than a shorter term of imprisonment, the Swedish Prison and Probation Service and the competent authority in the other Member State must consult one another as early as at the individual examination stage.</p>
<p>In much the same way as the Framework Decision of recognition and enforcement of custodial sentences, this Framework Decision means that there is to be direct communication between the competent authorities, and that a certificate with all the relevant information is to be included with any judgment sent for recognition and enforcement.</p>
<p>Recognition and enforcement of a Swedish probation sentence in another Member State of the European Union</p>
<p>Under the Act, the Swedish Prison and Probation Service may forward a Swedish judgment to another Member State for recognition and enforcement if the judgment has become final and nonappealable, the sentenced person is resident in the executing State and has returned or will return there, it can be assumed that transferring enforcement there would facilitate the sentenced person’s social rehabilitation and a transfer is suitable. If the sentenced person is not resident in the executing State, forwarding can still take place if the other Member State gives its consent.</p>
<p>In connection with recognition of the judgment by the executing State, competency to enforce the sentence and take subsequent decisions related to it is transferred to the executing State. Subsequent decisions taken in the executing State are to apply in Sweden. However, the executing State has the option of referring a matter concerning a measure to Sweden. This option depends on the explanation provided by the other Member State. In such a case, Sweden regains competency to take decisions with respect to the judgment. The Swedish Prison and Probation Service is to transfer a referred matter to the parole board.</p>
<p>In certain cases, a situation may arise where the Swedish Prison and Probation Service wants to restore competency to enforce a sentence and take subsequent decisions to Sweden. A withdrawal is possible until enforcement begins in the other state. After that, a withdrawal is possible if the sentenced person is charged with other offences in Sweden. Following a withdrawal, enforcement is to continue in Sweden and a Swedish court has the opportunity to consider the judgment when determining the sentence in a new criminal case. Enforcement is also to continue if the executing State restores competency to enforce the sentence to Sweden.</p>
<p>Recognition and enforcement in Sweden of a probation sentence that has been issued in another Member State of the European Union</p>
<p>A foreign probation sentence that is forwarded to Sweden for recognition and enforcement is to be addressed to and examined by the Swedish Prison and Probation Service. Recognition and enforcement are to be carried out if the judgment has become final and non-appealable, the sentenced person is resident in Sweden and has or wishes to return here, and the probation measure specified in the judgment is covered by Article 4.1 of the Framework Decision. Even if the sentenced person is not resident in Sweden, a foreign judgment may be recognised and enforced if it can be assumed that transferring enforcement here would facilitate the sentenced person’s social rehabilitation.</p>
<p>The Act also presents eight points that constitute impediments to recognition and enforcement. These correspond to the grounds for refusal listed in Article 11 of the Framework Decision. If such a ground for refusal exists, a request for recognition and enforcement is to be denied. Under the Framework Decision, a refusal may also be made if the enforcement of a foreign judgment would contravene the Swedish Constitution or Sweden’s commitments under the European Convention on Human Rights, or the general principles of European Union law and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. In exceptional cases, enforcement may take place in such cases despite the existence of a ground for refusal. The Act also contains an optional ground for refusal to the effect that the request may be denied if the sentence is less than six months in length.</p>
<p>The Swedish Prison and Probation Service is to take the final decision no later than sixty days after receiving the request. If special grounds exist, a decision may be announced later, i.e. if supplementary information is required. A decision to assume responsibility for enforcement is taken through a declaration of enforceability.</p>
<p>The Framework Decision means that in its capacity as executing State, Sweden is obliged to accept and enforce the probation measures listed in Article 4.1 of the Framework Decision. The applicable probation measure and its length is to be made clear in the certificate, and this information is to be attached to the declaration of enforceability. Regardless of the applicable probation measure, it is to be enforced by application of the provisions in Chapter 26, Sections 12–18, Chapter 27, Sections 4 and 5, and Chapter 28, Section 5 a of the Swedish Penal Code. If the sentenced person seriously neglects his or her obligations or is charged with other offences, the Swedish Prison and Probation Service is to restore competency to enforce the sentence to the issuing State. This applies even if the sentenced person absconds from Sweden or is no longer resident here. In such cases, enforcement in Sweden is consequently to cease. This is also the case if the issuing State has issued a withdrawal or a decision to the effect that the sentence may no longer be enforced.</p>
<h2>Other matters</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the three new Acts and proposed amendments to other legislation enter into force on 1 July 2014.</p>
<p>The Framework Decisions mean greater opportunities to transfer enforcement of sentences, which is linked to the obligatory coope- ration areas, direct communication between competent authorities and time limits for taking decisions. It can therefore be expected that the number of cases concerning the transfer of sentences will increase. This particularly applies to the transfer of enforcement of Swedish judgments to another EU Member State. We estimate that, all in all, the proposals will not entail increased costs for public authorities. Instead, there is much to indicate that, as a whole, the proposals may mean savings for Sweden.</p>
