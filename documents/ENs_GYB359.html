<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Terms of Reference</h2>
<p>The Committee was assigned to propose the supplementary provisions required for the European Union’s (EU) Council Regulation adopted on 18 December 2008 on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and cooperation in matters relating to maintenance obligations (‘the Maintenance Regulation’), including the reference, found in the Regulation, to the Hague Protocol of 23 November 2007 on the Law Applicable to Maintenance Obligations (‘the 2007 Hague Protocol’). Our Terms of Reference also included analysing the Maintenance Regulation and explaining the similarities and differences, primarily in relation to the Brussels I Regulation and the Hague Convention of 23 November 2007 on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance (‘the 2007 Hague Convention’). Particular attention was to be attached to matters concerning legal aid, refusal or suspension of enforcement, exchange of information and confidentiality (secrecy), together with access to and the processing of personal information (data).</p>
<p>The Committee was also to propose the statutory amendments that would ensue upon a future accession to the 2007 Hague Convention. Some of this work involved investigating the position of Swedish law in relation to the provisions of the Convention and analysing the consequences of Sweden becoming bound by the Convention. In this context, the relationship to other international instruments in this area was also to be described. Particular attention was also to be attached to issues regarding legal assistance, the exchange of information and the associated issues relating to confidentiality and also issues concerning the exequatur procedure and enforcement. To the extent that the issue arises, the Committee was also to adopt a position on how the Convention should be incorporated into Swedish law. Our Terms of Reference also included adopting a position on whether the scope of the Convention should be extended, either completely or partly, and whether there is reason to make reservations in accordance with the possibilities allowed by the Convention.</p>
<p>The Committee was to provide proposals regarding which authority should be appointed as the Central Authority in relation to the Maintenance Regulation and the 2007 Hague Convention and to deliberate on whether certain tasks should be dealt with by the Central Authority or by other bodies.</p>
<h2>Scope and relationship to other international instruments</h2>
<p>The Maintenance Regulation aims at offering a person entitled to maintenance (= creditor) better means and prospects to safeguard his or her rights. This shall be achieved by making it easy to obtain a decision in a Member State that will be automatically enforceable in another Member State without any formalities. The Regulation includes provisions on international jurisdiction, applicable law (in the form of a reference to the 2007 Hague Protocol; see further below), recognition and enforcement as well as cooperation. The Maintenance Regulation replaces the Brussels I Regulation as regards questions of maintenance. However, the Nordic Convention between Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway regarding the recovery of maintenance will continue to apply. The Maintenance Regulation applies to maintenance obligations arising from a family relationship, parentage, marriage or affinity. Even public bodies may be regarded as a creditor in the sense of the Regulation; for instance, if there is a claim for reimbursement of maintenance support paid out by a public body. The Maintenance Regulation will be directly applicable in Sweden.</p>
<p>The object of the 2007 Hague Convention  is to ensure efficient international recovery of child support and other forms of family maintenance. This shall be achieved, among other things, by establishing a system of cooperation and by requiring effective measures for the prompt enforcement of maintenance decisions. The Convention applies to maintenance obligations arising from a parent-child relationship towards a person under the age of 21 years and also, under certain conditions, towards a spouse (or former spouse). It is also possible to extend the scope of the Convention. The Committee had to proceed on the basis that the EU will accede to the 2007 Hague Convention and thereby bind the Member States to the Convention, an approach that has been proposed by the Commission. In its proposal for a Council Decision, the Commission also proposed that the EU should issue a declaration whereby the entire scope of the Convention is extended to correspond to the scope of the Regulation. The EU has not yet adopted a position on this proposal. When this is done, Sweden will be bound by the position adopted by the EU. The 2007 Hague Convention replaces the Hague Conventions of 1958 and 1973 in the relationship between the Contracting States. The New York Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance is also replaced.</p>
<p>The 2007 Hague Protocol  contains provisions on applicable law to maintenance obligations arising from a family relationship, parentage, marriage or affinity. The Protocol is intended to supplement the 2007 Hague Convention, and shall, in accordance with a special reference contained in the Maintenance Regulation, apply when jurisdiction is exercised under the Regulation. The EU has acceded to the 2007 Hague Protocol.</p>
<h2>Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>The Maintenance Regulation regulates when authorities in the Member States should have international jurisdiction regarding matters concerning maintenance obligations. Jurisdiction shall lie with the court of the country where the defendant or the creditor is habitually resident. Jurisdiction shall furthermore lie with the court that, according to the laws of its own country, has the jurisdiction to entertain proceedings concerning the status of a person or concerning parental responsibility when the matter relating to maintenance is ancillary to those proceedings, unless that jurisdiction is based solely on the nationality of one of the parties. There are also certain opportunities under the Maintenance Regulation to reach an agreement on the jurisdiction of the courts in a particular Member State. This contractual freedom is more limited than in the Brussels I Regulation and does not apply in the case of disputes concerning maintenance obligations towards a child under the age of 18. Jurisdiction may also be based on the appearance of the defendant before the court. Moreover, there are also provisions on subsidiary jurisdiction and jurisdiction on an exceptional basis (e.g. if it is impossible to reach a decision in a third State with which the dispute is closely connected).There is also a provision limiting the possibility of a creditor bringing new proceedings if a decision has already been made.</p>
<p>The Maintenance Regulation is comprehensive in the sense that it does not leave any scope for generally applicable, autonomous provisions on jurisdiction. The Committee therefore proposes that the provisions contained in Chapter 3, Sections 6 and 12 of the Act concerning certain International Legal Relationships relating to Marriage and Guardianship (1904:26, p. 1), which currently grant Swedish courts the right to exercise international jurisdiction in among other things matters concerning maintenance, be changed so that they no longer cover maintenance matters. On the other hand, the Maintenance Regulation does not affect the scope of conventions and agreements that are in force when the Regulation enters into force, which means that both of the Lugano Conventions from 1988 and 2007 will continue to apply. If a defendant habitually lives in a Lugano State that is not one of the EU Member States, the Swedish courts shall thus exercise jurisdiction under the Lugano Convention that applies in relation to the other State. Furthermore, according to the Maintenance Regulation, the 2007 Lugano Convention will apply if the parties have agreed that there shall be exclusive jurisdiction in a Lugano State that is not an EU Member State. However, this does not apply as regards maintenance for children.</p>
<p>The 2007 Hague Convention only contains indirect rules on jurisdiction. These mean that a Contracting State is only liable to recognise and enforce a decision if the decision has been made in a Contracting State in relation to which the defendant or creditor had a particular type of connection specified in the Convention. There is also a provision restricting the right to bring proceedings. This corresponds with the rule contained in the Maintenance Regulation, which limits the possibility for a debtor to institute proceedings if a decision has already been made.</p>
<h2>Choice of applicable law</h2>
<p>The EU has acceded to the 2007 Hague Protocol and this means that all Member States, with the exception of Denmark and the UK, are bound by the Protocol. For Sweden, this Protocol means regulation of an area that was virtually unregulated.</p>
<p>The main rule according to the Protocol is that maintenance obligations shall be governed by the law of the State of the habitual residence of the creditor. Some exceptions have been adopted favouring certain creditors, where an application of the law of the Member State of their habitual residence would not be in their interest. An exception applies, for example, in the case of maintenance obligations of parents towards their children and children towards their parents. The law of the forum shall apply if a creditor, who is subject to the rules on exceptions, is unable to obtain maintenance according to the law of the Member State of his or her habitual residence. Furthermore, the law of the forum shall apply if the creditor has instituted proceedings in the State where the debtor has his or her habitual residence. However, the law of the State where the creditor has his or her habitual residence shall apply instead if the creditor is unable to obtain maintenance according to the law of that State. If the creditor is unable to obtain maintenance by virtue of any of the laws, the law of the State of the common nationality shall apply if the debtor and creditor have a common nationality.</p>
<p>There are also exceptions for maintenance obligations between spouses, ex-spouses or parties to a marriage that has been annulled. If the law in a State other than the State where the creditor is habitually resident, in particular the State of their last common habitual residence, has a closer connection with the marriage, the law of that State shall apply. However, a prerequisite for this is first an objection by a party and second an assessment of whether there is a closer connection between the law in the other State and the marriage. In this connection, account must be taken of, among other things, the place where the spouses were habitually resident, the State in which the marriage was entered into and also where the divorce took place.</p>
<p>There is also a special rule concerning contesting maintenance obligations. However, this does not apply to a maintenance obligation arising from a parent-child relationship and a maintenance obligation between ex-spouses. This rule means that the debtor may contest a claim from the creditor on the ground that there is no maintenance obligation, under both the law of the State of the habitual residence of the debtor and the law of the State of the common nationality of the parties, if there is one. The provisions can come into question, for instance, in a relationship between stepparents and children or in the case of maintenance obligations of children towards their parents.</p>
<p>According to the Protocol, it is possible to agree to some extent on applicable law (see further below).</p>
<p>The law applicable to the maintenance obligation shall determine inter alia  whether, to what extent and from whom the creditor may claim maintenance and also questions concerning prescription periods. The application of law may only be refused if its effects would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of the forum. It is consequently only the effects of the application in the concrete case that are to be taken into account. It is not sufficient for the family relationship upon which the maintenance claim is based to be deemed to be manifestly contrary to the public policy of the State (for instance polygamy). The needs of the creditor and the resources of the debtor as well as any compensation which the creditor was awarded in place of periodical maintenance payments shall be taken into account in determining the amount of maintenance. This applies regardless of which State’s law is generally applicable.</p>
<p>As mentioned, jurisdiction in maintenance issues will be exercised either under the Maintenance Regulation or according to either of the Lugano Conventions. The 2007 Hague Protocol shall apply when jurisdiction is exercised according to the Maintenance Regulation. In the opinion of the Committee, the Protocol should also apply when jurisdiction is exercised under the Lugano Conventions. There is thereby no scope for generally applicable provisions on choice of law. The Committee therefore proposes that the provisions contained in Chapter 3, Section 6 of the Act concerning certain International Legal Relationships relating to Marriage and Guardianship, which state among other things that issues concerning maintenance shall be considered according to Swedish law if the child is resident in Sweden, should no longer cover maintenance matters.</p>
<p>The Maintenance Regulation states that the law applicable to maintenance obligations shall  be determined in accordance with the Protocol, which means that the application of the Protocol is mandatory for the courts and other authorities of the States. This is also prescribed by individual articles. Maintenance obligations shall  be governed by the law of the State where the debtor is habitually resident, unless otherwise prescribed by the Protocol. In the opinion of the Committee, this means that Swedish courts in cases concerning maintenance with international connections must fully understand the provisions of the Protocol. This also means that the Protocol imposes greater demands on the court to actively direct the proceedings regarding which law is to be applied than what has been required until now in cases concerning maintenance obligations.</p>
<h2>Recognition and enforcement</h2>
<p>With reference to the Maintenance Regulation , decisions from all EU Member States shall be recognised without any special procedure being required. As regards enforcement, there are two alternative procedures depending on whether or not the Member State of origin is bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol.</p>
<p>Decisions from States bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol (that is, from all EU Member States with the exception of Denmark and the UK) shall be enforced without the need for a declaration of enforceability (‘exequatur’), on condition that the decision involved is enforceable in the State of origin. This is new as compared to the Brussels I Regulation.</p>
<p>A debtor who has not entered an appearance in the Member State of origin is under certain preconditions afforded the right to apply for a review  of the decision within a certain period. The right to a review applies if the document instituting the proceedings was not served in sufficient time and in an appropriate way or if he or she was prevented from contesting the maintenance claim by reason of force majeure  or due to extraordinary circumstances without any fault on his or her part. A defendant who has failed to challenge the decision when it was possible to do so is not entitled to a review.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes certain supplementary provisions for processing an application for a review. The application should be presented to the Court of Appeal if the original decision is a ruling from the Swedish Enforcement Authority (Kronofogdemyndigheten) or a judgment from a district court. Otherwise, if the decision relates to a decision concerning an obligation to reimburse maintenance support paid out by the Swedish Social Insurance Agency (Försäkringskassan), the application should be presented to Svea Court of Appeal. The application must be made in writing. The relevant parts of the provisions on relief for a substantive defect contained in the Code of Judicial Procedure apply to proceedings at the Court of Appeal. Where the necessary conditions for a review are met, the Court of Appeal should decide that new proceedings should take place at the authority that made the original decision. In such a case, the Maintenance Regulation prescribes that the effect of the original decision is lost (except as regards interrupting the prescription or the like).</p>
<p>According to the Maintenance Regulation, it is the law of the Member State of enforcement that shall apply as regards the refusal or suspension of enforcement. However, the Regulation contains certain special provisions. Among other things, enforcement may be refused if the right to enforce the decision is extinguished by the effect of prescription. This shall be assessed either according to the law of the Member State of origin or the law of the Member State of enforcement, whichever provides for the longer limitation period. Enforcement may also be suspended if an application for a review has been submitted or if the enforceability of the judgment has been suspended in the Member State of origin. The Committee proposes that the Swedish Enforcement Authority be the competent authority for making decisions as regards refusal and suspension of enforcement and that appeals should be allowed against decisions made by the Swedish Enforcement Authority on matters concerning suspension of enforcement. Current law already allows appeals to be made against its decisions concerning refusal of enforcement.</p>
<p>In order for decisions from Denmark and the UK – which are States not bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol – to be enforceable in Sweden, an exequatur procedure is required using same model as under the Brussels I Regulation (see further below). The grounds for refusing recognition and enforcement also have corresponding provisions in the Brussels I Regulation – such as public policy, incompatibility with a decision issued in the requested State or with a previous decision made in another State – provided the decision satisfies the conditions for recognition in the requested State. However, a new decision, resulting from changed circumstances, does not mean that the new decision is incompatible.</p>
<p>According to the 2007 Hague Convention , decisions must be recognised and enforced in other Contracting States. Recognition and enforcement are mandatory if there are no grounds for refusal under the Convention; for example, if the defendant or the creditor was habitually resident in the State of origin at the time the decision was made. Subject to certain exceptions, the Convention’s grounds for recognition correspond to the rules on jurisdiction contained in the Maintenance Regulation. This means that a decision made in a Member State of the EU on the basis of the jurisdiction provisions contained in the Maintenance Regulation will normally be recognised in a State that has acceded to the 2007 Hague Convention. However, recognition and enforcement may be refused under certain circumstances, for instance if the decision was obtained by fraud in connection with a matter of procedure or if its recognition would be contrary to public policy.</p>
<p>Just like decisions under the Maintenance Regulation from Denmark and the UK, decisions made in a State bound by the 2007 Hague Convention must undergo an exequatur procedure to enable their enforcement in Sweden. A two-step procedure has been prescribed as it has in the Maintenance Regulation. The first stage relates to a formal consideration of the preconditions for enforcement and the other party is not given the opportunity to express his or her views. If the other party applies to change an enforceability decision, adversarial proceedings will ensue in the second stage where the other party may express his or her views.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes supplementary provisions for the exequatur review. These provisions follow the model that currently applies to decisions declared enforceable under, for instance, the Brussels I Regulation and the Lugano Conventions. The proposal means, among other things, that Svea Court of Appeal would be the competent court in both stages, that an appeal may be made to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal resulting from an application for a review, and that leave to appeal is required for the matter to be entertained by the Supreme Court. As regards Convention cases, it is also proposed that the party applying for recognition or a declaration of enforceability must submit a decision and that a decision resulting from an application for a declaration of enforceability must be served on those entitled to apply for a review. Similar provisions are included in the Maintenance Regulation. As regards the Maintenance Regulation, it is additionally proposed that there should be a provision whereby the grant of an application for enforcement by the Court of Appeal at the first stage shall be deemed to comprise a decision on provisional attachment or similar measure. The Brussels I Regulation and the ‘Act with supplementary provisions on the jurisdiction of courts and recognition and international enforcement of certain decisions’ (2006:74) contain provisions corresponding to this provision and the article contained in the Regulation to be supplemented.</p>
<p>The decisions that are directly enforceable, or that have been declared to be enforceable in Sweden, shall, as a main rule, be enforced according to Swedish law. The Committee proposes that a provision be introduced in statutory law that these decisions are to be enforced under the Enforcement Code in the same way as a corresponding Swedish judgment.</p>
<p>The Committee also proposes that Sweden should notify the Commission that the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, Swedish Enforcement Service and Social Welfare Committees are such</p>
<p>Swedish administrative authorities that, as regards maintenance matters, are to be equated with a court in the sense of the Maintenance Regulation. Corresponding notice should be provided as regards the 2007 Hague Convention, i.e. that the decisions of these Swedish administrative authorities always satisfy the requirements mentioned in Article 19.3 of the 2007 Hague Convention, which means that these decisions do not have to be provided with a special document in each individual case, indicating that the decision may be made the subject of an appeal to or review by a judicial authority and have a similar force and effect to a decision of a judicial authority on the same matter.</p>
<h2>Agreements</h2>
<p>An agreement on maintenance obligations concluded before or authenticated by an administrative authority can also be recognised and enforced under the Maintenance Regulation and the 2007 Hague Convention under certain specific circumstances, provided they are enforceable in the State of origin. According to the Maintenance Regulation, it is also possible for the parties to conclude agreements about the jurisdiction of courts in an EU Member State, with which there is some special connection. The parties can also agree under certain conditions that the law of a particular State shall apply in accordance with the 2007 Hague Protocol. This can involve both agreements about a particular law applying to a particular proceeding and agreements that are generally applicable.</p>
<p>Certain protective rules have been established for creditors in respect of generally applicable choice-of-law agreements. For example, it is not possible to conclude such agreements when a maintenance obligation applies in respect of a person under the age of 18 years or an adult who, by reason of an impairment or insufficiency of his or her personal faculties, is not in a position to protect his or her interest. Certain other protection rules also apply. The question of whether the creditor can renounce his or her right to maintenance shall be determined by the law of the State of the habitual residence of the creditor at the time of the renouncement.</p>
<p>As regards all choice-of-law agreements, if any of the parties at the time when the choice of applicable law is made were not fully informed and aware of the consequences of the choice, the law designated shall not apply where the application of this law would lead to manifestly unfair or unreasonable consequences for any of the parties.</p>
<p>The Committee does not propose any supplementary provisions for agreements. The possibility of concluding an agreement on competent courts and applicable law are directly prescribed by the international instruments. It is however stressed that attorneys and other legal advisors have particular reason to observe the provisions on agreements concerning applicable law, with regard to the fact that inadequate information may result in the agreement being rejected at subsequent proceedings.</p>
<p>Not all of the agreements concerning maintenance that can currently be concluded according to Swedish internal law satisfy the requirement prescribed by the Maintenance Regulation and the 2007 Hague Convention to enable them to be enforced in another country. The Committee emphasises that it would be useful if parents and spouses could conclude agreements on maintenance under Swedish law that are enforceable abroad to a greater extent than is currently feasible. However, this requires the introduction of a new system in Swedish law, where agreements on maintenance can be registered by or concluded before an authority, which calls for further deliberations that do not fall within the ambit of the work of this Committee.</p>
<h2>Cooperation through Central Authorities and their tasks</h2>
<p>A Central Authority should be appointed under both the Maintenance Regulation and the 2007 Hague Convention. The Central Authorities must cooperate with each other and perform the tasks prescribed by the respective instrument. These are broadly consistent. The tasks mainly involve helping an applicant to ensure that the application contains the information and the documents required, receiving applications made through a Central Authority in another country and transmitting it to the correct authority in their own country, and also, on request, helping another Central Authority with various tasks required in matters according to the instruments or themselves making a corresponding enquiry to another Central Authority. Applications must (Maintenance Regulation) or respectively may (2007 Hague</p>
<p>Convention) be made on special forms, the aim of which is to reduce translation costs and facilitate communication between the Central Authorities.</p>
<p>An individual can choose whether or not to make use of the Central Authorities. Individuals who engage the Central Authorities are entitled to free help to a greater extent.</p>
<p>In conjunction with applications  transmitted by the Central Authority of another State, the Swedish Central Authority will take all appropriate measures to, for instance, help to locate the debtor or the creditor, help obtain relevant information concerning income, encourage amicable solutions, facilitate ongoing enforcement and provide assistance in establishing parentage. Appropriate measures in each individual case depend on what the matter involves. If the application relates to a declaration of enforceability, the help provided by the Central Authority may comprise forwarding the application to the exequatur authority (Svea Court of Appeal). The Central Authority may ask for an application to be supplemented and does not have to process the application if any of this supplementary information or documentation is not submitted.</p>
<p>A  request for a special measure that the Central Authority receives from or makes to another Central Authority without any application pending may involve helping to locate the debtor or to obtain information about financial circumstances. In that way, a creditor may, for instance, learn that the debtor is in the State and the information regarding income may provide some indication of whether there is reason to proceed further with an application for enforcement.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the Government be authorised by law to appoint a Central Authority in Sweden in accordance with the Maintenance Regulation and the 2007 Hague Convention. In the opinion of the Committee, the Swedish Social Insurance Agency should be entrusted with the task of being the Central Authority. The Swedish Social Insurance Agency is already the Central Authority under the New York Convention, which will continue to apply in relation to the Convention States that have not acceded to the 2007 Hague Convention as well, and accordingly is well acquainted with the recovery of maintenance in international situations.</p>
<p>The tasks of the Central Authority have been prescribed by the Maintenance Regulation and the 2007 Hague Convention. The</p>
<p>Central Authority may draw up more detailed frameworks for its work. The Committee proposes that it should not be possible to appeal against a decision not to process an application or approve a request for a special measure from a foreign Central Authority that has been made by the Swedish Central Authority. Such a decision does not become legally effective and the foreign Central Authority can always revert with a new application. The Committee has not seen any need to rely on the possibility of appointing any other authority to perform some of the tasks for which the Central Authority is responsible according to the instruments.</p>
<p>As regards the information that is to be obtained and forwarded within the framework of the cooperation under the Maintenance Regulation, the Committee considers that the Central Authority, in conjunction with applications to obtain or amend a judgment in respect of maintenance, will have access to the information required, namely address details. If the application relates to enforcement instead, the Swedish Enforcement Authority, as enforcement authority, may make enquiries about income and assets. Only address details are relevant in the event that the application only relates to the recognition or enforceability of a decision.</p>
<p>If it concerns a request for special measures under the Maintenance Regulation, the Central Authority may need to obtain further information in addition to the address details. However, this only applies if the creditor can produce a decision that is to be enforced. The Central Authority must then use appropriate and reasonable means to obtain information about whether the defendant has income or assets in Sweden. In most cases, it would probably be sufficient for the Central Authority to get official information about the debtor’s taxed income together with interest income and expenditure. In addition, the Swedish Social Insurance Agency may have information about current income if the debtor has received social insurance benefits. This information will probably be sufficient in the vast majority of cases. Only if there is reason, should the Central Authority go further and make enquiries with other authorities. Then it is primarily the Swedish Enforcement Authority that may hold relevant information. The obligation for the Swedish Enforcement Authority to disclose information is prescribed by the Maintenance Regulation and secrecy provisions do not preclude the disclosure of information; cf. Chapter 10, Section 28 of the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400 – OSL). The Committee does not consider that there is any need to authorise any other authority to provide the Central Authority with information under the Maintenance Regulation.</p>
<p>According to the 2007 Hague Convention, the Central Authority shall take all reasonable measures to, among other things, help locate the debtor or the creditor and obtain information concerning income. There is no provision corresponding to the provision contained in the Maintenance Regulation that obliges other authorities to provide information to the Central Authority. Nor has the Committee considered it necessary to propose any such provision. The public information to which the Central Authority has access is deemed to normally be sufficient to meet the obligations under the Convention.</p>
<p>The Central Authority may, when applicable, also transmit information subject to secrecy to a foreign Central Authority. In this respect, the Maintenance Regulation requires more than the 2007 Hague Convention, but an assessment should still be made as to whether it is appropriate and reasonable for the information to be disclosed. Information subject to secrecy may be transmitted under the 2007 Hague Convention when allowed under OSL.</p>
<p>Information received by the Central Authority may be linked to a matter concerning maintenance support. Such information will then be subject to social insurance secrecy (Chapter 28, Section 1 of OSL). Otherwise, no secrecy provision currently applies to the Central Authority. The Committee proposes that the secrecy provisions contained in Chapter 28, Section 1 of OSL are also made to apply to matters under the Maintenance Regulation and the 2007 Hague Convention, and similarly to matters under the New York Convention. The Committee also proposes that a secrecy provision be introduced into OSL for courts in such matters.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that a provision be introduced into the Social Insurance Code to afford the Central Authorities the right to process personal data under the said instruments. The Committee also proposes that Central Authorities should be allowed to transfer personal data to competent authorities in a third country (that is, a State outside the EU and EEA) if this is necessary. It is otherwise considered that the current law relating to the processing and holding of personal data is adequate to meet the obligations contained in the Maintenance Regulation and the 2007 Hague Convention.</p>
<h2>Direct applications</h2>
<p>Both the Maintenance Regulation and the 2007 Hague Convention are based on applications being made through Central Authorities, but this is not an absolute requirement. It is still possible to make a ‘direct application’ to a competent authority. In these cases, the applicant must also be afforded access to a judicial review. However, there is no obligation in any case to provide free legal aid or free legal assistance (see further below). Nor do the provisions on cooperation apply, which means that the Central Authority cannot help the applicant to locate the debtor and ensure that the application is complete.</p>
<h2>Legal aid and legal assistance</h2>
<p>According to both the Maintenance Regulation and the 2007 Hague Convention, the States are liable to give the parties to a maintenance dispute access to a judiciary review. To ensure this access, the States must provide legal aid (Maintenance Regulation) and legal assistance (2007 Hague Convention). Legal aid in this context has a different meaning to legal aid under the Legal Aid Act (1996:1619). The scope of the legal aid and legal assistance respectively must be assessed from case to case, depending on what the matter involves.</p>
<p>The Maintenance Regulation specifies what the legal aid must cover as necessary, such as legal assistance in bringing a case before an authority or a court and representation in court, interpretation and translation, exemption from or assistance with the costs of proceedings and the fees to persons mandated to take measures during the proceedings. The 2007 Hague Convention provides examples of what legal assistance may cover, such as, for instance, legal advice. The States can also meet their obligations through the Central Authority providing general information or forwarding an application to the exequatur authority.</p>
<p>Legal aid and legal assistance must be provided without charge when an application is made by a creditor, through a Central</p>
<p>Authority, and relates to a maintenance obligation based on a parent-child relationship for a child under the age of 21. In other cases, legal aid and legal assistance is provided under the preconditions prescribed by national law on the basis of an assessment of need and reasonableness. A public body that may under certain conditions be regarded as a creditor and that, for instance, is entitled to reimbursement of maintenance support provided may also be entitled to legal aid and legal assistance respectively.</p>
<p>When legal aid or legal assistance is to be provided through a legal aid counsel under the Legal Aid Act, the Committee considers that the point of departure should be that legal aid is provided in the circumstances and on the conditions prescribed by the Legal Aid Act. In cases where legal aid or legal assistance is to be without charge, the Committee proposes that a number of the provisions contained in the Legal Aid Act are exempted from application. There should not, for instance, be any investigation of the applicant’s financial resources and nor should special reasons be required to grant legal aid. This means that in these cases costs for legal aid will be covered entirely by the State.</p>
<h2>General provisions and final clauses and attached forms</h2>
<p>The instruments also contain general provisions and final provisions. Some of these are directed at the States and are not for application in an individual case, such as the provisions relating to reservations and the signing of and accession to the instruments.</p>
<p>Forms have been produced and are included as appendices to the Maintenance Regulation and to the 2007 Hague Convention. These shall be used in various situations as mentioned in individual articles, for example in conjunction with applications.</p>
<p>As regards language and translation, the Committee considers that Sweden should accept applications and forms completed in and translations made into Swedish, Danish or English (the Maintenance Regulation) and Swedish, Danish, English or Norwegian (the 2007 Hague Convention). This should be prescribed in the form of an ordinance. It should also be possible for contacts between the Central Authorities to be conducted in these languages; and as regards the Convention, in addition to the prescribed languages, English and French. However, if the EU provides for the possibility of reservation against the use of French, the Committee is of the opinion that Sweden should make such a reservation.</p>
<p>The provisions of the Maintenance Regulation shall apply to proceedings instituted, to settlements approved by or concluded before a court, and to authentic instruments established after its date of application; that is, 18 June 2011. The provisions on recognition, enforceability and enforcement can under certain conditions also apply to decisions made before then. The 2007 Hague Convention in its turn shall apply to applications or requests received by the Central Authority or the competent authority (in the case of direct applications) in the requesting State after the Convention entered into force between the States. Special provisions apply to recognition and enforcement for those States that are also parties to the 1958 Hague Convention and the 1973 Hague Convention. The 2007 Hague Protocol shall not apply to maintenance claimed in a State relating to a period prior to the entry into force of the Protocol. Within the EU, the Protocol shall to a certain extent apply from and including 18 June 2011 (that is, from the date of application of this Maintenance Regulation) and then also as regards determining the law applicable to maintenance claimed relating to a period prior to the entry into force of the Protocol.</p>
<h2>Incorporation of instruments and legal technical solutions</h2>
<p>The Maintenance Regulation is an EU Regulation that will apply directly in Sweden. The 2007 Hague Protocol will also be directly applicable as of the EU acceding to the Protocol and the Member States (with the exception of Denmark and the UK) are bound by the Protocol through the EU’s accession.</p>
<p>As regards the 2007 Hague Convention, according to what the Committee has learned and on the basis of the negotiations conducted so far, it may be assumed that the EU will accede to the Convention. Sweden will then be bound through the EU’s accession, which means that the 2007 Hague Convention will also become directly applicable in Sweden. For this reason, no proposals are made regarding the incorporation of the 2007 Hague Convention. Nor can Sweden on its own volition extend the scope of the Convention or make reservations in relation to individual provisions unless this has been expressly allowed by the EU. For this reason, the Committee makes no such proposal.</p>
<p>The Committee’s proposal for supplementary provisions to the Maintenance Regulation and the 2007 Hague Convention have been put into an enactment of its own.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions</h2>
<p>The Committee’s proposal for supplementary provisions should enter into force at the same time as the Maintenance Regulation, the 2007 Hague Convention and the 2007 Hague Protocol. The Maintenance Regulation and the 2007 Hague Protocol shall apply from 18 June 2011. It is not yet clear whether the same will apply to the 2007 Hague Convention. For this reason, it should be left to the Government to decide when the proposed legislation should enter into force.</p>
<p>The Committee’s proposal for supplementary provisions does not require any transitional provisions. On the other hand, transitional provisions are proposed regarding the proposal to change the provisions on the jurisdiction of courts and choice of law contained in the Act concerning certain International Legal Relationships relating to Marriage and Guardianship. The jurisdiction of a court will not lapse in relation to maintenance in a case instituted under Chapter 3, Sections 6 or 12 prior to entry into force. Such cases must be considered under the old law.</p>
