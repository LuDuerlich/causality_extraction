<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Marine Environment Inquiry was appointed by the Govern- ment in 2006 to look into ways in which Swedish marine environ- ment efforts can be improved nationally and together with other countries. The original terms of reference primarily involved knowledge-related issues. The Government’s supplementary terms of reference extended the Inquiry’s assignment to also include issues concerning administration and planning.</p>
<p>Despite a large number of initiatives and international agree- ments, the environmental situation of the seas surrounding Sweden is far from acceptable. Warning reports on algal blooms and oxy- gen-deficient sea-beds occur almost every summer. The status of fish stocks is worse than ever. The enormous volume of shipping in the Baltic Sea is accompanied by a considerable risk of a shipping accident with extensive oil discharges as a result.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that it is high time for a third-generation environmental policy. This third-generation environmental policy must entail a holistic approach and full integration of environ- mental issues into all policy areas, stronger political leadership and, to a much greater extent, an international focus. With its long coastlines and large marine acreage, it is in Sweden’s interests to clearly pursue issues related to the Baltic Sea and North Sea envi- ronments.</p>
<p>Intergovernmental management of the marine environment</p>
<p>The EU Marine Directive, which is expected to be adopted in 2008, and HELCOM’s Baltic Sea Action Plan provide the conditions for intergovernmental cooperation to improve the marine environ- ment. The Directive will allow the designation of marine areas with particularly serious environmental conditions as pilot areas, which</p>
<p>will mean bringing forward action programmes and enable stricter protective measures to be taken.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that Sweden take the initiative for deeper cooperation with neighbouring countries to implement the EU Marine Directive. In the case of the Baltic Sea, implementation should take place in the framework of a pilot area and be coordi- nated by HELCOM. The point of departure should be the meas- ures in the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan, but these need to be supplemented in several respects. Sweden should take action to promote a more extensive integration of marine environmental issues in EU agricultural, fisheries and regional policies than is the case today. A special challenge facing the pilot area will be sectoral integration. The countries of the Baltic Sea region should cooper- ate to achieve joint positions on these issues.</p>
<p>Sweden should work to promote the establishment of an inter- governmental fund in the framework of the pilot area to finance projects and other measures aimed at improving the Baltic Sea envi- ronment. The purpose of this fund is to contribute to better coor- dination of marine environment initiatives taken in the form of projects and of the marine environment-related investments made with the support of investment banks. It should also be possible for the fund to provide support for developing project ideas for environment investment projects that meet the requirements for loans from investment banks and grants from private foundations. HELCOM should administer this fund. Sweden should work towards ensuring that money from the EU structural fund pro- gramme Interreg III for the Baltic Sea region, and parts of the structural funds for the EU agricultural and fisheries policies, are channelled to this fund.</p>
<p>The Government should draft an action plan for how Sweden will act in the EU and internationally on issues concerning the marine environment. The plan is to contain a timetable determin- ing when it is important to act in the context of various policy areas and organisations. The opportunities presented, for example, by Sweden’s Presidency of the EU in 2009 should be used to put the marine environment issue and the Baltic Sea problem on to the European agenda. Sweden should take action in good time before the evaluation of the EU fisheries policy in 2012.</p>
<p>HELCOM’s position as an intergovernmental actor for marine environment efforts in the Baltic Sea region needs to be strength- ened. Sweden should work to ensure that annual meetings are held</p>
<p>between the countries’ environment ministers, and in the long- term even between the countries’ heads of government, to empha- sise how important the marine environment issue is. A committee should be established in HELCOM to control compliance with the Helsinki Convention and the HELCOM Action Plan, with the competence to deal with complaints from Member States, agencies and the general public in the entire Baltic Sea region.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Environmental Protec- tion Agency be appointed as the agency responsible for imple- mentation of the EU Marine Directive and for overall marine envi- ronment administration in Sweden.</p>
<p>Planning of Swedish marine environments</p>
<p>Despite the many conflicting interests and environmental prob- lems, there is seldom any planning of marine environments corre- sponding to the physical planning that occurs for areas on land. The risk of conflict between various interests is particularly great in coastal and archipelago areas close to metropolitan regions, on off- shore banks and in connection with other countries’ claims on the use of Sweden’s exclusive economic zone.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes the introduction of a new planning sys- tem for Sweden’s marine areas. This planning should be based on marine plans similar to the comprehensive plans for land areas. These marine plans should however contain binding components in the form of fixed zones for use and protection. The ecosystem approach should serve to guide the planning. These marine plans should comprise all open sea from the coast to the outer border of Sweden’s exclusive economic zone. It is proposed that responsibil- ity for drafting marine plans in Swedish territory lie at regional level. Since Sweden still lacks a uniform system for a regional level of government, it is proposed that existing regional bodies, i.e., regional pilot projects, regional cooperation bodies and regional development planning associations, be responsible for implement- ing regional marine planning until further notice. In formal terms, this proposal means limiting the planning responsibility of primary municipalities. In practice, the consequences for the municipalities are expected to be marginal since most of them do not conduct any planning of the open sea. By actively taking part in regional plan- ning, which is proposed in the Inquiry, municipal influence over</p>
<p>open seas may increase instead. The state should have overall responsibility for planning throughout Sweden’s marine area.</p>
<p>The exclusive economic zone is an area in which Sweden, as a coastal state, has certain rights, but where account must also be taken of other states’ rights, for example, to sail their ships or to put underwater cables in place. Planning of the exclusive economic zone must be based on these conditions. Sweden’s exclusive eco- nomic zone is not divided by county or municipality. The Inquiry therefore considers that the state should assume responsibility for planning the exclusive economic zone. Such a solution will also improve the prospects of cooperation with other countries with regard to planning activities affecting several countries’ exclusive economic zones.</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning be given overall responsibility for planning the Swedish marine areas, and specific responsibility for planning the exclusive economic zone. This responsibility will include reviewing regional marine plans against certain criteria and having a supervisory function with regard to regional planning. The activi- ties of the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning will need to be changed in important respects because of this new assignment. Many other central government agencies will also need to participate, particularly in providing data for planning.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals should be seen as a model for how to design a planning system. When the principles of the planning system have been established, the Government should appoint a legal and implementation inquiry to make a detailed examination of legislation and responsibility issues. The relevant legislation includes the Planning and Building Act, the Environmental Code, the Continental Shelf Act, the Swedish Exclusive Economic Zone Act, and the Local Government Act. How responsibility inside the ‘baseline’ is to be divided between the municipal and regional levels should also be examined.</p>
<p>The attention of the Marine Environment Inquiry has been drawn to the fact that there are several ambiguities in the adminis- trative and legal boundaries applying to the sea. The baseline sys- tem and the various boundaries for maritime jurisdiction need to be reviewed in order to give them the precision made possible by modern technology.</p>
<p>Knowledge to support administration</p>
<p>The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency’s responsibility for control and coordination of environmental monitoring and other regular surveys needs to be clarified and strengthened. This should be done by extending the rights of the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency to issue regulations on environmental moni- toring, especially with regard to the state of the marine environ- ment. To strengthen coordination of Swedish marine environment efforts, the Inquiry proposes the establishment of a new marine environment council linked to the Swedish Environmental Protec- tion Agency. It is proposed that the new council replace the pre- sent Coordination Group and today’s Marine Environment Coun- cil. The new marine environment council should also be tasked with coordinating agencies’ work on monitoring and surveying. The task of the marine environment council should be to coordi- nate issues where there is no clear division of labour under the leg- islation and appropriation directions, and to bring issues requiring its participation or taking a decision to the Government’s atten- tion. A broad composition of members and experts in the council will provide the conditions for a dialogue between the state, the business sector and NGOs on issues related to the marine envi- ronment.</p>
<p>The responsibility of county administrative boards for informa- tion in marine environmental emergencies should be clarified. The information centres at the county administrative boards in the counties of Västerbotten, Stockholm and Västra Götaland, run under the auspices of the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, fill an important function. However, by including this task in their instructions, county administrative boards should take over responsibility for these activities as a whole. This will improve con- ditions for developing these activities, and for coordination between county administrative boards.</p>
<p>To be able to carry out vigorous measures for monitoring and surveying under the Water Framework Directive, a uniform organisation is required with a clear division of responsibilities between different levels. Today’s structure with five water agencies belonging to county administrative board organisations and lacking formal coordination presents a confusing picture vis-à-vis the sur- rounding world. It also risks leading to inefficiency in implementa- tion. Because of this, the Inquiry proposes a review of the way in</p>
<p>which water administration is organised as soon as possible and no later than the presentation of the first stages of the administrative plans and programmes of measures in 2009. Even now, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency should be given clear responsi- bility for coordination of water administration at the national level. It should also be responsible for coordinating water administration with marine administration. It is proposed that the Swedish Board of Fisheries and the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute be given clearer responsibility for providing data to the water agencies.</p>
<p>Monitoring the water environment is an important part of implementing the Water Framework Directive. Water agencies in Sweden are to ensure that a monitoring programme is established, but who is to implement and finance these programmes in practice is not made clear in the legislation. Based on the ‘polluter pays’ principle, and on requirements for cost recovery under the Water Framework Directive, the operator should be responsible for con- trolling and monitoring the water reserves affected by its opera- tions. The Inquiry proposes that provisions on the responsibility of the operator for monitoring the water environment be included in the Environmental Code. It is proposed to give the water agencies legal authority to order operators to take part in, or finance, monitoring programmes. To achieve full cost recovery, the Gov- ernment should examine how water charges can be used to sup- plement the proposed amendments to the regulations. Water charges are probably a pre-condition so that smaller operations, such as private sewage systems and diffuse pollution sources can also be included.</p>
<p>The need for information about depth, the state of the seabed, and the prevalence and extent of marine habitats and species is enormous. Detailed information is particularly required to imple- ment the proposed marine plan and to establish marine reserves. The Inquiry proposes that a national programme for surveying the marine landscape be implemented over a five-year period. The pro- gramme should be led by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and implemented primarily in cooperation with the Swedish Maritime Administration, the Geological Survey of Sweden and the Swedish Species Information Centre.</p>
<p>Strategic research initiatives are also needed in terms of exten- sive, comprehensive research programmes targeted at the marine environment to raise the level of knowledge and to support the</p>
<p>marine environmental work of agencies and other actors. As part of future efforts for research, the Government should allocate SEK 40 million per year over a five-year period to research in the following areas:</p>
<p>- Research on complex interactions and processes , particularly the ecosystem’s structure and function, the turnover and transport of substances, and interaction effects.</p>
<p>- Research to support  decision-making and management , particu- larly policy instruments, joint management and models sup- porting decisions.</p>
<p>- Research on measures and environmental recovery , particularly ecosystem impacts, time aspects,  cost-efficiency  and acceptance of measures.</p>
<p>- Research to support environmental monitoring and analysis of environmental data , particularly the development of pro- grammes, methods and techniques, analysis of environmental monitoring data and new environmental threats.</p>
<p>Those financing research should also be assigned the task of fund- ing new research posts in the field of environmental analysis and new doctoral and research posts in social science research focused on the marine environment. The Government should take the ini- tiative to evaluate Swedish marine environment research in the next two years.</p>
<p>There is a great need of scientific and interdisciplinary syntheses in all areas involving the marine environment. Synthesis efforts must therefore be strengthened, both nationally and internation- ally. An international scientific marine environment panel for the Baltic Sea should be established as part of advanced intergovern- mental work to improve the Baltic Sea environment. The task of this panel should be to synthesise research and develop scenarios and models to support the solution of marine environmental problems. This panel should be linked with HELCOM.</p>
<p>Researchers at Swedish universities and other higher education institutions should take part more extensively in the international working groups of HELCOM, OSPAR, ICES and other organisa- tions. The Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Environmental Pro- tection Agency and the Swedish Board of Fisheries fund researcher participation. Swedish researchers should also be given greater</p>
<p>opportunities to conduct research that entails synthesis of research and survey results.</p>
<p>As part of developing a sustainable fishing sector, the produc- tion of selective fishing equipment and development of low-impact methods of fishing should be intensified. It is proposed to give the Swedish Board of Fisheries this task.</p>
<p>Professional fishermen’s knowledge about the environment and ecology needs to be improved. The Inquiry proposes that a com- pleted, certified training in environment and ecology be required in order to obtain a professional fishing licence. The shorter courses for professional fishermen organised on both the east and west coasts provide a good basis for developing a certified course in environment and ecology. These courses should continue to be supported by the Swedish Board of Fisheries. The programme spe- cialising in fisheries given at Öckerö Upper Secondary School should include elements that meet the certification requirements.</p>
<p>Databases</p>
<p>The increased use of marine resources leads to a greater need for in-depth information on marine areas. Efficient administration of the marine environment and successful research require not only information on the marine environment but also access to a con- siderable amount of other information, for example, about catch- ment areas, shipping, size of population and climate.</p>
<p>Secrecy surrounding detailed information concerning depth and the state of the seabed is seen as a major problem by agencies and researchers working on marine environmental issues. In the opin- ion of the Inquiry, there is no reason to retain general secrecy applying to information involving depth and the state of the sea- bed. The Inquiry therefore proposes that a review be made of leg- islation concerning the protection of landscape information as soon as possible. The point of departure for this review should be that data on depth is to be freely accessible to as great an extent as possible. When formulating new legislation, account must be taken of various factors, such as the climate and environment, as well as military threats. Consideration must also be given to technological developments that now make it easy for private people to measure depth.</p>
<p>A further barrier to free access to data is the fees charged by several agencies. The system involving fees for data leads, for example, to certain agencies and municipalities not having access to the data that they need in their work. This means that the quality of the data on which decisions are based is not sufficiently good, which can lead to the wrong decisions being taken. It also restricts the scope of researchers and other experts, thus preventing the development of new knowledge.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that data produced by agencies and funded from the central government budget be freely available for non-commercial activities in agencies, regional bodies, municipali- ties, universities and other higher education institutions. It is pro- posed to fund this by redistributing appropriations from agencies buying data to agencies selling data. Reduced revenue for agencies caused by regional bodies and municipalities having access to free data should be compensated for via increased appropriations to the agencies concerned.</p>
<p>Much of the information that agencies and other actors have collected in the context of environmental monitoring and different types of investigations and surveys is not easily accessible to other users. Even at the planning stage of new investigations and surveys, the question must be raised of where and how data is to be stored and made available.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute be appointed as the agency responsible for coordination of storage methods for data relevant to marine envi- ronmental work and of making it available. This responsibility should include coordination of the development of joint standards, quality labelling and other support for making data available via the Internet and issuing guidelines for its use.</p>
<p>The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency should be tasked with developing portals enabling the coordinated presenta- tion of data. Data is to be downloadable in the same format and presentation of data is to be supported by map services and inter- active tools so that simple types of analysis can be made.</p>
<p>Research and survey vessels</p>
<p>To be able to conduct national marine environmental monitoring, marine research and survey activities in coastal and offshore areas, vessels are needed that are able to operate in these waters. Sweden also has international commitments that require access to larger vessels. Both agencies and researchers at higher education institu- tions therefore need vessels that can operate in coastal zones and offshore areas for shorter or longer periods. Agencies and univer- sities have resolved the need for vessels in different ways. These solutions have in some cases been relatively long-term, but in oth- ers have only applied to one or a few years. The agencies and uni- versities that have been able to acquire a vessel of their own have been able to meet their needs for a vessel relatively well, while those who have not had the same financial conditions have had to rely on other solutions.</p>
<p>Sweden is in a problematic situation with regard to access to large vessels for research and surveys as in principle all the vessels are in a poor condition and are approaching an age where, in the relatively near future, they must be replaced unless expensive reno- vations and investments are made.</p>
<p>Vessels are associated with enormous costs in terms of interest, depreciation, maintenance and staff, even when they are not in use. Today several of the research and survey vessels are not fully used. The Swedish Board of Fisheries’ vessel Argos is in dock relatively often, since its poor condition means that it has to be regularly repaired. Today’s organisation with vessels at several agencies and universities is not optimal from an economic perspective.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that vessels used in marine environmental monitoring, surveying and research be coordinated under one organisation. As a first step, the vessels used for environmental monitoring and research by the Swedish Board of Fisheries, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, the Swedish Meteoro- logical and Hydrological Institute, universities and other higher education institutions, and smaller state actors, should be coordi- nated. At a later stage, if considered appropriate, vessels needed for the surveying activities of the Geological Survey of Sweden and the Swedish Maritime Administration can be included. The Swedish Coast Guard should be tasked with providing research and survey vessels. Its tasks will also include short- and long-term planning of activities and procuring, delivering, maintaining and equipping</p>
<p>these vessels. This new assignment would strengthen the environ- mental profile of the Swedish Coast Guard and in the long term, make this agency an important actor in marine environmental work.</p>
<p>Communications</p>
<p>Communications are an important part of the marine environ- mental strategy. However, agencies and other actors must broaden their channels of communication. Better use must be made of the great interest of the general public in marine environmental issues, and their commitment to them. The Government should therefore take the initiative for a broad communication effort on the marine environment, based on dialogue and cooperation between the actors. It is proposed that financial support be available to agencies, municipalities, industrial organisations and interest organisations for a dialogue and cooperation projects of relevance to the marine environment.</p>
