<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit of the Committee</h2>
<p>According to its terms of reference, the Building Rules Modernisation Committee has to submit three reports. The Committee’s remit for this report is to investigate the need for policy tools to reduce environmental impact, including reducing the spread of particularly hazardous substances during the construction process. This report, the Committee’s second report, is about the resource-efficient use of building materials. It does not include proposals concerning building and control regulations, which will be presented in the Committee’s final report.</p>
<h2>The public objective is resource-efficient use of building materials</h2>
<p>The built environment is of central importance in attaining a sustainable society. The United Nations’ 17 Global Goals for sustainable development in the 2030 Agenda include the efficient use of natural resources and the minimisation of waste through reuse and recycling. An increased focus in the European Union (EU) on resource efficiency has resulted in several initiatives for the construction sector stating that resource efficiency is to be achieved through conscious choices of materials, adapted design of construction works and the reuse and recycling of construction products and materials.</p>
<p>The Committee has analysed whether there is a need for regulation to promote resource-efficient use of building materials. The Committee has summarised the meaning of resource-efficient use of building materials as an endeavour to manufacture and use construction products with as long a lifetime as possible. This is made possible by retaining the value of materials and construction products and by minimising construction and demolition waste through reuse and recycling.</p>
<h2>The use of building materials is not resource-efficient</h2>
<p>The use of building materials is not resource-efficient, either in the EU or in Sweden. Construction and demolition generate a third of society’s total quantities of waste in both the EU and Sweden. The objective is to reuse or recycle waste in the first place. By 2020, 70 per cent of non-hazardous construction and demolition waste (by weight) has to be reused or recycled. On average, the reuse and recycling of such waste in 2014 amounted to 58 per cent in Sweden and 50 per cent in the EU. Despite the low recycling efficiency in the EU and Sweden, there is potential to reuse and recycle more construction products since there is a great deal of value in certain materials. Materials gathered in buildings have the potential to be used as material banks that can be reused or recycled. However, as shown below, there are obstacles to a more resource-efficient use of building materials.</p>
<h2>Objectives of the Committee’s proposals</h2>
<p>The public objectives and aims that are relevant to a resourceefficient use of building materials are not being achieved. The Committee’s overall objective for its proposals is therefore to promote and drive the development of a resource-efficient use of building materials throughout the lifecycle of construction works. The Committee wants to achieve this by enabling market actors to make conscious choices of materials and facilitate developments in this area.</p>
<p>To meet this objective the Committee presents two proposals. The first proposal, about lists of contents of construction products, is intended to create conditions for resource-efficient use of building materials in the long term in Sweden and the EU. The Committee then goes on to present a second proposal in order to drive and accelerate development in the direction of resource-efficient use of building materials in Sweden.</p>
<h2>Lists of contents of construction products</h2>
<p>The Committee’s first proposal is that the Government should propose that the European Commission (the Commission) drafts a proposal to the Council of the European Union (the Council) and the European Parliament about requirements for lists of contents of construction products in Article 6.5 of the EU’s Construction Products Regulation . As a starting point, lists of contents of construction products should:</p>
<p>• apply to all construction products covered by a harmonised standard or a European Technical Assessment, with the existing derogations stated in Articles 5 and 38 of the Construction Products Regulation,</p>
<p>• cover all components of construction products in the first place and, in the second place, substances according to Annex VI of the CLP regulation and the substances covered by existing requirements in Articles 31 and 33 of REACH , and</p>
<p>• specify the occurrence of nanomaterials in construction products.</p>
<p>National requirements concerning information about construction products that affect the conditions for marketing such construction products are not permitted. Regulation imposing requirements for lists of contents of construction products therefore needs to be put in place in the EU.</p>
<h2>A national promotion package for resource-efficient choices of building materials to reduce construction and demolition waste</h2>
<p>To press forward developments in the direction of resource-efficient choices of building materials in Sweden the Committee makes a second proposal to the effect that the Government should commission the Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (Vinnova), for a total of ten years starting in 2019, to:</p>
<p>• establish one or more groups of actors that have a decisive influence on choices of building materials included in buildings that want to make  resource-efficient choices of building materials (buyer groups),</p>
<p>• provide funding for development and research studies in order to achieve close to  zero-waste buildings by the reuse and recycling of construction products and materials, and</p>
<p>• spread information about the experience of the work of the buyer groups and development and research studies to other buyers, architects, technical consultants and other relevant recipients.</p>
<h2>Two main obstacles</h2>
<p>The Committee’s analysis has shown that there are two main obstacles to resource-efficient use of building materials: lack of information about the contents of construction products and lack of economic incentives to reuse and recycle construction products.</p>
<p>The lack of information about the occurrence of hazardous substances in existing construction products both impedes and prevents the reuse and recycling of these products. Similarly, a lack of information about the content of new products results in ignorance of what substances and materials are being built into the construction works of the future. A further aspect of the problem is that construction products often consist of several different materials and substances, the composition of which can differ. Construction products are built into construction works with long lifetimes at the same time as knowledge about what substances result in harm to human health and the environment develops gradually over time.</p>
<p>As regards the lack of economic incentives, the production of materials seldom bears its negative environmental costs, which means that using new building materials can be cheaper than recycling or reusing used materials. A number of factors affect the materials choices made, and they include price, agreements and ambitions. Future resource use is steered to a high degree by the choices of building materials made, since construction works contain large volumes of building materials.</p>
<h2>Lists of the contents of construction products are fundamental and enabling</h2>
<p>To solve the obstacle of a lack of information about the contents of construction products the Committee proposes that the Government should work for the regulation of lists of contents of construction products. The need for further information about the contents of construction products is stressed consistently by a unanimous construction industry and also by the Government and government agencies in Sweden and the Council in order to attain resourceefficient use of building materials. According to these actors, the content information that has to be reported today under REACH is not sufficient since it covers far too few substances. Nor is the voluntary system of construction product declarations in operation in Sweden sufficient according to several actors since it is a voluntary system and is not used by all suppliers of building materials in Sweden, far less in Europe. These actors consider that a list of the contents of construction products would:</p>
<p>• facilitate specifications and enable conscious choices of new products and materials,</p>
<p>• limit risks of hazardous substances in the manufacture and purchasing of new products,</p>
<p>• make procurement criteria possible for  resource-efficient construction products,</p>
<p>• facilitate traceability of hazardous substances and improve the use of a log book,</p>
<p>• facilitate identification of contents of construction products when a  clean-up may be needed as new hazardous substances are discovered, thereby generating cost savings,</p>
<p>• make possible markets for the reuse and recycling of construction products to be manufactured,</p>
<p>• assess which products and materials can be reused and recycled in renovation and at demolition, and</p>
<p>• assess which products and materials should be phased out on account of hazardous substances in renovation and at demolition.</p>
<p>The Committee’s proposal for lists of contents also contributes to the possibilities of attaining public objectives adopted concerning less waste, a non-toxic environment, management of natural resources and a reduced climate impact.</p>
<p>Finally, requirements for lists of contents contribute to a complete system of traceability of construction products along with the log book for construction products included in construction works recently proposed by the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning. The aggregate information from lists of contents and log books would show what construction products are present in construction works and what they contain. According to the Committee, this would further increase the possibilities of reuse and recycling and prevent costs for making inventories in connection with decontamination measures.</p>
<h2>The promotion package will be a catalyst for resource-efficient choices of building materials in the construction sector</h2>
<p>As stated above by the Committee, choices of building materials are of central importance for the possibilities of attaining resourceefficient use of building materials, since they affect the possibilities of recycling and reusing all or parts of construction products.</p>
<p>The Committee therefore makes a proposal for a promotion package for resource-efficient choices of building materials in Sweden. The proposal is not primarily intended to address either of the two obstacles identified by the Committee (lack of information about</p>
<p>the content of construction products and lack of economic incentives to reuse and recycle construction products) but is instead intended to drive developments to initiate more resource-efficient choices of building materials in the construction sector. However, the work of buyer groups is based on them obtaining knowledge about the content of construction products when they act in the capacity of buyers in their own operations. Ultimately, buyer groups are therefore able to contribute to the voluntary disclosure of information about content. Moreover, the research studies proposed by the Committee can contribute to more knowledge about how the second obstacle of a lack of economic incentives can be dealt with, since they should have an economic perspective.</p>
<p>A number of initiatives are currently under way in the construction sector, but a large portion of development investments in construction are made in individual construction projects. Experience shows that development initiatives can come a long way, but that companies and organisations in the construction sector have difficulty in drawing long-term benefits from the resources put into development projects. The project-based activities in the construction sector provide weak and short-term linkages between actors and can impair learning, the spread of innovations and productivity growth. The Committee’s analysis shows that there is a need for further drivers, knowledge and collaboration to attain resource-efficient use of building materials. The Committee’s assessment is therefore that a national promotion package is needed to coordinate actors and spread new knowledge.</p>
