<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Part of our assignment was to consider whether the separation of the provisions of chapter 15 of the Secrecy Act (1980:100) concerning the registration of official documents etc. and the provisions of the Public Records Act (1990:782) concerning the importance of recording documents for records management etc. is appropriate. Basically, these provisions serve the same purpose and partly overlap.</p>
<p>Public authorities’ management of their documents is relevant to the question of access to official documents both in the short and the long term. To ensure the transparency that is the objective of the right of public access to official documents, the relevant provisions must be clear and easy to understand. Otherwise there is a risk of diminished legal certainty and administrative effectiveness and efficiency. Lack of clear legislation might also prejudice the establishment and preservation of a body of official documents that form part of our national cultural heritage.</p>
<p>To ensure that people can exercise their right of access to official documents, and that the provisions can easily be applied by the authorities, we consider it necessary to coordinate the current rules concerning authorities’ management of official documents. This would eliminate overlapping rules and make the legislation more transparent, which would benefit both the implementing authorities and individuals.</p>
<p>The authorities’ compliance with their obligations must not be determined by their choice of technical solutions. Measures must be taken to make it possible to apply the rules in a different technological environment. The aim should therefore be to ensure that the rules concerning the management of official documents are as technology-neutral as possible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, familiarity with the rules guaranteeing the right of access to official documents is essential if they are to have the desired effect. This applies to all levels of public administration. Familiarity with the rules is necessary both in connection with decisions to purchase new computer systems and decisions to release official documents. Persons who wish to see official documents also need to know about the procedure for searching for documents and information kept by the authorities. This makes it necessary to raise awareness, both in public administration and among the public, about the rules concerning the right of access to official documents.</p>
<h2>Our proposals A new Act concerning the management of official documents</h2>
<p>We propose that the provisions of chapter 15 of the Secrecy Act (1980:100) and the provisions of the Public Records Act (1990:782) be integrated into a new Act: the Management of Official Documents Act. This Act should set out all the requirements to be met by public authorities throughout the process of handling official documents. This would make it clear that it is the authority that uses the documents in its activities that must make official documents available so that citizens can exercise their right of access. Bringing the provisions together in a separate Act would ensure that they are neutral with respect to the management of official documents that are used by an authority and of documents that are no longer of immediate relevance to its activities.</p>
<p>It has been proposed that a new provision be inserted in chapter 2 of the Freedom of the Press Act as of January 1 2003 to the effect that basic provisions relating to the preservation, deletion and other disposal of official documents must be issued in a statutory instrument. The purpose of this provision would be to emphasize the importance of these matters in the context of the right of public access guaranteed in chapter 2 of the Freedom of the Press Act. Since one of the purposes of the new Act proposed by us is the same, it is well in line with the ongoing amendment of the Freedom of the Press Act.</p>
<p>Some of the main elements of the proposed Act are presented below.</p>
<h2>Purposes of the new Act</h2>
<p>These purposes are set out in the introductory section of the new Act. They are to safeguard the right of access to official documents laid down in the Freedom of the Press Act, to protect official documents that are part of the national cultural heritage, to meet the need of information for judicial and administrative purposes, and to satisfy research needs. The section also stipulates that public authorities must register, organize, keep and otherwise manage their official documents in such a way as to achieve these purposes.</p>
<h2>A good public access structure</h2>
<p>We propose that the Act should contain a technology-neutral rule specifying requirements with respect to the authorities’ management of official documents in order to safeguard the right of access to official documents. Such a specification must be made in general terms, since it will be applied by many different bodies. The proposed provision would require authorities, in connection with the organization of their documents, to ensure: 1. that official documents must be kept separate from other documents; 2. that citizens can exercise their right of access under the Freedom of the Press Act, while ensuring necessary confidentiality; 3. that official documents shall be released with the promptness required under the Freedom of the Press Act; 4. that the content of official documents must be presented in the form in which when they were received or drawn up by the authority and that any alterations or additions are recorded, together with the date; 5. that documents used by an authority as a source of information in connection with the handling of cases or other procedures are linked to other documents relating to the case; 6. that official documents associated with a case are presented in collected form so as to indicate the progress of the procedure; 7. that it is clear when and under which provision official documents should be deleted from the records or should otherwise cease to be kept by the authorities; 8. that official documents do not contain unnecessary abbreviations or other items that might obstruct access within the meaning of the Freedom of the Press Act.</p>
<h2>Registration and description of official documents</h2>
<p>In the new Act, all rules concerning the registration and listing of official documents will be gathered together in one place. This will make it easier both for authority officials and for individuals desiring access to official documents to apply the rules.</p>
<p>We propose that public authorities should register or organize official documents in the same way as today. Authorities should also keep a register of the document types that occur in their activities and prepare a description of their official documents.</p>
<p>The register of document types should replace the list of records required under the Public Records Act (1990:782), while the description of official documents should replace the description of records under that Act and the description of computer records under the Secrecy Act.</p>
<p>The term ‘document types’ means official documents which, due to their association with a certain type of procedure, subject matter or function of an authority, can be assigned to a particular type. Minutes of board meetings, criminal case files and patients’ case records from a specific department are some examples of document types. The register of document types should include data on the names of the document types, a more detailed description of the content where applicable, the relevant period, the method of access and other data that may be necessary to understand and access the documents.</p>
<p>The purpose of the description of authorities’ official documents is to give other parties an overview of the documents, in both paper and electronic form, to which an authority has access. It should therefore include information about the authority’s activities and organization and about the main types of cases and their implications for record creation.</p>
<h2>Deletion</h2>
<p>Deletion is the most drastic measure can be taken by authorities with respect to official documents. The result of deleting a document is irrevocable since the information is destroyed once the measure has been taken. This applies not only to complete destruction of a document. Information can also be lost due to the handling of documents, for example transfers of files from one computer platform to another. In order to raise awareness of the impact of authorities’ handling of official documents on the right of access, we propose that the term ‘deletion’ be defined in the new Act. According to the proposed definition, deletion means the destruction of official documents or other handling of official documents or data in them that leads to loss of information, loss of any aggregated information, loss of search facilities or loss of the possibility of establishing the authenticity (genuineness and original state) of a document.</p>
<p>As regards other aspects of the deletion of documents, our proposal is consistent with the rules of the Public Records Act (1990:782).</p>
<h2>Automated data processing records that constitute official documents and are available to several authorities</h2>
<p>The provisions relating to automated data processing records that constitute official documents and are available to several authorities are coordinated in the new Act. In our opinion, special rules should apply to such records, as is the case today. This applies to the provisions concerning registration of documents and document types, production and protection of documents and the transfer of archives. We also propose introducing a provision concerning the deletion of such records.</p>
<p>The authority that makes a document available to the other authorities is the only one that can meet the registration requirement for the document. It should therefore be the only authority that is required to register it.</p>
<p>Official documents in joint records may be of a type used both by authorities that enter data in the records and by authorities that retrieve data from them. The same documents may belong to document types that consist of joint records, wholly or in part. At present, only one authority, normally the one that is responsible for most of the content, is the custodian of a joint record. In our view, a single authority should continue to be responsible for such a record. To avoid uncertainty as to which authority has custodial responsibility, we propose that a decision on this matter should be taken in each individual case. In practice, this issue will have to be discussed and solved well in advance, in connection with the planning of the system.</p>
<p>In the case of government agencies, the decision should be taken by the Government or the authority appointed by the Government. In the case of local authorities and county councils, the decision should be taken by the municipal council or the county council assembly. However, under a transitional provision in the proposed Act, responsibility for existing joint records should remain with the authority that is responsible for most of the content until a decision is taken to the contrary. This means that decisions can be taken later, for example in connection with a comprehensive review of the rules relating to the record.</p>
<p>Information about the records to which an authority has access is important for an understanding of the authority’s activities and the official documents that are in use there. All authorities to which the record is available should be responsible for including this type of record in their descriptions of official documents.</p>
<p>Since a record can also be a official document that is available to several authorities, regulations or decisions on deletion are currently necessary to allow an authority that is not the custodian to delete the document. We propose instead that a general provision be introduced to allow these authorities to delete documents. This would make it possible, in the case of an authority that has direct access to information, to discontinue its access, thus avoiding unauthorized deletion of documents.</p>
<h2>Appeals and classification of documents</h2>
<p>Of the provisions currently contained in chapter 15 of the Secrecy Act, we consider that the provisions relating to appeals and classification should remain in the Secrecy Act. The provisions on classification are closely linked to the material provisions on secrecy. As regards the rules concerning appeals, these must, pursuant to the Freedom of the Press Act, be contained in the Secrecy Act.</p>
<h2>Supervision</h2>
<p>We propose that the archive authorities’ supervisory responsibility should be extended to matters that are currently governed by chapter 15 of the Secrecy Act. This means that they would exercise supervision over all aspects of the authorities’ management of official documents. This would strengthen the protection of both public access and the cultural heritage.</p>
<h2>Information and training</h2>
<p>Real transparency in public administration is only possible if citizens are aware of their right to access and information. All public administration staff must also be familiar with the rules and capable of applying them in their activities. Major efforts are already being made to provide citizens with the necessary information about public access to official documents and to train public administration staff. Among the authorities and public bodies involved in these efforts today are the National Archives and the Regional Archives, the National Council for Quality and Development, the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and the Swedish Federation of County Councils.</p>
<p>We wish to point out that it is the responsibility of all public authority executives to see to it that they provide access to official documents. This means that they are also responsible for ensuring that their staff are sufficiently familiar with the rules in force and that they apply this knowledge. In addition, they are responsible for ensuring that these matters are taken into account in connection with the organization of each authority’s activities and the use of various technical solutions. In practice, this means that the executive is responsible for ensuring, both in the short and the long term, that the right of access is not affected by organizational changes or new technical solutions.</p>
