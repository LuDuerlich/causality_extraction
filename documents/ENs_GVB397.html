<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Commission’s task has been to deal with certain matters concerning legal metrology, national measurement laboratories, and time and frequency. The Commission’s viewpoints are summarised below.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Decisions of various kinds are often based on measurement results. For such decisions to be correct, the results must be accurate. This requires proper measuring equipment and correct use and reading of the same. The science of measurement and verification of measurement results is known as ‘metrology’, and its technical application is termed ‘measurement technology’.</p>
<p>The scope, scale and forms of metrological activity in a country are determined partly by how this work is regulated in its legislation. A distinction is sometimes drawn between legal and general metrology. Legal metrology  is concerned with work in measurement technology that is subject to statutory regulation. Such rules may, for example, relate to requirements for and checking of certain measurements or measuring devices. Other metrological work comes into the category of general metrology.</p>
<p>Calibration is a means of verifying the accuracy of a measuring instrument. It involves comparing the equipment with other instruments of greater accuracy, which are in turn checked against even more accurate equipment, and so forth. If a measurement result can, via an unbroken chain of comparisons and with defined degrees of uncertainty, be related to the internationally accepted definitions of the measuring units, ‘traceability’ prevails. There is thus a hierarchy of traceability, with the peak consisting of the international, scientifically based definitions of the units of</p>
<p>measurement. These units are defined in the SI system. TPF FPT  The SI system and the highest international level of accuracy for various ‘measurands’ (such as length, volume, mass and time) are administered within the framework of the Metre Convention, of which Sweden is a member.</p>
<p>Measuring instruments intended solely for calibration purposes, and which serve as references for units of measurement, are known as ‘measurement standards’. Standards at the highest level of accuracy in Sweden are kept by the national measurement laboratories  (NMLs), whose activities include the measurands of time and frequency.</p>
<p>Legal metrology</p>
<p>The emphasis and scope of legal metrology vary from one country to another. For Sweden’s part, legal metrology may broadly be said to comprise:</p>
<p>• The types of measuring instruments covered by two EC directives, the Measuring Instruments Directive TPF FPT  and the Directive on non-automatic weighing instruments. TPF FPT</p>
<p>• Legal requirements concerning measurements, methods in measurement technology, characteristics of measuring instruments and inspection of such devices. These requirements are deemed necessary in order for Sweden to fulfil its international agreements, or are considered  well-founded from the consumer point of view. In some cases the scope of legal metrology may also, however, include regulation of relationships between business owners concerning, for example, electricity meters. In addition, there are certain other measurements that are regulated in Swedish legislation but not regarded as matters of legal</p>
<p>metrology, such as certain measurements in environmental protection.</p>
<p>• Some regulations concerning packaging, especially regarding requirements for and inspection of package size, and verification of the quantities of prepackaged goods.</p>
<p>The requirements imposed within the framework of legal metrology may be harmonised at EU level (for measuring instruments, this applies mainly to the stage before new instruments are launched on the market). Alternatively, they may be formulated through purely national regulation (for measuring instruments, this applies mainly to recurrent inspections of equipment in operation).</p>
<p>The Swedish Board for Accreditation and Conformity Assessment (SWEDAC) is the prescriptive and supervisory agency for all issues of legal metrology, with the exception of supervision of prepackaged foods, which is the responsibility of the National Food Administration and the municipal environment and health protection boards.</p>
<p>Responsibility for the measuring instruments covered by the Measuring Instruments Directive (MID) used to be divided among four agencies (the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning, the Swedish Energy Agency, the Swedish Road Administration and SWEDAC). SWEDAC was then responsible for regulations concerning weighing instruments and fuel-metering devices. When the MID came into force on 30 October 2006, however, responsibility for all the instruments it covered was transferred to SWEDAC. With this transfer of functions from the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning, the Energy Agency and the Road Administration, SWEDAC is now also responsible for water, heating, gas, electricity and exhaust-gas meters, and also for taximeters.</p>
<p>In the sphere of legal metrology, SWEDAC’s work consists mainly in issuing regulations and information, exercising supervision and engaging in international cooperation.</p>
<p>Scope of regulation</p>
<p>Under its directives, the Commission is charged with analysing and where necessary proposing changes in the present scope of coercive metrological regulation. Above all, it should review the restriction</p>
<p>that regulations may be issued mainly if they are justified from the viewpoint of consumer protection.</p>
<p>In the light of experience gained in the course of its work, the Commission’s overall assessment is that, at present, there is no reason to alter the scope of coercive regulation in the area of legal metrology.</p>
<p>Orientation and scope of supervision</p>
<p>SWEDAC is engaged in three types of supervision in the sphere of legal metrology: supervision of measuring instruments in operation; market surveillance with respect to measuring instruments subject to EC legal requirements that they must meet before being released on the market; and supervision of compliance with the regulations on prepackaged goods.</p>
<p>Today, in the areas recently taken over by SWEDAC from the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning, the Swedish Energy Agency and the Swedish Road Administration, there are certain unclear points regarding the actual supervisory role of SWEDAC. The Commission considers that this supervisory role with the powers associated with it, and with a mandate concerning sanctions etc should be made as uniform as possible for all the measuring instruments included in SWEDAC’s responsibility. The Commission proposes that SWEDAC’s supervisory role should, generally, be that assigned to the Board under the Act (1992:1514) concerning Quantity Units, Measurements and Measuring Devices.</p>
<p>To improve the scope for supervision, the Commission proposes the introduction of new principles for pricing in the event that SWEDAC purchases and performs tests on measuring devices etc that are subject to prescribed metrological requirements. This proposal means, first,  that a party from which the supervisory agency has requisitioned a measuring device for testing should receive remuneration corresponding to the purchase price, including VAT, and shipping costs. Second,  it means that if a measuring device tested does not fulfil prescribed protection requirements, the manufacturer, importer or other party providing the measuring device should refund the supervisory authority for the expenses it has incurred in purchasing and testing the measuring device.</p>
<p>The supervision of measuring instruments in operation that has been conducted to date by the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning, the Energy Agency, SWEDAC and the Road Administration can be estimated as having cost some SEK 1 2 million a year for the four agencies combined. These resources appear to have been split approximately 50/50 between SWEDAC on the one hand and the other three agencies together on the other. In relative terms, supervision of the areas for which SWEDAC was originally responsible was, accordingly, on a markedly larger scale than that of the additional areas that have now come within its remit.</p>
<p>The Commission’s assessment is that there is a need to devote somewhat more resources to the supervision of measuring instruments in operation than have been invested to date. Simultaneously, however, the fact that SWEDAC has now assumed all-round responsibility for supervision should also entail certain coordination gains, and it should therefore be possible to limit the increase in resources. A reasonable increase is probably an extra half-million kronor a year, bringing the level to around SEK 1.5 2.5 million annually.</p>
<p>Attempting to determine the reasonable extent of market surveillance in the area (with respect to measuring instruments covered by the MID and non-automatic weighing instruments) is more difficult, since there is not as much previous experience to build on as for supervision of measuring instruments in operation. The Commission’s assessment, however, is that a reasonable level for future market surveillance may be assumed to lie roughly in the range of SEK 0.5 1 million a year.</p>
<p>Funding of SWEDAC’s work in legal metrology</p>
<p>The work conducted to date in the area of legal metrology (by SWEDAC and the agencies previously responsible the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning, the Energy Agency and the Road Administration) may be estimated to have cost some SEK 4.5 5.5 million a year in recent years. Of this sum, SWEDAC’s charges for its services, bringing in revenue at its own disposal, have covered some SEK 3 3.5 million a year of the funding. The remainder, especially the activities of the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning, the Energy Agency and</p>
<p>the Road Administration, has mainly been financed collectively by the taxpayers and allocated by means of government grants. TPF FPT  SWEDAC’s charges are intended ultimately to be levied on the owners of the measuring instruments covered by the charges, i.e. weighing instruments and fuel-metering devices. However, the revenue is collected through charges on the inspection bodies that carry out recurrent inspections of weighing instruments and fuelmetering devices according to SWEDAC’s regulations.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s estimation, besides the costs of the ‘old’ activities which are to persist an increment of some SEK 1 1.5 million a year is needed to pay for the additional market surveillance of measuring instruments covered by the MID and also to fulfil the raised ambitions in terms of supervision that are proposed by the Commission. The aggregate funding requirement will thus be approximately SEK 5.5–7 million a year.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes financing activities from the following sources:</p>
<p>• SWEDAC’s work concerning weighing instruments and fuelmetering devices should continue to be financed in accordance with the current charging model, including the indirect costs (incurred throughout the Board’s work) attributable to the various activities.</p>
<p>• New charges should, as far as possible, be introduced to finance work on the new measuring instruments, including the indirect costs (incurred throughout the Board’s work) attributable to the activities concerned. For introducing a new charge to be appropriate, however, the Commission is of the view that the administrative costs entailed by the introduction and by administration of the charge must, for the central government and enterprises concerned, be in reasonable proportion to the scale of the charge. The Commission considers that this is feasible with respect to electricity and gas meters (since the existing charges for network monitoring and natural gas can be used), but not for water, heating and  exhaust-gas meters and</p>
<p>taximeters (for which entirely new charges would, in such cases, need to be created). The Commission’s assessment is that the proposed financing requires a rise of approximately 1% and</p>
<p>15% in the charges for network monitoring and natural gas respectively.</p>
<p>• Activities that should not be financed by means of user charges must be financed through taxes.</p>
<p>All in all, the Commission estimates the tax funds required at some SEK 2 million a year, i.e. around SEK 1 million annually more than the amount allocated by the Government to SWEDAC for 2007 in the short-term financing solution for the activities taken over from the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning, the Energy Agency and the Road Administration.</p>
<p>Legal formalisation of charging</p>
<p>SWEDAC’s current authorisation to set charges for measuring devices subject to its own supervision has been given not by law but in a Riksdag (parliamentary) decision. The Commission proposes making this authorisation statutory, by amending the Act concerning Quantity Units, Measurements and Measuring Devices.</p>
<p>The sanction system in legal metrology</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, the present system of sanctions against contraventions of prescribed requirements in legal metrology is unfit for purpose. Evidence for this is the fact that, at present, there are unclear points concerning what SWEDAC’s actual powers are in some of the areas it has taken over from the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning, the Energy Agency and the Road Administration. To create uniform conditions for the work, the Commission’s premise is that SWEDAC should have similar powers to act for the purpose of correcting any errors discovered on all measuring instruments for which it is responsible as a supervisory agency.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that, overall, the sanction system should be harmonised at the level applying at present in SWEDAC’s ‘old’ areas, i.e. there should be scope for issuing injunctions or prohibitions associated with fines. Regarding taximeters, however, the option of imposing fines should not be introduced.</p>
<p>National measurement laboratories</p>
<p>In Sweden, two bodies are currently designated as national measurement laboratories (NMLs): SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden (SP), a state-owned company, and the Swedish Radiation Protection Authority (SSI), a central government agency. Together, SP and SSI are responsible for some 40 different measurands. SP is in charge of the majority, while SSI’s responsibility as a NML relates to a small number of measurands in the area of ionising radiation. SP has also been appointed by the Government as Sweden’s national metrology institute.</p>
<p>A government grant is paid to the NMLs. For 2007, this support amounts to SEK 28.1 million: 24.6m to SP and 3.5m to SSI. SWEDAC is the grant recipient on behalf of SP, and passes it on to SP, while SSI for its part is entitled to draw on the government budget. However, SWEDAC is not charged with carrying out any review of the purposes of the funds payable to SP. Instead, fitness for purpose is intended to be assessed by the Governmentappointed National Metrology Council. This advisory council is composed of experts in metrology from industry, the academic world and agencies.</p>
<p>In its Budget Bill for 2008 TPF FPT , the Government has proposed that the funds hitherto allocated under a special grant for setting up national metrology from 2008 should be dealt with differently. Thus, SP’s portion is to be transferred to the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth (Nutek), while SSI’s portion is to be included in its framework grant. For 2008, payment to SP of the same amount as in 2007 and a decrease in the contribution to SSI, to some SEK 2.8m, are proposed. The Bill also states that government support for the work of NMLs should be adjusted to meet the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in particular, and that the Government deems that such adjustment is best carried out from a collective SME perspective. One change compared with the current system is that, in the light of the above, Nutek is to start actively examining the uses of funds paid to SP.</p>
<p>Preconditions for long-term establishment of a NML for all present measurands</p>
<p>Under its directives, the Commission must consider the needs of and preconditions for attaining the accuracy of a NML, in the long term, for all present measurands. With the framework laid down for the assignment, however, it has not been possible to gauge in any detail the need to set up a NML for individual measurands. The Commission’s analysis of the NMLs’ work is, instead, confined to an overall system level.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the directives, the Commission has assumed that it is primarily the central government’s commitment to and support for the NMLs’ work, and the motives for this commitment and support, that should be the focus of its reasoning. In particular, the key question is whether there is any need for a further public commitment in this area. The Commission has therefore laid special emphasis on the NMLs’ work to maintain and develop measurement standards at Sweden’s highest level of accuracy, with reference to the fact that this work — including calibration services, supportive R&D, etc — is the basis of the state’s commitment to and support for activities at the NMLs. This shows, for example, the overarching objective formulated by the state for these activities. Nevertheless, it should be emphasised that the competence required for maintaining and developing measurement standards (with supportive R&D etc) is also used for other functions (such as dissemination of knowledge and metrological assignments), and therefore also affords other benefits to society.</p>
<p>According to the Commission, in a modern industrial society like Sweden it is essential to have secure access to calibration against highly accurate measurement standards that are traceable to the international, scientifically based definitions of units of measurement in the SI system. One requirement, if such standards are to be developed and maintained, is R&D in measurement technology.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, the need to sustain in Sweden activities of the type currently carried out by the NMLs will persist in the future. One reason for this view is that there are likely to be genuinely Swedish metrological needs of essential importance to society that, at present, this country’s NMLs are better equipped to deal with than their foreign counterparts. Nevertheless, it should be added that the Commission has difficulty in determining the</p>
<p>precise extent to which it is currently possible to find, at institutions abroad, alternatives that are equivalent (in terms of quality, adaptation to needs, delivery times, etc) to the services offered by the NMLs at present.</p>
<p>Full user-charge financing of the NMLs’ work would entail higher prices for the calibration assignments performed. However, on average, the costs of calibration are a marginal proportion of companies’ turnover. Customers’ reactions to raised prices should, moreover, depend partly on how difficult they think it is to find abroad equivalent alternatives to the services now offered by the NMLs. However, the Commission’s view based on its overall assessment is that the most likely scenario is that full user-charge financing of NMLs’ work would, for the time being, result in such a substantial decline in customers that, compared with the current situation, it would both change the emphasis of the work and reduce its scope and/or scale. It therefore cannot be ruled out that full user-charge financing of the NMLs’ work would bring about such an orientation and a scale of activities that may entail adverse repercussions on society. Accordingly, the Commission’s view is that government support will continue to be needed in the future.</p>
<p>The experience obtained in the course of the assignment suggests that the method used to date for defining the orientation  of the NMLs’ work (which standards are maintained etc) is, broadly speaking, correct. Thus, gradual adjustment to the clients’ needs, rather than an instrumental application of a given set of selection criteria, is taking place.</p>
<p>Just as the emphasis of the work is gradually being adapted, so it is also difficult to determine once and for all exactly what the scale  of the NMLs’ work should be, and how much government support  they need. Ultimately, needs should be the governing consideration. The most appropriate way of identifying the optimal level is likely to be gradual adjustment of the scale of work, as well as its orientation, to the needs.</p>
<p>A suitable way for a gradual adaptation of the level of government support to take place would be for some independent party to carry out recurrent examinations of the needs for the NMLs’ work. To date, this has taken place largely through the National Metrology Council, which has examined national metrology efforts on behalf of the Government, at the highest level of accuracy, and issued recommendations on the level and use of government support. For several years, the Council has put forward the view</p>
<p>that the overall level of government support is too low. Nevertheless, it has not been the Council’s function to value society’s needs of metrology in relation to other purposes, for example on the basis of general premises of industrial policy. As stated above, however, the Government has stated in its Budget Bill for 2008 that government support for the NMLs’ work should henceforth be adjusted on the basis of the needs of SMEs, in particular, and that such adjustment is best done from a coherent SME perspective. In its Bill, the Government has therefore proposed, first, that the funds allocated to date under a special grant for setting up national metrology from 2008 should be transferred to Nutek (with respect to SP’s share) or included in SSI’s framework grant (SSI’s share) and, secondly,  that Nutek should then carry out an active assessment of the purposes of funds paid to SP.</p>
<p>Given this background, the Commission has no explicit view on what the ‘right’ level of government support for the NMLs would be and considers, rather, that this support should be gradually adapted from its present-day level. TPF FPT  Through the changed form of grant distribution proposed by the Government in its Budget Bill for 2008, a start has been made on establishing new institutional limits for such gradual adjustment of the level of support.</p>
<p>It is, of course, too early to say what conclusions Nutek will draw in the adjustment on the basis of an overall industrial-policy perspective mainly focusing on SMEs’ needs for which the plan is for Nutek to be responsible from 2008. However, the Commission’s view is that at present, given the current orientation of activities, there should be scope for a certain increase in calibretion charges as a proportion of the financing for maintenance and development of standards.</p>
<p>How the level of government support for the NMLs should be developed in the longer term is more difficult to assess. One factor on which this depends is how conditions for these activities develop in general terms. In the context one relevant consideration should, for example, be that the prospects of finding equivalent and easily accessible alternatives to the NMLs outside Sweden are probably gradually improving. At the same time, it is</p>
<p>also foreseeable that new, urgent areas may come into being and that demand for traceable measuring techniques will increase.</p>
<p>Management of the grant</p>
<p>Under its directives, the Commission was to analyse and, where necessary, propose changes with respect to the suitability and fitness for purpose of current responsibility for government support for the NMLs’ work and how the funds are spent.</p>
<p>However, the proposal now presented by the Government in its Budget Bill for 2008 (see above) may be deemed, in the Commission’s view, to have answered the questions regarding handling of the metrology grant that the Commission was to deal with according to its directives. The Commission has therefore not found it necessary to deal further with these questions in its report.</p>
<p>Preconditions for any coordination gains from increased European or Nordic cooperation among NMLs</p>
<p>European cooperation in metrology has, for some years, been undergoing a process of change. One starting point for this process has been that individual countries’ national metrology institutes should continue to provide a more or less comprehensive national range of services, but that European cooperation in metrological research and development is to increase. Accordingly, a special European research programme in metrology has been developed and a European research council established. The programme has been granted funds by the European Commission for the next fiveyear period as a ERA-NET+ scheme. The European Commission has also recently embarked on developing an ‘Article 169 Initiative’ in metrology on a planned scale of some €500 million for the years 2009–16. In addition, collaboration among the European national metrology institutes has been placed on a more formal legal footing through the formation early in 2007 of a new regional metrology organisation, EURAMET (the European Association of National Metrology Institutes), to succeed the former joint body EUROMET (European Collaboration in Measurement Standards). In our view, it would be reasonable for Sweden’s ambition to be</p>
<p>that of playing an active part in the (growing) European R&D cooperation.</p>
<p>Under its directives, the Commission’s task is to analyse whether there are gains to be made from coordination through increased international collaboration among NMLs whether, for example, the number of measurands within one country’s borders may be reduced as a result of division of labour among various countries in the maintenance and development of standards. In view of the model that has now been selected for European metrology cooperation, however, the Commission does not see reasons at present for the Government and Riksdag (Swedish Parliament) to take any initiatives aimed at bringing about, for example, increased European division of labour in the maintenance of standards or complete integration in a single European metrological institute or similar body.</p>
<p>Nordic cooperation at NML level is relatively limited. In the Commission’s view it cannot, admittedly, be ruled out that certain coordination gains might possibly be attainable through increased Nordic collaboration among NMLs. But the Commission is nonetheless not of the view that it is advisable for the Government and Riksdag to take any initiatives aimed at attempting to establish increased Nordic NML collaboration. First, the Commission considers with reference to current development at European level (see above) that the central arena for increased metrological cooperation, at least in the short to medium term, is the European rather than the Nordic. Second, the main impression given by the Commission’s contacts with responsible bodies in the Nordic countries is that these bodies lack interest in enhanced Nordic NML collaboration that would involve division of labour in the maintenance of standards and work of this kind.</p>
<p>Time and frequency</p>
<p>The issues of time and frequency that are specified in the Commission’s directives were dealt with, by way of introduction, by a special reference group on the Commission’s behalf. This work was conducted in two stages. First, a hearing was held with some 15 stakeholders in the area, representing both the business sector and the government agencies concerned. This reference</p>
<p>group then continued to work on these issues on the basis of what emerged at the hearing.</p>
<p>When the reference group had submitted its report, the Commission found it most appropriate to issue a status report on its assignment concerning time and frequency by submitting to the Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications the reference group’s report, supplemented with certain comments from the Commission in a special written communication. In practice, the Commission’s status report, issued in September 2007, contained no detailed proposals for the Commission’s part. The approach selected means that the issues of time and frequency have not been dealt with further in this report.</p>
