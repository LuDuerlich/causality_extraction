<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The drug problem has become an increasingly global phenomenon. The illegal drug trade feeds a hundred-billion-dollar global criminal industry that poses a growing threat to stability and security. No country can combat drug trafficking on its own. We are affected by everything that happens in the surrounding world. Virtually all the illicit drugs consumed in Sweden are produced elsewhere and brought into the country illegally. International social and cultural currents influence our attitudes and behaviour. Other countries’ laws also affect us. Sweden is therefore highly dependant on international cooperation in the fight against drugs.</p>
<p>The Committee of Inquiry was charged with charting Sweden’s international commitments in the drugs field and assessing the scope for better resource utilisation and coordination. The starting point for the Committee’s work was Sweden’s drug policy, as approved by the Swedish Riksdag and Government, and the UN drug conventions. The conventions’ underlying premise is that while we need narcotic substances for medical and scientific purposes they must not be taken for pleasure or enjoyment as they are addictive and can have harmful, and in some cases, fatal side effects. This premise is being increasingly called into question in the international drug policy debate, on which the Committee was also instructed to report.</p>
<p>Its conclusion on this matter is that the initiative in the debate has passed to those who are pressing for a paradigm shift involving decriminalisation – and in some cases legalisation – of some drugs, primarily cannabis. The predominant themes in the current public narrative on drug policy are failure, incarceration, human rights infringements and the lack of effective means to alleviate pain. However, there is also another narrative – about freedom from drug addiction, destitution and misery; about humane substance abuse treatment, education, support and rehabilitation as alternatives to prison; and about access to controlled, scientifically based methods of alleviating pain. This narrative is not coming through as clearly in the public conversation. It is essential that it find a voice. Although those who advocate a weakening of the conventions may have failed to make a major impact on UN and EU policymaking, they are seen and heard not only in the public debate but also by international officials in multilateral organisations.</p>
<p>Those who, like Sweden, have high ambitions with regard to drug policy must make their voices heard, not just at the negotiating table but also in the public debate. Active monitoring of global developments is a prerequisite. To stimulate and take part in the debate is to bring influence to bear. The Committee of Inquiry urges an active approach, both at the negotiating table and in the public debate. Non-binding political declarations are also of strategic importance. It is through such declarations that changes in drug policy positions are negotiated. The agreements are adopted by consensus, which confers legitimacy on the measures recommended therein, and can serve as a springboard for drug policy changes and for amending national and international regulations.</p>
<p>For Sweden, this will mean going a step further than we have taken in the last 25 years. In the 1970s and 1980s, Sweden was a driving force in the international fight against drugs. We pressed for international control of synthetic drugs such as amphetamines. We took the initiative of incorporating provisions on care and treatment as a complement or alternative to punishment into the conventions. These initiatives were based on a need for change identified by the Swedish Government, with the help of an actively engaged civil society. The changes were incorporated without disturbing the basic structure of the international control system. Sweden should proceed in the same way today. Together with other like-minded countries we should actively pursue efforts to bring about change while seeking to ensure that the drug conventions are fully respected. This will mean focusing away from mainly safeguarding our interests – an approach that has largely characterised Sweden’s approach for some considerable time – to the promotion of our drug policy interests, based on the aims of the conventions.</p>
<p>There are a wide range of opportunities for cooperation both in the EU and elsewhere. In an ideal world we would avail ourselves of all of them. However, resources are limited, and we need to prioritise. Otherwise we risk spreading our commitments too thinly to do any good at all. With regard to political and strategic cooperation, the Committee proposes that efforts be focused most intensively on cooperation in the UN and EU. The many practical opportunities for cooperation afforded by EU membership are also important as this enables us to meet our operational goals while allowing us to publicise Sweden’s drug policy more widely.</p>
<h2>Harm reduction</h2>
<p>A particularly sensitive area is cooperation on HIV/AIDS. Much of the drug policy debate revolves around the concept of harm reduction. The term embraces everything from offering drug users a roof over their heads to arranging so-called injection rooms, where addicts can inject themselves in a clean, calm, supervised environment. The expression appears in the policy documents adopted by the UN General Assembly with the aim of reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS, and encompasses, among other things, needle exchange programmes for injecting drug users. The term is highly controversial in drug policy discussions and does not appear in UN drug policy agreements, although a number of EU countries – but not Sweden – are actively urging acceptance of the terminology.</p>
<p>The Government has adopted a policy for Sweden’s international HIV/AIDS efforts. The policy advocates needle exchange as part of a broader treatment programme. A controversial issue within the UN is whether HIV/AIDS prevention should only be aimed at injection drug users or whether it should also target other drug users. Another contentious issue is whether HIV prevention should also involve drug prevention and treatment for substance abuse. Although the goal of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) strategy Getting to Zero, is to prevent all new HIV infections among people who use drugs, negotiations on this question regularly stall on the issue of drug policy. What is required, quite simply, is better coordination between the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) and the UNAIDS governing body, the Programme Coordinating Board (PCB). The CND has called for this in a recent resolution. In light of the above, the Committee of Inquiry emphasises that Sweden must speak with one voice on the issue of drug abuse and HIV/AIDS, irrespective of the context. Better coordination is needed ahead of negotiations within the governing bodies. The same applies to the</p>
<p>UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) and the UN General Assembly.</p>
<p>The Committee further proposes that the forthcoming evaluation of Swedish policy on international HIV/AIDS efforts give consideration to whether the policy should be made more specific in relation to these controversial areas of drug policy. The Committee also proposes that Sweden press for an evaluation of harm reduction activities financed by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.</p>
<h2>Clarifying drug policy positions</h2>
<p>Swedish drug policy is characterised by a restrictive approach guided by the long-term ambition to create a drug-free society. This restrictive outlook has not only entailed practical consequences for the policy but is also reflected in the positions Sweden has taken or needs to take in relation to specific issues under discussion at international level.</p>
<p>Sweden’s drug policy is not set out in its entirety in a readily accessible document. Anyone wishing to ascertain Sweden’s position on a specific drug policy matter must therefore do his/her own research, referring back to government bills and other documents stating the country’s positions However, the fact that these positions are not always mutually consistent creates uncertainty in international negotiations and extra work both for negotiators and those responsible for drawing up the instructions for the negotiations.</p>
<p>The Committee accordingly takes the view that Sweden’s position should be clarified in respect of a number of recurring issues in international discussions and negotiations. These include criminalisation of the use of drugs, the position on addiction as an illness or a habit, the role of prevention, police action against illegal drug use, harm reduction and the legalisation of cannabis.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that these clarifications should serve as a basis for a framework instruction to be adopted by the Government and observed by participating ministries and government agencies in international negotiations and efforts to promote Swedish drug policies.</p>
<h2>The United Nations</h2>
<p>The UN system is the global cooperation forum for crucial decisions on the foundations of drug policy. The Committee of Inquiry proposes that the Government draw up a policy on Sweden's involvement in UN work on drug-related issues. These issues are technically complicated and politically sensitive. They are closely connected to a number of other policy areas of importance to Sweden. For example, there are strong links between drug policy, the fight against HIV and human rights. Eradication of illegal drug crops and alternative development have a direct bearing on environmental policy and poverty reduction. Crime prevention measures aimed at the illicit drug trade are inextricably linked to anti-corruption efforts and human rights. Cohesion between policy areas is vital. Measures intended to further drug policy objectives should not be obstructed by measures in other policy areas, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The CND is the foremost international forum, not only for drug control, psychotropic substances and precursors, but also for drug policy debates. It is also the governing body of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). By initiating resolutions, member states can raise issues that might otherwise languish in obscurity, and by taking an active part in the ensuing negotiations they can bring influence to bear on the wording of resolutions. Although resolutions may not always be of major practical significance, they can mean a great deal when it comes to setting the agenda for policymaking and international cooperation.</p>
<p>Once one of the most proactive countries involved in the CND and its work, Sweden has in the recent past tended to adopt a watchdog position, particularly with regard to normative issues. The operational segment that acts as a governing body of the UNODC in drug-related matters is an exception. Here, Sweden has been highly – and successfully – proactive. In view of the considerable influence a united EU can bring to bear, every attempt should be made to effect resolutions that all EU member states can support. However, one cannot ignore the fact that drug policies, and hence positions on certain strategic issues, vary among EU countries. Sweden should accordingly seek to gain support for ideas among like-minded countries, including non-EU member states.</p>
<p>Active participation in the CND will require the enlargement of the Swedish delegation to include representatives of other ministries, primarily the Ministry of Justice, and, where appropriate, experts from government agencies.</p>
<p>The fight against drugs, crime and terrorism is a priority area for the UN. UNODC has a key role to play here. Sweden is a major contributor to the organisation. The Committee proposes that a Swedish organisational strategy for UNODC be drawn up jointly by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Justice. The strategy should specify positions on organisational issues such as governance, leadership and funding of operations – including staff and support functions at the organisation’s headquarters and field offices – and on issues concerning UNODC’s substantive activities. The aim should be to balance UNODC operations with respect to drug demand reduction and drug supply reduction efforts, and to strike a balance in the former area between preventive measures, care and treatment on the one hand, and harm reduction on the other. The current trend is strongly tilted towards drug supply reduction and harm reduction.</p>
<p>WHO has a key role to play in the international control of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. The CND may not adopt amendments to the 1961 and 1971 conventions without prior critical review by the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD) and a recommendation by the WHO. This provision is laid down in the drug conventions and cannot be amended or rescinded without renegotiating the conventions. Although the assignment is defined by treaty, the WHO has not convened the ECDD since 2006, as a result of which a number of potentially highly harmful substances have not been reviewed for international control. The WHO’s explanation is that there is no funding available for this activity. This is unacceptable. In the Committee’s view, Sweden should ensure that the WHO’s remit pursuant to the drug conventions is addressed as part of the ongoing reform process and dealt with as the core assignment it is. The ECDD’s operations should be financed through the regular WHO budget and not be dependant on voluntary earmarked contributions. The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs should raise this issue with the WHO at senior management level at its annual high-level meeting, and in addition urge the body's governing board to addresses the issue of funding through the regular budget. Sweden should also explore the possibility of establishing a common position on this solution in the EU.</p>
<h2>Cooperation within the European Union</h2>
<p>The EU is an important drug policy actor, both politically and in terms of practical cooperation. The prospect of 27 European countries reaching agreement on a drug policy direction is not to be ignored in international contexts. The advantage of agreeing on a common drug strategy is that it will add value to the countries’ national strategies. While it is true that the EU drug strategy and action plan are not legal instruments, and thus not in themselves legally binding on member states, a large number of the measures recommended in the action plan are legally binding. The Treaty of Lisbon has entailed major changes regarding the scope for drug policy cooperation, particularly in the areas of justice and home affairs and foreign affairs.</p>
<p>The current EU drugs strategy runs until December 2012. The principles on which its successor will be based have already been laid down by the European Council in the Stockholm Programme. It is essential that the new strategy and action plan make full use of all available means under the Lisbon Treaty to improve coordination and cooperation, particularly with countries and regions of major importance for drug policy. The strategy must mobilise civil society and contribute to the enhancement of the knowledge base by promoting research and data comparability.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that Sweden play an active part in the planning and implementation of a common EU drug policy. The European Commission has already begun work on the new drug strategy, which will launch in 2013. Clearly, there is little time to lose. Sweden should take part in the Commission’s work on the basis of a carefully considered, inter-ministerial concept of what the EU strategy should include, taking account of the new scope for cooperation afforded by the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
<p>With regard to participation in the Council's Horizontal Working Party on Drugs (HDG), the Committee considers that the Swedish delegation should be enlarged to include representatives of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice when matters falling within their spheres of responsibility are negotiated. Where appropriate, experts from government agencies should also take part.</p>
<p>Swedish participation in drug troikas and drug conferences/meetings with non-EU member states has been very sporadic. Sweden should make use of the opportunities for dialogue offered by these meetings. Using EU meetings to build alliances with like-minded countries is particularly important. Such meetings also afford an immediate insight into the kind of issues that are likely to be controversial or significant for other reasons, and that may need to be solved in other international fora. The Committee therefore proposes that the ministries concerned jointly determine which countries should be given priority by Sweden in the regular dialogue and cooperation process within the framework of EU cooperation against drugs.</p>
<p>Regarding EU cooperation at operational level, this is working well in the Committee’s view, although its full potential is not always exploited. This applies particularly to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and, in some respects, to Europol.</p>
<p>The European Commission administers a number of cooperation programmes which together place significant funds at the disposal of agencies, research institutions and civil society organisations for drug-related projects and activities. Swedish projects and organisations are poorly represented in these programmes. The application process is protracted and complicated, and the Swedish contact points for the programmes are located in different agencies. In addition, information is often only obtainable via multiple routes. The Committee proposes that the National Institute of Public Health – working in collaboration with the Ministry of Justice and Vinnova – be tasked with setting up a web portal, i.e. an introductory web page linking to EU programmes of relevance to drug-related issues. In addition to up-to-date information on the programmes, application forms, links to the programmes themselves, etc., the portal should also include access to information on drug-related projects and activities already receiving support.</p>
<p>There are also EU programmes providing technical assistance to candidate countries, potential candidate countries and neighbouring countries. These programmes involve a number of areas of relevance to drug policy. These include drug policy coordination, health matters, the fight against organised crime, capacity building for civil society, etc. In the Committee’s view, these programmes, for which the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) is the contact point, are a potential resource which from a Swedish standpoint could and should be used to steer drug policy development in the right direction. Purposeful, systematic advocacy work would enable Swedish government agencies and experts to contribute to exchanges of experience, and capacity and institution building in keeping with the spirit of the UN drug conventions and other policy documents. However, this will require the allocation of dedicated resources.</p>
<h2>Other fora for international cooperation</h2>
<p>There are, in addition to the UN and EU, a number of other fora for cooperation at various levels, and with varying degrees of Swedish participation. Global organisations include the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Dublin Group, Interpol, the World Customs Organisation (WCO) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The principal bodies at European level are the Council of Europe’s Pompidou Group and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Several cooperation projects have been established in the Baltic Sea region. These undertakings are of a practical nature, e.g. law enforcement cooperation to fight organised crime, and cooperation among experts on alcohol and drug-related issues and HIV prevention. Finally, the Nordic countries cooperate effectively in a number of areas, including research, collaboration on new psychoactive substances and informal exchanges among government officials responsible for drug-related issues.</p>
<p>The Committee finds cooperation efforts involving Interpol, WCO and FATF and the operational fight against crime in the Baltic Sea region to be both effective and of practical benefit. As regards other forms of cooperation, the picture is complicated. Conditions for cooperation have changed considerably, particularly in the wake of EU enlargement and the development of EU cooperation in a range of areas.</p>
<p>The Pompidou Group has seen the addition of several Eastern European countries. Meanwhile, Denmark, the UK and Germany have opted out due to resource constraints. Sweden participates at the overall strategic level through the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, and on a regular basis at working party level through the Swedish Customs Service in a cooperative effort to fight drug smuggling through airports. Counting travelling time, and preparatory and supplementary work, the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs spends an estimated two weeks a year on cooperation with the Pompidou Group. In the Committee’s view, this input should be weighed against the need to upgrade Sweden’s active participation in UN and EU activities in this sphere, particularly in view of the upcoming development of a new EU drug strategy.</p>
<p>In the government bill, A Cohesive Strategy for Alcohol, Narcotic Drugs, Doping and Tobacco Policy (ANDT) (Govt Bill 2010/11:47), the Government underlined the need for greater coordination and prioritisation of Nordic cooperation on ANDT. With regard to general cooperation on drug policy, the former committee of senior officials in the Nordic Council of Ministers has been replaced by an informal annual meeting denominated the Nordic Drug Forum. Although the Nordic countries are bound by strong cultural and language ties, there is no automatic consensus on drug policy. We have differing views on a number of major drug policy issues. It is nevertheless essential that Nordic cooperation, particularly on operational matters, be maintained, whereas the form taken by the general dialogue should always be open to discussion.</p>
<p>The Committee considers that research cooperation taking place under the auspices of the Nordic Welfare Centre in Finland (NVC) is of considerable value and should be encouraged. This also applies to the Network for Alcohol and Drug-Related Issues, a forum for dialogue between the research world and officials in the Nordic countries’ government offices responsible for drug-related issues. Similarly, informal cooperation focused on new psychoactive substances, carried on via the NADiS network, is a good example of an effective cooperation emerging in response to the need for collaboration.</p>
<p>With regard to Nordic cooperation between the police and customs authorities (PTN), the Committee notes that all EU member states are part of Europol, and have recourse to other EU countries’ liaison officers in countries where they themselves are not represented. It is important in this connection to be aware of the risk of the duplication of effort in other areas of PTN as the EU develops in response to the new possibilities afforded by the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
<h2>Greater international participation by Swedish experts</h2>
<p>One of the Committee’s tasks was to examine ways in which Sweden can promote greater participation by Swedish experts in international drug-related activities, particularly within EU institutions. This is not only about making use of Swedish expertise in international contexts, but also about skills acquisition by Sweden. International organisations need the knowledge and experience that Swedish experts can offer, and Swedish agencies and organisations need knowledge, experience and the contact networks that come with serving in international organisations. At present, very few Swedes are actively engaged in drug-related issues in organisations outside Sweden.</p>
<p>The question of international participation by Swedish experts cannot be viewed in isolation from Sweden’s other international commitments in this field. If drug-related issues are to be a priority cooperation area for Sweden, they should inform a range of areas, including international recruitment to key organisations. Among other things, this means that resources should be allocated both to disseminate information on how to access the systems and to defray the costs involved in maintaining national experts in the EU and the UN. Commitment on the part of agency leadership and human resources departments is also essential.</p>
<p>Sida and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs Secretariat for International Recruitment are both actively engaged in enhancing Sweden's presence in international organisations. To assist them in this task, departments in the Government Offices with responsibility for organisational and/or substantive matters, together with Sweden’s Permanent Representation in Vienna, should monitor developments in terms of vacancies at UNODC headquarters in Vienna and field offices that normally recruit experts on a project basis through the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). In addition, Sida should give favourable consideration to offering UNODC Junior Professional Officers (JPOs) via the Associate Expert Programme. Such requests are submitted to donor countries on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Much will depend on whether information on access to the systems is readily available to interested experts. The Committee recommends the dissemination of information about opportunities for Master's students to apply for internship at UNODC. In addition, interested Swedish experts should be encouraged to send their</p>
<p>CVs in to UNODC, which keeps a register of suitable consultants whom the organisation can contact as necessary. Another course of action worth testing is to lend out Swedish experts on a non-reimbursable loan agreement for special activities.</p>
<p>National experts are an important means of strengthening Sweden’s presence in EU institutions and bringing influence to bear on the work of the Commission, as well as creating networks of considerable utility to agencies at home. In the Committee’s view, it is particularly important to have Swedish experts within the Commission in view of the recently begun work of drawing up proposals for a new drug strategy and action plan for the EU.</p>
<p>Although Swedish NGOs have expressed interest in greater international involvement, this often wanes rapidly due to lack of funds to cover travelling and accommodation expenses. The Committee accordingly proposes that the Government consider introducing grants for NGO participation in international meetings and conferences. It further proposes that Sida be instructed to examine the feasibility of earmarking funds for pilot projects in which Swedish NGOs are given the opportunity to help similar organisations in developing countries to develop their own projects and programmes.</p>
<h2>Obligation to report</h2>
<p>Sweden’s international commitments are attended by an obligation to report on drug-related matters to a number of coordinating bodies. In some cases, statistics and information are collected at specified intervals and in accordance with set procedures.</p>
<p>Parties to the UN international drug conventions are formally required to submit annual data on the functioning of the three conventions. The data are collected through four annual questionnaires collectively entitled the Annual Reports Questionnaire (ARQ). The completed questionnaires are sent in electronically to UNODC, which summarises the information in two reports to the CND – one on the world situation with regard to drug abuse, and one on the world situation with regard to drug trafficking. The information also serves as a basis for other background documents prepared for the CND, and forms part of support data for the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) annual report and for the World Drug Report published annually by the UNODC.</p>
<p>A similar report is also submitted annually to the EMCDDA. Responsibility for coordinating reports to the EMCDDA rests with the National Institute of Public Health. In view of the close similarity between Sweden’s annual reporting to the UN through the ARQs and its reporting to the EMCDDA, the Committee proposes that the task of compiling the ARQ data also be allocated to the National Institute of Public Health, and that this assignment be included in the agency’s instructions.</p>
<p>Procedures for reporting to the UN and EU need to be tightened up. Responsibility for producing the required statistics and data is divided among a number of ministries and agencies. In cases where a particular issue is of concern to several actors, submissions should be made jointly. The Committee has pointed to the need for a more clearly defined allocation of roles and responsibilities in terms of who should supply what part of the information requested in the questionnaires. It therefore proposes the creation of a network comprising those bodies responsible for supplying information. It may be beneficial in the initial stages for network participants to meet in order to clarify aspects of the reporting process, such as scope, concepts and definitions. It can also be a useful means of establishing who else is contributing to the process, so that everyone involved can know who to turn to with any questions they may have.</p>
<p>The Committee has found that it can sometimes be difficult for an authority responsible for compiling data and information for the Government, and subsequent submission to the UN or EU, to get the required information in on time. An agency which owns statistical data and other information must be presumed to function as a supplier to the agency tasked with reporting to one or more international organisations. This should be self-evident. In cases where an agency is not specifically instructed to supply the Government and other agencies with statistics or other background data, the Government should consider introducing provisions to that effect in the agency's instructions.</p>
<p>Other reporting activities also take place on a regular basis. The Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control compiles a biennial report for the UNAIDS on a range of matters, including the number of newly infected individuals and access to clean syringes and needles by injecting drug users.</p>
<p>The Medical Products Agency has a wide-ranging obligation to report to the INCB. Annual and quarterly statistics on narcotic substances, psychotropic substances and precursors are submitted on seven separate forms. The agency estimates that the time required to meet this regular reporting obligation amounts to almost ten working weeks per year. This does not include a varying number of ad hoc queries and requests. This task should be regulated in the agency's instructions.</p>
<p>The result of this extensive reporting process is a wealth of material detailing the current drug situation in Sweden from a range of standpoints. However, little use is made of this body of information in Sweden. Not even those responsible for supplying the data are able to access the assembled information. It is unfortunate that the result of such a comprehensive, collective effort is not made more use of in the national context. It could easily be used as a basis for knowledge enhancement and in follow-up studies.</p>
<p>The Committee acknowledges the need for a system to disseminate the results of Swedish reporting at national level. The compiled responses to the questionnaires should be made available to all relevant ministries and organisations. The Committee also proposes that the reports be used for the purpose of knowledge enhancement. This might best be accomplished by the agency responsible for compiling the reports holding an annual seminar at which status updates contained in the reports are presented and discussed with other agencies and organisations engaged in drugrelated activities.</p>
<p>Finally, the Committee considers that the reports submitted to the UN and EU give an exhaustive picture of the strengths and weaknesses of Sweden’s drug policies and that they should be used in government follow-ups of these policies.</p>
<h2>Allocation of responsibility, coordination and knowledge development</h2>
<p>The drug question concerns a number of agencies and ministries. Overall responsibility for coordinating drug policy in the Govern- ment Offices rests with the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs. Several other ministries are responsible for specific policy issues. Coordination of all government work relating to alcohol, drug, doping and tobacco policy is the task of the ANDT Secretariat in the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs. The formal division of responsibility between the various ministries is clearly defined and</p>
<p>there is an established procedure for preparing matters and ques- tions involving several ministries.</p>
<p>When it comes to inter-agency collaboration, however, there is no established coordinating body apart from the ANDT Council, which is headed by the State Secretary at the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs and composed of relevant agency heads, and rep- resentatives of Sweden's municipal and county councils, the research community and NGOs. The Council is tasked with promoting greater coordination and collaboration at national level with the aim of achieving the ANDT strategy’s long-term objective.</p>
<p>Although there are advantages to dealing with ANDT-related issues within a single framework, particularly where preventive measures are involved, the fact that the drug issue is complex and requires special knowledge and expertise cannot be ignored, par- ticularly in the context of international cooperation. The general message from experts and policy advisers to the Committee is that the current state of knowledge leaves a great deal to be desired. It cannot be assumed that those who know about alcohol or tobacco policy are also well-versed in drug conventions, international agreements or the drug policy A to Z. In the Committee’s view, there is a need to supplement ANDT work with efforts aimed at developing and exploiting specialised knowledge of drug-related issues and strengthening coordination in this area.</p>
<p>One way of deepening and broadening the drug policy discus- sion among all the ministries and agencies concerned is to make use of the annually updated status reports submitted to the UN and EU. Examination of the updated status reports could be combined with discussions on current international issues along with Sweden's positions on specific issues. A seminar of this kind would not only provide an overview of Sweden's status and positions, but also serve to enhance knowledge among individual participants, agencies and organisations, thereby boosting the efficiency and effectiveness of their work.</p>
<p>Although the established procedures for preparing matters in the Government Offices have been carefully thought out, the Committee finds that joint discussions on drug policy matters only take place on a limited basis, and rarely ahead of large drug policy meetings at bodies such as the CND. The rule that a matter must be dealt with by the ministry mainly responsible for it has meant in practice that the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs as the coor- dinating authority shoulders a disproportionately large responsi-</p>
<p>bility for drug policy. For example, the ministry bears entire responsibility for the Council Horizontal Working Party on Drugs. Similarly, a major share of the responsibility for the CND and sole responsibility for the meetings of the Permanent Correspondents of the Pompidou Group and the Nordic Drug Forum rests with the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, despite the fact that all these cooperative undertakings involve several other ministries as well.</p>
<p>A consistent voice in international negotiations is essential if Sweden is to gain a hearing for its standpoints and the issues it wishes to raise. It is therefore vital that government officials who represent Sweden in international fora that address drug policy matters, either as their main concern or as an attendant issue, meet regularly to discuss matters of principle, and to prepare Swedish participation. No formal decision would be required to summon such a group. However, the ministries involved would each need to designate an official responsible for drug-related matters, and the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, as the coordinating ministry, would have to take on the task of convening the group.</p>
<p>On the whole, the international drug policy situation is worry- ing. Those who are pressing for a radical change of policy towards a more permissive regime are articulate, in some cases well-known and distinguished. They are seen and heard in more contexts than those who, like Sweden, are concerned to preserve a balanced, pub- lic health-based, humane and restrictive policy. In the Committee’s view, Sweden’s international involvement requires a refocusing away from a watchdog approach and towards the promotion of Swedish drug policy interests. Some steps towards this can be made by raising the level of knowledge, clarifying drug policy positions and coordinating relevant ministries and agencies, in line with the proposals presented by the Committee.</p>
<p>However, more will be needed to turn the current trend. The Committee therefore proposes that the Government consider appointing for a trial period an International Senior Representative for Drug Policy for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Min- istries of Health and Social Affairs, Justice, and possibly Finance. Similar appointments already exist in other areas. As chief nego- tiator and delegation head, the representative should represent Sweden in international negotiations on drug-related matters, mainly in the UN and EU. Bilateral cooperation and developing bilateral contacts should be included in the remit. The function should be evaluated after two years.</p>
