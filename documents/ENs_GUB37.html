<p>Remit</p>
<p>The terms of reference require us to</p>
<p>Legislative proposal</p>
<p>We propose a new section in the Higher Education Act, stipulating that free tuition is to apply to Swedish students and students from other EEA countries while at the same time allowing the Government the right to decide on fees for students from other countries.</p>
<p>Fees for education at the first and second level</p>
<p>We have understood the terms of reference to mean that the purpose is to relieve higher education appropriations of the costs for educating students from non-EEA countries. Our conclusion is that these fees are to cover all such costs, but not more.</p>
<p>We propose that education at the first and second level for students from non-EEA countries be financed via charges fixed by each HEI. These fees should be assessed so that they cover the costs of support and service to the educational programmes, the fee system</p>
<p>and measures related to it, in addition to the costs of tuition itself. A requirement that all costs be covered is to apply to the entire range of fee-funded educational programmes offered, not to individual programmes. This will enable HEIs offering a broader range of programmes to work with a limited number of fee levels.</p>
<p>For reasons of legal certainty, there must be no confusion between fees and admission to educational programmes. The same fee should be charged to all students in the same programme. Financial support to students who are obliged to pay fees should be given via the grant systems for which the Swedish Institute is responsible.</p>
<p>Educational programmes that are fee-funded must be dimensioned, budgeted and reported separately from those that are funded from appropriations, and the selection of students must be made separately. This does not need to mean a difference in the studies; as far as possible, tuition should be organised jointly for appropriationfunded and fee-funded students. Students paying fees should have the same rights and obligations as other students.</p>
<p>Some citizens from non-EEA countries should be exempted from fees and have the same status as Swedish and other EEA students. This applies to</p>
<p>• people with residence permits in, or some other particular connection with Sweden,</p>
<p>• students at foreign academic institutions conducting part of their education in Sweden in the context of a local or central agreement on cooperation or exchange,</p>
<p>• citizens of countries that have entered into agreements on free movement with the EU and its Member States, such as Switzerland at present.</p>
<p>With regard to eligibility, there is no reason to introduce special rules for fee-funded education. However, selection rules must be adapted to each educational programme and should therefore be established locally, but within the framework of the general rule that account must be taken of the applicant’s merits.</p>
<p>HEIs should get a right to charge fees for applications to fee-funded programmes. We assume that the institutions will want to coordinate admissions, primarily to facilitate assessment of applicants’ eligibility. The National Agency for Services to Universities and University Colleges should be tasked with developing an IT support system for these admissions. The National Agency for Higher</p>
<p>Education should be tasked with developing a database describing higher education programmes in other countries and documenting assessments of them.</p>
<p>The Swedish Institute should, together with HEIs, draw up a code of practice applying to the recruitment of foreign students and the use of agents.</p>
<p>Fees should not be introduced in isolation. If they were, the immediate result would undoubtedly be not an increase in the number of foreign students as intended but a reduction. The fee system instead must be seen as the linchpin of a strategy whose other aspects must also be realised for the system to be meaningful in the long term. This strategy should include the following:</p>
<p>• Continued development of educational programmes attractive to foreign students.</p>
<p>• Greater efforts to provide support and service to foreign students.</p>
<p>• Greater efforts to market individual educational programmes and Swedish higher education in general.</p>
<p>• More funding for grants to counteract the negative effects of the introduction of fees and reduce the impact of students’ private financial situations on the recruitment.</p>
<p>• Amended rules for labour immigration to make it easier for foreign students to stay in Sweden to work after completing their studies.</p>
<p>We consider it necessary for some of these initiatives to be funded without impacting on HEI appropriations. This applies mainly to funding for grants. The costs of increasing existing government grants to students from non-EEA countries by an amount that covers an assumed average fee may be estimated at SEK 11 million. To avoid a reduction in the number of students in this category – 1 650 in 2004 – in connection with the introduction of fees, more funds are needed for grants.</p>
<p>We propose introduction of the fee system in the academic year 2008/2009, possibly in stages over a three-year period.</p>
<p>Doctoral studies</p>
<p>We are not prepared to advocate charging individual doctoral students fees. There are primarily two reasons for this:</p>
<p>• Postgraduate education is largely conducted through the student’s own research, and the research is largely financed via external funds. A fee system would complicate the dialogue between HEIs and sponsors, without providing HEIs with any more resources.</p>
<p>• Most doctoral students have doctoral posts or postgraduate grants, which means that they are compensated by their HEIs for undergoing postgraduate education. A few more hold another kind of post at their HEI. We cannot see natural conditions for a fee system for these categories.</p>
<p>The number of doctoral students who are not affected by these conditions is so small that we do not consider it meaningful to build up a fee system. However, a closer examination should be made of the potential for contract education at doctoral level.</p>
