<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Gender equality in higher education is essentially an issue of fairness for individuals. But it is also an issue that is crucial to the legitimacy of higher education as an institution that serves and unites our society and, in the long term, to the development and competitiveness of Swedish society.</p>
<p>The Delegation for Gender Equality in Higher Education has worked on the instructions of the Government for almost two years. The remit covered both education and research, as well as the structure of higher education. Over SEK 47 million has been allocated to higher education institutions and others for measures at local level. The Delegation has also identified ongoing efforts for gender equality in higher education, launched studies, published reports and organised conferences and seminars.</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that there are shortcomings in efforts to achieve gender equality in higher education when it comes to planning, long-sightedness, cooperation, and the establishment of theoretical and practical knowledge. We have also concluded that the efforts made over the past three decades have not had the desired results. There has, of course, been some progress. It is also reasonable to assume that further progress will be made in time. But the process is slow: too slow. If we want real change, we need something more than and different from what has previously been tried.</p>
<p>Moreover, greater independence for higher education systems and changes to the systems for research funding and quality assessments of education mean new challenges for gender equality in higher education. This must influence the direction of future work.</p>
<h2>Proposals</h2>
<p>In light of the above, the Delegation proposes a concerted package of measures. The point of departure is the need for governance , support  and strategies in local efforts.</p>
<h2>Governance</h2>
<p>One crucial factor in strengthening gender equality in higher education is effective governance, follow-up and evaluation. New types of measures are necessary in this respect: measures that focus more on results and qualitative aspects of gender equality and that stimulate local impetus and desire for change. Furthermore, additional measures are needed to integrate gender equality aspects into regular processes and policy documents, and thus into the core of higher education institutions’ activities. Measures are also needed to combat the negative effects on gender equality of the existing systems for research funding. The Delegation proposes the following:</p>
<p>• Monitoring of recruitment objectives concerning professors should be improved.</p>
<p>• A gender equality bonus should be introduced. This bonus – totalling SEK 50 million per year – should be paid to higher education institutions where gender equality is deemed, on assessment, to be evidently good or to have evidently improved.</p>
<p>• Gender equality aspects should be considered within the framework of the new quality assessment system.</p>
<p>• The qualification descriptions in the Higher Education Ordinance should be reviewed from a gender perspective.</p>
<p>• The Government should review the instructions for agencies that fund research and make the requirement to take account of gender equality clearer.</p>
<p>• The research councils and the Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems (Vinnova) should be given the joint task of reviewing the process of allocating funds for investments in excellence or equivalent, from a gender equality perspective.</p>
<h2>Support</h2>
<p>Concrete efforts for gender equality must be conducted on the basis of local conditions and build on the commitment and professionalism that exist in higher education institutions. This is especially clear in light of the trend towards greater independence for higher education institutions. However, the state must take active responsibility for supporting, stimulating and promoting efforts at institution level. It is necessary for an actor to be given this explicit task. Special resources are also needed to stimulate the development of practical and useful knowledge and to create scope for higher education institutions to work on structural change. The Delegation proposes the following:</p>
<p>• The mission of the Swedish National Agency for Higher Education in the area of gender equality should be developed. The Agency should follow up, evaluate, promote in the long term and stimulate efforts for greater and stronger gender equality in higher education. Information, advice and support must be given to those higher education institutions that require them. The Agency should also evaluate gender equality at higher education institutions and present proposals to the Government on the allocation of the gender equality bonus (cf. above).</p>
<p>• The Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research should be tasked with allocating funds – in consultation with the Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems and the Swedish National Agency for Higher Education – for  needs-driven and practice-based research in areas of strategic significance to gender equality in higher education. The Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research should also allocate funds to higher education institutions for structure-changing gender equality work covering the institution as a whole.</p>
<h2>Strategies in local efforts</h2>
<p>Given the far-reaching independence of higher education institutions, it is of vital importance that they take their own primary responsibility for developing gender equality in their activities. In our view, there are a number of areas that are of particular importance for gender equality in higher education. Higher education</p>
<p>institutions must prioritise these areas. They should carefully analyse how routines, processes and working methods could be developed. Both analysis and changes to working methods should be based on existing research and documented practical experience. The Delegation proposes the following:</p>
<p>• Higher education institutions should give efforts to break  gender-related educational choices a broader focus and link them to the contents and structure of education programmes, as well as the way higher education functions in general.</p>
<p>• Higher education institutions should prioritise the development and coordination of activities concerning teaching methods in higher education.</p>
<p>• Higher education institutions should ensure that student representatives are given the opportunity to observe and influence gender equality work.</p>
<p>• The Academic Career Inquiry’s main conclusions concerning higher education institutions’ strategic responsibility as an employer should shape efforts in this area. Higher education institutions should work actively, purposefully and in a longterm perspective on issues concerning dimensioning, recruitment and human resources strategy. Recruitment should, as far as possible, be fully open to competition. Career counselling should be introduced at all higher education institutions.</p>
