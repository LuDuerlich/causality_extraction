<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The last decades have seen major, extensive changes in the field of electronic communications both in Sweden and in the rest of Europe. This development has been driven by technical changes and by the regulatory reform of markets that were previously state monopolies. This requires the legislation regulating the area to be adapted accordingly.</p>
<p>For more than a decade, work has been going on within the European Union (EU) aimed at developing common guidelines in the area of electronic communications and in 2002, a number of legal instruments were adopted within the EU (including the Framework Directive, Authorisation Directive and the Access Directive). As a result of its Electronic Communications Act (2003:389), hereinafter referred to as ECA, which came into force on 25 July 2003, Sweden has incorporated these EC directives into its national legislation. The ECA also replaces the Swedish Telecommunications Act (1993:597) and the Swedish Radio Communications Act (1993:599).</p>
<p>The National Post and Telecom Agency (PTS), the national regulatory authority for these issues, has been tasked with a number of new assignments via the ECA. The most obvious differences compared to earlier are that an operator's obligations, which were previously provided for directly under the law, now presuppose special decisions being taken by the authority and that competition-promoting measures are now only taken after a specific need has been ascertained.</p>
<p>In this final report, the Commission has been tasked by the Government to both review the authority organisation in the area of electronic communications and to evaluate the decision-making and appeal processes pursuant to the ECA.</p>
<h2>The problems</h2>
<p>Authority organisation</p>
<p>Under Government Ordinance (1997:401) containing instructions for the National Post and Telecom Agency, PTS is a central administrative authority with overall responsibility (sector responsibility) in the postal services field and in the area of electronic communications. In addition to PTS, there are a number of other authorities whose spheres of responsibility also fall within the area of electronic communications - including in particular the Data Inspection Board, the Swedish Competition Authority, the Swedish Consumer Agency, and the Swedish Radio and TV Authority.</p>
<p>As regards the area of electronic communications, PTS has been focusing its efforts on promoting competition. This is also well in line with how the goals for the sector have been formulated. The foremost means of achieving these goals is to create the conditions for effective, undistorted and unlimited competition and to promote international harmonisation.</p>
<p>PTS promotes competition by continuously analysing sub-markets into which the introduction of obligations in accordance with the ECA might be justified based on the European Commission’s recommendation and guidelines for market analysis and assessment of significant market power (SMP). In this context, the Agency shall define the relevant markets, identify undertakings with SMP and impose obligations on them. The decisions regulate the applicable conditions on a particular sub-market. It is therefore a question of ex ante regulation, in contrast to general competition law, where action is mainly taken after the event (ex post), for example when a dominant market player has abused his position, even though the provisions of the competition legislation also have a preventive effect on the actions of enterprises.</p>
<p>In SMP proceedings, PTS is obliged to consult the Swedish Competition Authority; although this consultation obligation only applies to the first step, i.e. when defining relevant markets and identifying undertakings with SMP, and not to decisions imposing the obligations. The Commission has noted, however, that the new regulatory framework affords PTS substantial decision-making authority and considerable responsibility in the field, and objections have been raised regarding the authority organisation in the</p>
<p>Official Government Reports 2006:88 Summary area of electronic communications and regarding the Agency's strong position.</p>
<p>The decision-making and appeal process</p>
<p>PTS has notified a large number of decisions based on the new legislation, many of which have been appealed to a court of law.</p>
<p>PTS rulings are appealed to the public administrative courts, or more precisely to the County Administrative Court of Stockholm, the Stockholm Administrative Court of Appeal and ultimately the Supreme Administrative Court. Cases in the County Administrative Court are dealt with by a special department, the PTS unit, and the court has appointed specific personnel to handle them. The cases are prepared and administrated by reporting clerks and assistant judges, but more difficult issues are ultimately decided by two chief magistrates and three lay assessors. In the Stockholm Administrative Court of Appeal, PTS cases are dealt with by one of the court's regular divisions.</p>
<p>The number of PTS cases is relatively small in relation to the number of other cases brought before the administrative courts - both the County Administrative Court and the Administrative Court of Appeal - but the number has gradually increased since the ECA came into force. At the end of 2005/beginning of 2006, there were 45 ongoing PTS cases at the County Administrative Court of Stockholm and 20 cases at the Stockholm Administrative Court of Appeal. On 15 July 2006, the corresponding figures were 55 and 5 cases respectively.</p>
<p>As of 15 August 2006, PTS had rendered decisions relating to 17 of the 18 markets specified in European Commission recommendations. PTS has identified one or more SMP operators on 11 of these markets, and has imposed obligations upon them.</p>
<p>The decisions on obligations have been appealed by one or more operators on all of the markets but one. Final rulings on several of the decisions rendered by PTS during the second half of 2004 had still not been made in September 2006.</p>
<p>An illustrative example of this is the PTS decision to designate TeliaSonera as an SMP operator in the wholesale broadband access market and impose obligations on it. PTS rendered its decision on 24 November 2004. On 20 April 2006, the County Administrative Court ruled in favour of the Agency and on the 3 July 2006, the</p>
<p>Administrative Court of Appeal decided not to grant leave to appeal. This verdict has in turn been appealed and on 28 July 2006 the Supreme Administrative Court decided to try the question of the Administrative Court of Appeals decision not to grant leave to appeal.</p>
<p>The problem of the courts often electing to hamper the implementation of decisions rendered by PTS by granting stays of execution has been brought to the attention of the Commission. For example, PTS has highlighted the problem of it not being able to implement the above-mentioned decision on wholesale broadband access due to the decision being suspended by the County Administrative Court and the final adjudication has yet to be made. As a result of a judgement on 20 April 2006, the County Administrative Court of Stockholm simultaneously rejected TeliaSonera's appeal and lifted the stay of execution from 3 February 2005. Only after this date, therefore, has PTS been able to start enforcing the obligation it imposed over 14 months earlier. Implementation has however been hampered once again by the Supreme Administrative Court having decided to grant leave to appeal and a stay of execution on 28 July 2006.</p>
<p>Of the 45 cases that were ongoing at the end of 2005/beginning of 2006 in the County Administrative Court of Stockholm, a stay of execution had been granted in 16 of them.</p>
<p>Dispute resolution</p>
<p>Under Chapter 7, Section 10 of the ECA, PTS shall resolve disputes between players on the electronic communications market and shall also render decisions on issues central to such disputes as soon as possible; decisions are to be passed within four months from the date the application is received by the Agency. The Commission has noted that there are certain problems associated with meeting this four-month deadline for the resolution of disputes. The problems are however not particularly serious and most cases are indeed decided on within the deadline. The Commission has ascertained, however, that there are no regulations enabling the regulatory authority to speed up dispute resolution proceedings or to prevent any of the parties from delaying them. The majority of the market players also feel that the requirement placed on PTS to maintain a division of functions leads to extra work and inefficiency, an opinion also expressed by PTS.</p>
<p>The Commissions assessment</p>
<p>The Commission has ascertained that the regulation of electronic communications is necessary under a foreseeable future and that the long-term purpose is that the markets should be brought to work so well that the regulation is no longer needed. There is today a considerable degree of regulatory uncertainty in the markets for electronic communications. This impedes the development of investments and makes it more difficult to establish working competition and thereby the supply of services for consumers.</p>
<p>The fundamental assignment of responsibilities between the authorities works satisfactorily according to the Commission. The cooperation between PTS and the Swedish Competition Authority should however be improved and be developed. The decision processes at PTS (including the dispute resolution proceedings) could also be improved. The problems that the Commission has noted in these respects contribute to regulatory uncertainty.</p>
<p>The Commission has also established that the drawn-out handling of PTS cases causes problems and delays the implementation of regulation. According to the Commission, these long appeal processes are primarily caused by the regulations laid down in the Administrative Court Procedure Act, which governs public administrative court proceedings, not having been adapted to enable a final ruling in PTS cases to be carried forward. The courts can do little to prevent the parties from submitting additional documentation should they wish to do so. Another factor, which, in the Commission’s view, leads to drawn-out proceedings is the scope for appealing to at most three different court instances.</p>
<h2>The proposals</h2>
<p>In this report, the Commission presents a number of proposals for amendments to the ECA. The aim of these proposals is to reduce regulatory uncertainty and contribute to that the regulation which under a foreseeable future is necessary for parts of the field of electronic communication becomes well-balanced. The Commission present proposals that clarify the long-term regulation strategy and short-term decisions on obligations, but also by implementing measures to shorten the time between PTS decisions being passed and them gaining legal force. The proposals aim inter alia to shorten the appeal processes and improve PTS decisions in order to thereby reduce legal uncertainty. The proposals in the report will hopefully lead to improvements as regards how PTS formulates the long term strategy for the area of electronic communication and how the authority formulates its decisions and the dispute resolution proceedings. An important part of the proposals are also an increased and improved cooperation with the Swedish Competition Authority. Moreover, proposals for amendments to procedural rules as regards the handling of PTS cases are put forward to enable decisions to be more promptly implemented. According to the Commission, the proposals will reduce regulatory uncertainty and hence have a positive effect on competition and the will to invest, which in turn will lead to more rapid development of different services for the benefit of consumers.</p>
<p>Regulatory decisions</p>
<p>The Commission has ascertained that PTS often in practice uses a three-stage process when imposing obligations on players with significant market power in a particular market. The Commission has also established that decisions pursuant to the guidelines in the preparatory work of the ECA are being gradually more precisely defined by decisions on obligations, supervisory decisions and dispute resolution decisions. Several operators feel, on the other hand, that decisions on obligations in particular are far too imprecise, although this also applies in part to supervisory and dispute resolution decisions. The Commission shares this assessment. The most important problem is that the decisions are not felt to be sufficiently clear as regards which obligations are imposed on SMP undertakings, so that this can form the basis of future business agreements between enterprises. This naturally causes considerable uncertainty on the market.</p>
<p>It is the Commission’s assessment that more precise decisions on obligations by PTS would in all likelihood reduce the time spent on investigations and reduce conflicts between market players. The Commission therefore proposes that the importance of precisely defined decisions be emphasised by such a requirement being incorporated into the provision regarding decisions on obligations in Chapter 8 Section 6 of ECA. The deciding factor should be that decisions are to be sufficiently clear so that both the obligated and entitled parties are aware of their rights and obligations. The aim of such a requirement is to further emphasise the fact that the decisions should, as far as possible, be able to be used as a basis for agreements between the obligated and the entitled parties.</p>
<p>Yet another proposal to create further reason for PTS to define its decisions on obligations more precisely is that in its appropriation directions to PTS, the Government shall require the Agency to report the average time span between the decision being passed and its implementation for all the decisions on obligations taken each year.</p>
<p>According to the Commission, one measure to make obligations more precise would be to allow civil law suits to be brought in connection with decisions on obligations. This possibility to bring action for damages will also draw the market players attention to the importance of PTS duty to make the obligations more precise. The Commission therefore proposes that a regulation be introduced specifying that if an operator deliberately or as a result of negligence takes a measure that is in breach of, or fails to take a measure that is necessary in order to comply with, an obligation under Chapter 4, Section 4 or Chapter 5 Sections 13-14 of ECA or ensuing from Chapter 5 Section 12 thereof, the aforesaid operator shall compensate for the damage thereby incurred.</p>
<p>According to the Commission, the Government should task an independent expert to analyse how the National Post and Telecom Agency has worded its arguments relating to its decisions on market analysis and obligations, how these decisions, if necessary, could be improved and what, if any, legislative amendments might be necessary to bring about the desired improvements.</p>
<p>To make a clear, formal distinction between decisions on obligations and dispute resolution, the Commission proposes that it be made clear that decisions on obligations may not apply to the relationship between certain parties; they shall relate to general obligations for the obligated addressee, at the same time as they also apply for the benefit of all those for whom, according to the legislation, the decision constitutes a right. This will make the distinction between supervision and dispute resolution clearer, since supervision is not only a question of whether the obligated party complies with the obligations but also may result in an order to follow the law or decision on obligations. Dispute resolution, on the other hand, is a question of clarifying the conditions that shall apply between two parties on account of obligations according to the law or decisions that have been passed pursuant to the law.</p>
<p>This may lead to clearer decisions on obligations, since it becomes obvious that these decisions shall be more precise and that no further obligations may be imposed as a result of dispute resolution. This is obvious as far as supervision is concerned, since supervision must always be a question of compliance with an obligation of some kind.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore proposes that clarification shall be given in Chapter 8, Section 6 of the ECA of the fact that an obligation may not be restricted to the relationship between an undertaking with significant market power and one or more opposing parties, but shall apply generally in relation to all entitled parties covered by the decision.</p>
<h2>Dispute resolution</h2>
<p>It is the Commission’s opinion that the proposal for more precisely defined decisions on obligations will lead to fewer disputes being the subject of dispute resolution. The dispute resolution process will thereby be streamlined, since the authority can establish the terms that are to apply between certain specified parties by means of dispute resolution.</p>
<p>It is crucial that the ECA is applied in a legally secure way in order to create good conditions for a well-functioning market. According to the Commission, it is therefore important that the obligations imposed under the act are determined in accordance with the proceedings that apply to decisions on obligations as regards consultation with market players, other authorities and the European Commission - and not in any other form. It is therefore important that dispute resolution in accordance with the ECA implies a legally secure interpretation of these decisions on obligations. The wording must be crystal-clear that imposing new or extended obligations in connection with dispute resolution is out of the question.</p>
<p>As regards how PTS organises its internal activities in relation to e.g. dispute resolution matters, the Commission feels that there is</p>
<p>no reason to impose a requirement on PTS to maintain an organisational division between the Agency's different functions. PTS should instead be able to organise itself in a way it sees most suitable in order to perform its tasks efficiently.</p>
<p>The Commission does propose, however, that dispute resolution matters shall always be decided on presentation by an official who must be a Master of Law, in order to guarantee a high level of legal security.</p>
<p>In disputes examined pursuant to the ECA, it is common for PTS to have to examine the issue of when, i.e. on which date, the dispute arose when a party requests a ruling to be applied retroactively, i.e. before the request was submitted to the Agency. In such cases, it is not uncommon for PTS decisions to involve the dispute being examined from the date when dispute resolution was requested at the Agency. PTS's application of the act presupposes therefore that a dispute has arisen when the request for dispute resolution is submitted to the Agency. PTS accepts any arrangement whereby the parties agree on the dispute having arisen at an earlier point in time. If they however disagree, the party requesting dispute resolution from an earlier point in time (retroactively) must provide evidence that the dispute did indeed arise at such a point in time, something which in many cases is difficult to do.</p>
<p>There is also a danger of such an application of the act, since it risks encouraging parties to hurriedly request dispute resolution at PTS before they have exhausted all other possible ways of solving the dispute through commercial negotiations.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore proposes that a special provision be incorporated into the ECA stating that the examination of a dispute may cover the time prior to the application being submitted to PTS as long as the applicant has beforehand requested negotiations with the opposing party on the issue but that such negotiations have either not taken place or have not resulted in an agreement on the issue. The examination may then include the time from whence the requested agreement or condition were to have applied, though at the earliest from the date a request for negotiations was made.</p>
<p>The Commission ascertains that PTS is often able to notify a decision in dispute resolution cases within the statutory fourmonth deadline. This deadline is occasionally exceeded however due to the complexity and extent of individual cases. Exemption from the deadline can be granted for such cases under the act.</p>
<p>One common reason why things take a long time seems, however, to be that parties change their claims or present new claims at a very late stage in the proceedings. Neither is it uncommon for parties to repeatedly request deferment in order to submit their claims; the Commission cannot rule out the possibility that this is done in an attempt to procrastinate proceedings even further. A key factor in this context is that the opposing party in a dispute resolution case often has nothing to gain from a rapid resolution of the dispute, which is primarily in the interest of the applicant.</p>
<p>In order to speed up dispute resolution proceedings under the ECA, they need to be regulated bearing in mind the fact that they involve parties with widely opposing individual interests. The Commission therefore proposes that provisions governing dispute resolution proceedings be incorporated into the ECA.</p>
<p>One problem in a dispute resolution case can be that PTS does not receive the necessary background information from the parties. It is the Commission’s view that the existing regulations do not give PTS sufficient authority to be able to request the necessary information and background material. The Commission therefore proposes that scope be provided for PTS to be able to order a party to submit the necessary background information. This order could be subject to an administrative fine.</p>
<p>The appeal process</p>
<p>One important issue is obviously why court proceedings take such a long time. The Commission draws the conclusion that this is caused by extensive exchange of written correspondence and administration; when cases are ready for final ruling, they are settled relatively quickly in the courts. The Commission does not feel that the resources set aside by the administrative courts to deal with PTS cases are insufficient. On the contrary, it seems if anything that these cases are to a certain extent prioritised in relation to other cases which, pursuant to the law, are not to receive priority treatment. This is particularly true of the County Administrative Court of Stockholm and its established PTS unit.</p>
<p>The Commission has considered whether or not it should instead be possible to appeal PTS cases to the Swedish Market Court as the first and only instance. Such an amendment would</p>
<p>make the appeal process more expedient. Another advantage of transferring cases to the Market Court is that economic experts would thenceforward be involved in the decisions and it is clear from the preparatory work of the ECA that SMP decisions should be taken based on competition law principles and methodology (Government Bill 2002/03:110, p 275 - in Swedish).</p>
<p>According to the Commission, one of the most compelling reasons for keeping PTS cases in the public administrative courts is, however, that they have accumulated considerable skills for dealing with such cases. Furthermore, strong arguments need normally to be put forward to change existing administrative regulations, especially if the teething troubles associated with reorganisation are likely to counteract the goal of speeding up the appeal process. Even though the Commission is convinced that such a change, with the Market Court being the first and only instance, would make the process quicker than it is today, the same effect can be achieved by amendments being made within the existing system. Furthermore, a change within the existing system is considerably easier to implement than if PTS cases were to be transferred to the Market Court.</p>
<p>All things considered, the Commission feels that it should continue to be possible to appeal PTS cases to the public administrative courts.</p>
<p>Fewer court instances</p>
<p>The Commission feels that legal security can be upheld for PTS cases even if the Administrative Court of Appeal is the last instance. Reducing the number of appeal instances can shorten the time it takes for decisions pursuant to the ECA to gain legal force. The Commission therefore proposes that the scope for appealing PTS decisions all the way up to the Supreme Administrative Court be removed, and that the Administrative Court of Appeal be instead the last court instance for all PTS cases. The Administrative Court of Appeal shall be able to examine a case based on the same dispensation grounds as are currently applicable.</p>
<p>Special members</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that special members (economic experts) shall participate when the County Administrative Court and the Administrative Court of Appeal decide on issues relating to the identification of undertakings with significant market power on a particular market and issues relating to obligations for such undertakings.</p>
<p>Deadlines for administration and adjudication</p>
<p>To speed up the final rulings of PTS decisions on competitionpromoting issues, the courts should be empowered to force such ruling through. Such scope is provided if the courts are given a deadline for when cases should be finally adjudicated, combined with deadlines for when the exchange of written correspondence should be concluded.</p>
<p>The Commission proposed that a regulation be introduced stating that appealed decisions in accordance with Chapter 8, Section 6 of the ECA must have been finally decided within six months after the expiry of the appeal period; the same deadline shall apply to appealed decisions. In the event of exceptional circumstances hindering final ruling, the deadline may be extended. The exchange of written correspondence in the County Administrative Court shall be deemed to be concluded four months after the expiry of the appeal period. The exchange of written correspondence in the Administrative Court of Appeal shall be considered concluded two months after the court has decided whether or not to grant leave to appeal. These deadlines can also be extended in the event of extenuating circumstances.</p>
<p>The Commission also proposes that special preclusion regulations be incorporated into Chapter 8 of the ECA relating to administrative proceedings in the County Administrative Court and the Administrative Court of Appeal. New circumstances or new evidence shall only be invoked in the County Administrative Court when four months have elapsed since the expiry of the appeal period if the party is able to give probable cause why he wasn't able to invoke such circumstances or evidence at an earlier juncture. New circumstances or new evidence may only be invoked</p>
<p>in the Administrative Court of Appeal if there are special reasons for doing so.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that a court that is examining a stay of execution petition relating to a decision taken pursuant to the ECA shall pay special attention to the purpose of the act as is laid down in its portal paragraph in Chapter 1, Section 1. The County Administrative Court and the Administrative Court of Appeal shall be obliged to give reasons why a decision on a PTS ruling shall not apply until further notice.</p>
<p>Authority organisation</p>
<p>The Commission believes that the existing allocation of responsibility between the authorities as regards competition-promotion activities in the field of electronic communications works satisfactorily and should therefore not be changed. The cooperation between PTS and the Swedish Competition Authority should however increase to promote sustainable competition and to reduce regulatory uncertainty through improved decisions on obligations.</p>
<p>As regards consultation between PTS and the Swedish Competition Authority in SMP issues, the Commission proposes that PTS shall request written opinions from the Competition Authority in matters relating to Sections 21-22 of the Electronic Communications Ordinance, i.e. concerning proposals for imposing obligations on an enterprise with significant market power in a particular market. The consultation shall be in connection with a draft proposal for a decision. A decision that deviates from the opinion of the Competition Authority shall include reasons for why the opinion has not been heeded.</p>
<p>The Commission also proposes that PTS shall cooperate with the Competition Authority on a long-term strategy.</p>
<p>The internal organisation of PTS</p>
<p>The Commission feels that PTS is an efficient authority with a high level of skills within its remit. It has been brought to the Commission’s attention that many market players feel the requirement placed on PTS to maintain a division of functions between regulation tasks, supervision and dispute resolution activities leads to extra work and inefficiency. These players recommend that PTS be divided up per issue instead. Others feel however that it is not suitable for the same authority to exercise all these different functions, from inter alia a legal security point of view.</p>
<p>The Commission makes the same assessment as regarding dispute resolution concerning the division of functions between regulatory decisions and supervisory decisions pursuant to the ECA. Bearing in mind that the same people make decisions in the various matters, the division of functions serves no purpose. To improve efficiency by realising the benefits of coordination, the Commission believes that PTS does not need to maintain an organisational division of the different functions within the Agency. PTS should instead be organised in a way it feels is most suitable to be able to carry out its various tasks most effectively.</p>
<p>The Commission does believe however that there is reason to place more explicit demands on PTS in certain respects. The Government should for example give the Agency the task of proposing quantitative indicators to measure yearly development as regards overall goal achievement, consumer complaints, delays between decisions and their implementation as well as the quality of decisions.</p>
<p>The Commission feels that there is a need for new strategic measures with the purpose to increase the clarity and predictability of PTS future actions. There should therefore be a requirement for a long-term strategy for the area of electronic communications. The Commission therefore proposes that the Government task the PTS to draft a long-term strategy in communication with the Swedish Competition Authority in the area of electronic communications at least every third year. The strategy should supply grounds for developing decisions on markets analyses and obligations and for policy development on a national and an EU level. The strategy shall stretch over a period of five years and shall be annually reviewed.</p>
<p>The Commission feels that the activities of PTS and the Competition Authority in the area of electronic communications shall continue to be financed by fees even in the future. Decisions as to the size of annual fees shall be taken by the Government. PTS shall collect fees and use them as it sees fit, with the exception of the funds needed by the Competition Authority for its participation in decisions on market analysis and obligations. Administration fees</p>
<p>shall continue to be decided on and be at the disposal of PTS. The Government shall determine what proportion of the annual revenue shall be given to the Competition Authority for its participation in accordance with the Electronic Communications Ordinance. Both authorities shall report their resource use to the Government.</p>
<p>The consequences of the proposals</p>
<p>A basic idea behind the proposals presented in this report is that, taken together, they shall lead to quicker decision processes and a more efficient authority organisation. This in turn will reduce regulatory uncertainty and the time span between PTS decisions being passed and when they can be implemented. According to the Commission, this should have a positive impact on the way the markets function. The Competition Authority will function better and the will of enterprises to invest for the long term will increase. This will have positive economic effects and help improve consumer access to electronic communications.</p>
<p>The Commission’s assessment of the collective economic consequences is that PTS and the administrative courts will be able to reduce their costs. Enterprises, too, will need to set aside fewer resources for legal disputes. The Competition Authority, the public courts and the Government Offices will have slightly higher costs to bear. The decision process will be speeded up, which to a corresponding extent is expected to provide significant economic advantages in the form of lower prices and an increased and better supply of services.</p>
<p>The total economic effects will therefore be both positive and significant, according to the Commission.</p>
