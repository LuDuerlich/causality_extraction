<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>1.1 Mission and background</h2>
<p>The Veterinary Inquiry has been commissioned by the Swedish Government to analyse the current situation in the following fields and to propose how they should be organised in the future: 1. Veterinary field work, TPF FPT 2. The exercise of public authority by practising veterinarians 3. The supervision of professional veterinary activities.</p>
<p>The aim in this endeavour is to promote economic efficiency and make clearer the role of central government in the veterinary sector. Competitive neutrality is to be sought. A basic essential is 24hour access to animal care throughout the country. In addition, the new veterinary setup must maintain a nationwide and effective preparedness for the outbreak of epizootic diseases and the like. Finally, the organisation must have the capacity to perform veterinary administrative tasks relating to the exercise of public authority, including control measures undertaken by official veterinarians.</p>
<p>At present, veterinary activities in the Swedish market are undertaken both by state ‘district veterinarians’ employed by the Swedish Board of Agriculture and by veterinarians in the private sector. The district veterinarians are responsible for the delivery of health and medical care to farm animals, for performing official duties under EC regulations, and for providing a field resource in infectious disease control programmes. The district veterinarians offer veterinary care and maintain 24-hour preparedness for the control of infectious animal disease throughout the country.</p>
<p>Among private veterinary practitioners, there is widespread dissatisfaction with the present setup. In particular, this concerns the differing terms and conditions for state and private veterinary activities respectively. The problems are largely as follows:</p>
<p>• Private and state veterinarians operate under different terms and conditions.</p>
<p>• State veterinarians are increasing their work with pets and horses, traditionally a preserve of private practitioners.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Board of Agriculture has a dual role in that it undertakes clinical veterinary activities while at the same time performing supervisory and other official tasks in the veterinary field, in the private sector as well as the public.</p>
<h2>1.2 The veterinary market</h2>
<p>There are some 330 state district veterinarians in Sweden, operating in 90 odd locations. Their mandates require them to provide emergency duty services primarily targeting farm animals, in accordance with a rotating timetable. If there are animal welfare grounds for doing so, or if no other animal care is available, all animals, including pets and horses, are to be provided with animal care by the district veterinarians. There are different views in the market as to how this part of the mandate is to be interpreted.</p>
<p>Over time, state veterinary activities have focused increasingly on animal care for pets and horses, neither of which are a production factor in the agricultural sector. During the period 2000– 2005, the proportion of farm animals in district veterinary operations fell from 39 to 28 per cent. Over the same period, the proportion of pets in the state operation rose from 45 to 53 per cent and the proportion of horses from 16 to 19 per cent. Activities under the official veterinary mandate represent about 2 per cent of total activities in the veterinary sector.</p>
<p>The district veterinarians are largely financed by fees and also to some extent by central government grants. In 2005, turnover was approximately 44 million euros, of which some 10 million euros comprised government grants. Just under half of the appropriation was used to offset deficits at the veterinary stations and the remainder to finance the district veterinarians’ national operation at the Board of Agriculture, including certain centrally reported production costs. The latter includes central administrative costs, inservice training for veterinarians, and IT costs at the veterinary stations. No statistics of a more detailed kind are available. District veterinary stations can only exercise control of their own local operations to a very limited extent. They are not entitled to make investments or recruit staff themselves.</p>

<p>Private veterinary field activities</p>
<p>In 2005, some 300 private practitioners registered 10 or more site visits to farm animals with the Board of Agriculture’s national animal desease register. In the same year, farm animals accounted for 19 per cent of the private veterinarians’ total operations. The corresponding figure for the district veterinarians was 28 per cent.</p>
<p>About a hundred private veterinarians engage in activities that from a customer viewpoint are fully comparable to those provided by the state district veterinarians. This means, for instance, that they maintain a 24-hour service with veterinary field activities. As a rule, they provide an emergency duty service under the same type of rotating timetable as the district veterinarians. One difference is that private practitioners do not qualify for government funding. They have to work entirely on the market’s terms. Nor do they participate in infectious disease control work to the same extent as the district veterinarians, and they receive far less in-service training in infectious disease control and epizootic diseases than their state colleagues.</p>
<p>The agency structure</p>
<p>Besides being responsible for a significant share of the clinical veterinary activities undertaken in Sweden, the Board of Agriculture is required to monitor the veterinary situation in the country as a whole and to supervise professional veterinary operations. The board also provides veterinarians with official authorisation. Each veterinarian is required to report his or her diagnoses to the board’s national animal desease register.</p>
<p>Food issues, including meat inspection, are however dealt with by the National Food Administration, which is a public administrative agency. Some 80 veterinarians are employed by the National Food Administration to carry out meat inspections. When required, clinically active district veterinarians and private practitioners are also called in as an extra resource.</p>
<p>Operative supervision of veterinary activity is undertaken regionally by the county administrative boards. This supervision has not worked efficiently. The county administrative boards are also responsible for coordinating and following up activities in the veterinary market.</p>
<h2>1.3 Trends</h2>
<p>Farm animals of virtually every kind have declined in number over the past 25 years. This trend will continue. It includes such categories as beef cattle kept for meat production. The number of dairy cows is expected to decline by 10–15 per cent over the next 10 years. This corresponds to around 50 000 animals. The number of pigs, too, is expected to fall, but to a lesser extent.</p>
<p>Demand for medical care provision to farm animals is also expected to fall. This decline is expected to be larger than is directly attributable to the fall in the number of farm animals. An important catalyst in this respect is growing cost pressure on farmers, which in turn is a result of growing international competition combined with national effects of the transition to farm support under the EU’s Mid-Term Review (MTR) of the Common Agricultural Policy.</p>
<p>The number of horses will not undergo any great change. The number of dogs and cats, however, is expected to continue rising significantly, according to representatives of dog and cat organisations.</p>
<p>About 80 per cent of dogs in Sweden are insured (life insurance and/or medical insurance). The proportion of insured pets and horses is on the increase. The number of health insurance claims settled per animal is also rising. Between 1995 and 1999, the number of such cases per 10 000 insured animals in the leading Swedish animal insurance company was 36 per cent for dogs, 37 per cent for cats and 50 per cent for horses. This means that animal owners have become much more inclined to seek medical care for their animals than before. It is difficult to see any other explanation for this development than a change in owners’ attitudes to their animals. The animal insurance market, too, has grown and has widened its range with the addition of new insurance products.</p>
<p>The trends described here are clearly reflected in the above Table 1.</p>
<h2>1.4 Overall assessment</h2>
<p>When the Swedish veterinary sector is thus described, the picture that emerges is one of division, and of a heterogeneous market with unclear roles and responsibilities. This applies both to the commercial market and to the tasks of central government, such as coordination, followup, official controls and supervision. The regulatory systems are unclear and in many cases difficult to interpret. One such example is the government mandate under which the state district veterinarians operate. The lack of clarity apparent in this respect means that district veterinarians are competing in the animal care market well beyond what can be reasonable limits of central government responsibility.</p>
<p>It is important to note that to a great extent state and private veterinarians perform the same work and serve the same purpose, side by side. This applies both to animal care and to certain state veterinary tasks. State actors receive government funding of about 10 million euros per annum, to perform such tasks as delivering 24hour animal care nationwide. Certain other tasks of important public concern, such as field preparedness for infectious animal diseases, are also defrayed out of this appropriation. However, funding based on these spheres of activity is not reported. Thus, seen from the outside, activities in the private and central government sectors are homogeneous and increasingly tend to converge. Internal operating conditions in terms of administration, financing, investment and control, however, are diametrically different.</p>
<p>The number of farm animals is declining on a fairly broad front. Livestock herds are growing in size. In the assessment of Sweden’s dairy farmers, an average dairy cow herd will be twice as large in 2015 as it was in 2005. This change will not be a dramatic one. Developments have been moving in this direction for some time, and fairly slowly. Matters will speed up in the years to come, however. This is due to the realignment of agricultural policy, which means that farming companies will either have to become more productive or close down. Demand for animal care for pets, meanwhile, will increase significantly.</p>
<p>This situation has led to conflicts between state and private actors in the veterinary market, which in turn has made it more difficult for them to cooperate on emergency duty services and disease control. The public authorities are regarded with considerable suspicion by large sections of the private veterinary market. Many practitioners maintain emergency duty services partly to ensure that a state veterinary station is not established in the area. Were such facilities to be established, private practitioners’ customer potential would be reduced in the increasingly important markets for pets and horses. Veterinarians who would like to provide duty services refrain from doing so because they are ineligible for government funding, while others who would prefer not to provide such services continue doing so for competitive reasons. This means that veterinary resources are not being exploited in the best possible way. Competitive distortions and market conflicts are leading to a decline in economic efficiency.</p>
<p>Under the inquiry’s terms of reference, 24-hour animal care must be available to farm animals throughout the country, whether or not their number is reduced. Even the most pessimistic forecasts for dairy herds – easily the largest patient category among livestock – expect there to be some 50 000 cows in the six northernmost counties in ten years’ time. This area covers more than half of Sweden’s land surface, is considerably larger than the UK and six times as large as Denmark. It is also very sparsely populated. Given the current rules on working hours, around 4 veterinarians are needed to staff a veterinary station wishing to maintain a 24-hour emergency duty service. According to the inquiry’s analyses, in large parts of the country there is insufficient customer potential for the provision of 24-hour animal care on market terms. This means that public funding to veterinary operations must continue in the future if nationwide 24-hour veterinary services and efficient disease control are to be ensured.</p>
<p>One important conclusion is that a governmentfunded, nationwide veterinary organisation in its present form cannot be run in a costeffective manner unless it is able to accept work involving pets and horses. Reducing the organisation’s size would mean infectious disease control could no longer be effectively maintained. Thus continued state operation on a nationwide basis cannot solve the market’s problems, given the limits established for the present inquiry.</p>
<p>The dual role of the Board of Agriculture, involving both clinical veterinary activities of its own and the supervision of professional veterinary operations in the country as a whole, is a factor in the inadequate working of the market. This dual role undermines confidence in the public authority and leads to inefficiency in the monitoring and supervision of the market. There may, for instance, be suspicions that data concerning an individual veterinarian’s business and production situation, duly reported to the Board of Agriculture, may be improperly used to benefit the agency’s own veterinary activities.</p>
<p>In a time of change, a solution for the future should emphasise flexibility. At the same time, it must ensure access to at least a basic degree of animal care and guarantee that programmes for infectious disease control are efficient throughout the country. In other words, the solution must be both flexible and stable. Furthermore, it must be economically efficient. Veterinarians should therefore be given the freedom to organise their activities in new forms, on the basis of market conditions.</p>
<p>A general principle should be that in scale and scope, any state veterinary operation or other central government activity should not exceed what is required to ensure that the public objectives concerning veterinary activity are achieved. In light of this, analysis should be made of which tools, incentives and policy levers might appropriately be introduced in place of – or in combination with – a staterun, clinical veterinary operation. Such an operation may still be needed, however, in areas where the conditions for an efficient veterinary market are neither present nor can be created with the aid of whatever other policy levers may be considered.</p>
<h2>1.5 Proposals</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the state run district veterinary organisation be privatised, starting in southern Sweden, in areas of high animal density. Staff are to be invited to take over the veterinary stations, complete with vehicles and fixtures. In time, the aim is for clinical veterinary activities under central government auspices to be phased out all over the country. This presupposes that the supply of veterinary services can be maintained through private actors. The problem of the Board of Agriculture’s dual role will diminish in importance with the privatisation of staterun, clinical veterinary activities.</p>
<p>At the same time, a system of government funding to privately practising veterinarians is to be introduced, encompassing an emergency duty grant, an investment grant and an operating grant. The emergency duty grant can be made available to all veterinarians who undertake to participate in a comprehensive joint duty scheme. The size of the grant can be made dependent on the number of site visits. In return, the veterinarians will be required to stand by for infectious disease control work prior to or in connection with outbreaks of epizootic diseases or salmonella. Separate government funding will be provided for such purposes. The investment and operating grants will be available to veterinarians who receive emergency duty grants in areas with low animal density. The Board of Agriculture will be assigned to draw up more detailed criteria for how the funding system is to be applied.</p>
<p>The grants must be designed in such a way as to correspond to the cost of maintaining those veterinary services that are vital to the community and to ensure that there is no crosssubsidising of regular veterinary services. In addition, the principles governing the remaining financial support to district veterinarians must be overhauled and made transparent so that the funding is provided on the basis of the same criteria as apply in the case of grants to private practitioners.</p>
<p>The inquiry also proposes that the legal obligations of all veterinarians be made more compelling. Each and every veterinarian engaging in professional activities involving animal care must, if required to do so by the animal owner, provide emergency care to injured or sick animals, should this be desirable on animal welfare grounds. The animal owner is to pay for the work. The inquiry also proposes introducing a general obligation whereby veterinarians</p>
<p>must take part in infectious disease control work should this be requested by a public authority. This obligation is to apply where there are special reasons for such a request and where the disease control organisation’s regular field resources are insufficient. In this connection, reasonable allowance is to be made for the veterinarians’ personal circumstances and for their need to provide regular animal care. Veterinarians are to be appropriately compensated out of state funds when ordered to carry out field work. Finally, a new statutory obligation is proposed requiring veterinarians to report information to the public authorities, including data on such aspects as place of business, the orientation and volume of the operation concerned, site visits and diagnoses etc.</p>
<p>New rules on supervision are also proposed. Under these rules, the regional supervisory authority – the county administrative boards, as before – will have the right to obtain access to the veterinarian’s premises, facilities and vehicles, and to carry out investigations and take samples there. Veterinarians will be required to supply whatever documents, objects or artefacts may be necessary for the proper supervision of their activities. Where necessary, the police may assist the supervisory authority in such matters. The authority will also be able to order veterinarians to hand over whatever material may be required for such purposes and to correct any irregularities that the supervisory process may uncover. Failure to comply may result in the imposition of a financial penalty.</p>
<p>Practising veterinarians will still be required to perform official veterinary duties, such as the issuing of animal health certificates in connection with the import or export of animal products, in addition to their regular clinical work. Any alternative would necessitate the development of a totally new agency structure affecting many different areas of agriculture and food production. Given its terms of reference, the inquiry is not in a position to propose such farreaching changes. However, it does propose the development at central level of guidelines showing how conflicts of interest between the exercise of public authority and commercial clinical veterinary activities might best be avoided, based for instance on the rules in the Administrative Procedure Act on lawful disqualification in the exercise of public authority.</p>
<p>Finally, it is proposed that the Board of Agriculture establish a modern, webbased veterinary register where the veterinarians themselves, on the basis of their new statutory obligation to report,</p>
<p>are required to provide information about their activities. Hitherto, such data has been reported in printed form and seldom updated. In the inquiry’s assessment, all the above measures can be undertaken within existing budgetary frameworks. Taken together, the proposals will help reduce or eliminate the competitive distortions and market conflicts currently evident in regular commercial veterinary activities. Also, as a result of the proposals, it will be possible to bring in more veterinarians for the performance of veterinary duties essential to the community, such as maintaining emergency duty services and being available for field work in connection with outbreaks of epizootic diseases etc.</p>
