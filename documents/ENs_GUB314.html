<p>Remit</p>
<p>The main remit of the Committee has been to delimit, primarily on the basis of archive material, the areas that the Sami may use under the Reindeer Husbandry Act for reindeer grazing during the period October–April (winter grazing lands). This part of the remit has been called the search for the outer boundary . There has also been another side to the remit. This has been to transfer the terms set out in article 14 of ILO (International Labour Organisation) Convention No. 169 to Swedish conditions. This particular article deals with lands that indigenous peoples traditionally occupy and land to which they have traditionally had access for their subsistence and traditional activities. We have called the boundary between theses two categories of land the inner boundary .</p>
<p>Our work can be seen as a continuation of the work done by an earlier inquiry, the ILO Inquiry, which was led by former county governor Sven Heurgren. The purpose of that Inquiry was to determine what measures were required to enable Sweden to fulfil the requirements that Convention No. 169 places on the states that have acceded to it (which Sweden has not yet done). The ILO Inquiry presented its report in 1999 (SOU 1999:25). The report proposed the establishment of a special boundary delimitation committee.</p>
<p>It is worth explaining at the outset that the remit of this committee is limited in certain respects. Thus we have not had the task of proposing legislative amendments and have instead been obliged to make our assessments in the light of the current law. This means, for example, that we are bound by rulings that have been made by the courts and that our pronouncements on the Sami’s customary lands will not have any formal legal force. In addition, it is not part of our remit to strike balances in industry policy between the interests of reindeer husbandry and other industries in</p>
<p>the light of the current conditions. Nor does our remit include the substance of the reindeer herding right or the question of who is entitled to exercise that right.</p>
<p>Finally it should also be noted that our work has been limited by the time and resources at our disposal. Thus it is not impossible that deeper surveys of limited areas will be able to find historical evidence of winter grazing in material that we have been unable to study, such as parish registers, newspaper items, etc. It is also possible that, with access to expert knowledge in the field, we could, by making a more thorough analysis of other legal systems than the one we have carried out, have at any rate stated views de lege ferenda  (i.e. about what the law ought to be) of importance for the assessment of both the outer and the inner boundary. However, as no such analysis has yet been carried out in connection with court rulings it would hardly have been able to form the basis for the pronouncements de lege lata  (i.e. about what the law is) that fall within our remit.</p>
<p>Historic background</p>
<p>Changes in reindeer husbandry and society</p>
<p>Over the centuries reindeer husbandry has been affected by both external and internal change. In Lapland itself, the Sami had more or less sole control until the 18th century. In the following centuries they were transformed into a minority by the expansion of agriculture and forestry. At the same time there was sharp population growth in the coastal communities of Västerbotten and Norrbotten and in Jämtland and Härjedalen. In the mid-18th century Norrland accounted for 5 per cent of the Swedish population, but when the region’s share peaked in 1930 it was 13.3 per cent. In contrast, the reindeer-herding Sami population did not increase, and actually stagnated in the 19th century and fell in the 20th century. Over time most Samis had to seek a livelihood outside of reindeer husbandry.</p>
<p>To begin with, Sami culture was mainly based on hunting and fishing and at that time a family only had a few tame reindeer. The 17th century saw a transition to large-scale reindeer nomadism with reindeer herds as the main source of livelihood. For a long time these operations were intensive, which meant that the herds</p>
<p>were relatively small with only around a hundred animals. In the late 19th and early 20th century extensive reindeer herding evolved with larger herds and looser supervision. The authorities resisted this development for a long time, but since the Second World War extensive reindeer herding has been seen as a natural modernisation corresponding to what was happening at the same time in agriculture. During the last three decades of the century this has led to a marked increase in the number of reindeer, especially in Jämtland and Västerbotten Counties; this growth has, however, remained within the limits approved by the authorities. Nevertheless, it is not impossible that this development has put strains on the relationship between reindeer husbandry and the rest of society. On the other hand, the emergence of large-scale forestry, changes in communications, the expansion of hydropower, tourism and other factors have led to strains on reindeer husbandry.</p>
<p>As long as inner Norrland was roadless country, the reindeer and the ackja , or Sami sledge, was the only possible means of communication. The state therefore saw it as important to safeguard Sami livelihoods and prevent Samis from migrating Norway. The Riksdag (Swedish Parliament) and the Government have retained this ambition in modern times, as expressed in the 1886 Reindeer Grazing Act and successor legislation. However, consideration of the Samis has often been outweighed by the stronger interest of supporting the development of other industry. This conflict between different interests has been the source of many remarkable and sometimes outright racist, attitudes and public decisions. However, it is important to underline that the relationship between the Sami and the permanent population should not solely be viewed in a conflict perspective. In many cases, especially long ago, it has involved fruitful cooperation.</p>
<p>The historic boundaries of reindeer husbandry</p>
<p>Legislation on reindeer husbandry works with a number of concepts that can only be understood when their background is known. The most important of these concepts are the Taxed Lapp Lands ( lappskatteland ), the Lapp Lands boundary ( lappmarksgräns ), the cultivation limit ( odlingsgräns ) and the reindeer grazing mountains ( renbetesfjäll ) in Jämtland County.</p>
<p>The Taxed Lapp Lands were areas that individual Sami families used long ago for the maintenance of their reindeer herds in the spring, summer and autumn. In the winter they sought grazing for their herds outside of their own lands. As far as can be seen from the historical material, in the 17th century case-law and the authorities treated the Taxed Lapp lands in a way that corresponded to the taxed land held by the tax-paying farmers ( skattebönder ). In the late 17th century and the first half of 18th century, however, the Crown questioned the right of both the tax-paying farmers and the Sami to their land. But a Royal assurance of 1789 guaranteed the tax-paying farmers ownership of their land. This was not to be extended to the right of the Sami to their Taxed Lapp Lands. Instead, from then on these were treated as Crown land. This land was leased by the county administrative boards in return for a certain Lapp tax and land titles were not registered at the courts, as they had been previously. Over time the whole system of Taxed Lapp Lands was exposed to internal pressures and changed. One reason was the development of the reindeer husbandry itself. The individual Taxed Lapp Lands were too small for the large reindeer owners who emerged at the end of the 19th century. The Lapp tax and the Taxed Lapp Lands were finally abolished in 1928.</p>
<p>The border of the Lapp Lands in Västerbotten and Norrbotten Counties was drawn in the mid-18th century. Its main purpose was to stimulate agricultural colonisation. Coastal farmers were prohibited from continuing to fish in watercourses in the Lapp Lands in competition with the Sami there and the colonists. Colonists in the Lapp Lands were granted certain tax exemptions not available in coastal parishes and were exempt from the system of involuntary military service ( knektutskrivning ). Initially no conflict was anticipated with the Samis. A proclamation from 1749 underlined that the colonists were not allowed to harm anyone else’s livelihood, i.e. Sami livelihoods.</p>
<p>The proclamations on the Lapp Lands boundary do not contain any regulations stating that it was to be a boundary for Sami winter migrations. Nor did it act as one in practice either. Various sources from the 18th and 19th centuries, not least church sources, provide evidence that in the winter the Sami often migrated with their reindeer down to the coastal parishes, sometimes all the way to the Gulf of Bothnia coast and to the islands off the coast. The proclamations issued in the early 19th century on the obligation for farmers to enclose their hay-drying racks to protect them from</p>
<p>reindeer also applied to the coastal parishes in Västerbotten and Norrbotten Counties and to rural areas in Jämtland County. This shows that the Government assigned the Sami the right to let their reindeer graze there in the winter. Although individual county governors took decisions in the opposite direction, these local decisions were declared invalid when reviewed by higher authorities.</p>
<p>In Jämtland and Härjedalen there were no Lapp Lands with set boundaries like in the two northern counties. However, our investigation shows that Jämtland’s Lapp Lands were an established concept. The area extended along the mountain range from Frostviken in the north to Härjedalen in the south. Sami in these Lapp Lands were hit very hard by the partition of Crown land to private ownership carried out in the 1820s. The Sami had a pre-existing free grazing right on Crown lands, but when these lands were sharply reduced, major problems arose. The “reindeer grazing mountains” set aside for Sami needs in the early 1840s were totally inadequate. At the end of the 19th century the state tried to correct the worst mistakes by purchasing “expansion homesteads” ( utvidgningshemman ). However, the resulting expanded “reindeer grazing mountains” were never intended to also meet Sami needs of grazing land in winter half of the year, as is clear from the inquiries and the Riksdag record.</p>
<p>The cultivation limit was established when the Riksdag decided in 1867 to draw a “provisional boundary between the cultural lands of the Lapp Lands and the mountain communities”. In principle, land above this boundary would be Sami land and no new construction would be permitted there. However, discussions on where to draw this boundary was to be drawn on for many years, which meant that the expansion of cultivation in the Lapp Lands could continue and the wording used in the first Reindeer Grazing Act about this boundary was diffuse. The location of the cultivation limit was fixed definitively in 1890 and it could therefore be described in much clearer terms in the 1898 Reindeer Grazing Act. Under this Act and all subsequent Acts the Sami have the right to stay with their reindeer throughout the year above the cultivation limit in Västerbotten and Norrbotten Counties and on the reindeer grazing mountains in Jämtland County.</p>
<p>Partition was carried out first in Jämtland County. In the other Norrland counties it was carried out at a slower pace and a later date. In the early 1870s it was the turn of the areas above the Lapp Lands boundary. For the Sami, the partition decree for the Lapp</p>
<p>Lands in Västerbotten and Norrbotten in 1873 was a turning point. It decreed that the Sami were free to use reindeer grazing areas on Crown land throughout the year. In addition, they were able to do so without restriction on private land that was to be partitioned off in the Lapp Lands during the winter half of the year, when the reindeer’s sole diet was reindeer moss and it was therefore felt that no appreciable damage could be done to agriculture and forestry. This decree and the discussion of the concept of customary laws in that context portended the first Reindeer Grazing Act.</p>
<p>Customary law is embodied in statute law</p>
<p>The 1870s saw serious conflicts in Härjedalen concerning the right of the Sami to graze their reindeer outside the reindeer grazing mountains. These conflicts became known throughout the country as the “culture struggle”. In the course of this struggle, it became clear that the legislation was in chaos. Over the years, regulations had been issued and had then been forgotten or replaced by new regulations with diametrically opposed content. Frequently the new regulations originated from local decisions taken by various county governors. The provisions concerning the enclosure obligation were a highly illustrative example of this. As government minister Nils Vult von Steyern pointed out in the bill proposing a Reindeer Grazing Act, there was an evident need to bring together all the provisions “in a clear and unified whole”.</p>
<p>The “Lapp Committee of Inquiry” appointed in 1882 to study the matter presented its report in 1883. It contained the draft of our first concerted Reindeer Grazing Act. The first section of this act was to read as follows:</p>
<p>Subject to the provisions issued in this Act, the Lapps are entitled to stay with their reindeer not only in the Lapp Lands of Västerbotten and Norrbotten and in the land set aside for them in Jämtland County but also in the other tracts that they have by ancient custom visited up to now and to avail themselves of the land and water there to maintain themselves and their reindeer. The Lapps may, however, only stay without the permission of the land-owner or user concerned on private property located outside of the Lapp Lands of Västerbotten and Norrbotten or inside those parts of these Lapp Lands declared suitable for cultivation at a previously conducted or future partition during the months of October, November, December, January, February, March and April when these grounds have not also been retained at partition</p>
<p>as reindeer grazing land or when unusual weather conditions present an obstacle to migration.</p>
<p>Despite opposition, mainly from representatives from Jämtland, the proposal was adopted by the Riksdag in 1886. The law has subsequently been modified in various respects through Reindeer Husbandry Acts in 1989, 1928 and 1971. However, the provisions on customary law have been retained even though their wording has been altered. The actual texts of the acts have not specified the boundaries for customary law. However, all the committees of inquiry that have prepared the legislation have conducted extensive investigations to determine where these boundaries might conceivably be located. These preparatory works provide a wealth of material for a closer study of the geographical extent of customary law.</p>
<p>The historical sources</p>
<p>The terms of reference for the Boundary Delimitation Committee state that, in its work, the Committee is primarily go through the material held by various public authorities. As historical issues are involved, this work has almost exclusively consisted of research in the, often very old, archives of defunct public authorities. The great bulk of these archives are held by the state archive institutions, primarily the National Archives and the Regional Archives in Östersund (for Jämtland County) and in Härnösand (for the rest of Norrland). In some cases, however, they are still held by public authorities and institutions that exist today.</p>
<p>The archive material we have had to assess is extremely extensive. In order not to drown in it we have had to use certain strategies. Archaeological investigations have been ruled out for several reasons. One very weight reason is that our investigation does not cover periods when hunting and fishing were the main Sami livelihoods. Our investigation only applies to the period after reindeer nomadism became a principal livelihood, i.e. from the 17 century and onwards. Another interesting archival source that we have had to refrain from using for reasons of time is a closer study of extensive local source series such as judgment books, parish registers and the like.</p>
<p>The material that has been of greatest importance for the Inquiry has been the archives of the Government and the central administrative authorities held at the National Archives. For the older period particular mention can be made of the archives of the Royal Chancellery, the Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency and the Board of the Lapp Lands Authority for the Ministry of Education and Ecclesiastical Affairs ( Direktionen för Lappmarkens ecklesiastikverk ). For the period since the civil service reform of 1840 ministry records and Council of State files and the committee of inquiry archives have been particularly important. Fourteen committees of inquiry have given some degree of consideration to the question of the geographical extent of reindeer grazing lands. These committees have, in turn, initiated local investigations. They have also had a number of maps prepared that form the core of the digital map collection that the Boundary Delimitation Committee has made available on the website of the Norrbotten County Administrative Board http://www.bd.lst.se. As regards the regional archives, the archives from the Cathedral Chapter in Härnösand, the county administrative boards, the enforcement districts, the Swedish administrative officers for the Sami ( lappfogdarna ) and the county agricultural boards has been of most importance.</p>
<p>Printed sources have, of course, been used in addition to archive material. In this context, official publications in the form of Riksdag records, the Swedish Government official reports (the SOU series and its predecessors), compendiums of legislation, etc. are obvious sources. Some older travel reports and topographical descriptions have also turned out to be of great value.</p>
<p>There is a very great deal of scientific and amateur literature about the Sami. A good deal of this literature has been useful, but it is nonetheless striking to see how much of it has revolved around religious, political, legal and ethnographic issues and how little attention has been given to the conditions for reindeer husbandry as such. This has meant that the work of the Boundary Delimitation Committee has had to build to a great extent on hands-on basic research in archives.</p>
<p>Source critical problems</p>
<p>In the work of the Boundary Delimitation Committee a great deal of effort has been put into analysing how different types of source material have come into being and what has been the background to them. This has been seen as an essential pre-condition for an assessment of the value of the sources and an understanding of the contexts behind them. This careful examination provides material for a principled discussion of the source critical problems in chapter 8.</p>
<p>Some of the issues concerning source criticism deserve to be given special emphasis. In various court cases in recent years the Sami have been required to give an, often detailed, account of where they were with their reindeer in the 90 years that preceded the 1886 Reindeer Grazing Act. On closer inspection these demands appear to be unreasonable. The registration of Sami migrations that existed at that time does not make such an account possible. An investigation has to proceed by making use of probabilities based on several factors: the detailed investigations of migration patterns carried out around 1900, natural conditions, the characteristics of the reindeer, sporadic contemporary evidence, general descriptions in the historic sources and retrospective interviews. In addition, account should be taken of the consultative comments made on various legislative proposals by the municipalities and authorities in the relevant counties. In many cases they provide a picture of the local view in these counties of the geographical extent of customary rights.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are also gaps in the evidence for winter grazing in the 20th century. While the authorities in Jämtland County made noteworthy attempts to systematically document where these took place, in other counties neither the Sami, the land-owners nor the authorities grasped that there was a need to do so, as far as can be judged because it was thought that rights under customary law had been established through the Reindeer Husbandry Acts and the village statues for the Sami villages down to the Gulf of Bothnia coast.</p>
<p>Apart from this, the other factors that the investigation also points to include the difficulties that can arise from the failings of memory. On closer inspection, areas identified as “normal” winter grazing areas have turned out to only be “normal” during a particular surveyable period, and in many cases that period has tuned</p>
<p>out to be shorter that could have been expected. Moreover, it is necessary to be attentive to the shifts of perspective that the spirit of the times and the personal views of individual informants often give rise to.</p>
<p>Topographic account of information about winter grazing lands</p>
<p>This sizable chapter gives a detailed account of the sources information available on winter grazing in various areas from different periods. The ambition has been to achieve roughly the same level of detail as has occurred in legal proceedings, and to do so, as far as possible, for an area large as the whole of the reindeer herding area. Obviously this has resulted in a large volume of text. On other hand, it provides more of an overview than the material that emerges in legal proceedings concerning regional or more limited areas.</p>
<p>There are quite a number of pitfalls in the material. Maps and other documents are often based on county boundaries. It is important to pay attention to this. In several cases current county boundaries differ from boundaries a hundred years ago. Of course, the reindeer are not aware of administrative boundaries either. This is why the old Lapp Lands have been used as the basis for the account. This is a better reflection of the natural migratory pattern of the reindeer.</p>
<p>Our conclusions from this extensive documentation are set out in chapter 11. As regards the two maps referred to there, it can be mentioned that county treasurer Elof Huss’s map from 1959 is based on an extensive survey of winter grazing lands that he conducted in Jämtland County. The map from the National Board of Physical Planning and Building was produced in connection with national physical planning in the 1970s. It is based on interviews with the Sami villages, which were then processed by the relevant authorities. In addition to these maps, several other maps are also interesting. Special mention can be made of the maps produced as a result of the interview survey with 211 Samis from the whole reindeer herding area carried out in 1912–1913 (map no 7.7.1–5).</p>
<p>Prescription from time immemorial</p>
<p>In chapter 10 we set out our view of the concept of prescription from time immemorial. Our starting point is current law, as we have interpreted it. In the context, it should be noted that interpretation is made more difficult by the fact that to a great extent there are no explanatory preparatory works and there is practically no case-law.</p>
<p>Prescription from time immemorial is a concept that has deep historic roots. Since the late 19th century it has been used to legitimise the reindeer herding right. Prescription from time immemorial was discarded from the Land Code in 1972, but is still found in the Reindeer Husbandry Act. The reindeer herding right is a constitutionally protected right that arises through a long-term use of land and water accepted by others. The reindeer herding right based on prescription from time immemorial differs in many respects from to other rights based on prescription from time immemorial. In several respects the requirements for prescription from time immemorial under the Land Code are not relevant when this legal construct is to be applied to the reindeer herding right. We therefore consider that the reindeer herding right based on prescription from time immemorial should be regarded as a separate legal institution, which should, however, be interpreted in accordance with what used to apply under the Land Code, where relevant.</p>
<p>The law has nothing to say on question of how long a use must have continued for prescription from time immemorial to exist, except that it must have continued for such a long time that no now living person remembers or has heard from his forefathers when it started. The import of this has not been established in caselaw. We consider that in the interest of clarity there should be a specific time limit and in accordance with certain pronouncements in doctrine we have opted for 90 years. If the reindeer herding right is not exercised, the same time should elapse before a pre-established prescription from time immemorial is held to have lapsed. If, on the other hand, there has not been time to establish a reindeer herding right based on prescription from time immemorial, the position is somewhat different. However, the requirement concerning intensity of use that generally applies for the establishment of prescription from time immemorial cannot be applied to a reindeer herding right based on prescription from time immemorial. The</p>
<p>decision should instead be based on what appears reasonable from the perspective of reindeer husbandry. Therefore no regard should be paid to interruptions of use that are a normal result of having to wait for the re-growth of reindeer moss in an area that has been grazed off or that are due to a district only being used in years known as flenår , when a crust of ice forms on the ground in the autumn, preventing the reindeer from reaching the moss. As a general rule we have assumed that a continuous interruption of use for a period of 30 years means that the period for the appearance of prescription from time immemorial has been broken.</p>
<p>According to our interpretation, an assessment of whether a reindeer herding right based on prescription from time immemorial has been established shall take account of use both before and after the oldest Reindeer Grazing Act and up to and including our own time. In our opinion, the fact that prescription from time immemorial was removed from the new Land Code is of no importance for the application of prescription from time immemorial to the reindeer herding right.</p>
<p>The reindeer herding right is independent of the division of land into real property units. When the area in which there is a reindeer herding right is to be clarified, use must be made of the concept of a tract ( trakt ), which is hard to define. We have taken the view than it must refer to a large area that meets the reindeer’s need to shift between different kinds of land depending on grazing conditions from year to year.</p>
<p>We also discuss how to assess evidence in cases about the existence of the reindeer herding right. As these cases often involve very old circumstances it goes without saying that no direct witness evidence is available and the evidence that is available is generally in written form. But other kinds of evidence can also be cited. On many occasions the evidence is such that, considered separately, each piece is not strong enough but when considered together they can have considerable force. In general the party who claims the existence of a fact has the burden of proof. In the case of the reindeer herding right it is the Sami side that has the burden of proof. Even if this is formally the case, it goes without saying that the burden of proof shifts to the opposing side if the Sami can produce evidence of a certain power.</p>
<p>In cases concerning the existence of the reindeer herding right, the Sami side is represented by the Sami villages. We consider that a judgment in such a case is binding on the whole collective of</p>
<p>reindeer herders even though only one Sami village or certain Sami villages have taken part in the proceedings. The land-owner side in such proceedings is often represented by private land-owners. It is, however, usual for all the land-owners affected not to be represented in the proceedings. In such a case the court’s ruling does not have formal legal force concerning those who have not been involved, but it goes without saying that it has very strong status as proof to the extent that the court has made a determination based on the facts in the case.</p>
<p>Under reindeer husbandry legislation the reindeer herding right is independent of agreements between land-owners and reindeer owners. It is however, not unusual to enter into agreements with one another concerning joint land-use. There can also be an interest in reaching agreements on a reindeer grazing right outside of the reindeer herding area determined by customary law or in areas where it is unclear whether or not there is a reindeer herding right. At the end of chapter 10 we point out that current legislation does not provide scope for stable contractual solutions.</p>
<p>The outer boundary</p>
<p>In chapter 11 we take a position on the outer boundary for reindeer grazing. It is important to repeat that our position will not acquire the force of law. A determination with legal force of the question of whether or not a land area is burdened by a reindeer herding right can only be obtained through a court ruling. This does not mean that we regard our work as meaningless. We have had the ambition of bringing forward as much material as possible that can serve as relevant information in support of decisions about where rights exist under customary law and we hope that, as a result of the conclusions we have drawn from this, we can help to make future legal proceedings largely unnecessary.</p>
<p>The sources we have used are drawn from archives, maps, official publications, scientific works and information we have received from Samis and land-owners. On the basis of this information and guided by the principles that have been expressed earlier in the report we have divided the reindeer herding area into the following categories:</p>
<p>2. reindeer grazing right not proved according to  land-owners, but preponderant probability of a reindeer grazing right in our view</p>
<p>3. reindeer grazing right claimed by the Sami, but not proved or less probable in our assessment</p>
<p>As a further category we have reported areas that are currently subject to court proceedings. For constitutional reasons such areas have been excluded from our assessment.</p>
<p>Our conclusions are illustrated on a map that is attached to the report. In this context it must be said that the Committee’s decisions concerning the extent of the reindeer herding area refer to categories 1 and 2.</p>
<p>The grouping can be described very briefly in the following way. According to the current law, the whole province of Lapland is inside the reindeer herding area and is reported on our map as within grazing area 1. Most mountain Sami villages and all forest</p>
<p>Sami villages have their year-round lands in this province.</p>
<p>We also assign the concession area in Norrbotten to category 1 even though all reindeer herding there is not conducted by Samis. We have taken the view that it is not part of our remit to comment on the disputes on land-use that occur between mountain and forest Sami villages on the one hand, and concession villages, on the other.</p>
<p>For the remainder of Norrbotten we have made the following grouping. An area 2 A, which follows the approximate line Niemisel – Gullträsk – Harads – Vittjärv – Niemisel, lies within the reindeer gazing area. Another area that cannot in our view be assigned to the reindeer grazing area with sufficient certainty and therefore belongs to Category 3 (area 3 A) is delimited by the approximate line Råneå –Niemisel – Vittjärv – Rosvik. Areas 2 B and 4 A consists of enclaves within area 3 A. Area 2 B – inside the reindeer grazing area – can be described as Kallaxheden (a moor) and its surroundings and area 4 A consists of an area that, as a result of a final, non-appealable judgment in 2002, is not burdened with a reindeer herding right. Further south, at the coast, is grazing area 2 C, the delimitation of the area is roughly Rosvik – Sikfors – Bergsviken – Jävre. The rest of the province of Norrbotten forms part of category 1, whose area extends along the coast between Jävre and Kåge.</p>
<p>As regards the interior of the province of Västerbotten rights under customary law are beyond dispute. In the view of the landowners, the assessment of the area towards the coast is not altogether uncontroversial. We have considered that a line delimiting the inner parts (category 1) from the outer (category 2) can be drawn between Skellefteå – Boliden – Burträsk – Vindeln – Örträsk. Our view is thus that the whole of Västerbotten lies within the reindeer grazing area. It must, however, be pointed out that Area 5 A, which consists of the Bjurö peninsula, is the subject of ongoing legal proceedings and is therefore excluded from our assessment.</p>
<p>Large parts of Ångermanland have not only been affected by winter grazing in historic periods; this grazing has also gone on continuously until the present. Despite this rights under customary law are more or less questioned in large parts of the province. However, there is also an area in the north where these rights are beyond dispute. We have assigned this area to category 1 and reported it on the map in grazing area 1 A. This area also includes the parishes that belong to Jämtland County. On the other hand Nordmaling Municipality belongs to Västerbotten County, and in view of ongoing legal proceedings it is reported as category 5 B.</p>
<p>Otherwise, in moving through Ångermanland and into Jämtland we largely follow the map of the National Board of Physical Planning and Building from 1978 and the line on a map by Elof Huss (the Huss Line). This means that the major part of the province of Jämtland lies within the reindeer grazing area and that it shall be reported as category 1, since no dissenting view has been reported by land-owners concerning particular tracts. In the southeast part of Jämtland County, however, we have deviated from this line in certain areas because we have not been able to show that reindeer herding there is based on ninety-year prescription. We do not consider that we have sufficient evidence for a winter grazing right based on prescription from time immemorial south of our line either. There are some areas between our outer line and the line proposed by land-owners. These intermediate areas have been assigned to category 2 in accordance with the principles set out above. In Jämtland there is also an area round Lake Näkten that ought to belong to category 1. In addition, in Jämtland there is an area – 5 C</p>
<p>– that is excluded on account of ongoing legal proceedings, namely the area at Klövsjö-Rätan. All year-round lands in the province of Jämtland obviously belong to category 1.</p>
<p>We have assigned the winter gazing lands in Berg Municipality in the province of Härjedalen to the reindeer grazing area, but have placed them in category 2 due to the lack of a sufficiently reliable investigation. We have assigned the winter grazing lands in the whole of Härjedalen Municipality, i.e. the remainder of the province of Härjedalen apart from the year-round lands defined by law, as well as certain areas in Älvdalen Municipality, to category 4 as a result of final, non-appealable judgments. Idre New Sami Village’s winter grazing area belongs to category 2 and the Village’s yearround lands belong to category 1 to the extent that they do not belong to category 4 as a result of the above judgment.</p>
<p>The inner boundary</p>
<p>The Boundary Delimitation Committee has also had the remit of identifying, in accordance with ILO Convention No 169, the land that the Sami occupy and use together with others.</p>
<p>As yet only a few countries have ratified ILO Convention No 169. The question of a possible Swedish ratification has been raised on several occasions. The main obstacle to Swedish accession to the Convention has been the question of indigenous peoples’ right to land. The Convention requires that the rights of ownership and possession of the peoples concerned over the lands they traditionally occupy are recognised. In addition, measures shall be taken in appropriate cases to safeguard the right of the peoples concerned to use lands not exclusively occupied by them, but to which they have traditionally had access for their subsistence and traditional activities. The Convention also requires that governments shall take steps as necessary to identify the lands which the peoples concerned traditionally occupy, and to guarantee effective protection of their rights of ownership and possession.</p>
<p>Our analysis of the requirements set up in article 14 of the ILO Convention results in conclusions that differ in significant respects from those drawn by the previous ILO inquiry. We do, however, agree with the ILO Inquiry that the Convention does not require a formal ownership right in order for lands that are used by the indigenous people to be assigned to lands that it traditionally occupies. There is, however, a minimum level that the rights must reach to be applicable. We consider that this minimum level is not fulfilled by the reindeer herding right that the Sami have under reindeer husbandry legislation. This means that we do not share the view of the ILO Inquiry that all state-managed year-round land shall be classed as land possessed by the Sami under the Convention. In our view, which is based on the current law, there is no large continuous area to which the Sami have a right that is as strong as the right to which the Convention’s requirements concerning rights of ownership and possession refer.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we want to rule out the possibility that there may be limited areas in the year-round lands, where the Sami’s use is both sufficiently intensive and exclusive that they should be classed as Sami-possessed lands on Swedish accession to the Convention. It is appropriate for the Samis to be awarded a formal ownership right to this land following the identification of the land and a property formation procedure. This will give them a right to make use of the land that is independent of reindeer husbandry legislation.</p>
<p>We share the view of the ILO Inquiry that the outer boundary of the land that the Sami use together with others coincides with the outer boundary of the reindeer herding area.</p>
<p>What can be seen as a weakness in Swedish law in relation to the requirements of the Convention is that there is no alternative to the determination of questions concerning land rights by the courts. In chapter 14 we have outlined a proposal for such an alternative.</p>
<p>A Swedish investigation and mediation institute</p>
<p>In recent years there have been several cases concerning Sami land rights. In the instances where the courts have undertaken a substantial review, this review has been preceded by extremely protracted proceedings and the investigation and legal costs incurred by the parties in these cases have been considerable. In some instances, however, final, non-appealable court rulings have arisen without the court making any substantial determination in the case; in every instance the reason has been that the Sami side has not considered that it has the financial possibilities of contesting the action.</p>
<p>We believe that, through this investigation, we have fulfilled our remit of producing supporting information that can help to resolve future conflicts on the reindeer herding right, but we are well aware</p>
<p>that our pronouncements, which do not have legal force, have not been able to clear up existing uncertainties in a way that has not met with objections. This means that there is an evident risk that conflicts on land rights will also arise in the future.</p>
<p>The main source of these conflicts is unclear legislation, which gives the parties affected grounds for different views about the legal position. The design of the law is also to blame for the fact that conflict resolution requires extensive and costly investigations. The responsibility for legislation rests with the state. We therefore consider – like the ILO Inquiry – that the state should assume responsibility for the costs of these investigations. It is not satisfactory when a party refrains from a determination of his rights for financial reasons.</p>
<p>In a society based on the rule of law conflict resolution is ultimately the responsibility of independent courts. It is, however, usual in most contexts for determination by the courts to be preceded by an attempt to reach an agreed solution. But in the case of the reindeer herding right there appears to be limited potential for stable contractual solutions as an alternative to court decisions. This is largely to do with the fact that the legal regulation of reindeer husbandry originates from a period when the Sami were placed under state guardianship. The interests of the Sami were to be protected by special Swedish administrative officers and the county administrative boards, and this meant there was no need to regulate matters in agreements.</p>
<p>We consider that, in the first place, the conflicts on Sami land rights should be resolved through agreement between the parties. One important reason for this is that, in many respects, the legislation appears to be outdated and is not contributing to the satisfactory development of reindeer husbandry. The current law relates to historic conditions when both reindeer husbandry and the other industries that compete for land resources operated under completely different conditions from today. As a result, conflict resolution based strictly on the application of the current law does not always lead to a satisfactory and appropriate outcome for the parties. By disregarding legal considerations, an agreed solution can aim for what is appropriate and can thereby help to limit the need for a costly investigation of historical circumstances.</p>
<p>In other countries that have acceded to the ILO Convention or that are affected by rules in public international law on the rights of indigenous peoples, special investigation and mediation bodies have</p>
<p>been set up for conflicts on land rights. We consider that such a body should also be set up in Sweden. This is also important if Sweden is to accede to the Convention and meet its requirements.</p>
<p>It has not been part of the Committee’s remit to put forward proposals on an investigation and mediation institute. We have therefore been content to point to the need for such an institute. However, in addition to this, we have stated that amendments in the areas of civil law and legal procedure are needed to enable such a body to help bring about stable contractual solutions.</p>
