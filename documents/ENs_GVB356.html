<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>Background</p>
<p>The Governmental Commission on Public Accountants and Auditing (the Commission) has been directed to submit proposals on how the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on statutory audits in the EU TPF FPT  (the Directive) should be implemented into Swedish law.</p>
<p>One aim of the Directive is to establish harmonised rules on statutory audits within the EU. The Directive imposes minimum rules. However, a Member State with statutory rules on audits may in some cases prescribe more stringent rules.</p>
<p>The Directive aims at maintaining confidence of consumers and investors in European business entities, and also strengthen the rights of shareholders, improve investment security, improve the competitiveness of European business entities and guarantee the advantages of the internal market.</p>
<p>The European Commission can decide on regulations regarding the application of certain provisions contained in the Directive. As yet no implementation regulations have been adopted.</p>
<p>The Directive should be implemented no later than on 29 June 2008. The Commission proposes that the statutory amendments ensuing from the Directive should enter into force on that date. There may be reasons, in the course of future statutory work and following entry into force, to monitor and reconsider certain issues, for instance if the Commission adopts implementation regulations.</p>
<p>TP PT  Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts, amending Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC and repealing Council Directive 84/253/EEC.</p>
<p>General points of departure</p>
<p>One general point of departure in the course of the investigation work has been to, as far as possible, avoid introducing more stringent rules than required by the Directive and to try to establish rules that are as close as possible to the Directive. The Commission has also taken into consideration the work with the simplification of rules for small businesses initiated within the EU and in Sweden and has endeavoured to avoid imposing new rules on small businesses as far as possible.</p>
<p>Swedish legislation contains rules with more stringent requirements than called for by the Directive. The Commission has not yet had time to consider whether it is possible to simplify the regulations but has, in all essential respects, contented itself with considering whether the current rules violate the Directive. However, the issue of simplification of rules will be considered in the future investigation work.</p>
<p>Audit committee</p>
<p>The Directive imposes requirements on an entity, whose transferable securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market, to have an audit committee. However, the Member States do not need to legislate on this but can allow the issue to be resolved through self-regulation. In the opinion of the Commission, self-regulation is preferable. The Swedish Code of Corporate Governance, which is a component of industry’s self- regulation, contains provisions on audit committees. However, these do not include provisions for all entities that are required according to the Directive to have an audit committee. The Commission therefore proposes that the Directive’s provisions on audit committees are now implemented through statutory provisions that can be repealed when the scope of application for both the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance and the Directive are harmonised.</p>
<p>The Commission also proposes that a statutory provision on entities whose transferable securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market should, as a main rule, have an audit committee. The audit committee comprises members of the board who are not at the same time part of the corporate management. At least one</p>
<p>member of the audit committee should be independent and have competence in accounting or auditing.</p>
<p>However, certain entities may choose to allow the functions of the audit committee to be exercised by the entire board. This applies to entities that in the last annual report or consolidated accounts satisfy at least two of the following three criteria:</p>
<p>•  the average number of employees of the entity was less than 250,</p>
<p>•  the entity’s reported balance sheet total has not exceeded 43 000 000 Euro, and</p>
<p>• the entity’s reported net turnover has not exceeded 50 000 000 Euro.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that an audit committee should monitor financial reporting and monitor the efficiency of the entity’s internal control, any internal audit and risk management systems. Furthermore, the committee should keep itself informed of the statutory audit of especially annual accounts and consolidated accounts and review and monitor the qualified auditor’s or the registered audit firm’s impartiality and independence, particularly if the auditor has provided further services to the audit client.</p>
<p>The audit committee or, in those cases where the audit committee’s functions are dealt with by the board in its entirety, the board shall assist the nomination committee regarding the election of auditor.</p>
<p>It is also proposed that an obligation is introduced into company law providing for the auditor to report to the audit committee.</p>
<p>Finally, it is proposed that the administration report should state whether the entity has an audit committee or whether the board performs the functions of the audit committee.</p>
<p>Independence and objectivity</p>
<p>The analysis model</p>
<p>In order to guarantee the impartiality and independence of the auditors, an ‘analysis model’ is applied in accordance with Section 21 of the Auditors Act. An auditor should for every assignment in the audit business consider whether circumstances</p>
<p>prevail that may impair confidence in her or his impartiality or independence. Should certain circumstances apply, the auditor should decline or resign from the assignment. However, this does not apply if such circumstances prevail or such measures have been taken whereby there is no cause to question the auditor’s impartiality or independence.</p>
<p>The Swedish analysis model does not violate the Directive. The analysis model shall also be applied in connection with audits of public-interest entities. The Commission proposes that a new provision is introduced into Section 21 of the Auditors Act providing that the auditor, in connection with assignments in the audit business relating to public-interest entities, should be particularly attentive and implement measures in the event that there is any threat of self-interest or self-examination.</p>
<p>Transparency report</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that a provision is introduced into the Auditors Act providing that auditors and audit firms that audit entities whose transferable securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market should publish annually a transparency report on its website. The Government or the authority proposed by the Government should be granted powers to issue regulations regarding the content of this report.</p>
<p>Auditor rotation and qualifying period</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that provisions are introduced into company law providing for auditor rotation and qualifying period within entities whose transferable securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market.</p>
<p>The Commission thus proposes that an elected auditor or a key audit partner in such a firm may only be re-elected or appointed again, respectively, for an aggregate period of at most seven years. Thereafter the auditor may only participate in the audit again following a period of at least two years.</p>
<p>Finally it is proposed that the auditor may not hold a leading position with a former client before two years have elapsed from when he or she participated in the audit of that firm.</p>
<p>Quality reviews</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that a provision is introduced into the Auditors Act providing for quality reviews. The Supervisory Board of Public Accountants should ensure that all qualified auditors and registered audit firms undergo a quality review at least every sixth year. However, auditors and audit firms that audit entities whose transferable securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market shall undergo such review at least every third year.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the Commission, the Board should determine which requirements should be imposed on the quality reviewers, how they should be appointed, the scope of the review, that a written report on the review should be prepared and what it should contain. However, it is not necessary to introduce a provision regarding this into law or ordinance.</p>
<p>Election and dismissal of auditors and registered audit firms</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that a provision is introduced into company law providing that the audit client may not dismiss an auditor unless there are proper grounds to do so.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is proposed that the auditor and audit client are liable to report the reasons for premature resignation of an auditor to the Swedish Companies Registration Office or county administrative board. A new auditor can not be registered unless the previously registered auditor has been removed from the register. The Swedish Companies Registration Office or county administrative board tries the reasons given for the premature resignation. If the reasons are not approved, the registered auditor remains in the register.</p>
<p>Approval, continuing education and mutual recognition</p>
<p>The Directive contains provisions on approval, continuing education and mutual recognition of auditors and audit firms. Swedish law is basically compatible with the requirements of the Directive in this respect. In order to implement the Directive completely the Commission proposes the following amendments.</p>
<p>A majority of the voting rights in a registered audit firm shall be held by auditors who have been qualified or audit firms that have</p>
<p>been registered by a competent authority within the EEA. This means that the present requirement that the majority shall be held by Swedish auditors or Swedish audit firms is abolished and similarly the requirement that the shares in a company must be owned by the auditors or the audit firm. The requirement that the minority owners should be professionally active in the audit firm or in an entity within the same audit group is also abolished.</p>
<p>As regards board representation and partners of partnerships, auditors qualified by a competent authority within the EEA should be equated with Swedish qualified auditors. This means that three fourths of the members of the board and the deputy members of the board of a limited company should always be approved or authorised public accountants or auditors who in a corresponding way have been qualified within the EEA. Corresponding rules shall apply to partners of partnerships. It is proposed that, until further notice, the Swedish provisions providing that the managing director and procurer of limited companies and authorised signatories and procurer of partnerships should be an approved or authorised public accountant should remain in force.</p>
<p>An auditor who wishes to practise audit business outside the EEA must have the permission of the Supervisory Board of Public Accountants. However, an auditor should not need to have a licence to be allowed to conduct audit business within the EEA.</p>
<p>Practical experience under the supervision of an auditor is required in order to become an approved or authorised public accountant. The Commission proposes the introduction of a provision into the Auditors Ordinance making it possible to fulfil this work experience requirement with qualified auditors or audit firms within the EEA. Considering the fact that this issue is currently being processed by the Ministry of Justice, the Commission does not submit any proposed legislation regarding this aspect.</p>
<p>A requirement is to be introduced into the Auditors Ordinance for a qualified auditor to undergo continuing education.</p>
<p>Registration</p>
<p>The Supervisory Board of Public Accountants currently keeps a register of auditors and audit firms. The Directive gives cause for the Commission to propose, among other things, that this data</p>
<p>should be accessible to the public on the Board’s website, though not details of personal identity number or home address.</p>
<p>International aspects</p>
<p>The Commission proposes a number of provisions enabling auditors from foreign countries to operate as approved or authorised public accountants in Sweden and for Swedish auditors and audit firms to operate abroad.</p>
<p>Investigations and sanctions, etc.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that a provision is introduced into the Auditors Act granting powers to the Supervisory Board of Public Accountants to waive the imposition of a sanction if there are special reasons to do so.</p>
<p>It is also proposed that the powers of the Supervisory Board of Public Accountants to impose penalty charges be removed.</p>
<p>Public supervision and regulation between the Member States</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that a provision is introduced into the Auditors Act clarifying that the Supervisory Board of Public Accountants may disclose to supervisory bodies in other countries within the EEA data that is required for investigation, supervision and the granting of licences. However, data may not be disclosed if public order is jeopardised or if a disciplinary procedure regarding the same matter has already been initiated or has been concluded. It is also proposed that a reminder be given that the Supervisory Board of Public Accountants may request investigation by the corresponding supervisory body in other member states.</p>
