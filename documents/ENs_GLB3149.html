<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The Committee of Inquiry was, by the Swedish government in february 1997, commissioned to analyze the environmental and associated economic consequences of the forthcoming enlargement of the EU. The analysis has been based on the assumption that all applicant states countries will become full members of the EU.</p>
<p>The Committee has to a large extent made use of available data and existing studies. These have been taken from, or have consisted of, international and Swedish studies and environmental impact analyses conducted in preparation for Sweden’s accession to the EU. The Committee has also used the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency’s “Who Pollutes Sweden?” (NV 1997:4788, available soon in English translation) as background material, along with “Environmental Implications of EU Membership of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland”, published by the Stockholm Environmental Institute (SEI) in 1996. The European Commission’s report “Agenda 2000” has also been taken into consideration, along with the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development’s (EBRD) report “Compliance Costing for Approximation of EU Environmental Legislation in the CEEC” (the EDC report). The Environmental Research Institute (IVL) has, on behalf of the Committee, prepared the report “The state of the environment in Europe, Sweden, the associated countries and other countries in Central and Eastern Europe” (in Swedish, Appendix 2 of this report). The Committee has also taken cognizance of the Danish environmental impact analysis “The EU’s enlargement towards the East – environmental perspectives” (the Danish Environmental Protection Agency, Copenhagen, June 1997, in Danish). Furthermore, the Committee has conducted its own surveys and studies of the state of the environment and the ongoing process of EU approximation, particularly in the Baltic states and Poland. Information from other candidate countries has been gathered and analyzed to the extent that this has been possible. For some countries this background information is incomplete.</p>
<p>In-depth analyses of the ongoing pre-accession process have been conducted for Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, while the corresponding processes in Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Hungary have been analyzed superficially. In the case of the Czech Republic, however, atmospheric emissions have been analyzed in greater detail.</p>
<p>The Committee has also analyzed the environmental consequences of enlargement that have to do with nuclear power generation, nuclear non-proliferation, radiation protection and environmental and health.</p>
<p>The economic consequences associated with the candidate countries’ approximation of EU environmental legislation have been more difficult to judge. Cost estimates are therefore sketchy or lacking entirely in some cases. This is mainly due to the fact that relevant data have been impossible to obtain. The assessments presented have largely been taken from published reports, such as the EDC report and the Danish impact analysis. Even in these studies, the cost estimates are uncertain.</p>
<p>In addition, the Committee has made, for specified candidate countries, an environmental impact assessment for the EU as a whole and for Sweden with surrounding marine areas (Baltic Sea, Kattegat and Skagerrak). The consequences and environmental impact in other nearby countries, such as Ukraine, Russia and Belarus, are dealt with only marginally.</p>
<p>The Committee has also taken in account the fact that the EU’s environmental legislation is under development. Several new, important and comprehensive directives governing e.g. air, water and waste are planned in the next few years. They will be of great importance for the development of the state of the environment in an enlarged EU and will also affect the environmental situation in the candidate countries.</p>
<p>An important task for the Committee has been to analyze the environmental consequences of the candidate countries’ approximation of the EU’s environmental legislation. The Committee has also examined how the enlargement of the EU to 25 member states will affect environmental efforts within the EU, for example in the form of stricter environmental rules and greater integration of environmental considerations within important sectors of society such as energy, industry, transport and agriculture.</p>
<p>The Committee notes that it has been difficult to distinguish between environmental consequences resulting from already ongoing social changes that have already had positive environmental effects and would continue to proceed even if the candidate countries did not become members of the EU, and environmental effects that are a direct consequence of approximation with the EU’s environmental directives.</p>
<p>The approximation process in the candidate countries</p>
<p>Cooperation between the EU and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe began at the end of the 1980s. Diplomatic relations were established between the EU and Bulgaria, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary in 1988. In 1989, different types of free-trade agreements were concluded that regulated cooperation in trade, industry, etc. As the process of political change progressed in Central and Eastern Europe, the EU established similar contacts and agreements with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania in 1991.</p>
<p>These agreements have gradually been expanded into broader framework agreements for cooperation between the EU and the country in question. The purpose of these so-called “Europe agreements” is to support political and economic change in these countries. The Europe agreements comprise a basis for the EU’s technical and financial assistance to these countries and provide a framework for supporting a specific country’s integration in the EU.</p>
<p>The Europe agreements give the candidate countries access to numerous other EU cooperation programmes, in addition to financial assistance via Phare. These programmes include, for example, the LIFE fund within the environmental field.</p>
<p>The issue of accession to EU membership has top political priority in the candidate countries. This is clearly evident from statements made by the heads of state of the candidate countries in various contexts in recent years. The issue of EU membership is, along with that of NATO membership, probably the most important foreign policy issue in these countries.</p>
<p>The European Commission’s “opinions” on the candidate countries note that the countries have given clear priority in their approximation work to the legislation that was discussed in the Commission’s 1995 White Paper on the internal market.</p>
<p>The Baltic states have on various occasions noted that conflicts exist between the priorities of the European Commission and those of the candidate countries in the environmental field. Motor vehicle emissions, fuel grades, chemicals, packaging, noise and radiation protection are prioritized in the EU. They are not, however, given particularly high priority on the lists of national environmental problems in the candidate countries. Instead, the concerned countries give the highest priority to air and water pollution and waste-related environmental problems. This in turn means that a large portion of the qualified personnel in the environmental ministries are now working with approximation of EU environmental legislation, in part at the expense of other national and international environmental work.</p>
<p>The European Commission and the candidate countries have so far primarily focused on the work of approximation of EU legislation (including environmental legislation). Less attention has been given to the important questions relating to the implementation and enforcement of the legislation and the need to build competence and institutions within these areas.</p>
<p>The approximation process in the Commission and the member states</p>
<p>The process of enlargement has high priority in the European Commission. When it comes to environmental issues, a large number of directorates are involved. DG 1A has coordinating responsibility for the entire negotiation process, DG III is in charge of the internal market directives, while DG XI bears direct responsibility for the environmental issues. The agriculture and transport directorates also have an important role.</p>
<p>Great importance has been attached to the question of EU enlargement and its consequences for the environment in several member states, especially those bordering on the candidate countries. The Nordic countries along with Germany and Austria have focused much of their bilateral support in the environmental field on projects associated with the approximation process.</p>
<p>In Sweden, EU enlargement is accorded high priority both as a general political issue and as it bears on the environment. Enlargement has been included on the agenda of many bilateral meetings, in particular with Poland and the three Baltic states.</p>
<p>EU aid to the candidate countries has increasingly come to be focused on projects that support approximation. Financial assistance is being given via the Phare programme to knowledge transfer, consulting services, education and training, as well as to the reformation of legislation and institutions. Since 1990 a total of ECU 600 million has been allocated to environmental projects in the candidate countries via Phare. In 1996 the European Commission adopted a new environmental strategy for Phare giving the highest priority to aid to the approximation process and other activities that can support the approximation of environmental legislation. During the fall of 1997 the Commission has proposed a new expanded PHARE programme for two years (2000-2001) amounting to three billion ECU.</p>
<p>In the strategy for enlargement presented by the European Commission in the summer of 1997, the Agenda 2000 document, it is proposed that the Phare programme should continue to be the most important EU instrument for supporting the approximation process. The programme will focus on institution building and financing of investment projects (in the ratio of 30-70 percent respectively). The environmental and transport sectors are mentioned as particularly urgent areas for efforts aimed at approximation of the EU’s environmental requirements by the candidate countries. Three special programmes have been established within Phare to support the approximation process.</p>
<p>Very heavy investments are required in order to enable the candidate countries to meet the EU’s environmental requirements. Farreaching efforts, including considerable financial and technical assistance from the EU, are, according to the Commission, required for the candidate countries to approximate the EU’s environmental legislation, especially in the fields of water and air pollution and energy. The Commission also emphasizes that environmental improvements in Central and Eastern Europe will benefit not only these countries, but also the environment in the current EU member states.</p>
<p>The Commission also points out that investments aimed at solving the environmental problems in Central and Eastern Europe can create important markets for those EU industries active within the environmental sector or other related sectors. This can in turn strengthen the competitiveness of these industries in fast-growing high-tech markets.</p>
<p>In parallel with the assistance given by the EU in various forms to the approximation process, other multilateral organizations have</p>
<p>increasingly begun to focus their assistance on this process, including the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the OECD.</p>
<p>The state of the environment in Europe</p>
<p>A comprehensive, general description of the state of the environment in Europe as a whole was given in the DOBRIS report that was presented by the European Environment Agency in 1995. A number of important environmental problems are identified in the report, such as climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, tropospheric ozone and other photochemical oxidants, acidification, management and pollution of fresh water, forest degradation, loss of biodiversity, coastal zone threats and management, chemical risks, waste reduction and management, and urban stress.</p>
<p>The environmental situation in the Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) is often described as very poor with widespread health problems in industrial regions, dying forests, soil degradation due to monoculture agriculture, eutrophication, degradation of groundwater, etc. Much in these accounts is well-founded, but in some cases the claims have turned out to be exaggerated, especially as regards the geographic extent of the problems. The actual environmental situation in the individual countries is characterized for the most part by large local environmental problems, while parts of the countries have been less intensively developed and have to a large extent been spared contamination with toxic substances.</p>
<p>Development has been proceeding rapidly in the candidate countries since 1989-90. They aspire to reach the same standard of living as in Western Europe. Considerable efforts have thereby already been made to address the worst environmental problems.</p>
<p>Air pollution</p>
<p>Air pollution and the effects it has on human health and the environment is considered to be one of the most serious environmental problems in large parts of Europe. The most important air pollutants in Europe today are sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia, volatile organic compounds (VOC), ozone, metals and particulates.</p>
<p>In major conurbations and industrial areas, air pollution can cause serious environmental and health problems. On the regional level,</p>
<p>air pollutants, mainly sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and ozone, contribute to vegetation damages including damages to economically important crops, damages to forests, acidification of soil and water, and to eutrophication of water and coastal seas and nutrient saturation of soil. European emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, ozone and nitrous oxide contribute on the global level to climate change, including global warming, and to depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer.</p>
<p>Most emissions of air pollutants in different European countries come from the same sources. The most important sources/sectors are energy generation, residential heating, transport (particularly road traffic), various industrial processes, and agriculture.</p>
<p>Even though some improvements have been made in recent years as a result of the emissions control measures that have been adopted, 37 million Europeans are still exposed to sulphur dioxide concentrations in excess of the EU’s target values. At the same time, 20 percent of Europe’s ecosystems receive acid deposition in excess of the critical load limit for acidification. The corresponding figure for eutrophication is 33 percent.</p>
<p>Water pollution</p>
<p>In many countries, particularly the CEECs, water pollution is a greater problem than air pollution. Extensive water pollution occurs mainly in densely populated areas where large quantities of untreated or inadequately treated wastewater is discharged into lakes, watercourses and coastal waters. Discharges directly to water combine with deposition of air pollutants to affect water quality. Polluted rivers carry the nutrients (mainly phosphorus and nitrogen) to the sea and contribute to excessive nutrient input to the coastal areas (eutrophication).</p>
<p>The assessment of conditions in Europe that was presented in the Dobris report showed that the quality of the water in many of the rivers on the European continent that run into the North Sea and the Baltic Sea is poor. There are, however, no general differences between Eastern European and Western European rivers.</p>
<p>Excessive inputs of nutrients to fresh waters and coastal waters give rise to eutrophication, and unless remedial measures are taken serious eutrophication effects (e.g. algal blooms) can occur. Generally declining trends for phosphorus have been noted in the majority of</p>
<p>Western European rivers and in many lakes since the 1980s, while an increase has been measured in most Eastern European rivers. The decline in Western Europe is considered to be due to improvements in sewage treatment.</p>
<p>In contrast to this decline in phosphorus, nitrogen concentrations in rivers and lakes have increased over the past 20–40 years.</p>
<p>Serious acidification of surface waters is particularly prevalent in the Nordic countries, parts of Central Europe and in northwestern Russia.</p>
<p>Groundwater quality in certain agricultural areas is threatened by nitrate leaching, main due to extensive spreading of fertilizer and manure. Particularly threatened or polluted areas in this respect are found in Germany, the Netherlands, Great Britain and Denmark. In some areas in Denmark, the Netherlands, France, Lithuania and Belarus the drinking water is threatened by pesticides, and unless measures are taken it will be necessary to purify the drinking water before it is used.</p>
<p>Waste</p>
<p>Municipal as well as hazardous waste is a growing environmental problem in Europe. A calculation of the waste quantities from different social sectors shows that by mining waste dominates followed by industrial waste and municipal waste.</p>
<p>During the period 1975–1990, production of municipal waste increased generally. The quantity of waste that is produced per capita varies between different countries in Europe. Production of municipal waste per capita is slightly lower in Central and Eastern Europe compared with the EU countries. The composition of the waste has also changed. A larger fraction of industrial waste is now considered hazardous. The quantity of plastics and packaging has increased in Western Europe. A similar increase can be expected in the CEECs in the years to come.</p>
<p>In Europe, most waste is still deposited on landfills. This often leads to the contamination of soil and groundwater and to the formation of methane, carbon dioxide and toxic gases. A considerable portion of the waste is incinerated nowadays, however, and even though emissions are being controlled to an increasing extent, emissions of dioxins, hydrochloric acid and mercury are still considerable in com-</p>
<p>parison with other sources. Waste incineration is almost non-existent in the candidate countries.</p>
<p>Despite rules and international conventions, hazardous waste is transported across national boundaries in Europe and from Europe to developing countries. This is also an issue considered to be a great problem by many countries in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Great concern has been expressed during the past ten years regarding the contamination of soil and groundwater by leachate from old refuse dumps. This concern has particularly come to the fore when the candidate countries have described the environmental problems in their own countries. There is no reliable European estimate of the scope of these problems. The CEECs also have special waste and pollution problems associated with the former Soviet military bases located on their territories.</p>
<p>The state of the environment in Sweden</p>
<p>For a more thorough account of the state of the environment in Sweden the Committee refers to publications of the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, for example “The State of the Environment in Sweden” (NV 4509, in Swedish only) and “Who Pollutes Sweden?” (NV 4788, soon available in English).</p>
<p>The pollution situation in Sweden is improving in many respects. In the case of certain pollutants (sulphur dioxide, particulates and lead), the measures that have been adopted nationally and internationally have been effective. However, the emission reductions have generally been less in other countries, entailing continued stress on the Swedish environment from sources outside the country. As far as other air pollutants are concerned, especially from the transport sector (NO x  and CO ), the measures adopted in Sweden and in other countries have been less effective.</p>
<p>The commitments within the framework of the second sulphur protocol to the LRTAP convention are expected to lead to considerable reductions of atmospheric deposition in Sweden. For Sweden as a whole, the greatest gains will be won via the projected emission reductions during the period 1995–2010 in Germany, the UK, Poland, Denmark and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>The state of the environment in the marine areas surrounding</p>
<p>Sweden</p>
<p>All the marine areas surrounding Sweden – the Baltic Sea, the Kattegat and the Skagerrak – are affected by human activities. The sea, and particularly the areas near the coasts, are affected by discharges of pollutants to water in lakes, watercourses or directly at the coast, by deposition of pollutants from the atmosphere, and by discharges from ships.</p>
<p>Among the most serious pollution problems and threats to biodiversity in the marine areas surrounding Sweden are the following:</p>
<p>· Plant nutrients, mainly phosphorus and nitrogen, and other organic matter, which cause eutrophication</p>
<p>· Metals</p>
<p>· Oil releases</p>
<p>The state of the environment in the CEECs</p>
<p>Local air pollution</p>
<p>Before the fall of communism, sulphur dioxide and particulates (soot and industrial dust) were perhaps the foremost environmental problem in a number of industrial regions, above all in southern East Germany, northwestern Czechoslovakia and southern Poland. Prior to 1990, it is estimated that the levels in approximately half of the major cities in Eastern Europe exceeded WHO’s limit values. Substantial improvements have been made since then, however.</p>
<p>Even though the levels of sulphur dioxide, lead and particulates in the cities have declined all over Europe, the major urban areas in the CEECs generally still have poorer air quality than equivalent areas in the EU, particularly as regards these pollutants. With regard to other pollutants of importance for human health and for which data are available, the situation is not worse in the CEECs than in the EU. In fact, nitrogen dioxide levels are slightly higher in the EU as a result of heavier car traffic there.</p>
<p>Acidification</p>
<p>Acidification problems in the CEECs are primarily restricted to soil acidification and damages to forests (the most extensive in all of Europe) in regions with heavy coal burning and large associated sulphur emissions, above all in the “black triangle” comprising the southern part of former East Germany, the northern Czech Republic and southern Poland. The critical load limits are being exceeded and acid deposition is considered to be one of the most important causes of forest damage.</p>
<p>Persistent organic pollutants and metals</p>
<p>A single body of statistics is lacking to enable assessments to be made of the overall situation as regards metals and POPs in the CEECs, as well as in the EU countries. There are so-called “hot spots” where the problems are very serious, but the general extent of the problems is not known.</p>
<p>Approximation of EU legislation in the candidate countries</p>
<p>Most of the candidate countries already had an extensive body of environmental legislation under their former central planning regimes. The legislation was often based on environmental quality standards, while direct emission requirements on individual plants or types of plants were rare. Nor were there any administrative structures to enforce compliance with limit values and emission requirements in an effective manner. An exception, and the one area where the candidate countries were already ahead of or at least on a parity with the Western European countries, is the field of nature conservation.</p>
<p>New environmental legislation in all countries</p>
<p>In conjunction with the political transformation of the former communist countries and the independence of the three Baltic states, work began on writing new legislation in virtually all sectors of society, including the environment. Since the question of EU membership for these countries had not yet been raised at this time (early 1990s), approximation of EU legislation was not a primary consideration when the first new environmental laws were written.</p>
<p>These framework laws are now undergoing revision, or have in some cases already been revised, to meet the requirements in EU legislation and to incorporate accepted principles in the environmental fi-</p>
<p>eld, for example the overall objective of sustainable development, the polluter pays principle, the precautionary principle, rules concerning the individual’s and the public’s right to information in environmental matters, and sectoral integration of environmental considerations.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be said that the approximation of legislation that has taken place so far has mainly concerned framework laws and other fundamental legislation within the environmental sector. Very much (in some cases everything) remains to be done, however, above all when it comes to different types of implementation legislation, environmental monitoring and, not least, in administrative capacitybuilding, particularly locally and regionally, and in making sure that the new rules are enforced effectively.</p>
<p>The opinions written by the European Commission on the candidate countries state that in their approximation efforts, the countries have so far clearly prioritized the legislation that was mentioned in the Commission’s White Paper regarding the internal market from 1995. This also applies to those parts of the EU’s environmental legislation that fall under the Internal Market rules. In this context it is also worth noting that this part of the EU’s environmental rules is only estimated to comprise about 20 percent of the entire body of EU environmental legislation.</p>
<p>The Committee’s review of the legislation in the candidate countries has covered the following areas: climate change, protection of the ozone layer, tropospheric ozone, acidification and air quality, eutrophication and water quality, waste and waste management, chemicals, and nature conservation and biological diversity.</p>
<p>It can be concluded that the candidate countries have come farthest with approximation in the areas of air and water pollution control. This is probably because these are the areas where the candidate countries already had a relatively extensive body of legislation and where the work with new legislation got under way relatively quickly after the transformation of the social system. These are also areas where the countries have, owing to the transboundary nature of the problems, been able to obtain extensive international assistance. A great deal remains to be done, however, and it will take a long time before the countries are able to fully comply with the EU’s requirements. Large investments are required.</p>
<p>It can also be concluded that waste and waste management, and chemicals and chemical management, are two sectors where, in comparison with other sectors, a greater portion of the work of approxi-</p>
<p>mating the EU’s legislation in the candidate countries’ rules remains to be done.</p>
<p>The area where the problems with EU approximation will probably be least is within nature conservation and protection of biological diversity. Action is required here as well, however, mainly as regards rules for land use and integration of nature conservation considerations in legislation in other sectors, such as agriculture, forestry and transport.</p>
<p>Costs of approximation of EU environmental legislation</p>
<p>Attempts have been made in a number of reports and consultant studies presented in recent years to estimate the costs to the candidate countries of meeting the requirements in the EU’s environmental legislation.</p>
<p>The cost calculations that have been presented vary within wide limits due in part to great uncertainty in the data used in the calculations and in part to the fact that the calculations have been based on different assumptions.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be said that even if there is a large span in estimates of the total costs of environmental approximation, all calculations show that the environmental field will be one of the most costly, perhaps even the most costly sector for approximation.</p>
<p>Calculations carried out on behalf of EU-Phare indicate that the costs of environmental approximation could constitute as much as between 30 and 40 percent of the total costs.</p>
<p>Calculations carried out on behalf of the European Commission and presented in a report in the summer of 1997 showed that the total costs of EU approximation within the investment-intensive sectors of water supply, sewerage, wastewater treatment, incineration plants and waste treatment amount to more than ECU 100 billion, equivalent to about ECU 1000 per capita.</p>
<p>The annual costs according to the same calculations amount to between ECU 8 and 12 billion, or ECU 80–120 per capita. The report emphasizes that even though this amount only comprises about twothirds of the average per-capita environmental expenses of the present-day EU states, it represents a much larger share of the GDP of the candidate countries.</p>
<p>The Committee’s environmental impact assessment, conclusions and recommendations</p>
<p>In its summary assessment, the Committee analyzes the environmental consequences of economic integration and the trend within the transport, industrial, energy and agricultural sectors. The analysis of the energy sector also includes questions pertaining to nuclear safety and radiation protection. Other topics discussed are air and water pollution, waste management, nature conservation and biological diversity. Finally, the effects of political prioritizations, better administration and better enforcement and monitoring are dealt with.</p>
<p>The Committee’s overall conclusion is that the forthcoming EU enlargement will entail considerable environmental benefits. These benefits will be achieved more rapidly, if the proposed increased financial recources to the accession process will be accepted by the Council. Furthermore, the environmental benefits, will be achieved due to the strict follow-up by the EU to ensure that the new member countries meet their environmental obligations. Other international treaties are not as effective in this respect. The EU’s environmental policy is the most comprehensive body of international law, which forces the member states to review and revise their entire environmental policy. At the same time, the enlargement entails certain risks in the environmental field, mainly in the form of increased emissions from transport. It is therefore important that the enlargement process be accompanied by supplementary measures to support the candidate countries in achieving compliance with the EU’s environmental directives as soon as possible, and to tighten up the EU’s current environmental legislation to counteract any negative effects of the enlargement, particularly within the transport sector.</p>
<p>The Committee finds that the greatest environmental gains stand to be achieved in the ten candidate countries. At the same time, it is important to emphasize that it is in these countries that negative environmental effects of EU membership can occur, for example in the transport sector.</p>
<p>Environmental gains will be achieved within virtually all areas that have been studied, i.e. improved air quality due to reduced local air pollution, reduced atmospheric deposition of acidifying substances, heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs), as well as reduced water pollution and improved water quality, improved waste management and reduced risks to human health and the environment from the handling of hazardous chemicals.</p>
<p>The environmental gains for Sweden will be relatively limited. It is mainly southeastern Sweden that stands to benefit from reduced deposition of acidifying substances as a consequence of reduced air pollution in Poland and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>As far as the Baltic Sea is concerned, the positive effects stem from reduced discharges of plant nutrients (mainly phosphorus and nitrogen compounds) to water, reduced deposition of nitrogen compounds from the air, and reduced input of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants via air and water. Reduced eutrophication effects can be expected mainly along the coasts in Poland and the three Baltic states, while the effects in the open sea are likely to be small.</p>
<p>The Committee would like to point out that it is difficult to distinguish between environmental consequences resulting from the ongoing changes in the candidate countries and the environmental effects that are a direct consequence of the countries’ accession to the EU. Greater efficiency in the environmental work and an improvement in environmental conditions in the candidate countries has already been achieved as a part of the ongoing social transformation. At the same time, the Committee would like to point out that the preaccession process has already led to higher priority being given to environmental issues in the candidate countries.</p>
<p>The Committee concludes/recommends:</p>
<p>· that it is an advantage from the environmental viewpoint if accession negotiations can be initiated jointly for all candidate countries. From an environmental viewpoint it is important to be able to base judgements on the total environmental problems of the different sectors and decide what measures are needed for each sector in larger contiguous geographic regions, since the most serious environmental problems are transboundary in nature. The example closest at hand is the Baltic Sea area, whose environment is affected by both the Baltic states and Poland.</p>
<p>· that the European Commission should conduct a more detailed analysis of the environmental consequences of the planned enlargement, particularly as regards the environmental responsibility of the sectors. Such an analysis is important as a basis for a more balanced appraisal and prioritization between different directives and environmental areas. In principle, an environmental</p>
<p>impact assessment should be made of every major approximation programme. In view of the great importance of the transport sector for the development of the overall environmental situation, special attention should be given to this sector.</p>
<p>· that the EU’s requirements should be applied to all new investments and plants at the time of the opening of the accession negotiations. Regarding products there is however ralistic to forsee certain transitional periods.</p>
<p>· that the candidate countries, as a part of the EU’s joint responsibility and within the framework of the work to establish the Natura 2000 network of protected areas, be given aid for the conservation of valuable habitats.</p>
<p>· that environmental approximation should be given high priority in the accession negotiations so that as large a portion as possible of the environmental legislation will have been adopted by the date of accession date. In the case of those directives which, for various reasons, cannot be fully adopted by this date, timetables must be established in the negotiations for each of the candidate countries. Adequate resources must also be allocated for effective monitoring of compliance with these timetables. No transitional solutions should be accepted without set timetables.</p>
<p>· that the Government, in formulating Sweden’s strategy for accession negotiations, should take into account the fact that environmental costs represent a much larger portion of the total approximation costs than the proportion of the Phare resources that have so far been allocated to the environmental field.</p>
<p>· that in prioritizing initiatives for reducing air pollution, very high priority should be given to approximation of EU legislation in the transport/vehicle sector. As a part of this policy, the Committee recommends that all new vehicles sold in the new member states be required to comply with the latest EU standards  as soon as possible and by not later than  the date of accession. The Committee also recommends that the countries consider adopting new economic instruments, or strengthening already existing ones, to hasten the renewal of the country’s vehicle fleet.</p>
<p>· that the candidate countries’ participation in the EU’s environmental work should be stimulated and facilitated as a part of the approximation process. Representatives from the candidate countries should already now be invited to participate in the various task forces working to develop the EU’s environmental policy within different areas.</p>
<p>· that the gradual shift in priorities in Swedish environmental assistance to the candidate countries that has taken place over the past few years should continue and be further focused on projects that support the EU approximation process. Experience from the Swedish accession negotiations, as well as from the past three years of full membership, should be drawn on in stimulating administrative capacityand  competence-building in the candidate countries.</p>
<p>· that the EU and its current member states should work to raise the level of nuclear safety in the candidate countries as quickly as possible. It is then important that the aid be designed so that it is not a subsidy for continued nuclear power production in relation to energy efficiency improvements and  non-nuclear electricity and heat production.</p>
<p>· that the EU ascertain in detail the costs and environmental consequences of replacing existing nuclear power plants with energy conservation measures and, where necessary, with new nonnuclear power plants.</p>
<p>· that the EU and its current member states continue to contribute to raising the level of knowledge in the candidate countries and to the investments that are necessary to manage and dispose of existing radioactive waste and to improve radiation protection. that the EU and its current member states continue to give their strong support to nuclear  non-proliferation efforts in both the candidate countries and the Newly Independent States (that were formerly part of the Soviet Union).</p>
<p>The Committee also identifies a number of directives that should be given priority in the work of approximating the EU’s environmental legislation in the candidate countries.</p>
