<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Inquiry was initially asked to present proposals under which information reported by businesses to government authorities would, as a rule, only need to be submitted once, to one place. The task included, inter alia, to report on the legal and technical conditions for creating a system that would allow for such information to be used by multiple agencies and thus, result in an exchange of information between the authorities. The proposals were to pay particular attention to the coordination and regular maintenance of the reporting requirements in a Reporting Requirement Register (Directive 2012:35).</p>
<p>In March 2013, the Inquiry submitted an initial interim proposal (ref. No. 2013/4) for companies not having to provide government authorities with information more than once and on one occasion only.</p>
<p>In an additional directive (Directive 2013:51), the Inquiry was asked to develop a prototype of the proposed system.</p>
<p>On 4 December 2013, the Inquiry submitted its report on the tasks described above (SOU 2013:80).</p>
<p>A further directive, dated 28 November 2014 (Directive 2013:111), asked the Inquiry to prepare and implement the measures necessary for businesses not having to provide government authorities with information more than once and on one occasion only, the objective of which was to have an information submission system in place by the first half of 2015.</p>
<p>Based on the interim proposal, the directive also asked the Inquiry to further develop the prototype system before this was taken into use.</p>
<p>The measures implemented by the Inquiry resulted in a Reporting Submission Service including the following:</p>
<p> Businesses are given an overview of the reporting requirements that relate to their own operations via the  e-services of verksamt.se (a service on verksamt.se)</p>
<p> Businesses are given details of the basic information that is required by the various government authorities and how this information can be modified (a service on verksamt.se)</p>
<p> Businesses are notified by the authorities via ‘My messages’</p>
<p>(Mina meddelanden) when they are required to provide certain information (Notification service under ’My messages’)</p>
<p> Government authorities coordinate the information received about businesses in conjunction with the information collection (Composite Basic Service)</p>
<p> Government authorities survey what information is required in the Reporting Requirement Register (Reporting Requirement Service)</p>
<p> Government authorities are obliged to actively strive to reduce and simplify the information submission requirements applicable to businesses (Task simplification).</p>
<p>Early on in the implementation of the additional directives, the Inquiry identified a number of critical success factors. In an interim report to the Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation dated 30 January 2014, the Inquiry drew attention to the importance of the Principal providing support in order for the work to be completed within the set timeframe. The support was primarily aimed at participating government authorities allocating the resources necessary for their own operations but also, for the work to be prioritised at a management and operational level within the authorities.</p>
<p>In an attempt to, among other things, bring about real synergy between the Inquiry and the authorities concerned, a round-table meeting was held at the Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation in April 2014. Attending the round-table meeting were representatives from the Inquiry and the government authorities including Principal Investigator Cecilia Magnusson Sjöberg and Directors General Annika Bränström, Swedish Companies Registration Office and Ingemar Hansson, Swedish Tax Agency as</p>
<p>well as Gunilla Nordlöf, Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth and Ewa Carlsson, Administrative Director of the eGovernment Delegation. Based on a progress report jointly drawn up by the Inquiry and the authorities, the meeting was able to reach consensus on a common direction for the future.</p>
<p>In July 2014, the Swedish Companies Registration Office, Swedish Tax Agency, Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth and the Inquiry were commissioned by the Government to further develop and adapt the proposal put forward by verksamt.se and the Inquiry whereby companies would only have to submit information once and on one occasion. According to a government decision, the work was to result in the functions and functionality proposed by the Inquiry being coordinated with verksamt.se.</p>
<p>In a separate decision, the Companies Registration Office was commissioned to procure a technical solution for companies submitting information to verksamt.se and the Composite Basic Service (Sammansatta bastjänsten). This would involve the proposals of the Inquiry being implemented within the framework of verksamt.se. So as to effectively coordinate the implementation of the proposals, the Inquiry and the authorities created a mutual project. The work was coordinated by the Principal Investigator, partly through the operational steering group consisting of representatives of the Swedish Companies Registration Office, Swedish Tax Agency, Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth and the eGovernment Delegation. A representative of Statistics Sweden subsequently joined the group.</p>
<p>Composite Basic Service (Sammansatta bastjänsten)</p>
<p>The purpose of the Composite Basic Service is to coordinate basic information about companies in connection with companies submitting information. The Composite Basic Service initially downloads information from the Companies Registration Office and Statistics Sweden. The information is then compiled and transferred to the authority, the e-service of which initiated the download in the first place. The Composite Basic Service is procured by the Swedish Companies Registration Office, where, in</p>
<p>line with current framing, the central organisation and administration of the service is based.</p>
<p>The Composite Basic Service only deals with information that is conveyed and forms part of the technical processing of third parties. Compilations created within the framework of the Composite Basic Service are not, in the opinion of the Inquiry, public records. The intention of the information producers (i.e. the authorities) is to receive information via the Composite Basic Service and in media formats that are suitable for automated information processing when direct access is not permitted.</p>
<p>The Composite Basic Service processes personal data. In order to elucidate the responsibility of processing personal data via the Composite Basic Service, it is the opinion of the Inquiry that such responsibility should be regulated and controlled separately. The person receiving personal data through the Composite Basic Service shall also be responsible for the processing of such personal data. The responsibility of the Companies Registration Office shall include the handling of personal data in terms of the data submission and operations of the Composite Basic Service but shall exclude the processing of basic data transmitted via the Service. The Inquiry has assessed that the responsibility of the authority providing corporate data (the data producer) should extend up to the point where such data reaches the Composite Basic Service.</p>
<p>The Composite Basic Service does not necessitate any privacy controls.</p>
<p>Reporting Requirement Service</p>
<p>The Reporting Requirement Register contains information about specific reporting requirements. The register includes certain predetermined information about all reporting requirements. The register or database is linked to technical interfaces for reading and writing data, which together constitute a basic service for the submission of data (Reporting Requirement Service). The Swedish Companies Registration Office procures the Reporting Requirement Service but in keeping with current framing, the organisation and administration of the service is based at the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth.</p>
<p>At present, the Reporting Requirement Register includes data requirements as prescribed by the law, regulations and government provisions. The data included and registered in the Reporting Requirement Register has two main purposes. Firstly, to help companies identify the data submission requirements that apply to their specific operations and secondly, to monitor the obligation to submit data.</p>
<p>A key function of the Reporting Requirement Service is the option to identify the data submission requirements that apply to a certain company. This is primarily achieved using basic data about the company in question together with filtering attributes in the form of metadata submission requirements.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has continued working on quality assurance and the further development of data requirements. Moreover, the Inquiry has focused on the quality assurance of the Reporting Requirement Register with the intention of forming the basis for the services launched on 30 March 2015 and particularly, the redeveloped version of the current service offered by verksamt.se called Find permits.</p>
<p>Service function at verksamt.se</p>
<p>The functionality previously proposed by the Inquiry (“Servicetjänsten”) will be implemented either in the form of new or enhanced functions at verksamt.se.</p>
<p>The current service Find permits will be enhanced to provide companies with an overview of the reporting requirements that apply to their specific operations. The enhanced functionality will not be directly linked to the Reporting Requirement Service. Verksamt.se will instead, on a daily basis, download information about the latest data requirements from the Reporting Requirement Service and compile this with information from the existing database of the Find permits service. The authorities responsible for verksamt.se will also contribute with editorial texts.</p>
<p>In addition, verksamt.se gives a presentation of what basic data is collected from other authorities and how such data can be modified and amended.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of the Inquiry that no privacy controls are necessary in connection with the disclosure of basic data to companies at verksamt.se.</p>
<p>Notification function</p>
<p>The Inquiry has in a previous report (SOU 2013:80) proposed that the Reporting Submission Service should include ‘To do’-lists showing the data submission imposed on all companies and by which authority. The contents of such ‘To do’-lists are controlled by the authorities, which will send out electronic notifications of, for example, the date when the submission process is to be initiated. The notification is then prioritised and placed at the top of the ‘To do’-list. In addition to the notification of the information submission process, the authorities will also be able to notify companies of the completion of an information submission process. The purpose of the notification function is to simplify the information submission process for companies in general.</p>
<p>During the implementation of the notification function, however, the operational steering group has come to the conclusion that it should not to be developed as an independent service as initially proposed by the Inquiry but shall form part of</p>
<p>‘My messages’.</p>
<p>The Swedish Tax Agency has initiated the development of a project titled ‘Overview and notification support’. The Inquiry has partaken in the work of the project reference group and followed the development of the project – especially the function needed for its own proposals.</p>
<p>The notifications function as proposed by the Inquiry in its report SOU 2013:80 has given rise to a number of legal considerations that will continue to apply to the notification function of the Reporting submission service. However, it must be considered and assessed within the framework of the Swedish Tax</p>
<p>Agency’s project ’My messages’.</p>
<p>Connection to the Reporting Submission Service for companies</p>
<p>On 30 June 2014 (ref. No. 2014/16), the Inquiry put forward a proposal for the timing and frequency of the connection of authorities to the Reporting submission service. The existence of the Reporting submission service is dependent on several authorities connecting to the system, which, if they do not, will minimize or abolish the benefits of the system altogether.</p>
<p>Thirteen government authorities have so far been connected to the system but other government authorities are also expected to connect.</p>
<p>In March 2015, the Companies Registration Office and Statistics Sweden will be connected to the Composite Basic Service for the first submission of basic company-related information. By mid 2015, the Swedish Tax Agency will also be connected while the remaining 13 authorities will connect to the Reporting submission service in their capacity as data producers during the first half of 2015. The next phase covers the submission of basic information from relevant authorities as well as the identification of other authorities that may connect to the system as data producers for the submission of information and consequently, the expansion of the Reporting submission service.</p>
<p>Out of the 13 authorities working with identifying information requirements, few are willing to freely connect their e-services to the Composite Basic Service. However, the proposed company information regulations will enable the Government to oblige these authorities to connect to parts of the system.</p>
<p>Future organisation of the Reporting submission service</p>
<p>The Inquiry has established a user interface, primarily aimed at the authorities involved in the identification process. The purpose of the user interface is to help find a common approach as regards the submission of information so that this decreases while interactions between the authorities increases. Another objective is to create an incentive for authorities to connect to the Reporting submission service.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has also, in cooperation with corporate operators and representatives of business associations, created a forum for</p>
<p>businesses, the purpose of which is to ensure ease of use, solicit the opinion of others and support the introduction of the Reporting submission service to authorities and businesses. The organisations that are given access to the forum are those listed in the Inquiry directive and those having shown an interest by providing appropriate feedback on the Inquiry’s previous report in the form of a statement of opinion. The individual corporate operators make up various categories of companies, the competencies of which are of specific importance for information submitting businesses.</p>
<p>As far as we know, it is not the Government’s intention to transfer the coordinating role of the Inquiry in the continued management of the Reporting submission service to another authority in the immediate future. The Companies Registration Office, the Swedish Tax Agency and the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth understand the need for cooperation if the Reporting submission service is to function as intended. The Inquiry therefore recommends that a provision is included in the proposed Company Information Regulations to the effect that the Swedish Companies Registration Office, the Swedish Tax Agency and the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth shall cooperate in order to enable and facilitate the smooth functioning of the Reporting submission service. The authorities share the responsibility of finding common forms of effective cooperation.</p>
<p>So as to ensure continuity in the work on reducing and simplifying the information submission process for businesses, a continued development of the user interface and forum for businesses is needed in addition to the establishment of a solid service management organisation. The organisation used for the implementation of the service may serve as an example of the way in which the Swedish Companies Registration Office, the Swedish Tax Agency and the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth choose to organise the management and future development of the Reporting submission service. Statistics Sweden, a major data producer, should also be clearly and proactively involved in the management organisation.</p>
<p>The Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth will, as proposed by the Inquiry, be responsible for creating and monitoring the user interface.</p>
<p>The forum shall proactively support the introduction of the Reporting submission service to businesses and other stakeholders. The forum shall also, at a regular interval of for example once a year, provide the Government with a report on its activities. The report shall also include an evaluation of the performance of the Reporting submission service for businesses.</p>
<p>The forum shall be based as a separate independent decision- making body within the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth whereupon the Government shall appoint the Chairman and other members. To facilitate for the forum to fully evaluate the extent to which the Reporting submission service is decreasing and simplifying the submission of data from businesses, it must be given the opportunity to influence the authorities at an early stage. Hence, the Swedish Companies Registration Office, the Swedish Tax Agency and the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth should be required to consult with the Company Data Forum prior to making any changes to the Reporting submission service.</p>
<p>Impact assessment of proposals</p>
<p>To assess the benefits that our proposals will bring to the government authorities and businesses involves taking major uncertainties into consideration. Previous socio-economic assessments (see Inquiry Report SOU 2013:80) suggests that it is socio-economically viable to establish a Reporting Requirement Register and actively endeavour to coordinate data requirements in order to reduce and simplify the submission of data for businesses.</p>
<p>The result of a cost-benefit analysis of the authorities’ own assessment of perceived benefits indicates administrative gains in the form of fewer calls to customer service centres, less paper mailings and mistakes plus a faster turnaround and time-savings by way of a diminished data collection, improved re-utilisation and reduced number of unnecessary data submission demands.</p>
<p>The authorities will ultimately benefit from this process as the need for service among businesses is reduced, which in turn will lead to the release of added resources. Seeing as our proposals involve the coordination and re-utilisation of data by multiple</p>
<p>authorities, we conclude that the benefits gained by the authorities include, among others, the reduced collection of data from businesses.</p>
<p>The benefits gained by the businesses, on the other hand, include time-savings and less administrative costs. Running a business should be easy, something that requires simple, effective and understandable rules.</p>
