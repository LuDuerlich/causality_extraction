<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>General starting points</h2>
<p>In accordance with the directives, the commission will undertake a review of the Act (1991:586) on Special Income Tax for NonResidents (SINK).</p>
<p>Swedish taxation law distinguishes between unlimited and limited tax liability. In principle, persons who are resident in Sweden, persons who are living here on a regular basis and also those who have substantial connections here and who have previously been resident here have unlimited tax liability. Others, i.e. practically all non-residents, have limited tax liability. Unlimited tax liability includes all income, irrespective of the country from which it derives. Limited tax liability only includes income that in some way derives from activities or assets in Sweden.</p>
<p>Income from employment that has been earned through work in Sweden and that is received by physical persons who are resident abroad (limited tax liability) is taxed according to SINK. The tax rate for taxation according to SINK is 25 percent of gross earnings, which consequently means that no deductions are allowed. The tax is a final tax at source; in other words, there is no obligation to file a tax return.</p>
<p>The commission has two main tasks with regard to the review of SINK. One task is to consider whether certain persons who are currently taxed according to SINK, namely non-residents who regularly commute to Sweden to work several days a week but who do not spend their rest time here (day commuters), should be placed on an equal footing with persons who have an unlimited tax liability here in the country, and consequently instead be taxed according to the Income Tax Act (1999:1229, IL). The background is that SINK is also applied to persons who commute to Sweden on a long-term basis, from Denmark for example, in order to work here; persons such as this are consequently not considered to live here on a regular basis. When SINK was introduced the intention was that the Act should apply to tax-payers who temporarily receive income in Sweden. Taxation in accordance with SINK of 25 percent of gross pay is, according to the directives, normally considered to be far too favourable to persons such as these who have permanent employment in Sweden or who otherwise work here on a regular basis; this applies in particular to those who have a high income.</p>
<p>The other task is to investigate if SINK may constitute discrimination in that it conflicts with the regulations in the EUTreaty on free movement of labour. The background in this case is that according to SINK no deductions for expenses or personal allowances are permitted, and consequently a person who is taxed according to the Act can in certain cases be more severely taxed than a person in an equivalent situation who is taxed according to IL; this applies in particular to those who have a low income but a high level of expenses.</p>
<p>Over and above these tasks, the commission shall look into the procedural regulations according to SINK, among others, certain questions concerning the relationship between, on the one hand SINK, and on the other hand the Tax Payment Act (1997:483, SBL) and the Tax Assessment Act (1990:324, TL).</p>
<p>In addition, the commission shall deal with a question that involves tax liability for foreign arrangers of entertainment in Sweden when the Act (1991:591) on special income tax for nonresident artistes and others (A-SINK) is applied.</p>
<p>To start with, it can be observed that the criticism against SINK in the two relevant respects is based on the fact that the SINK-tax is in the one case – that of day commuters – considered to be too favourable to the tax-payer, while the SINK-tax in the other case – that of deductions – is considered to be too unfavourable to the tax-payer. This is in itself a natural consequence of the fact that the SINK-tax is a tax at source and consequently a tax of standard character; after all, all standard-rate taxation involves some individuals being taxed more favourably and others more unfavourably than would have been the case if consideration was paid to all the circumstances that are normally taken into account in the context of tax.</p>
<p>It can additionally be observed that the SINK-system by and large functions well and that there are few individuals who stand out as big winners or losers in the way that has been indicated, by being assessed according to SINK instead of according to IL. At the same time it is clear that in order to overcome the problems indicated, a fairly large intervention in the system is required that obviously complicates the taxation of the groups in question.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that changing the current regulations should require compelling reasons. Neither does the commission’s directive require the commission to propose changes. When it comes to the issue of whether SINK is compatible with EU-law – this concerns the issue of deductions – there is however hardly any room to avoid changing the rules if they are found to conflict with Community law. Concerning day commuters there is, however, in itself nothing to prevent letting the current state of affairs remain, even if due to its standard nature it can convey considerable tax advantages for a few persons. The problem of day commuters by and large applies only in terms of the relationship between Sweden and Denmark. There has, primarily from the Danish side, been demands that the tax rules are changed so that the competitive advantages that the current rules are considered to convey when employing Danish day commuters in Sweden, are eliminated. Discussions have also long been taking place between the countries with the aim of finding a bilateral solution to the problem, however up to now this has been unsuccessful. There is consequently a desire that a concrete proposal is put forward that can constitute a basis for continued consideration in the area. The commission is therefore putting forward a proposal of this nature.</p>
<h2>Taxation of day commuters and the concept of habitual abode Day commuters’ income – taxation according to SINK or IL</h2>
<p>As stated above, in principle, day commuters can work in Sweden for an unlimited period and still bear a tax liability according to SINK. The intention when the law was introduced was that it should apply to tax-payers who were temporarily in receipt of income in Sweden. These individuals would thereby avoid filing a tax return and the taxation procedure would in general be simplified for this group. Any reason to allow the Act to have a more widespread area of application has not emerged. As a rule, the day commuters have permanent jobs in Sweden and should therefore not be taxed according to SINK. The commission consequently proposes that this category shall be taxed according to IL.</p>
<p>The proposal means that those individuals who are resident abroad and who work in Sweden for a period of at least six months, and normally for at least ten days per month, shall be taxed according to IL, instead of according to SINK. The commission is not putting forward any requirement that it needs to be the same employment during the six-month period. The ten-day limit is motivated by the fact that those who have permanent employment with regular work in Sweden should fall outside SINK. As a rule employment of this kind involves working at least half time. The limit should therefore in principle be set at two days a week. In order to also cover those cases in which working-hours are distributed unevenly between weeks, the commission proposes that the work criterion shall be fulfilled if the work normally takes place for at least ten days per month.</p>
<p>The commission proposes that the tax rate for this category should be the average local tax that is being levied in Sweden’s municipalities at the time.</p>
<h2>Should the concept of habitual abode be clarified?</h2>
<p>What is meant by habitual abode does not emerge directly from the text of the Act but it is determined by custom. In the main the legal position is that continuous residence should be at least six months and that short breaks are not considered to interrupt the period of residence.</p>
<p>The commission has deliberated on whether the concept of habitual abode should be made more precise. However it is difficult to find a model with the right balance. Several neighbouring countries have an equivalent unregulated system in which equality with those who have unlimited tax liability comes about according to custom after at least six months residence in the working country, with short breaks not representing an interruption to this residence. It can further be pointed out that disputes involving the issue of habitual abode are not particularly common in the fiscal courts. It indicates that the current state of affairs is not producing any major application problems. Against this background the commission proposes no definition of the concept of habitual abode.</p>
<h2>Non-residents (limited tax liability) have the opportunity to choose taxation according to IL instead of according to SINK</h2>
<p>In this section, the commission’s task is to clarify if SINK can constitute discrimination in that it conflicts with the regulations in the EU-Treaty on free movement of labour. As has been mentioned, with taxation according to SINK persons resident abroad have no rights to deductions for professional expenses or to basic deductions, general deductions or deductions for interest.</p>
<p>Against the background of the rulings of the European Court of Justice, it can be maintained that with all probability there is a requirement for there to be the opportunity for non-residents in certain cases to be removed from standard taxation under SINK when this is less favourable than taxation according to the usual rules in IL. As a consequence of the so called Schumacker ruling in the European Court of Justice, an opportunity has been introduced in Germany and in Denmark for a non-resident (limited tax liability) who works in the country to choose, when being assessed, to be in principle put on an equal footing with a person who has unlimited tax liability; as a prerequisite for obtaining this right, among other things, tax-payers must earn a clearly predominant part of their income in the country in which they are working (Germany/Denmark).</p>
<p>With regard to the requirements of EC-law, the commission has come to the conclusion that a non-resident tax-payer shall under certain conditions be allowed to choose if taxation shall take place according to IL instead of according to SINK. According to the commission, a non-resident tax-payer should, to start with, without any special requirements, have the opportunity to choose to be taxed for income from employment according to IL and consequently be entitled to the deductions that are necessary for professional expenditure.</p>
<p>Persons liable to taxation should furthermore have the right to personal deductions if they receive a clearly predominant part of their income from the state in which they are working. This is based on the fact that persons in this situation, as a rule, do not have the opportunity for personal deductions in their state of abode. The commission therefore proposes that persons resident abroad with tax liability who are citizens of a state within the European Economic Area and who have an earned income in Sweden that amounts to at least 75 percent of their total earned income from Sweden and other countries shall also have the right to general deductions, basic deductions and deductions for interest.</p>
<h2>The rules on procedure</h2>
<p>The commission proposes that not just the employer but also the person liable to tax shall, as a rule, be liable to pay special income tax.</p>
<p>The commission proposes further that the Tax Payment Act’s rules on among other things reviewing, additional taxation and tax surcharge shall also be applicable with regard to special income tax. Certain consequential changes are also made in the Taxation Act.</p>
<h2>Other issues Procedural issues</h2>
<p>According to the directives the commission shall consider a harmonisation of the jurisdictional rules for procedures according to IL and according to SINK. The background is that the question of whether a person has unlimited or limited tax liability can be the subject of adjudication at various tax authorities and subsequently at various courts.</p>
<p>With regard to court adjudications, there are provisions in the General Administrative Courts Act (1971:289) that make it possible to move the hearing of a case to another county administrative court or administrative court of appeal that is hearing a case which is closely connected to a case at another court. According to the fundamental principle, cases shall be grouped together to be heard at the court where the action was first initiated. The provisions are certainly not compulsory but are based on the fact that agreement can be reached. Since one possibility for transfer of cases already exists, the commission considers however that there are not sufficient reasons to propose a new regulation of a more compulsory character.</p>
<h2>Reimbursement of expenses</h2>
<p>According to a provision in SINK, persons resident abroad are exempted from tax liability for reimbursements for travel and accommodation expenses that they have received in their capacity as a member or a deputy member of a board or similar body in a Swedish limited company or other Swedish legal person in conjunction with assignments in Sweden.</p>
<p>The exception from tax liability with respect to reimbursements for travel and accommodation consequently only applies to assignments in Sweden; i.e. reimbursement to persons who hold directorships abroad for Swedish companies become liable to taxation. The provisions therefore mean that reimbursement to persons who have directorships abroad for Swedish companies become liable to taxation. The commission considers that there are no reasons to differentiate between assignments in Sweden and assignments abroad and therefore proposes a change in the law that means that reimbursement for expenses for persons resident abroad shall also be tax-free for directorships outside Sweden.</p>
<h2>Special income tax on non-resident artistes and others</h2>
<p>According to the directives the question has been raised as to whether discrimination according to the EC-Treaty and Tax Agreement may arise as a result of the fact that under certain circumstances Swedish non-profit organisations can be exempted from tax liability without a corresponding tax exemption being available for foreign arrangers of an equivalent kind.</p>
<p>The commission proposes in terms of this issue that exemption from tax liability shall apply for a foreign arranger for receipts from the sale of tickets, advertising revenues and other revenues from an entertainment in Sweden if the foreign arranger is in all essentials equivalent to a Swedish non-profit organisation of this kind, for which tax liability is not present.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposals</h2>
<p>The commission’s proposals are estimated to lead to a permanent budget weakening of 290 million Swedish kronor.</p>
<p>The commission proposes that the shortfall in tax revenues is financed through a reduction in the general basic allowance of 100 – 200 Swedish kr. A reduction in the basic deduction of this order gives an estimated budget strengthening of 235-470 million Swedish kronor.</p>
<h2>Coming into effect</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the new rules come into effect 1st January 2004.</p>
