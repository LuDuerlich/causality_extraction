<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Veterans and their families</h2>
<p>Every day and all year round, Swedish women and men voluntarily serve the Swedish people (the State) on various peacesupport missions, humanitarian interventions and aid and development initiatives around the world. These initiatives are undertaken to create peace in areas affected by conflict, to rescue people in need and distress in the wake of disasters and to help others achieve a safer and better life through various forms of aid and development assistance. The women and men sent on these missions are recruited carefully as their duties often require great personal sacrifices, not just by the individual themselves, but also by their family, especially their children. The work often take place in dangerous, demanding circumstances, where the individual might be at great risk of physical and psychological injury as a result of their service. Experience has shown that most of those who return home after having served found that the challenges they faced in their work enriched and developed them as individuals. The c. 60–70 000 Swedish veterans who have served on international missions and operations over the years are, in many respects, a group with huge resources, whose knowledge and experience makes various contributions to our society. At the same time, research and experience show that a smaller number of women and men suffer from various physical and psychological problems and injuries as a result of the often very dangerous, difficult and complex conditions in the areas where they served. In some cases, the individual has been severely injured. The family, especially the children, also have to make great sacrifices and are subject to strain when a husband/wife/partner/parent/child is sent to areas affected by conflict or disaster.</p>
<h2>The commission</h2>
<p>In 2010, the Riksdag decreed a Swedish veterans policy. This means that the Swedish people (the State) demonstrate their gratitude for the efforts of the veterans and their families, while the veterans are granted increased protection by social legislation in connection to their service in various international missions. Support is also provided to the families.</p>
<p>The Commission of Inquiry on Veterans is tasked partly with following up and evaluating the implementation thus far of the Swedish veterans policy and the veteran soldier legislation and partly with assessing whether these need to be developed further, e.g. whether there is a need for veteran legislation that also covers civilians who have served on international missions or other dangerous and stressful operations. These personnel could also be regarded as veterans, and thereby be entitled to society's special support measures, as required. The basic premiss is that all veterans, civilian and military alike, should be guaranteed individualised and appropriate support before, during and after their service on an international mission or operation.</p>
<h2>Basic premisses</h2>
<p>One fundamental prerequisite that would allow the support provided to veterans and their families to correspond to the risks and stresses resulting from participation in international missions and operations is that all the governmental authorities are willing to collaborate on a collective veterans policy goal. In other countries, veterans policy reforms have been implemented together with the various ministries affected. This increases the impact of the improvements and sets an example for the various governmental agencies answering to different ministries and that are directly responsible for these activities.</p>
<p>There is also a need in Sweden for a corresponding widespread commitment in order for a coordinated, well-developed veterans policy that affects several ministries and governmental agencies to become credible and accepted and have an impact on society in general.</p>
<p>Knowledge about the situation and the reactions of veterans, veteran soldiers and their families is growing steadily. However, there is still a great need for further knowledge about this area and research in this field is constantly yielding new information. A successful veterans policy depends on it being adapted to new knowledge and continuous development.</p>
<p>Other than peacekeeping missions, Sweden also participates in international humanitarian interventions, aid and development initiatives, disaster and rescue missions and healthcare intervenetions in various places around the world. In the work to shape the coordinated, well-developed future veterans policy, corresponding specific needs to those of veteran soldiers and their families have been identified in civilian personnel (veterans) who undertake international missions or operations and in their families.</p>
<p>Prior to the mission, both the personnel and their families have a great need of information, not least those who are serving for the first time. The personnel and their families also need to be able to contact one another while the mission itself is ongoing. Knowing that it is possible to contact one another should something happen, in the field or at home, means a lot to the personnel and their families.</p>
<p>Follow-up of the personnel subsequent to the mission is very important. The ability to identify an individual affected by physical or psychological ill-health during the mission is fundamental in order to offer relevant support measures and to help the individual get back to normal. The availability and structure of the support measures are also of great importance.</p>
<p>This chain – information, support, contact and follow-up – forms the basis of a coordinated and credible veterans policy in support of personnel and their families. For this reason, the preparations for personnel prior to a mission, the support provided during the mission and the support and follow-up subsequent to the mission are fundamental if Sweden is to assume its responsibility for the personnel affected. This is dependent on operations being based in a coherent, credible and generally recognised personnel policy. Such a policy must cover all links in the chain, from the initiation of a mission to long after it has been completed. It must also encompass all those affected by the mission.</p>
<p>One basic premiss in the work to shape proposals for a coordinated, well-developed veterans policy so that it also encompasses civilians who have served in different missions has been for this policy – as is currently the case for the Swedish Armed Forces' personnel – to be based on a socially holistic perspective that includes dissemination of knowledge, recruitment of personnel, training and preparation prior to the mission, support and actions during the mission and subsequent support and follow-up, as well as rehabilitation of any individuals who may have been injured. The support provided to the family, especially children, is also an important part of this holistic perspective.</p>
<p>Another basic premiss has been to assess – in a similar way as prior to the introduction of the veteran soldier policy – how society as a whole can contribute to the implementation of a coordinated, well-developed veterans policy. Accordingly, the basic premiss is that the governmental agency or organisation that is, from an overall societal perspective, the most suitable for the task should be in charge of the initiative.</p>
<p>If, as proposed by the commission of inquiry, a coordinated, well-developed veterans policy is to be implemented, the following measures should be taken in order to increase the support provided to all veterans – civilian and military alike – before, during and after an international mission. These suggestions are also based on experience from the follow-up and evaluation of the veteran soldier policy implemented thus far.</p>
<p>Follow-up and evaluation of the veteran soldier  policy</p>
<p>The commission of inquiry's follow-up and evaluation of the veteran soldier  policy indicates that a predominate majority of the goals and interim goals set by the Riksdag and Government for this policy have been achieved.</p>
<p>Veterans legislation has been introduced that covers all of the Swedish Armed Forces' personnel – both military and civilian – involved in international military interventions, a joint veterans' day for all civilian and military veterans has been established on 29 May and a veterans' memorial has been erected at the Royal Djurgården in Stockholm.</p>
<p>At the same time, the follow-up and evaluation indicate that there deficiencies and challenges remain in the implementation of the veteran soldier policy.</p>
<p>The evaluation shows a lack of public awareness of international military interventions and the veterans policy, which has a negative impact on the chances of providing veterans with adequate support, follow-up and rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the follow-up and evaluation indicated that there have been deficiencies in the Swedish Armed Forces' organisational structure and work to support and monitor veteran soldiers. The Swedish Armed Forces has also not conducted any large-scale collaboration exercises involving other participants for the event of major casualties in the mission area.</p>
<p>There are also clear deficiencies in the collaboration between various governmental agencies, municipalities and county councils when it comes to the support and care provided to injured veterans.</p>
<p>From the follow-up, it is clear that the Swedish Armed Forces still has no statistics on veterans, which makes it more difficult for this agency and others affected to learn how the health and living situations of veteran soldiers are progressing. The lack of statistics on veterans also makes research into the subject more difficult.</p>
<p>All in all, the deficiencies stated affect society's likelihood of and ability to provide veterans and their families with sufficient gratitude for the sacrifices they have made for the Swedish people (the State) and the healthcare that injured veterans must receive and the support their families are entitled to.</p>
<p>Consequently, the commission of inquiry proposes the following measures be taken in order to remedy the deficiencies and problems identified, and thus reinforce and improve the veterans policy.</p>
<p>The State, through the Swedish Armed Forces and other organisations affected, should take action to increase public awareness of international military interventions and the veterans policy.</p>
<p>The Swedish Armed Forces should make sure that its personnel receive the support needed before, during and after the mission. It should continuously evaluate its organisational structure and operations to ensure that personnel with physical and psychological problems are identified and monitored, and given the support they need. It should also take action to ensure that injured veterans are provided with the required health and social care from those agencies responsible. This also includes measures that aim to improve the effectiveness of the collaboration between those affected, for example between authorities, municipalities, county councils and voluntary organisations for veterans and their families.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the commission of inquiry suggests that the Swedish Armed Forces and the other public employers involved should keep official veteran statistics in order to learn more about the veterans' health and life situations, and to give researchers better data with which to investigate the subject of veterans.</p>
<h2>Proposed measures to improve the different parts of the veterans policy Knowledge about international missions and operations must improve</h2>
<p>It is of vital importance that there is widespread knowledge about the international missions in which Sweden participates in different areas. Increased knowledge about these operations is important for several reasons. Helping people in need in various parts of the world will come to be seen as a natural part of everyday Swedish life. The knowledge amongst society as a whole about these missions and operations, as well as about what they entail in terms of risks and stress for the personnel involved, must increase in order for a coordinated, well-developed veterans policy to achieve its full impact. Governmental authorities and other government agencies have a responsibility to contribute to ensuring this takes place. There will then be a better societal foundation from which to provide support to the veterans and their families. More in-depth knowledge will also entail greater and more definitive support for overseas personnel, not only in their day-to-day work, but also in the event of an incident and when, for example, undue criticism is directed at the mission or an individual.</p>
<p>The commission of inquiry has come to the conclusion that a more widespread and in-depth knowledge amongst society about international missions and operations would contribute to improving understanding of these activities. Increasing the level of insight into the purposes and implementation of these activities will also increase the understanding of the reality in which the overseas personnel live and of what they have to overcome when they return home. When the purpose of various international missions and operations has been firmly established among the general public, they can become involved in and affected by those missions and operations in a positive way. The overseas personnel can then feel that they have the support necessary to complete their task. According to the commission of inquiry, these aspects are an important part of the coordinated veterans policy.</p>
<p>Consequently, the commission of inquiry proposes a number of measures to increase the knowledge among society about international missions and operations in which Sweden participates on the one hand, and about the veterans policy, its goals and implementation on the other.</p>
<h2>Improved recruitment</h2>
<p>Research has shown the importance of recruiting only those with the appropriate expertise and personal circumstances to serve as part of dangerous, complex international missions. Public employers must continue to improve the quality of recruitment to international missions, and ensure that new results from research and the past experience of other organisations and countries involved in this work are taken into account in the recruitment efforts.</p>
<h2>Mission frequency</h2>
<p>To reduce the risk of personnel suffering ill-health and to reduce the social stresses, all public employers should have guidelines that set out the mission frequency allowed for individual employees. These guidelines should be based on the results of research and the past experience of other organisations and countries.</p>
<h2>Medical care</h2>
<p>The public employer is responsible for ensuring that those who participate in international missions are appropriately prepared for those missions, that they receive the necessary support during those missions, and that they are taken care of afterwards. The same applies to emergency situations during the mission, and access to adequate healthcare in conjunction with accidents or acts of violence that their personnel are exposed to. The public employer must also ensure access to adequate healthcare in the field or medical evacuation of personnel in need of such care.</p>
<h2>Planning in the event of major casualties</h2>
<p>There must be an overall national plan in the event of major casualties resulting from an accident or another serious incident in the field and where regular national resources such as the Swedish Response Team are not sufficient to support the operation. Each individual public employer must also have a plan for dealing with such situations and conduct exercises using this plan.</p>
<h2>Responsibility for support and follow-up</h2>
<p>The support and follow-up provided by public employers must be reinforced. The public employer must – as is currently the case for the Swedish Armed Forces – provide support to those who have previously served in need of support as a result of their service, regardless of whether the person is still employed by the agency in question. The governmental agency must actively follow up on whether its employees have any physical or psychological problems resulting from their service. This follow-up must be an active effort and include personal contact with employees subsequent to their service as part of an international mission, if this is not evidently unnecessary or impossible.</p>
<p>The specific responsibility of the public employer to follow-up will apply for five years with regard to employees who have served as part of international missions or operations of a dangerous or stressful nature.</p>
<p>The public employer will also be responsible for providing extra help or guidance to an individual veteran in particularly difficult cases that require extensive measures and resources. Thereafter, the agency will have a permanent, but more limited responsibility for follow-up. This means that the agency will provide support, when needed, to employees suffering from physical or psychological problems after the stated five-year period has elapsed. Therefore, the responsibility to support employees who have been injured as a result of their service as part of an international mission or operation has no time limit. The supportive measures will instead continue as long as they are required and the measures appear reasonable.</p>
<p>At the same time, this proposal means that regular actors are not exempt from their responsibilities pursuant to, for example, the social security legislation. The proposed measures would mean that all veterans, civilian and military alike, receive the same support and follow-up before, during and after their service as part of an international mission or operation.</p>
<h2>Family – support and compensation</h2>
<p>The employee's family also make sacrifices and take part in the international mission or operation. The whole family may need support when one member is serving in the field far away.</p>
<p>The commission of inquiry proposes that the public employer must – as is currently the case for the Swedish Armed Forces – provide support in the form of information to the families those serving as part of an international mission or operation. Furthermore, the public employer must have a coherent plan for its work with families in general. Specific compensation – similar to that pursuant to the Act (2010:449) on Swedish Armed Forces Personnel in International Military Operations – will be payable to the families of such personnel. It will be possible, in special cases, to pay this type of compensation even if the employee has not been killed or injured severely enough to require hospitalisation.</p>
<p>The commission of inquiry also suggests that there should be a contact person within the governmental agency to support and guide family members in various issues connected to the service. Therefore, support and assistance should be available, not only in the event that the employee is injured or killed, but also in certain other situations.</p>
<h2>The State's gratitude</h2>
<p>Participation in international missions or operations is an important instrument for Sweden's security policy aim of contributing to peace, security and development. The State's gratitude to the civilian and military personnel who participate, and have participated, in international missions or operations, often in dangerous and stressful conditions, must be unequivocal.</p>
<p>A monument has been erected in memory of all Swedish veterans at the Royal Djurgården in Stockholm, and 29 May is already an annual day of remembrance for all Swedish veterans. The Swedish Armed Forces has a long tradition of awarding medals to personnel serving as part of international missions, and since 2011 there is a medal for individuals who have been injured while serving.</p>
<p>The State's gratitude to civilian veterans who have served as part of international missions or operations is, to some extent, already expressed through the veterans' memorial and the veterans' day of 29 May. However, the State's gratitude should go even further, and the public employers involved should consider the creation of a medal to reward personnel who have served as part of particularly dangerous or stressful international missions or operations, in the same way as the Swedish Armed Forces. These medals would, amongst other things, constitute recognition of the danger and the stress that personnel subject themselves to, and where the individual may come to pay a high personal price. Each public employer should individually set out more detailed regulations regarding their recognition of veterans.</p>
<p>A veterans' church service should be held in the Royal Chapel in Stockholm on the first Sunday of September each year. A special veterans' march should be adopted and 29 May declared an official Swedish flagday.</p>
<h2>The mission as a merit</h2>
<p>The proposed national veterans' authority and the public employers should strive to give service as part of international missions or operations more weight as merits, by disseminating information and knowledge about what work as part of an international mission or operation entails for the individual employee in terms of increased expertise and skills.</p>
<h2>Voluntary organisations, particularly veterans' and family organisations</h2>
<p>Voluntary organisations, veterans' and family organisations in particular, have a special role to play in the work to support veterans and their families. For the individual it is often easier to turn to one of these organisations for help.</p>
<p>The Swedish Armed Forces and other public employers should therefore continue to develop their collaboration with voluntary organisations, and also involve more such organisations in the work with veterans.</p>
<h2>Official veteran statistics</h2>
<p>Veteran statistics form the basis of knowledge concerning the development of veterans' health and living situations, and also support veteran research. Official veteran statistics are also available in many other countries.</p>
<p>Official veteran statistics should therefore be introduced in Sweden. It is proposed that each public employer be responsible for keeping these statistics and the proposed national veterans' authority would have the overall national responsibility for veteran statistics.</p>
<h2>A national veterans' agency</h2>
<p>To promote and develop veteran issues, a national veteran agency should be established. This national veterans' agency will, among other things, have an overall and coordinating responsibility for national veterans' issues, develop a national action plan for veterans' issues, work strategically with the coordination of veterans' issues that concern all the governmental agencies, be responsible for national knowledge development and dissemination of experience concerning veterans' issues, administer the combined official veteran statistics, have an advisory capacity and coordinate the work with veterans' and family issues between the agencies, municipalities, county councils and voluntary organisations affected, particularly veterans' and family organisations. The veteran's agency will also be able to provide information and guidance to other affected agencies, municipalities, county councils and voluntary organisations and, in special cases, to individual veterans and families. The agency should also have a commission-funded unit that can provide advice, support and guidance, and coordinate cases where the veteran has been severely injured and where there is a need for the national veteran's agency's particular expertise in veterans' issues.</p>
<h2>International collaboration</h2>
<p>Many other countries have a lengthy experience of working with matters relating to veterans and their families. This experience from other countries should be taken advantage of to a greater extent. Nordic collaboration in veterans' and family issues should be developed, which includes, amongst other things, considering the establishment of a collaboration with the Norwegian veteran organisation in Bæreia  and, in the long term, develop an equivalent organisation in Sweden. Furthermore, experience from the Danish model, involving a well-developed collaboration between the Danish Armed Forces and Rigshospitalet, should be utilised in developing Swedish veterans policy.</p>
<h2>A new law containing provisions for the civilian personnel of public employers in international missions etc.</h2>
<p>The commission of inquiry proposes the introduction of a new law concerning publicly-employed civilian personnel taking part in dangerous and stressful international missions and operations. This law contains provisions that essentially correspond to what is currently valid according to the Act (2010:449) on Swedish Armed Forces Personnel in International Military Operations. This law would guarantee civilian government employees increased support and protection in conjunction with their service as part of dangerous or stressful international missions or operations.</p>
<h2>The veterans policy is the collective responsibility of everyone in Sweden</h2>
<p>The proposed legislation and the other suggestions made by the commission of inquiry will develop the veterans policy into a coordi- nated national veterans policy that covers all veterans in Sweden, both civilian and military and affects society as a whole. The co- ordinated, well-developed veterans policy is thereby also the collec- tive responsibility of everyone in Sweden.</p>
