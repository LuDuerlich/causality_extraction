<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The assignment</h2>
<p>According to our terms of reference, we shall undertake a general review of the Postal Services Act. This review includes analysing definitions, authorisations and the overall structure of the Postal Services Act.</p>
<p>We shall analyse the 2008 Postal Services Directive as well as the various means of financing the universal service specified in that Directive. The assignment also includes analysing whether the provisions of the 1997 Postal Services Directive (amended by the 2002 Postal Services Directive) on accounting and tariffs, according to which, inter alia, prices must be affordable and geared to costs, have been appropriately implemented in Swedish legislation, and whether the amendment of these provisions by the 2008 Postal Services Directive necessitates any legislative amendments. Within the framework of this analysis, the principles of transparency and non-discrimination when applying special tariffs and associated conditions shall also be investigated. Finally, the assignment also includes consideration of whether the procedure for customer complaints in Sweden complies with the provisions of the Postal Services Directive on resolution of disputes and the possibilities for postal users to bring complaints to the competent national authority.</p>
<p>We shall propose the legislative changes arising from our analysis and our assessments. In connection with the review of the Postal Services Act, we shall take into consideration the changes proposed by the Postal and Cashier Service Committee (Postmarknad i förändring [The Development of the Swedish Postal Market], SOU 2005:5) on revocation of unused licences, redirection of addressed mail items as well as on service providers and administration of the postcode system.</p>
<h2>The postal market</h2>
<p>Postal services are very important for the EU economy. In 2004, postal services turnover in the EU totalled approximately EUR 90 billion or almost 1 per cent of the EU’s GDP. The postal sector has undergone extensive development and the postal operators are now also encountering competition from electronic means of communication. There are some indications that the previously national mail companies are to an increasing extent becoming established in several countries or that they are looking for strategic partnerships with one another across national borders. The first real merger of two national postal companies is between the Swedish Posten AB and Post Danmark A/S.</p>
<p>The Swedish letters market, i.e. the market for addressed items of domestic correspondence up to two kilos, is a very diversified market. Customers include all types of actors, from households who purchase a few stamps per year to major customers such as banks, insurance companies and authorities, who send millions of items of correspondence annually. However, letters are primarily a channel for information from businesses to households.</p>
<p>From 1990 until today, the letter mail market has shown rather stable volumes of over 3 billion items of correspondence per annum, although there has been a downward trend averaging 1.25 per cent per year in recent years. The Swedish Post and Telecom Agency (PTS) has estimated that over 70 per cent of the volumes on the domestic letter mail market consist of ”bulk mail” and around 20 per cent ”office post”. The share of letterbox post is thus less than 10 per cent.</p>
<p>Posten has a special position in the Swedish postal market, partly due to its dominant position and partly to the company being responsible for providing the ”universal service” in the postal sphere. In 2008, Posten delivered almost 90 per cent of the mail items in the letters market. Bring CityMail is by far and large the largest company among the other postal operators.</p>
<p>Posten completely dominated the Swedish parcel market until the mid-1970s. Competition then increased when the traditional transport sector started to offer a door-to-door business parcels service. In the case of business parcels, i.e. parcels sent by businesses either to other businesses or to private individuals, business customers can now choose between a number of parcels distributors in Sweden.</p>
<p>Previously, parcel distribution between consumers was only provided by Posten. However, in 2008, Schenker Privpak and DHL opened their agent network for distribution between consumers.</p>
<h2>Swedish legislation The Postal Services Act</h2>
<p>The rules on postal operations and the universal postal service are contained in the Postal Services Act. The Postal Services Act is intended to establish the basis for the extent of postal services that are to be provided to the public and to enable the state to monitor activities in an open market for postal operations so as to enable compliance with the political goals for the postal service. This law stipulates certain key provisions for postal operations justified by protection of personal integrity. The law further aims to create the prerequisites for neutrality in competition and improved joint usage of the postal infrastructure and thus also greater simplicity for the postal customer.</p>
<p>The overall objective of postal policy is stated in section 1 of the Postal Services Act stipulating that there shall be a nationwide postal service where everyone is able to receive letters and other kinds of addressed mail items weighing less than 20 kilograms. It shall also be possible for everybody to have such items delivered at reasonable prices. Furthermore, single letters shall be delivered at uniform prices. It shall be possible to insure mail and to receive a receipt from the addressee confirming the receipt of the item.</p>
<h2>Other legislation</h2>
<p>Other legislation is also applicable to postal operations. One such example is the Competition Act (2008:579) which is a general law that applies to all sectors of society, including the postal sector. This law is intended to remove and counteract barriers to effective competition in production and trade of goods, services and other utilities. The Act is intended to provide general protection for the economy, consumers and competing companies.</p>
<p>Organisations that engage in operations in the postal sphere are covered by the Act (2007:1092) on Procurement within the Energy, Transport and Postal Services Sectors, also referred to as the ”Utilities Procurement Act”. Procurement of actors in the postal sphere and procurement of postal services by authorities and other public bodies is accorded regulated by the Utilities Procurement Act and by the Procurement Directive 2004/17/EC.</p>
<h2>The Postal Services Directive</h2>
<p>Within the European Union, there has been a postal services directive since 1997. This Directive was amended in 2002. A directive with additional amendments was adopted on 20 February 2008, to be implemented in Sweden and most other Member States by 31 December 2010.</p>
<p>The 1997 Postal Services Directive aimed to introduce harmonised provisions for universal post services (universal services) and to improve the quality of the postal service in the internal market. This Directive contains measures to guarantee universal post services. The Directive also aims to ensure the gradual and controlled liberalisation of the market.</p>
<p>The 2008 Postal Services Directive is intended to develop an internal market for postal services. This means that special or exclusive rights are abolished within the postal sector, that all users in EU Member States are guaranteed universal services at the same level and that harmonised principles are established for regulation of postal services on an open market to remove all barriers to the functioning of the internal market.</p>
<h2>The universal postal service</h2>
<p>The universal service is an expression of the state’s undertaking in the postal sphere. The intention is to ensure that everyone throughout Sweden has access to certain basis services of societal interest. The extent and quality of these services is ultimately determined by the Postal Services Directive.</p>
<p>The majority of the authorities, companies and organisations we have consulted have been opposed to changes in the universal postal service and have instead underlined the importance of retaining an unchanged extent and quality. We cannot find any reason for changing the state’s undertaking in the postal sphere. We therefore consider that the universal postal service should have the same extent and guarantee citizens a service of the same quality as at present. There should accordingly still be a postal service throughout the whole of Sweden making it possible for everyone to receive letters and other addressed items weighing at most 20 kg. It should also be possible to insure mail items and receive a receipt from the recipient that the item has been received. At least 85 per cent of mail items handed in for overnight conveyance shall have been delivered by the following working day and 97 per cent within three working days.</p>
<h2>Measures by the state to guarantee the universal service</h2>
<p>Posten has been designated to provide the universal postal service in Sweden. No payment is made by the state for this task. Within the framework of our assignment, we have considered the possibility of making our own calculation for the net cost of the universal service. In the light of the practically unanimous view that emerged during the consultation process with the companies, authorities and organisations concerned that it does not currently entail any net cost for Posten to provide the universal postal service and the weaknesses associated with a calculation of this kind, we have, however, decided not to make any such calculation.</p>
<p>Posten maintains a level of quality in the nationwide network that exceeds by a broad margin the objectives imposed on the company in its capacity of provider of the universal postal service. In these circumstances and in the light of the statements made by Posten concerning the need for funding, we consider that there is not at present any need for special funding for the universal postal service.</p>
<p>It should primarily be left to the market to meet the need for universal services. However, the licensing authority may when it considers that the market is not meeting the whole or parts of the universal postal service attach conditions to the licence to conduct postal operations on the obligation to provide a universal postal service.</p>
<p>There is no provision in Swedish postal services legislation for paying financial compensation to the operators obliged to provide the universal service. The Postal Services Act does not contain any limitation on the burden that the universal postal service may entail. It cannot be excluded that the changes in the market in the future may mean that it will become a financial burden to provide a universal postal service. In these circumstances, it would be reasonable for the state to pay some form of compensation for providing the universal service. We therefore propose that the universal postal service should be procured, if there is a special need to do so taking into consideration the costs of providing the service.</p>
<h2>Articles 12 and 14 of the Postal Services Directive -  Tariff Principles and Transparency of Accounts</h2>
<p>We consider that the requirements of the Postal Services Act are in full compliance with Article 12 of the 2002 Postal Services Directive, which was also the conclusion arrived at by the Postal and Cashier Services Committee. However, the wording of Article 12 has been changed through the 2008 Postal Services Directive and the Postal Services Act should reflect this. We therefore suggest that the universal postal service should be provided at cost-oriented prices which promote effective use of the service.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the deregulation of the postal market, its development and the fact that the import of the prohibition in competitive legislation against abuse of a predominant position is not sufficiently clear, we consider that Article 12 of the Directive should be implemented in the Postal Services Act in a clearer way. We therefore propose that the Postal Services Act should explicitly state that pricing of the universal postal service should be transparent and non-discriminatory and provided at cost-oriented prices. The provider designated to provide the universal postal service shall apply the principles of transparency and non-discrimination both with regard to the tariffs and to the associated conditions for users. Prices and other conditions shall apply equally in relation to different users.</p>
<p>We further propose that the provider designated to provide the universal postal service through licensing conditions shall have special accounts in its internal accounts to clearly distinguish between services and products included in the universal service and those not included. The other parts of the internal accounts shall also be arranged in accordance with the 2008 Postal Services Directive. The licensing authority shall be able to decide that the above requirements on the accounts need not be applied if the prerequisites specified in Article 14.8 exist.</p>
<h2>Postal infrastructure</h2>
<p>It should be possible for other postal operators than the operator managing the postcode system to request changes in the postcode system. The licensing authority may decide that a requested change be implemented if special reasons exist. Before deciding on a change, the licensing authority shall consult the operator administering the postal code system, other licensees, authorities responsible for population registration and the property register and the municipalities concerned.</p>
<p>There are no rules in the Postal Services Act on access to the networks of other operators. The Postal and Cashier Services Committee noted that no requests or demands had been put forward in this respect in Sweden. However, the needs of postal operators and other companies to obtain access to some part or parts of another operator’s chain of distribution may be important for development and to increase diversity in the postal market. Further consideration should therefore be given to this issue in the form of an assignment for the Post and Telecom Agency.</p>
<h2>Dealing with complaints</h2>
<p>We consider that the postal operators’ procedures for dealing with complaints and supervision by the Post and Telecom Agency comply with the demands made in the Postal Services Directive. Sweden complies with the requirement for encouraging the development of independent out-of-court schemes for the resolution of disputes provided for in Article 19.1, third paragraph, of the 2008 Postal Services Directive through the possibility of having consumer disputes considered out-of-court by the National Board for Consumer Complaints.</p>
<p>The provision on complaint procedures and publication of information on the number of complaints and how these were dealt with is moved to the general requirements that may be made on postal operations in the Postal Services Act in order to implement Article 19 of the 2008 Postal Services Directive.</p>
<p>The rules of the Postal Services Act on responsibility in post conveyance and the application of these rules by the postal operators in the internal complaints procedures mean that Sweden complies with the requirements of the Postal Services Directive that Member States should ensure, within the framework of the postal operators complaints procedure, that possibilities exist, when justified, for compensating postal users in connection with loss, theft or damage or when quality norms are not complied with.</p>
<p>Consumers’ knowledge about their rights is in general at a low level in the postal sphere. The Post and Telecom Agency should therefore be given the task of working for the operators providing clearer information about what users should do to safeguard their rights.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>The current Postal Services Act is to be replaced by a completely new Act with the same name. The new law starts with provisions stating the content of the Act and important definitions for its application. This is followed by provisions on postal operations in general followed by provisions that only regulate the universal postal service. The Act concludes with common provisions. It is proposed that the Act come into force on 1 July 2010.</p>
<p>Our proposals mean that the Postal and Telecommunications Board will to some extent have new tasks. However, we consider that this can be dealt with within the framework of the current charge financing. The proposals we are making in this report do not have any other consequences that require separate state funding.</p>
<p>All in all, our proposals will strengthen the position of the smaller postal operators in the market. From the perspective of the users, our proposals mean that the universal postal service will be guaranteed and that the prerequisites for competition in the market will be improved.</p>
