<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The assignment of the Debt Relief Inquiry has been to evaluate and review the 1994 Debt Relief Act. The evaluation has focused primarily on procedures in debt relief cases. The Inquiry has concluded that the present system for debt relief is unnecessarily complicated, which has led to procedures that are protracted and convoluted. The aim of the Inquiry has been to make debt relief procedures simpler and more efficient. The proposals presented by the Inquiry entail very considerable changes from the present procedures.</p>
<p>In addition to a number of changes in the Debt Relief Act (1994:334), the Inquiry proposes that certain changes should be made in the Income Tax Act (1999:1229), e.g. to facilitate the redemption of a pension policy, and in the Act concerning Composition of Accounts Receivable by the State (1993:892) to make it easier to obtain decisions on relief for public debts.</p>
<p>Main points of the proposal</p>
<p>• Personal attempt</p>
<p>The “personal attempt” requirement for debt relief will be removed. This means that a debtor will not need to have made a personal attempt to bring about a voluntary settlement with his creditors before being able to apply for debt relief.</p>
<p>• Role of the municipality</p>
<p>Municipal budgetary and debt counselling services are given a weightier role in that the debtor will receive counselling and support not only when applying for debt relief but also after a decision on debt</p>
<p>relief has been pronounced. Scope will be made available for this important task by freeing up the considerable resources that municipal advisers have devoted to helping debtors with their personal attempt.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Consumer Agency</p>
<p>The Swedish Consumer Agency shall be the central authority responsible for coordinating municipal budgetary and debt counselling services. This role includes a responsibility for training and computer support. Furthermore, the Swedish Consumer Agency shall follow up and further develop its own activities and assist the municipalities in their activities by providing information and advice. An additional task should be to encourage municipalities to cooperate with one another on debt relief.</p>
<p>• Role of the Enforcement Service</p>
<p>The Enforcement Service shall have full responsibility for examining applications for debt relief. This means that even if one or more creditors is opposed to the proposal for debt relief that is put to them, the Enforcement Service can still pronounce a decision on debt relief. Thus, the case will no longer be turned over to the district court.</p>
<p>• Role of the district court</p>
<p>Appeals against decisions by the Enforcement Service can be lodged with the district court. Limiting the role of the court exclusively to hearing appeals is in line with the general ambition that has existed for some time to streamline the role of both courts and judges. This streamlining entails that rather than conducting investigations of their own to any great extent, judges will simply examine the petitions brought and evidence adduced by an applicant or a party in a case or other matter. In cases where a matter has been turned over to the district court, it has very rarely occurred that a creditor who has opposed debt relief has cited grounds for his position. The expected effect of limiting the role of the district court to hearing appeals is that the appellant will then adduce grounds for his appeal.</p>
<p>• Payment plan</p>
<p>A payment plan shall never be allowed to run for a period lasting more than five years. If there are special grounds for doing so, it shall be possible to limit the plan to a shorter period. The present option of setting a period other than five years for a payment plan in the event of special grounds has very rarely been used. Taking into account the different interests that come into play in a case of debt relief and in order to ensure that the debt relief system will continue to live up to the requirement that it is to the advantage of creditors, the Inquiry is of the opinion that it is absolutely necessary to retain the present arrangement of a five-year payment plan in the great majority of debt relief cases.</p>
<p>The possibility shall exist of extending the payment plan to a maximum of seven years after reconsideration. In the main this shall be done when it is noticed after the initial decision that for a certain period of time, the debtor has had a considerably higher capacity to pay than was presumed at the time when the decision on debt relief was made.</p>
<p>The payment plan will normally run from the time that an initiating decision is made (initiating decision). This will enable the process of debt relief to get underway at a considerably earlier point than is now the case, when the payment plan cannot begin to run before a final decision on debt relief has gained legal force.</p>
<p>• Collecting account</p>
<p>In connection with an initiating decision being made, in the great majority of cases the debtor is required to open a bank account, or similar account, which in the Act is termed a “collecting account”. The Enforcement Service will decide at the same time how much the debtor must pay into the account each month.</p>
<p>• Annual payment to creditors</p>
<p>Payment to creditors shall be made once a year via the collecting account. This arrangement will reduce the quite considerable costs incurred by both the debtor and creditors in connection with monthly payments of relatively small amounts by the debtor.</p>
<p>• Petty debts</p>
<p>The option of allowing creditors who are owed relatively small amounts to be paid in full will be eliminated. The Inquiry has taken the view that it is unreasonable that a creditor who is owed, for example, SEK 700 is paid in full while a creditor who has a claim for SEK 5 000 will receive less than SEK 500 in all those cases where the amount the debtor is required to pay is less than ten per cent of the total debt. Here the Inquiry has taken into account the fact that repayment rates this low are very common.</p>
<p>• The general reasonableness condition</p>
<p>In line with the proposal made by the Council on Legislation in connection with the drafting of the Debt Relief Act in 1994, the Inquiry has chosen to reformulate the general reasonableness condition to state that a person who is confirmed to be insolvent shall obtain debt relief if this is not unreasonable. In doing this, the Inquiry has desired to emphasise still more clearly than previously that the examination of the case must comprise an overall assessment of the debtor’s personal and financial circumstances. This means that an isolated circumstance shall not inevitably lead to the application being rejected if all other circumstances strongly indicate that the debtor should obtain debt relief.</p>
<p>• Reconsideration</p>
<p>Applications for reconsideration shall also be examined by the Enforcement Service, with a possibility of appealing the decision to the district court.</p>
<p>When a creditor applies for reconsideration on account of the debtor’s failure to pay, it shall not only be possible to cancel</p>
<p>the debt relief but also to modify the debt relief decision. It has often emerged in connection with such reconsideration that the reason why the debtor has missed payments is that his financial situation has deteriorated. If the debtor himself has not applied for reconsideration, which would have led to modification of the payment plan, there should be nothing to prevent the enforcement service from modifying the plan upon application from a creditor instead. This will give the debtor a genuine possibility of following a new payment plan.</p>
<p>A debtor shall also be entitled to apply for reconsideration if his financial circumstances have improved. By this means, the debtor can avoid an extension of the payment plan in connection with a creditor much later learning about the change of circumstances and therefore applying for reconsideration.</p>
<p>• Enforceability</p>
<p>One natural consequence of the Inquiry’s proposal that the payment plan shall begin to run when debt relief is initiated and that payment shall be made to the creditors once a year via a collecting account is that a decision on debt relief should come into effect immediately.</p>
<p>• Pension policies and pension savings accounts</p>
<p>The Income Tax Act shall be amended to make it clear when it shall be possible to redeem a pension policy and when it shall be possible to close a pension savings account with an early disbursement. This shall be possible if the policy-holder or pension saver (debtor) is insolvent and a redemption of the policy or disbursement from the savings account is essential in order to allow the debtor to reach a voluntary agreement with his creditors or to be granted debt relief.</p>
