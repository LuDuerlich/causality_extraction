<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The committee’s assignment</h2>
<p>The committee’s assignment has been to consider the statutory changes and other measures necessary to allow voluntary recruitment and training of the personnel currently serving in accordance with the Swedish Total Defence Service Act (1994:1809). The committee shall also adopt a position regarding the circumstances under which voluntary recruitment and training should be applied. The directive stresses that ultimately the tasks of the military and civil defence establishments during conditions of raised preparedness shall determine the design of personnel supply and legislation. Consequently, some form of total defence duty should also be maintained in the future. The committee shall adopt a position regarding the circumstances under which the duty system should be brought into use.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the committee shall consider whether the obligation to complete military or civilian service with extended training should also apply to women. The assignment has also included adopting a position regarding how a new military personnel supply system should be introduced in accordance with the objective of commencing the process of reforming the supply of military personnel on 1 July 2010. Specific proposals are to be submitted regarding what should apply for individuals directly affected by the reform ahead of, and in conjunction with, its implementation. The consequences for the Swedish Armed Forces’ capacity ahead of, during and immediately following implementation shall be elucidated.</p>
<p>The government adopted its first directive to the committee on 6 December 2007. Subsequently, the government adopted supplementary directives on 29 January and 23 April 2009. The committee has adopted the name “Total Defence Service Commission”.</p>
<p>The committee has consisted of a chairman, representatives of all Riksdag parties, technical advisors and experts. In its work, the committee has been assisted by a secretariat. The secretariat has prepared specific issues in working groups consisting of representatives of authorities and special interest organisations. On several issues, efforts were also coordinated with relevant units within the Swedish Armed Forces and other authorities. Study visits have been made to Denmark and the Netherlands with the purpose of studying the systems of military personnel supply in those countries. Several study visits have been made to the Swedish Defence Forces’ training facilities. In the course of this work, two external consultants have assisted the committee’s efforts.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>National total defence service comprises national military service, civilian service and general compulsory national service. National military service and civilian service consist of basic military training, compulsory military refresher courses, emergency service duty and active service. Previously, national military service, civilian service and general compulsory national service were regulated by separate acts. Since 1995, however, all three forms of service have been covered by the National Total Defence Service Act.</p>
<p>Under the National Total Defence Service Act, individuals are obliged to participate in the prescribed survey of personal circumstances, to serve in the national total defence to the extent permitted by their physical capacity and health and to observe the regulations otherwise stipulated in the National Total Defence Service Act. To participate in the prescribed survey of their personal circumstances, Swedish men are required to undergo registration. No one is obliged to complete national military service or civilian service without first having been enlisted for that.</p>
<p>General national military service was introduced in 1901. Since then, the system has undergone a large number of sweeping changes. However, the purpose of national military service has always been the same: to secure the Swedish Armed Forces’ personnel supply. On the basis of national military service, it has been possible to call people up for basic training and refresher courses and to then post them in the case of war or to call them up for emergency duty or active service. In accordance with the current National Total Defence Service Act, all Swedish men are liable for national military service from the age of 19 until they turn 47. Women may apply to participate in military service. To be enlisted for national military service, men must have first registered and women must have first undergone a voluntary enlistment examination.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, civilian service was introduced as a complement to national military service. The purpose of civilian service has been to secure the supply of personnel within the civilian defence. In its design, civilian service corresponds to national military service in that it allows those liable for national total defence service to undergo basic training and be assigned postings in peacetime and to subsequently be called up for active or emergency service duty as needed. However, civilian service need not commence with basic training. With regard to civilian service with basic training, a distinction is made, in accordance with the Swedish Total Defence Service Act, between civilian service with basic training of less or more than 60 days. For enlistment to civilian service with more than 60 days of basic training, individuals must complete registration or special enlistment examination. Enlistment to civilian service with basic training of less than 60 days is also possible following another form of examination. The same applies to enlistment to civilian service without basic training.</p>
<p>General compulsory national service differs from national military service and civilian service in being applicable only in states of raised preparedness. Nor shall any basic training take place within the framework of general compulsory national service.</p>
<p>Extensive basic training of conscripts and civilian service personnel has necessitated a well developed examination and registration system. These activities are currently safeguarded by the National Total Defence Service’s service administration (hereafter referred to as the National Service Administration). To assess their capacity to complete military or civilian service, all individuals required to complete national service must undergo the prescribed examination of their personal circumstances. Such examination may involve enlistment examination or another form of examination. The obligation to undergo enlistment examination applies only to Swedish men. Enlistment examination is conducted by the National Service Administration. Since 2007, this examination and registration have been preceded by a suitability survey that is distributed to all Swedes during the year in which they reach the age of 17. Women are not obliged to respond to the questions in the suitability survey. Based on the responses to the suitability survey, the National Service Administration then summons the most suitable men for examination and registration. The number of people enlisted in national military or civilian service during a particular year is determined on the basis of the personnel needs reported to the National Service Administration by the authorities responsible for staffing. In accordance with the National Total Defence Service Act, the number of people enlisted to military and civilian service shall correspond to that required by the Swedish Armed Forces and the civilian defence in the event of war and for the peacetime preparedness of the Swedish Armed Forces. Today, there is no enlistment to civilian service with basic training exceeding 60 days.</p>
<p>Women may apply to undergo a special admission examination procedure equivalent to the compulsory examination and registration for men. After undergoing special admission examination, women, can, if they consent, be enlisted to military or civilian service with basic training exceeding 60 days.</p>
<p>Since the National Total Defence Service Act was passed in 1995, its application has undergone several changes. The number of people enlisted to military or civilian service with extended basic training has declined from 32,547 in 1996 to 4,834 in 2007. Extended training for those liable for civilian service ceased completely during 2008. Furthermore, the share of men summoned for examination and registration has declined considerably between 2007 and 2008. This is attributable to the web-based suitability survey that now precedes the registration summons. This meant it was necessary to summon only 16,803 men for registration in 2007, compared with 41,720 the previous year. The number of people charged for infraction of the national total defence service obligation also declined from 156 in 2004 to 88 in 2007.</p>
<h2>Analysis of the current system</h2>
<p>As currently applied, the National Total Defence Service obligation is more than sufficient to secure personnel for military units. Since the number of units has decreased substantially in recent years, military unit personnel can also be replaced relatively quickly. However, considering all of the tasks of the Swedish Armed Forces and their combined personnel needs, the current system displays a number of shortcomings. Units staffed by posted conscripts cannot be fully utilised unless personnel are called in for emergency or active service. The immediate accessibility of the units is therefore low. Nor can posted conscripts be used in the Swedish Armed Forces’ international operations on the basis of the National Total Defence Service obligation. This has resulted in the development of two parallel units structures within the Swedish Armed Forces. Conscripts are selected, trained and undergo joint exercises to be placed in military units in the event of war. On the other hand, units abroad and the Swedish Armed Forces’ emergency units consist of voluntarily recruited personnel. Consequently, conscripts deployed internationally following completion of basic training have first participated in joint exercises in a military unit and subsequently in an international operations unit.</p>
<p>Having two parallel systems of units impedes the Swedish Armed Forces’ opportunities for effective personnel planning. These difficulties are compounded by the fact that conscripts’ basic training focuses almost exclusively on the needs of military units. The operations of the forces abroad and emergency units must be planned on this basis. In reality, the two different unit structures must also often share materiel and training resources. This causes extensive strain on the training organisation. At certain units, resources must be taken from conscript training in order to meet the needs of the international operations. Not only does this result in inadequate practice for military units but also in negative attitudes among the conscripts who are affected. In addition to the above-mentioned difficulties, there is the issue of having particular individuals posted in two different units. If one unit is deployed, the individual concerned cannot, at the same time, be active in the other.</p>
<p>The current system also suffers from problems of excessive lead times. Today, the National Service Administration enlists conscripts to relatively specific posts within the Swedish Armed Forces. Six to 24 months pass between enlistment and the commencement of basic training. During this time, the Swedish Armed Forces’ personnel needs may have changed. In such cases, the post to which the recruit is enlisted must be changed, which impedes training planning and results in dissatisfaction among the recruits affected.</p>
<p>Conscripts who have completed basic training constitute the recruitment base for the Swedish Armed Forces’ international operations, for its professional officer corps and for the Home Guard. Consequently, the number of conscripts must be large enough to provide a sufficient recruitment base for these activities. To a sufficient extent, recruits undergoing basic training must also elect to continue within the Swedish Armed Forces.</p>
<p>The number of conscripts selected for basic training is currently relatively small. The number selected is linked to the needs of the military units and cannot be adjusted in accordance with the personnel needs of the Swedish Armed Forces as a whole. The number of conscripts completing basic training may therefore continue to decline even though ambitions may increase, for example, regarding international operations.</p>
<p>Today, conscripts’ willingness to remain within the Swedish Armed Forces after completing their basic training is relatively low. There are probably several reasons for this. In the current system, the individual’s attitude towards service does not achieve full impact, despite the fact that, in the committee’s view, the National Service Administration allows the individual’s attitude to have the greatest possible impact permitted by current legislation. The relatively long period between enlistment and the commencement of basic training also gives people time to change their level of commitment to the Swedish Armed Forces. Furthermore, the quality of the training affects the individual’s view of the Swedish Armed Forces as an employer and willingness for continued commitment. Changed posts, long lead times and shortcomings in training stemming from an overextended training organisation are key influences in this regard. Due to shortcomings in training, certain groups of conscripts, particularly conscript guardsmen, have also proven especially difficult to recruit to continued service within the Swedish Armed Forces.</p>
<p>The committee has also concluded that the current system has been unable to recruit a sufficient number of women to the Swedish Armed Forces. On several occasions, the Riksdag and the government have underscored how important it is that the share of women within the Swedish Armed Forces increases. This applies to conscripts, officers, the share of women in forces abroad and in the Home Guard. Of the approximately 5,250 people enlisted to military or civilian service in 2007 with basic training exceeding 60 days, about 400 were women. The share of professional officers who are women is approximately 4.5 percent. In the Home Guard, women represent 15 percent of personnel. The proportion of women in the forces abroad and in emergency units remains low.</p>
<p>There are probably several reasons why the Swedish Armed Forces have not succeeded in recruiting more women. However, in the committee’s view, the foremost reason is the distinction between men and women made by the current system. As long as this differentiation persists, it will be difficult to fully attain the set targets when it comes to increasing the number of women in the armed forces. Since conscripts who complete basic training form the principal recruitment base for the professional officer corps, the Home Guard and personnel for forces abroad and emergency units, the small proportion of women completing military service also has an effect on these parts of the organisation. Nor does the current system make use of the interest displayed by women who want to do military service. Of the slightly more than 1,500 women who applied for special admission examination in 2007, only 365 were enlisted for basic training.</p>
<p>From the analyses that have been made, the committee concludes that the national total defence service obligation, as it is currently designed and applied, risks proving inadequate as a recruitment base for military personnel for all of the Swedish Armed Forces’ tasks, the Home Guard and the professional officer corps. The system is also burdened by inherent shortcomings in efficiency, while the two parallel systems of units impedes personnel planning. The committee also finds reason to question the suitability of calling young people up for service under the threat of legal repercussions when the national defence’s need for military personnel is so limited.</p>
<h2>Future obligation to complete military or civilian service</h2>
<p>The committee proposes that the obligation for total defence conscripts to complete military or civilian service be made conditional upon this being prescribed by the government for reasons of defence preparedness. In such events, the supply of military personnel for the Swedish Armed Forces is to be secured, to the extent defence preparedness allows, independently of military service regulations. The Swedish Total Defence Service Act should, however, be retained for full implementation if necessary. The government is also granted extensive scope in its assessment of when this is necessary. No formal circumstances, such as raised levels of preparedness, are required for the obligation to complete military or civilian service to be reinstated.</p>
<p>According to the committee, it is not possible to foresee the circumstances under which it would be necessary to bring the national service system into use. Nor is it possible to forecast what the personnel needs would be in such a situation. However, the committee finds it entirely unrealistic that gender should be a decisive factor. If it becomes necessary to reinstate the national service system, the authorities responsible must be afforded the greatest freedom of action in calling up the individuals best suited for service. The committee therefore proposes that, when activated, the obligation to complete military or civilian service with extended training should also apply to women.</p>
<p>The committee also proposes that, if necessary, it should be possible to call up voluntarily recruited and trained military personnel and that these individuals shall be obliged to comply. This is necessary to be able to secure the Total Defence’s longterm personnel needs in the event of, for example, a change in Sweden’s security status. However, even in the future, no one shall be obliged to complete national military service without first having been enlisted for that. To complete emergency or military service, total defence conscripts must also have been assigned a wartime posting. Consequently the committee proposes that it should be possible to enlist for military service total defence conscripts who have completed other military training or service than that stipulated by the Swedish Total Defence Service Act, that for this group, military service need not commence with basic training and that it shall be possible to assign to a certain post or operation those who, through voluntary military training or service, have acquired sufficient knowledge and skills for war assignments. The committee also proposes that enlistment to military service without basic training shall be possible without the individual first undergoing registration and examination, since a sufficient basis for assessment will be available from the individual’s service in the Armed Forces.</p>
<h2>The future obligation to participate in the prescribed survey of personal circumstances</h2>
<p>The committee proposes that the obligation for total defence conscripts to undergo registration and examination, as well as the obligation to complete military or civilian service, be made conditional upon this being prescribed by the government for reasons of defence preparedness. When applied, the obligation to undergo registration and examination shall apply to both men and women.</p>
<p>According to the committee, the regulations regarding the obligation to participate in other examinations should apply on all occasions. When other parts of the national service system are not in use, the application of the regulations regarding other examinations should be based on the web-based survey currently preceding registration and examination that is administrated by the National Service Administration. If other parts of the national service system are to be brought into use, it may be necessary to do this rapidly. By imposing a continuous duty to report on total defence conscripts, there will always be a sufficient base of information regarding which total defence conscripts are most suitable to call up for examination when needed. This guarantees that the national service system can be brought into use at short notice. At the same time, since the collection of this information does not require personal attendance, this also entails the least possible disruption for the individual.</p>
<h2>Authority responsible for voluntary recruitment, examination and call-up</h2>
<p>The committee proposes that the Swedish Armed Forces be principally responsible for recruitment of military and naval personnel. This principal responsibility also includes responsibility for marketing, selection and recruitment. The Swedish Armed Forces shall also determine what tests should precede voluntary military training. The proposal entails the responsibility for the supply of personnel for military defence being focused on one authority rather than being divided between the Armed Forces and the National Service Administration as it is today.</p>
<p>Over a transitional period of five to ten years, the Swedish Armed Forces should be obliged to purchase from the National</p>
<p>Service Administration the tests that must precede the selection of individuals for acceptance to basic military training. This arrangement should subsequently be evaluated.</p>
<h2>Voluntary military training</h2>
<p>The committee’s proposal entails the regulations regarding the obligation to complete military or civilian service not being applied more than the government prescribes. The recruitment and training of personnel currently serving in accordance with the National Total Defence Service Act shall instead take place on a voluntary basis. According to its directive, the committee shall consider how such training should be designed with regard to remuneration and other benefits, disciplinary liability and opportunities to discontinue service. If the obligation to complete military or civilian service is not applied, it will be necessary for the current obligatory training of military and naval personnel to be replaced by voluntary military training. According to the committee’s assessment there is no need to introduce equivalent voluntary training in the area of civilian defence.</p>
<p>The committee proposes that new, quality-assured basic training, common to all of the Armed Forces, be introduced under the auspices of the Swedish Armed Forces. The training programme would be about three months long and would, to all intents and purposes, form the point of departure for all forms of voluntary military commitment in the Swedish Armed Forces. This would ensure that all military personnel within the Armed Forces have the same basic military skills. Shorter basic military training common to all of the Armed Forces would also facilitate recruitment to the Home Guard and would provides individuals interested in the Armed Forces an opportunity to try military training without committing to a more extended period. Individuals undergoing training would be termed recruits .</p>
<p>According to the committee, training would be associated with a benefit and not conducted as a form of employment. An extended continued commitment within the Swedish Armed Forces in the form of employment or contracting would not commence until after basic military training.</p>
<p>To be accepted to basic military training, an individual must be 18 years or older and a Swedish citizen. The Swedish Armed Forces may prescribe additional enlistment requirements. The Armed Forces have announced that all posts held by recruits will be assigned security classifications. Consequently, those whom the Defence Forces intend to enlist for training will also need to undergo security testing.</p>
<p>To ensure that those admitted to training are suited to this and to avoid injuries among trainees, training is to be preceded by physical, medical and psychological tests. It is proposed that enlistment decisions be made at a central level within the Armed Forces, regardless or where within the Armed Forces the individual is to be trained.</p>
<p>Since basic military training is to be common to all of the Armed Forces, the training objectives should be uniform for all branches of the Armed Forces. During training, recruits shall only be required to carry out tasks directly linked to the training objectives. On completion of training, an assessment shall be made as to whether or not the recruit has fulfilled the training objectives. To guarantee the quality assessment of the training, there should be a training inspector responsible for this.</p>
<p>Military training programmes impose specific requirements on individuals. For this reason, the Swedish Armed Forces should have the possibility to dismiss anyone who proves unsuitable for continued training or who is absent to such an extent that it can be assumed that he or she will not be able to profit by the training. At the same time, recruits should also be able to discontinue training at any time. During training, recruits should be subject to the regulations included in the legislation pertaining to disciplinary responsibility in total defence, etc. (1994:1811).</p>
<p>Following an individual’s completion of basic military training, it shall be determined whether he/she has passed the training or not. The committee proposes that the Swedish Armed Forces develop targets and methods for how this should be achieved.</p>
<p>In addition to basic military training, the committee proposes that supplementary military training be established. This is intended to permit the continued training of military personnel, with benefits, for a short period following completed basic military training. This may be necessary to provide, among other things, certain functional training for individuals subsequently applying to officer training. Conditions and benefits for recruits during supplementary military training should largely correspond to those applicable during basic military training.</p>
<p>Specifics regarding recruits’ conditions and benefits during training</p>
<p>Applying and being accepted to basic military training provides no guarantee that the individual can subsequently be offered a continued position within the Armed Forces. The committee has taken this into account, striving to offer conditions that will increase the attractiveness of training without being excessively expensive. For example, it is proposed that recruits’ civilian jobs be subject to the same protection currently applicable to national service conscripts. Nor should recruits be legally disadvantaged in terms of unemployment insurance. In the same spirit of enhancing attractiveness, the Swedish Armed Forces should be assigned the task of regulating the length of training weeks and how and when leave can be approved. In addition, the committee proposes that the income level on which sickness benefit is based shall be safeguarded during the period that the recruit is undergoing training, in accordance with the ordinance proposed by the committee. Furthermore, recruits should be given the opportunity to have the income level on which sickness benefit is based determined on the basis of any additional work performed alongside their training.</p>
<p>Given the nature of the training as associated with certain risks, the committee finds it self-evident that recruits be covered by the same occupational life insurance, regulations regarding national risk guarantee, national personal injury protection, etc. as for total defence conscripts completing military or civilian service.</p>
<p>With regard to financial remuneration to recruits, the committee has made comparisons with current total defence conscripts and officer candidates and has found there to be scope for changes that would likely have a favourable effect on the attractiveness of basic military training. The proposals entail a monthly compensation being paid to those who undergo basic military training. This monthly compensation should combine the daily remuneration, compensation for meals and training premium currently paid to total defence conscripts. It is proposed that the Swedish Defence Forces be permitted to determine the scope of monthly compensation to recruits. Recruits in training shall also be entitled to free meals and lodging, as well as the clothes and equipment associated with the training. Compensation and any fringe benefits received by recruits during training shall be exempt from taxation. By reallocating resources from significant cost items under the current system – such as travel costs for home leave and provisions for future pensions – greater scope can be achieved for raised compensation levels. Beyond these general remunerations, recruits should be afforded the same opportunities as today’s total defence conscripts to apply for needs-tested family allowances.</p>
<p>Specifics regarding co-determination for recruits</p>
<p>Similarly to the current system, opportunities for recruits to influence their situation at the local level should exist through opportunities to elect representatives who can express the opinions of the group. In connection with this, each unit shall have personnel responsible for recruits’ co-determination. Such personnel shall coordinate co-determination efforts and form a link between recruits and unit leadership. They shall also train elected representatives and recruits in co-determination. Training in how codetermination works and the rights of recruits shall be included in training objectives and implemented by specially assigned personnel during the initial stages of training. Continued network efforts for and by women shall exist at all levels.</p>
<p>Applying the current model of co-determination at the central level is more complicated. It would be difficult to establish an equivalent to the current Conscript Council. Nonetheless, continuous monitoring of recruits’ co-determination opportunities must be safeguarded. Consequently, the committee proposes that a board be established to review the treatment of recruits and their opportunities for co-determination. The board should be able to act on its own initiative in conducting investigations and should have the capacity to conduct ongoing visits to units. The board should have its own secretariat. The board should also include a special appeals function for recruits who have not passed their basic military training.</p>
<p>Since no total defence conscripts will be undergoing military service, the Värnpliktsnytt magazine should be phased out. This should be replaced by a journalistic publication with the task of monitoring and reporting on operations throughout the defence area. The publication should be independent from the authorities it is charged with monitoring. The magazine’s purview should include the Swedish Armed Forces and other players in military and civilian defence. The task of financing the magazine should be given to the Swedish Armed Forces and the Swedish Civil Contingencies</p>
<p>Agency.</p>
<h2>Principles of recruitment</h2>
<p>The committee presents no detailed proposals as to how the Swedish Armed Forces should conduct their recruitment operations. Marketing efforts and recruitment methods must be continuously evaluated and developed to achieve the desired effect. However, the committee does emphasise a number of general principles with regard to recruitment to basic military training. One of the most central is the fact that the Armed Forces’ attractiveness primarily lies in factors other than marketing campaigns. The authority must appear to be – and in fact be – an attractive employer, requiring favourable conditions for those serving within the authority, paths for individual development both within and outside the authority, and confidence in the operations of the Swedish Armed Forces.</p>
<p>It is important that the Armed Forces have information about the groups targeted by marketing. It is not possible to state precisely who these groups are on each occasion. However, three groups can be discerned. The first consists of individuals with an interest in the Armed Forces but who have not decided whether they really want to commit to operations in the longer term. The second consists of those who already in advance have a greater conviction in their interest in certain specific posts or continued training tracks within the Armed Forces. A third specific group probably consists of those who are interested in a commitment within the Home Guard or national defence forces. The Swedish Armed Forces should adapt its marketing to the interests of various target groups.</p>
<p>To meet its personnel requirements, the Swedish Armed Forces must each year reach about 18,000 individuals who are willing to apply for basic military training and undergo subsequent testing. The Armed Forces should develop methods by which the number of people who must undergo testing is reduced in comparison with the number who can be enlisted for training. However, increasing the efficiency of testing and selection operations should not entail reducing the scope of the testing procedures. Potential efficiency improvements must be achieved in other ways. The Armed Forces should also carefully consider cooperating with other players, such as authorities, volunteer organisations and other special interest organisations, to attract competent individuals to basic military training.</p>
<h2>Principles for information, public support and the Swedish Armed Forces’ future public communications</h2>
<p>Studies show a declining trend regarding public awareness on security and total defence issues, despite information efforts being conducted by several players. According to the committee, it is crucial that the public has a good knowledge of the Armed Forces and society’s crisis preparedness and, as far as possible, has confidence in work carried out in the area.</p>
<p>To raise the level of awareness, the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency should coordinate the efforts of relevant authorities to develop and distribute information on defence and society’s crisis preparedness. Reaching out to young people with information on defence and society’s crisis preparedness is particularly important and the National Agency for Education plays an important role in this regard. The committee would also like to stress the importance of the Swedish Armed Forces being a visible part of society. In the future, the contribution of volunteer organisations will be important in engaging people in the Armed Forces and society’s crisis preparedness and in disseminating information on related issues.</p>
<p>The committee proposes that information about defence and society’s crisis preparedness shall be distributed specifically to all women and men required to participate in the examination of their personal circumstances during the year in which they turn 18. The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency shall bear the responsibility for developing this information.</p>
<h2>Future personnel reporting in total defence</h2>
<p>A prerequisite for military and civilian service being implemented as needed is that a functioning personnel reporting system be in place regarding those liable for national total defence. Centralised reporting of wartime postings must also be maintained within the Armed Forces. The committee therefore proposes that centralised personnel reporting for total defence personnel be maintained even when the obligation to complete military or civilian service and to undergo registration and examination is not being applied. In the committee’s view the National Service Administration is the only authority that can, in practice, assume responsibility for centralised personnel reporting of this kind.</p>
<p>From a total defence perspective, basic military training is one of the most important competencies an individual can have. Details of the competencies acquired by an individual through other military training or service than that supported by the total defence legislation should therefore by made available at the National Service Administration. For this reason, the committee takes the view that the Swedish Armed Forces should be required to submit requisite information on total defence conscripts who have undergone voluntary military training or service within the Armed Forces, to the National Service Administration.</p>
<h2>Implementation of transition to voluntary personnel supply</h2>
<p>In its proposal on how to conduct a reform of the military personnel supply, the committee has taken into account, among other aspects, the consequences of applied compulsory military service to voluntary training and opportunities to train smaller numbers of national service conscripts over a transitional period. However, the committee considers it unsuitable, even in a transitional phase, to maintain a hybrid system in which certain individuals are obliged to undergo training while others do so voluntarily. With regard to a transition with lower training volumes, the committee believes that the Armed Forces’ difficulties in meeting the personnel requirements of the active units would merely be postponed. Given the inherent efficiency shortcomings of the compulsory national service system, the committee believes that implementation with a single cut-off point would be more efficient than a system where conscripts are mixed with volunteers. The committee also questions the reasonableness of retaining a system in which people are required, under threat of legal repercussions, to complete service once a transition has begun to a voluntary military personnel supply system.</p>
<p>The committee proposes that, effective from 1 July 2010, no total defence conscript be required to complete military or civilian service unless so prescribed by the government. These proposals also apply to those who have been enlisted for military service, are undergoing basic training or have been called up for registration and examination on or following 1 July 2010. It should be possible, from 1 July 2010, for the proposed ordinance regarding basic military training and supplementary military training within the Armed Forces, as well as other legislation necessary for the training of recruits to enter force.</p>
<p>The implementation of the reform will affect a number of total defence conscripts. To provide opportunities for choice to those who begin their basic training as conscripts before 1 July 2010, they should be offered the opportunity to complete their training on a voluntary basis in accordance with the regulations that the committee proposes shall apply to basic and supplementary military training. The objective for the Swedish Armed Forces should be for as many conscripts as possible to complete their basic training. To meet the need of the active organisation, transitional rules should be introduced making it possible to offer a total of 11 months of voluntary training before employment or contracting commences. Equivalent transitional rules should apply to those enlisted for national service but who have not commenced their basic training before 1 July 2010.</p>
<p>During 2010, the Swedish Armed Forces should also recruit people to basic military training and conduct it in accordance with the committee’s proposals on the basis of the combined personnel requirements of the Home Guard/national defence forces (beyond the contract personnel provided by the voluntary defence organisations). This is to be facilitated by reallocations of resources within the Armed Forces. To meet their personnel needs for 2010, the Swedish Armed Forces should primarily seek to recruit personnel undergoing basic training that year, or as a second alternative, to recruit conscripts who have completed basic training in the past five years. To facilitate the transition to a new training system, the Swedish Armed Forces should immediately initiate the process of developing requirement profiles for admission to basic military training.</p>
<p>Factors such as completion rates, pace of operations, etc. affect the number of people required to commence basic military training and after completing this and further training, to be able to staff the active organisation. A key factor is the average term of employment for military personnel: shorter terms of employment entail greater recruitment needs. On the basis of data provided by the Swedish Armed Forces, information from other countries’ military personnel supply systems, etc., the committee estimates that the total annual recruitment need for basic military training will be about 6,050 individuals (at an average employment term of two years). This training volume will be necessary once it is no longer possible to recruit people formerly trained as national service conscripts. Of this required training volume, approximately 4,300 individuals are needed for standing and contracted units, while approximately 1,750 individuals are needed for the training needs of the Home Guard/national defence forces. The committee’s proposals entail that, the Swedish Armed Forces should be able to offer basic military training in 2011 for as many as 6,050 recruits. However, even in 2011, it will be necessary to supplement personnel requirements from the group that was trained as conscripts. In addition, the Armed Forces should strive to recruit individuals who have undergone basic military training and have subsequently been involved with the Home Guard/national defence forces.</p>
<p>Effective from 2012, it should be possible for the majority of those choosing to become involved with the Armed Forces to be recruited from those who have qualified following basic military training. Recruitment drives should also target individuals who have achieved military qualification but who have not chosen to become involved in the authority’s operations directly after completing their training.</p>
<p>To maintain defence preparedness, the registration and examination activities of the National Service Administration should continue until 30 June 2010. On the other hand, enlistment to military service with basic training should cease by August 2009. After that, those judged to have the prerequisites for completing military or civilian service with extended basic training should be enlisted to the training reserve. The National Service Administration should continue to collect details of all men obliged to undergo registration and examination by means of the web-based suitability survey. The National Service Administration should also collect the personal details of women electing to respond to the survey questionnaire. Based on the results of the suitability survey, the National Service Administration should call up for registration and examination all men and women who are judged to have the prerequisites to complete military service with extended basic training.</p>
<p>During a transitional phase, the Swedish Armed Forces should be able to admit individuals to basic military training who have undergone registration and examination and who have been assessed in accordance with the current requirement profiles for total defence conscripts. In other regards, the total defence conscripts who are affected by the implementation of the new personnel supply system should be informed of the new regulations and their consequences well in advance and should be given information regarding the alternatives the Armed Forces can offer them. Since it is proposed that the compulsory national service regulations remain in effect until 30 June 2010, the responsibility for preparing and distributing this information should be assigned to the National Service Administration. However, this should be done in consultation with the Swedish Armed Forces, which have a greater knowledge regarding continued training tracks, etc. within the authority.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the committee’s proposals</h2>
<p>The committee’s proposal for a new, voluntary basic military training programme affords the Swedish Armed Forces better opportunities to secure, in an efficient and expedient manner, the personnel needs of its active organisation on the basis of govern- mental requirements. In addition, the proposed personnel supply system will generate improved conditions for enhancing equality between women and men and for achieving political integration targets. Since the regulations regarding compulsory military or civilian service will no longer be applied, the restriction on the freedom of movement of the individual will cease. Consequently, the committee’s proposal benefits personal integrity. With regard to the consequences for small businesses and employment, as well as public service in various parts of the country, it is likely that the consequences will mainly be positive.</p>
<p>The total cost for training recruits will depend on costs for marketing, testing and selection, as well as the actual training costs. Depending on how many are to be trained, reaching out to the required number of recruits will require marketing efforts. In order that suitable individuals be offered access to training, tests and selection procedures must be implemented. Experience says that, for each training vacancy, three people must undergo testing and</p>
<p>selection. Finally, the training costs to be taken into account can be divided among several items including financial remunerations to recruits, officer salaries, healthcare and equipment. The total costs for marketing, testing, selection and training for 6,050 recruits over a period of three months with varying remuneration levels are presented in Table 1.</p>
<p>Table 1 Costs (in SEK millions) for marketing, testing, selection and training for 6,050 recruits over a period of three months with varying levels of monthly remuneration</p>
<p>In both its interim and final reports, the committee has described the inefficiency of the compulsory national service system as a method for training military personnel. To illustrate this in a finan- cial perspective, the committee has estimated the potential cost of producing 3,000 soldiers ready for active service with the current compulsory national service system, that is, the volume required to meet the targets the government has set for the Swedish Armed Forces. This cost has been compared with that required to produce an equivalent number of soldiers with the proposed volunteer system. Despite the stated elements of uncertainty, the differences in efficiency between the systems are tangible. The cost of producing one soldier ready for active service is 2,4 times higher in a compulsory national service system compared to the system suggested by the commission. (see Table 2).</p>
<p>Table 2 A comparison between the efficiency of compulsory and volun- teer systems in producing 3,000 soldiers ready for active service</p>
<p>The committee’s proposals entail consequences for authorities, particularly the National Service Administration and the Swedish Armed Forces. Since the National Service Administration shall no longer conduct extensive selection procedures and since the scope of testing operations will decrease, the National Service Admini- stration will need to implement rationalisations in certain parts of its operations. At the same time, it should be re-stated that certain tasks previously performed by the National Service Administration will instead be transferred to the Swedish Armed Forces.</p>
