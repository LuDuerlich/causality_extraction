<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>One of our main tasks was to evaluate the 2006 custody reform and investigate how the regulations have worked in practice, and whether the aim of the reform – strengthening the child rights perspective – has been achieved. Another main task was to survey and analyse the reasons behind the increase in the number of custody cases. The remit also included considering:</p>
<p>• whether the regulations on joint custody need to be amended;</p>
<p>• how parents’ chances of reaching an  out-of-court settlement in cases concerning custody, residence and contact can be developed and improved;</p>
<p>• how the child’s right to be heard can be strengthened;</p>
<p>• what measures may be needed to ensure that risk assessments are carried out sufficiently, and that they are of high quality;</p>
<p>• what measures may be needed to improve and streamline the handling of issues concerning transfer of custody in cases where serious violence has been committed in the family;</p>
<p>• whether special forum rules need to be introduced for situations in which children and their parents have protected personal data; and</p>
<p>• whether measures are needed to strengthen expertise in the processing of matters concerning custody, residence and contact.</p>
<h2>Our evaluation of the 2006 custody reform Our examination and survey</h2>
<p>To shed light on the results of the 2006 custody reform, we examined child custody judgments from district courts throughout the country, and held hearings with judges, family law secretaries and lawyers. We obtained opinions from child rights organisations, other stakeholder organisations and various associations. We also interviewed nine children who have experienced a custody dispute. To some extent, we were able to compare our results with the results of the 2002 Custody Inquiry presented in Vårdnad – Boende – Umgänge, Barnets bästa, föräldrars ansvar  (‘Custody – Residence – Contact; the best interests of the child, parents’ responsibilities’, Swedish Government Official Reports 2005:43).</p>
<h2>The overall results of the evaluation</h2>
<p>The primary aim of the 2006 custody reform was to strengthen the child rights perspective. In our assessment, the 2006 custody reform has been successful in many respects. The child rights perspective has been strengthened. Children’s views are now heard to a greater extent than before, risk assessments are carried out to a greater extent than prior to the reform, and social welfare committees submit proposed decisions on custody in more than 90 per cent of cases. The best interests of the child play a prominent role in assessments concerning custody, residence and contact. Although the reform has helped to strengthen the child rights perspective, areas for improvement remain. For example, we have noted that the opinions of younger children, in particular – and how these opinions have been considered – are commonly not included in custody investigations and judgments. The quality of risk assessments also needs to be improved.</p>
<p>One aim of the 2006 custody reform was to give courts greater scope to award sole custody. We have noted that it has become more common for one of the parents in custody disputes to be awarded sole custody. In 2014, the district courts awarded joint custody in 33 per cent of cases, sole custody for the mother in 46 per cent of cases, and sole custody for the father in 21 per cent of cases. In 2002, the district courts awarded joint custody in 55 per cent of cases, sole custody for the mother in 36 per cent of cases, and sole custody for the father in 9 per cent of cases. The courts also make more nuanced assessments of the issue of custody, in the sense that more circumstances are taken into account in the deliberations.</p>
<p>Another aim of the 2006 custody reform was to make it easier for parents to reach an agreement on matters concerning custody, residence and contact. Our survey shows that it is common for the parties to reach a consensus agreement during court proceedings. This happens in around 65 per cent of cases in which there has at some point been a petition for sole custody. Courts work in various ways to help the parties reach an agreement, e.g. by ordering family mediation, by repeatedly drafting agreements that gradually bring the parties closer together, and by using the conflict and conciliation method. However, the possibility for courts to order mediation that was introduced through the reform is used in few cases. The reason for this appears to be that many judges have negative experiences of the mediation process. In cases where mediators have expertise and are suitable for the assignment, however, mediation can be an effective method for helping parents to reach an agreement.</p>
<p>The 2006 custody reform highlighted parents’ ability to cooperate on matters concerning the child as a particularly important factor to be taken into account when adjudicating on custody (Chapter 6, Section 5, second paragraph of the Children and Parents Code). The intention was to make it clear that joint custody should not be considered where the level of parental conflict is so high that it has an adverse effect on the child. The reform may have contributed to more parents petitioning for sole custody. Difficulties cooperating are raised in the court case in an attempt to obtain custody. It is our impression that parents focus to a large degree on their difficulties cooperating rather than on possible solutions to resolve the conflict. In this sense, the regulation may have exacerbated conflict.</p>
<p>The part of the 2006 custody reform whereby the examination of enforcement was transferred from the general administrative courts to the general courts has been positive. The practicalities of enforcement cases have been facilitated, and the number of enforcement cases submitted to the district courts since 2006 has increased only slightly. We found that Chapter 21 of the Children and Parents Code, which regulates enforcement cases, needs to be reviewed with regard to content and language. We were not able to undertake such a review under the terms of our remit. Nonetheless, we propose that an additional provision be introduced into Chapter 21 of the Children and Parents Code concerning the division of legal costs and special forum rules for those with protected personal data.</p>
<h2>The increase in the number of custody cases</h2>
<p>In 2006, 3 108 custody cases were submitted to the district courts; the corresponding figure in 2015 was 6 185. This represents an increase of 99 per cent. However, these cases are not only cases concerning disputes between parents, but rather also cases and matters in which a social welfare committee is the claimant or applicant. When those cases and matters are discounted from the figures, 2 822 custody cases were submitted to the district courts in 2006, and 4 166 cases in 2015. This represents an increase of 48 per cent, which is a more relevant figure on which to base our considerations.</p>
<h2>Why has the number of custody cases increased?</h2>
<p>The increase in the number of custody cases submitted following the 2006 custody reform is considerable. In our assessment, the increase is due to several factors. One possible explanation is the greater possibilities for sole custody entailed in the reform, which has probably led to more parents seeing an opportunity to successfully petition for sole custody. More equal parenting and an increased tendency towards conflict are other factors that have probably influenced this trend. The fact that leave to appeal is now required from the court of appeal may have led to repeat proceedings becoming more common. In our investigation, we found that 40 per cent of parties had previously been involved in a dispute concerning children. The corresponding figure in 2002 was 29 per cent. An increased incidence of cases with a foreign connection in which only one of the parents is in Sweden is yet another example of a likely reason for the increase in cases. There are also shortcomings in efforts to prevent parental conflict. This has probably also influenced the trend.</p>
<h2>Starting points for the Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>Protracted conflicts between parents have an adverse effect on children. Parental conflict can constitute a risk factor for a child’s emotional and social development. A court dispute often entails long-term emotional strain for children and parents. For the sake of the child, it is therefore important that conflicts are handled well, as far as possible – or ideally avoided altogether. It is also important that both children and parents can be offered support and assistance at an early stage on issues that may affect the child’s circumstances and daily life. Action is needed to help prevent parental conflict, which in turn may lead to a reduction in custody disputes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we take the view that the focus in this process needs to be shifted from the parents and their areas of conflict to the child and the child’s rights and needs. The child’s right to be heard and to receive information should be clarified further. There is also a need for greater protection for children at risk.</p>
<p>While court proceedings are ongoing, the parties live in uncertainty as to the outcome of future rulings in the dispute. This is stressful for everyone concerned, particularly the children. Court proceedings should therefore be as efficient and proper as possible. It is vital that the courts’ possibilities to plan cases and pursue them to swift decisions are harnessed, while at the same time courts work to help parents reach lasting consensus agreements.</p>
<h2>Our proposals and assessments Consensus agreements Obligatory information meetings to precede court proceedings</h2>
<p>There is a need to reach out to parents who are considering initiating a court dispute concerning children with information at an earlier stage than at present. A requirement will therefore be introduced whereby parents must, as a general rule, have taken part in information meetings before presenting any petition in a dispute concerning custody, residence or contact. At the meetings, all parents who are considering initiating a court dispute concerning children will receive relevant information about the legal regulations, the various forms of conflict resolution available, etc. before proceedings are initiated. If it is appropriate to do so, the parents will be offered family mediation. At the meetings – which should have a clear focus on the child – the parents will also receive information and guidance, according to their needs, on the assistance and support available to them. The municipalities will be responsible for the information meetings, within the framework of their social services provision. Information meetings should be held at the earliest opportunity, and within four weeks of them being requested. The social welfare committee will issue a certificate to parents who have attended information meetings. The certificate will be valid for one year. A parent who initiates proceedings and presents a petition in a dispute concerning custody, residence or contact must present a valid certificate showing that they have attended an information meeting. If no certificate is submitted – despite a subsequent court injunction to do so – the action will be dismissed. A specific law will be introduced – the act on information meetings with parents involved in disputes over children – to regulate the procedures for these meetings. A provision will be introduced into Chapter 6 of the Children and Parents Code, making information meetings a prerequisite in many cases for legal actions concerning custody, residence or contact. The provisions in Chapter 14, Section 5 of the Marriage Code will be supplemented to stipulate that in some cases, the courts cannot examine a parent’s claim concerning custody, residence or contact.</p>
<h2>A competency and suitability requirement for mediators to be introduced in law</h2>
<p>Our survey shows that the frequency with which mediators are appointed varies from one court to another. In general, mediation is used in few cases. One somewhat uncertain finding from our survey is that the courts appoint mediators in 1–3 per cent of cases. Sometimes, judges refrain from appointing mediators due to negative experiences. Nonetheless, there are examples of mediators who do succeed in helping parents to reach an agreement. To ensure that mediators meet the high standards that must be imposed in terms of qualifications and experience, we propose the introduction in law of a competency and suitability requirement. Under our proposal, mediators should be required to have relevant training and professional experience, and be suitable for the task. It is up to the judge concerned to ensure that the person appointed as mediator meets the requirements.</p>
<p>For mediation to be successful, it is important that it is conducted in confidence. We propose that secrecy apply in court to information provided by a party to a mediator in the context of mediation in a case in which the mediator has been appointed under Chapter 6, Section 18a of the Children and Parents Code, if the party has entered a reservation to that effect. However, we do not propose any restrictions on mediators’ obligation to give evidence. Nothing should prevent information of significance to the assessment of the best interests of a child, of which a mediator may be aware, being presented in court.</p>
<h2>Joint custody In determining custody, particular importance should be attached to the parents’ ability to take joint responsibility in matters concerning the child</h2>
<p>Under the current regulations, when assessing whether the parents should have joint custody or one of the parents should have sole custody, the court is to pay particular attention to the parents’ ability to cooperate in matters concerning the child. We have concluded that the focus on parents’ inability to cooperate – which has resulted from the regulation – can exacerbate conflict. An elevated conflict level has negative consequences for children. Custody should be influenced by how the parents’ behaviour towards each other affects the child, rather than the precise details of how they choose to resolve matters concerning the child. If the parents’ behaviour has an excessively adverse effect on the child, it may mean that sole custody is in the best interests of the child. Under our proposal, therefore, when assessing custody the courts should take particular account of the parents’ ability to take joint responsibility for matters concerning the child, rather than of their ability to cooperate. Parents taking joint responsibility means that together they can resolve matters concerning the child in such a way that the child is not affected by the parents’ conflict. This can be achieved through extensive contact or very little contact, and contact can be verbal or written. The aim is to reduce the focus on the parents’ ability to cooperate and instead focus on the child’s situation and the consequences for the child. In our view, this will allow considerably less scope for parents to contrive conflicts with a view to obtaining sole custody than is possible at present. This proposal also corresponds better to how the courts in practice assess the ability to cooperate.</p>
<h2>Courts should be able to award joint custody even if both parents oppose it</h2>
<p>At present, the courts can award joint custody if one parent opposes it, but not if both oppose it. We propose that the courts should be able to award joint custody even if both parents oppose it. The aim of this amendment is to make it clear that the best interests of the child, not the parents’ positions, should be the crucial factor in the court’s assessment.</p>
<h2>The best interests of the child and the child's right to be heard The best interests of the child will be clarified</h2>
<p>We propose an addition to Chapter 6, Section 2a of the Children and Parents Code, clarifying that the principle of the best interests of the child is the deciding factor not only for court orders, but for all matters concerning custody, residence and contact. We also propose that the same section stipulate that the parents’ ability to place the child’s needs before their own conflict is to be one of the circumstances that is taken into particular account when assessing what is best for the child. An addition of this kind sends an important signal to parents involved in a dispute concerning children, or considering such a dispute.</p>
<h2>Children must receive relevant information and the child’s right to freely express their views and have them taken into account will be clarified</h2>
<p>A child is never obliged to express their views, but they should be given the opportunity to do so. The child’s right to be heard presupposes that the child receives information. We have found that the child’s right to information and to freely express their views needs to be clarified. Under Chapter 6, Section 2a of the Children and Parents Code, the wishes of the child must be taken into account, and under Chapter 6, Section 19 of the Code, the person conducting an investigation must seek to establish the position of the child and present it to the court. It is unfortunate that the legislative text is based on wordings that may imply that the child must have expressed a decided opinion for it to be taken into account. This approach does not reflect the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, or our perception of the child’s right to be heard. We therefore propose a new provision in the introduction to Chapter 6 of the Children and Parents Code, stipulating that the child must receive relevant information and be given the opportunity to express their views or position on matters concerning custody, residence and contact. If the child does not express an opinion, their views or position must – in as far as it is possible – be established in some other way. The provision will apply regardless of whether a matter is processed by family law services, the courts or a mediator appointed under Chapter 6, Section 18a of the Children and Parents Code. We also propose that the child’s views and position, rather than their wishes, should be given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child. By introducing the word ‘views’ into the legislative text it is made clear that even views that cannot be considered an expression of a decided opinion should be taken into account. These proposals would strengthen the right of younger children, in particular, to be heard.</p>
<h2>Social welfare committees will be able to hear children without custodial parents’ consent</h2>
<p>We propose that when an investigation or measure is ordered by a court under Chapter 6 of the Children and Parents Code, social welfare committees should be able to hear a child without the consent of their custodial parents and without a custodial parent being present. This will make it clear that children have an unconditional right to be heard, regardless of the views of their custodial parents on the matter.</p>
<h2>Risk assessments We welcome the assignment recently given to the Family Law and Parental Support Authority</h2>
<p>If information emerges that a child is at risk, the social welfare committee and the court must always conduct a risk assessment. Our investigation shows that both social welfare committees and district courts conduct risk assessments to a greater extent than previously. Nonetheless, the quality of risk assessments needs to be improved. The issue primarily concerns the difficulty of identifying and assessing different circumstances that may constitute a risk to the child and how those circumstances should be considered in the case in question. This issue is difficult to remedy through legislation. There is a demand – and a clear need – for support for handling risk assessments in investigations concerning custody, residence and contact. In its appropriation directions for the fiscal year 2017, the Government has tasked the Family Law and Parental Support Authority with producing support materials for risk assessments by social welfare committees in cases concerning custody, residence and contact. We welcome this assignment and thus note that there is no reason for us to propose any measures with regard to risk assessments. This assignment can help improve the quality of risk assessments by providing tools to identify and assess the risk of a child being, for example, subjected to abuse or neglect. If social welfare committees’ risk assessments maintain a higher standard, it will improve the basis on which the courts make decisions, and thus also the prospects of decisions that are in the best interests of the child.</p>
<h2>Serious domestic violence It should be possible to appoint a temporary custodian if there are special grounds for doing so</h2>
<p>A custodial parent who has intentionally killed or seriously injured the other parent must, in the vast majority of cases, be considered to have failed in their duty of care to the child in such a way that it is not in the best interests of the child for the parent to continue to have custody. Although the legal conditions are already in place for custody to be rapidly transferred to one or two specially appointed custodians, in practice there is often a delay before custody is transferred. The reason for the delay is that there is often no suitable person who is willing to take on this task. We propose that it should be possible, where there are special grounds, to appoint a temporary custodian , pending the designation of a specially appointed custodian. This assignment should focus on the legal aspects of a custodian’s duties. It should be a fundamental prerequisite that the actual care of the child is provided by someone else, either through voluntary arrangements e.g. under the Social Services Act (2001:453), or pursuant to the Care of Young Persons (Special Provisions) Act (1990:52). A member of the Swedish Bar Association, legal associate at a law firm, or some other person may be appointed as a temporary custodian. Only a person who, due to their expertise and experience, and personal qualities, is particularly suitable for the task may be appointed. Although this regulation primarily targets cases of lethal violence, it may also be applicable in certain cases of other serious violence targeting the other parent or the child.</p>
<h2>Forum rules for protected personal data New forum rules in cases involving protected personal data</h2>
<p>Matters concerning custody, residence or access are considered by the court in the place where the child habitually resides. There is therefore a need for special forum rules when a child’s personal data is subject to secrecy, regardless of which parent the child lives with. Matrimonial cases are considered by the district court in the place where one of the spouses habitually resides. In matrimonial cases, there is therefore a need for special forum rules both when only one of the spouses is habitually resident in Sweden and that spouse’s personal data is subject to secrecy, and when both spouses are resident in Sweden and both of their personal data is protected. According to the guiding court decision in NJA 2015 p. 218, as the reserve forum Stockholm District Court is to be considered the competent court when the personal data of a child in a case concerning custody, residence or contact is protected. We consider that it should be stated in law which court is competent to examine a dispute. Our proposal also involves a solution that differs in part from that offered by the guiding court decision.</p>
<p>We propose that if the details of where the child is resident are subject to secrecy, matters concerning custody, residence or contact should, in addition to what is currently prescribed, also be examined by the court in the place where one of the parties is habitually resident. Stockholm District Court should also be a competent court in cases and matters where details of where the child and both parties are resident are subject to secrecy. Stockholm District Court should also be a competent court in matrimonial cases if only one of the spouses is resident in Sweden and details of where that spouse is resident are subject to secrecy, or if details of where both spouses are resident are subject to secrecy. We make similar forum proposals for cases concerning child support, and in enforcement cases where the personal data of one of the parties is protected.</p>
<h2>Processing issues Interim custody orders should only be issued if there are special grounds for doing so</h2>
<p>If the parents are unable to agree, a child’s residence and contact with the parent with whom they do not reside often needs to be regulated through an interim order while proceedings are ongoing. The fact that a large number of interim orders are issued has to be accepted. Nonetheless, it is important that interim custody orders are not issued without compelling grounds to do so. One parent losing custody can have serious consequences for the child, who risks being cut off from that parent. It is also a serious matter for a parent to lose custody of their child. Only in exceptional cases should such orders be issued without a complete basis for a decision. In practice, there is already a difference between when an interim order is issued concerning residence and contact, and an interim order concerning custody. In general, the courts only issue interim custody orders in exceptional cases. We propose that the legislative text state that an interim custody order must only be issued if there are special grounds for doing so.</p>
<h2>More provisions to override secrecy between social welfare committees</h2>
<p>At present, there are provisions to override secrecy that enable a social welfare committee to obtain data from another social welfare committee before an agreement is approved (Chapter 6, Section 17a, third paragraph of the Children and Parents Code) and in investigations concerning custody, residence and contact (Chapter 6, Section 19, fifth paragraph of the Children and Parents Code). Prior to the 2006 reform, an investigator could only obtain data that was held by their own authority, not corresponding data from another municipality. This was not considered reasonable. Our survey and analysis of the legal situation found that the same applies to social welfare committees’ provision of reports under Chapter 6, Section 19, second paragraph of the Children and Parents Code, and of rapid reports under Chapter 6, Section 20, second paragraph of the Code. It is essential that information that may influence a decision is presented, regardless of whether the decision is final or applies for a limited period. We therefore propose that provisions to override secrecy be introduced in these cases as well.</p>
<h2>A time limit will be introduced for completing custody, residence and contact investigations</h2>
<p>We have identified long investigation times as a particular factor that delays courts’ processing of cases concerning custody, residence or contact. The measures previously proposed to limit investigation times – training and exchange of experience – have proved inadequate. We therefore propose the introduction of a provision whereby investigations concerning custody, residence and contact must, as a general rule, be completed within four months. This time limit has been deemed reasonable in previous legislative matters, and it corresponds to the time limit that applies to child welfare investigations carried out under the Social Services Act.</p>
<h2>Court processing times can be reduced using existing provisions</h2>
<p>In addition to investigation times and the complexity of disputes, we have identified a number of other factors that particularly cause long processing times for custody cases before the courts. Repeated preparatory hearings are one such factor; decisions to order a custody investigation when court proceedings have been ongoing for a long time are another. A further factor is that main hearings are often not held until several months after a custody investigation has been received by the district court. In our assessment, the tools offered by current law to strike a balance between efficiency and due processing can be used better than they are at present. Courts should, for example, set timetables for processing.</p>
<h2>Need for training for family law secretaries</h2>
<p>Training and skills development are important for those responsible for processing matters concerning custody, residence and contact. A relatively wide range of training is available to judges. However, action is needed to strengthen municipal efforts to develop the skills of family law secretaries. As a first step, we propose that the Family Law and Parental Support Authority be tasked by the Government with surveying the need for training for family law secretaries.</p>
<p>This should include identifying the areas where the need for training is greatest.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<h2>Fewer disputes over children will be decided in court</h2>
<p>In our assessment, the proposal on information meetings for parents involved in disputes over children will help to reduce parental conflict and to ensure that fewer disputes are decided in court, which has consequences for children. The prospects of finding the best solution for the child at an early stage will increase. In our assessment, the proposal will thus help to improve the mental and physical wellbeing of the children whose parents disagree, or have disagreed, on matters concerning custody, residence or contact.</p>
<h2>Increased focus on children</h2>
<p>Our proposals will clarify children’s rights in several respects in matters concerning custody, residence or contact. The focus will shift from the parents to the children. Our proposals concerning children’s right to information and right to be heard strengthen children’s right to participate in matters concerning custody, residence or contact.</p>
<h2>Greater security for children</h2>
<p>Our proposal concerning additional forum rules will mean that, in many cases, it will be possible to have a matter examined by a court in a different place to where a child whose personal details are protected resides. As such, the choice of court will not necessarily reveal the child’s location.</p>
<p>The proposal on transferring custody to a temporary custodian is primarily intended to be applied when a custodial parent has intentionally killed the other custodial parent. The proposal will bolster the prospects of finding a new custodian for the child when there is a need to do so and when a solution of this kind is in the best interests of the child.</p>
<h2>Financial consequences</h2>
<p>The proposal on information meetings for parents involved in disputes concerning children will probably lead to fewer court disputes concerning custody, residence and contact and, at least in the longer term, to reduced costs for the courts. Since the number of family cases will be reduced, the work of the social welfare committees at various stages of disputes processed by the courts will also decrease. If the number of cases before the courts is reduced by 10 per cent, we estimate that the cost incurred by the municipalities for holding the interviews will correspond to the savings made in terms of rapid reports and investigations.</p>
<p>At the information interviews, parents will be offered family mediation and receive information about other forms of support and assistance. The proposal will thus mean that more parents than at present will be aware of the support options available, and such measures will probably become more common, which is also the intention. However, beyond the information meetings we do not propose any other new measures; it is a matter of offering parents measures that are already available. It is reasonable to expect that municipal costs for such measures will increase. In our assessment, however, these costs should not be seen as a calculable consequence of our proposal.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the costs of the training and information measures we propose can be financed within existing financial frameworks.</p>
<p>It should also be possible to finance the costs of the assignments to the Family Law and Parental Support Authority and others within existing financial frameworks.</p>
<p>The proposal whereby temporary custodians can be appointed for children may lead to marginally increased costs for individual municipalities.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>It is proposed that our proposals enter into force on 1 July 2018. However, it is proposed that the proposals concerning information meetings enter into force on a date determined by the Government.</p>
