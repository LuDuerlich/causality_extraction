<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>General remarks</h2>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The Committee on Trademarks proposes that a new Trademark Act should replace the present Trademark Act of 1960. The Committee also proposes amendments to the Business Names Act. In many cases these are linked to the Committee’s proposals for a new Trademark Act, but some innovations are proposed.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out from the start that the provisions on trademarks not only apply to marks used for goods, but also for services.</p>
<p>Nordic cooperation on harmonizing trademark legislation in the Nordic countries</p>
<p>One of the Committee’s general tasks was to ensure that Nordic legislation on trademarks is harmonized wherever possible. Parallel with the work of the Committee, similar work has been undertaken in Finland and Norway. The three committees collaborated closely, and the Finnish and Norwegian committees have also proposed new trademark legislation in their respective countries. The structure of the draft legislation in the three countries is broadly similar and contains identical solutions as regards key trademark law issues.</p>
<p>A new Trademark Act entered into force in Denmark on January 1 1992, and legislation revised to make it broadly consistent with the Danish Act came into force in Iceland on July 1 1997. There has therefore been no need in these countries to enact new legislation. In their endeavours to harmonize the Nordic legislation in this field Finland, Norway and Sweden have considered it appropriate to take the Danish Act as a point of departure.</p>
<p>The Nordic countries have a tradition of collaboration on legislation relating to trademarks and signs. Professor Birger Stuevold Lassen of Norway contributed a paper on previous collaboration for the Committee’s report in which he analyses and discusses various matters of interest within the context of Nordic collaboration. Among these matters is the question to what extent identical provisions imply substantive legal harmonization. Another matter discussed in the paper is the importance of similar legislation for the future. The paper emphasizes the need for uniform application of the law in this connection.</p>
<p>Effects of Community law on the Committee’s proposal</p>
<p>The EC Trademark Directive of 1989 was adopted in order to approximate the Member States’ trademark legislation. In many respects the Committee’s proposal for a new Trademark Act takes its cue from the Directive.</p>
<p>The binding provisions of the Trademark Directive apply only to registered  trademarks and not to trademarks or other signs that are protected by the fact that the holder has used them in such a way that they are, to use the terminology of trademark law, established by usage .</p>
<p>The Committee considers that trademarks and signs established by usage should enjoy the same protection as registered trademarks. In the draft Act trade signs established in this way have the same status as registered trademarks as far as possible.</p>
<p>Developments in commerce and industry since the entry into force of the present Trademark Act</p>
<p>Two members of the Committee, Birgitta Hermansson and Bertil Strömberg, contributed a paper in which they analyse developments in trade and commerce. The authors note that the main trend, particularly as regards fast-moving consumer products, is increasing globalization and at the same time increasing concentration at both the producer and distribution levels. The authors also point out that the pace of product development has constantly increased and that the life cycles of individual products are now shorter than they used to be.</p>
<p>The authors also mention companies’ efforts to reduce the number of product lines, which makes it possible to have longer production series and smaller stocks. As a result, uniform international packaging is increasingly used for their products, which in turn means that the trademark must be the same in all the countries where the products are sold.</p>
<p>The authors also refer to the internationalization of the media as a further reason for using uniform international trademarks.</p>
<p>Another trend is towards concentration at the distribution level and the fact that the daily consumer goods retail sector now distributes many products that were previously sold only in specialized shops. Large food retailing chains have emerged and are being internationalized at an ever faster pace. There is a tendency for these chains to try to stand out from the others, and one consequence of this is that strong trademarks are built for the chain itself.</p>
<p>As regards marketing directed at professional users, the authors mention the tendency for producers to seek to market not only a product or a service, but a system of products or services.</p>
<p>They also mention the fact that for some suppliers the protection of their company name is more important than a trademark that protects the various goods and services offered by the company.</p>
<p>Developments in modern trademark legislation</p>
<p>Marianne Levin, another member of the Committee, contributed a paper on the development of modern trademark legislation. The author notes that the economic and cultural value of trademarks and signs has risen sharply in recent years. Market establishment has also become increasingly important. And since it is largely true to say that a trademark represents the value created by the company in the form of an image, it is important to protect such expressions of advertisement value and goodwill.</p>
<p>The author also points out that the dividing-line between exclusive rights and objects of protection is determined in an interactive process between legislators, courts and external factors in a continuously evolving process. This area of law is trendsensitive and there are signs that we are experiencing a systemic shift.</p>
<p>The author also deals with the tendency to regard intellectual property rights as a form of investment protection, and there is consequently an increasing demand for wider protection of wellknown and reputable trademarks.</p>
<p>Another subject that is discussed is the consequences of the fact that global factors and dependencies and technological developments play a more significant role than ever in shaping trademark law. The author also discusses individualization and the protection of goodwill. She concludes by noting that there is a risk that abuse of the current well-developed and generous system of protection may destroy the exclusive rights system.</p>
<h2>Trademarks and other signs Origin of exclusive rights etc.</h2>
<p>Reduced scope of statutory examinations by the Swedish Patent and Registration Office</p>
<p>An exclusive right to a trademark can be acquired by registration or establishment by usage. The registration of a trademark in the Swedish Trademark Register entitles the holder to an exclusive right in Sweden. This section deals only with such national registrations. The Trademark Register is kept by the Swedish Patent and Registration Office (‘the Patent Office’).</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the examination conducted by the Patent Office before a trademark is registered should be simplified. Under today’s system the Patent Office checks whether there are any grounds for refusing registration. There are two main types of grounds which it must take into account. The first – absolute grounds for refusal  – is based on public interest, while the second – relative grounds for refusal  – relates to previous exclusive rights. Where either of these grounds for refusal exists the Patent Office does not register the trademark.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the Patent Office should no longer refuse registration on relative grounds, i.e. that the Patent Office’s examination of relative grounds ex officio  should be abolished.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this proposal. One is that nowadays it is impossible to carry out a sufficiently reliable examination of such grounds since it has become increasingly difficult to obtain sufficiently complete registration documentation. The most important reason, however, has to do with the Community trademark system. This system provides for a special procedure for registering trademarks throughout the EU without the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (Trade Marks and Designs) (OHIM) taking account of relative grounds for refusal in its procedures.</p>
<p>The Committee does not propose, however, that the Patent Office’s examination of relative grounds for refusal should be abolished altogether. The Patent Office should continue to carry out searches in some form, but it will be up to the Government to determine their extent. One alternative might be to carry out automatic searches in trademark and related databases to check for identical or similar marks. If such a search gave any indication that grounds for refusal exist in accordance with the criteria specified for new registration, the Patent Office would inform the applicant. This would give applicants the opportunity to decide whether or not to withdraw their applications. Should the applicant decide not to withdraw the application, the trademark would be registered.</p>
<p>If a party considers that a trademark should not be registered, for example because it infringes someone else’s exclusive right, it could – as is the case today – file an opposition against registration. Since the Patent Office would not on its own initiative consider any relative grounds for refusal, the opposition procedure would be more important.</p>
<p>Revocation of a registration following an opposition procedure could in essence be based on the same relative grounds for refusal as now. However, the Committee proposes that the provisions relating to refusal on the grounds of a family name  should be amended and that the protection of titles of literary works  should be abolished. The Committee also proposes certain other amendments to the provisions concerning grounds for refusal.</p>
<p>If an applicant is informed that there may be absolute grounds for refusal, but does not contact the Patent Office, the application should be deemed to be withdrawn. Provision should, however, be made for the possibility to request further processing of an application that has been deemed to be withdrawn. This is an innovation in trademark law, but the possibility exists in connection, inter alia, with patent applications.</p>
<p>Opposition procedure</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the registration of a trademark can be opposed. The Committee’s proposals in this respect contain two innovations. One is that the time limit for filing an opposition should be extended from two to three months, which is the time limit specified in the EC Trademark Regulation. The other is that an opponent who invokes relative grounds for refusal must himself represent the interest at stake for the Patent Office to base a revocation decision on such grounds.</p>
<p>During an opposition procedure the Patent Office cannot consider any grounds for refusal other than those referred to by the opponent. If the opponent withdraws his opposition, the Patent Office may nevertheless consider it if there are special reasons to do so. The Committee mentions, as an example of such special reasons, the fact that a registered trademark contains a racist element. Under no circumstances should relative  grounds for refusal be considered once the opposition on which they are based has been withdrawn.</p>
<p>No requirement in the Act for written applications and oppositions</p>
<p>An amendment has recently been made to the Patents Act, under which it is no longer compulsory to present patent applications in writing. Instead, the formal requirements for applications will be laid down in a Government Ordinance. The Committee proposes basically the same system for applications for trademark registrations and for oppositions to trademark registrations.</p>
<p>Requirements concerning representatives</p>
<p>The provisions of the Patents Act requiring foreign patent applicants to have a representative were recently amended. The purpose of the amendment was to bring the Act into line with the EC Treaty’s provisions on freedom of establishment and free movement of services. The Committee proposes a corresponding amendment with respect to trademarks. This would mean that the Patent Office could, in connection with trademark registration applications filed by foreign applicants, require such applicants to appoint a representative domiciled in Sweden who is authorized to receive service of notices or documents. Foreign holders of trademark registrations would also be required to appoint such a representative.</p>
<p>Convention priority and exhibition priority</p>
<p>In some situations the question of which application for registration was first filed with the Patent Office may decide who has an exclusive right to a trademark. But in some cases an application can claim priority from a date other than that on which it was submitted to the Patent Office. Sweden has signed international conventions under which it undertakes in certain conditions to give priority to applications submitted at an earlier date in another state, i.e. ‘convention priority’. The Trademark Regulation contains detailed rules in this respect.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that most of these rules should be incorporated into the Act. The reason for this is that, in connection with consideration of amendments to the Patents Act, the Government concluded that such provisions must be adopted by Parliament under the Swedish constitution.</p>
<p>The Committee also proposes, with reference to the constitution, that the rules concerning exhibition priority, which at present are embodied in an Ordinance, should be incorporated into the Act and that they should be clarified.</p>
<p>Transfer of an application to a party who has a better right to the trademark</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that it should be possible to transfer an application for registration of a trademark to a party which has a better right to it. This is an innovation in trademark law, but the possibility exists elsewhere, for example in connection with patent applications.</p>
<p>For the Patent Office to transfer an application to a party other than the party that has applied for registration, that party must show that it has a better right to the trademark than the applicant.</p>
<p>In doubtful cases the Patent Office may require such a party to bring an action before a court within a certain period. If it fails to do so, the Patent Office may disregard the claim for a better right in its continued examination of the registration application.</p>
<p>If a proceeding relating to a claim for a better right to the trademark is instituted, the Patent Office will normally declare the matter of registration dormant. If a party requests that the application be transferred, it must not be altered, deemed to be withdrawn, dismissed or granted until the request has been considered.</p>
<p>If a party claims during the opposition procedure that it has a better right to the trademark, the provisions concerning transfer will be applicable in the same way as in connection with the application.</p>
<p>Acquisition of a distinctive character</p>
<p>An essential condition for the registration of a trademark is that it is distinctive, although a lack of distinctive character in the original trademark can be remedied by use.</p>
<p>The assessment of the distinctive character of a trademark in connection with the processing of an application for registration are currently based on the use of the trademark up to the date of registration. The exclusive right to the trademark applies, however, from the date of application. One result of this system is that the holder can enjoy an exclusive right to a trademark for a certain period although it does not fulfil the criteria for registration.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the assessment should only consider the use of the trademark up to the date on which the application is filed with the Patent Office.</p>
<p>Establishment by use</p>
<p>It should be possible to acquire exclusive rights to trademarks and signs by established usage, as is the case at present. As before, a sign should be considered as established by use if it is known to a significant part of the relevant sector of the public.</p>
<p>Where the sign is established all over the country the exclusive right should have the same legal effect as an exclusive right based on registration, as is the case at present.</p>
<p>An exclusive right established by use on a local basis should also have the same legal effect, but only within the geographical area to which the right relates. The existence of a sign established locally should, however, no longer constitute grounds for revocation of a registration, which by definition applies on a national basis.</p>
<p>The Committee cannot see any reason why a right established by local use should have any legal effect outside the area concerned. But the existence of a locally established trademark should constitute grounds for prohibition of the use of a conflicting registered trademark in the area where the sign is established.</p>
<p>Protection regardless of registration or establishment</p>
<p>A person who uses his own distinctive personal name as a brand for goods or services in a specific geographical area should continue to enjoy protection of the name as a trademark in that area. Furthermore, the holder of a business identifier, for example a company name, that is protected in a specific area should enjoy protection of it as a trademark in the same area.</p>
<p>In principle, the protection of marks consisting of personal or business names should as before be the same as the basic protection provided by registered trademarks. However, where such marks are only protected in a specific geographical area they should not constitute an obstacle to the validity of a trademark registration.</p>
<p>Addresses should no longer enjoy protection as signs.</p>
<h2>Definition of exclusive rights</h2>
<p>The Trademark Directive contains binding provisions on the definition of the basic protection  of registered trademarks. Under these provisions the owner of a registered trademark can prohibit the use of an identical trademark for the same type of products. Furthermore, the owner of a registered trademark can prohibit the use of an identical or similar trademark for products of the same or a similar kind, if there is a risk that the public may confuse the trademarks, including the risk of the later trademark being associated with the earlier one. Such circumstances also represent grounds for refusal and for invalidity.</p>
<p>The Directive also contains provisions providing extended protection  for well-known trademarks. This protection is provided even where the relevant products are not similar.</p>
<p>The Committee has discussed the implications of these provisions and has concluded that the wording of the Swedish Act should be closer to that of the Directive than is the case at present.</p>
<h2>Termination of exclusive rights</h2>
<p>The Patent Office should be authorized to revoke trademark registrations</p>
<p>At present, a party who wants to have another party’s registration of a trademark revoked must bring an action before a court of law. The Committee proposes that a simplified procedure should be introduced under which the Patent Office would be authorized to revoke trademark registrations independently of an opposition procedure.</p>
<p>The procedure proposed by the Committee is broadly similar to the existing simplified procedure for the processing of applications for orders to pay. The suggested procedure would be as follows.</p>
<p>A party wanting to have a registration revoked could file an application to that effect with the Patent Office. If the holder of the registration agreed to the application or refrained from contesting it, the Patent Office would revoke the registration without examining the merits.</p>
<p>If, however, the holder contested the application, the Patent Office would inform the applicant. If the applicant still wanted his revocation application to be considered he could request that the Patent Office referred the application to a district court. The district court would then examine the application in the same way as if the applicant had brought an action before the court from the start.</p>
<p>The holder of a registration could oppose a decision by the Patent Office to revoke a registration by applying for the procedure to be reopened.</p>
<p>The Committee’s proposal would make the revocation procedure simpler and less costly than it is today. Under this system, cases that require substantive examination would be referred to a district court, where they would be subject to the more detailed examination applied by the courts.</p>
<h2>Other matters relating to trademarks and other signs</h2>
<p>International registration</p>
<p>Under the Madrid System, which includes the Madrid Agreement and the Madrid Protocol, the holder of a trademark can obtain protection for his trademark in several different countries under a single procedure. Sweden has acceded to the Madrid Protocol, but not to the Madrid Agreement.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s view, the disadvantages of acceding to the Madrid Agreement outweigh the advantages, and therefore the Committee does not recommend that Sweden should accede to it.</p>
<p>As regards the procedure in connection with applications for international registration, the Committee proposes a few minor changes.</p>
<p>Geographical indications</p>
<p>A geographical indication can be described simply as a description identifying products with a specified geographical origin – national, regional or local.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that a provision be introduced in the Act to the effect that geographical indications can be registered as collective marks and as guarantee and certification marks.</p>
<p>The Committee also proposes the indication of a provision according to which a trademark that contains or consists of an element that can be construed as a geographical indication for wine or spirits should not be registered if it relates to wine or spirits of some other origin. This should apply regardless of whether or not the trademark is misleading.</p>
<p>The Collective Marks Act</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the Collective Marks Act be repealed and that its provisions be incorporated into the new Trademark Act.</p>
<p>Compensation for trademark infringements etc.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s view, there is a need to clarify the provisions on compensation for trademark infringements. The Committee does not propose any changes as regards the obligation to pay compensation for the use of the trademark. But it proposes amendments to the provision concerning compensation for the damage caused by the infringement in other respects. The Committee considers it necessary to define more clearly the criteria that are relevant to an assessment of such damage.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s view, special consideration should be given in connection with the assessment to: the damage caused to the reputation of the trademark (goodwill) the loss of sales suffered by the right-holder the profit made by the infringer as a result of the infringement the right-holder’s interest in ensuring that his trademark is not infringed.</p>
<p>The Committee also proposes that the provisions on prosecution by a public prosecutor  should be changed in connection with trademark infringements so as to make it possible for the public prosecutor to prosecute where this is appropriate from the point of view of public interest. This means that prosecution would no longer be subjected to special circumstances.</p>
<p>Confidentiality</p>
<p>There are no provisions on confidentiality with respect to applications for trademarks filed with the Patent Office. Such provisions do apply, however, for court proceedings, both in appeals from decisions by the Patent Office to an administrative court and cases tried by ordinary courts of law.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that arrangements be made to protect business secrets in connection with trademark applications processed by the Patent Office and that changes also be made in the provisions relating to confidentiality in courts of law. However, information that is relevant to the origin, extent or validity of exclusive rights should never be subject to confidentiality.</p>
<p>Right to bring an action; declaratory actions</p>
<p>The Trademark Act contains provisions on the right to bring actions and on declaratory actions. The Committee proposes that such provisions should not be included in the new Act, which would mean that the general procedural provisions would be applicable.</p>
<h2>Business names</h2>
<p>General points of departure</p>
<p>The Committee recognizes that dealing with trademarks and business names in one and the same Act would have certain advantages. However, such a course would have far-reaching consequences that are difficult to foresee, and it may be inferred from the Government’s terms of reference that business names and trademarks should continue to be regulated in different acts. Regulating them in a single act would also be inconsistent with the principle of harmonized legislation in the Nordic countries.</p>
<p>In many respects the provisions of the Trademark Act are similar to those of the Business Names Act, and some of the amendments proposed by the Committee with respect to trademarks are similar to those proposed for the Business Names Act.</p>
<p>A distinctive character should not be a condition for registration of a business name</p>
<p>The Committee proposes abolishing the requirement that a business name must have a distinctive character in the context of the business concerned. Registration should, however, continue to provide protection for business names that are distinctive.</p>
<p>This proposal does not affect assessment of the extent of exclusive rights associated with business names that are distinctive and therefore have a legitimate claim to protection. A registered business name that is devoid of any distinctive character should not, however, continue to enjoy protection by virtue of registration. This change may appear to be a change for the worse, but this is not really the case, since the existence of a distinctive character is a necessary condition for continued registration and thus for the scope of the exclusive right.</p>
<p>Business descriptions</p>
<p>The Committee has discussed whether it is necessary to require more detailed business descriptions than is the case today. This would have many advantages, but the Committee has decided not to propose any new requirements in this respect.</p>
<p>There is, however, a great deal to be said for classifying business descriptions in company registers on the basis of the Swedish Trade Classification. Such a classification would be very useful as an administrative aid.</p>
<p>Scope of statutory examinations; the registration procedure</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the examination ex officio  made by the registration authorities should, as with trademarks, be restricted to absolute grounds for refusal.</p>
<p>The opposition procedure</p>
<p>There is at present no opposition procedure in connection with the registration of business names. But in a system where business names are registered without any prior examination ex officio of</p>
<p>relative grounds for refusal, the holders of earlier rights must have the opportunity to oppose registration. The Committee proposes the introduction of an opposition procedure providing the possibility of opposing registration. The opposition procedure should be the same for business names as for trademarks.</p>
<p>Preliminary examination of business names</p>
<p>In a report submitted to the Committee the Patent Office proposes a system that would allow a preliminary examination of business names. The Committee has concluded that such a system should not be introduced. This conclusion is related, among other things, to the Committee’s proposal that distinctiveness should not be a condition for registration of a business name and to the proposal to abolish examinations ex officio  of relative grounds for refusal.</p>
<p>Distinction between registration of a business name and registration of the legal entity to which the name relates</p>
<p>The Committee proposes the introduction of a new section in the Business Names Act which expressly stipulates that a business name is either to be registered in connection with registration of the legal entity to which the name relates or, if the business name relates to a legal entity that is already registered, in a separate procedure.</p>
<p>The Committee also proposes that a provision be introduced to make it clear that the revocation of the registration of a business name does not affect the registration of the legal entity to which the name relates. This would make it clear that the registration of a business name can be revoked while the legal entity remains.</p>
<p>Partial revocation</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the registration of a business name can be revoked in respect of some of the activities for which it is registered.</p>
<p>Revocation of a business name by decision of a registration authority</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that it should be possible to revoke the registration of a business name by decision of a registration authority. The proposal is the same as that described above with reference to trademarks.</p>
<p>Compensation in connection with infringement of a business name etc.</p>
<p>The provisions proposed by the Committee concerning compensation for trademark infringements and prosecution in connection with such infringements should also apply to infringements of business names.</p>
<p>Consequences of the Committee’s proposals</p>
<p>The Committee concludes that its proposals would reduce the cost of the Patent Office’s processing of registration applications. Another consequence would be that most trademarks and business names would be registered much more quickly than is the case today. Even if the number of opposition procedures increases, as anticipated, it should be possible to reduce the charges for application procedures for the registration of trademarks and business names, or at least not to raise them. The proposals should not involve any major changes for the administrative courts, the ordinary courts of law or other public authorities.</p>
