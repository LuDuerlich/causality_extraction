<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Terms of reference</h2>
<p>According to the terms of reference the Committee is to analyse questions that arise with reference to the Council’s decision concerning a new implementing regulation for the competition rules in Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty, the so-called work of modernisation.</p>
<p>The assignment includes examining</p>
<p>• whether the rules in Section 8 of the Competition Act concerning individual exemption from the prohibition in Section 6 of the Competition Act against restrictive agreements between undertakings should be amended to constitute a permanently applicable general exception,</p>
<p>• whether the right of undertakings to obtain negative clearance should be abolished,</p>
<p>• whether the Swedish Competition Authority should be given the legal authority – in the same way as the Commission – to enjoin structural measures and make commitments by undertakings legally binding.</p>
<p>Further, the Committee shall</p>
<p>• consider amendments to the Swedish procedural rules in view of the new implementing regulation,</p>
<p>• analyse to what extent the present provisions of the Competition Act concerning procedure, investigations, sanctions etc can be applied and are appropriate in the light of the new implementing regulation</p>
<p>• consider whether the rules concerning assistance to the Commission in connection with investigations should be amended.</p>
<p>Another task is to carry out a general examination of whether the circle of parties entitled to damages under the Competition Act should be extended. In addition the Committee is to review the method of calculating the administrative fine in combinations of undertakings as well as the application of the law in connection with ancillary restraints.</p>
<p>Under its terms of reference the Committee is to report its assignment with reference to a new implementing regulation, where amendments to Swedish rules are deemed necessary before application of the regulation, by 31 July 2003 at the latest and in other respects by 31 January 2004.</p>
<p>In this progress report the Committee is reporting on the first stage of its assignment.</p>
<h2>Outline of the report</h2>

<p>Chapters  5–11   contain the Committee’s deliberations on the various issues in question. In each of these chapters a more detailed account is given of the relevant parts of Community law, Swedish law and the new implementing regulation.</p>
<p>In chapter 5  the Committee deals with questions concerning the relationship between Community competition legislation and national competition legislation, particularly in the light of the principle of the primacy of Community law over national law.</p>
<p>Chapter 6  deals with the role of the national courts in the new regulatory system.</p>
<p>In chapter 7  the Committee considers how present rules on exemption and negative clearance are to be adapted to the new regulatory system at Community level.</p>
<p>Chapter 8  discusses particularly whether the system of block exemption regulations should be retained in the new regulatory system.</p>
<p>Chapter 9  deals with the measures that the Swedish Competition Authority may take against infringements of the competition prohibitions.</p>
<p>In chapter 10  the Committee describes its considerations on matters concerning investigations at Community level and national level and the co-operation and assistance required.</p>

<p>In chapter 12  the Committee describes the consequences of its proposals.</p>
<p>Chapter 13 , finally, contains explanatory notes.</p>
<h2>The considerations of the Committee</h2>
<p>The new implementing regulation is intended to decentralise the application of Community competition legislation so that the member states’ competition authorities are given a more prominent role than has been the case up to now, as the Commission has been entirely dominant. The present prior authorisation in the form of individual exemptions and negative clearance, determined by the Commission, will be abolished. The Commission will instead concentrate on intervening against serious infringements of the prohibition rules.</p>
<p>The Swedish Competition Act was framed using the Community competition legislation as a model. Both the substantial prohibition rules and the procedure and sanctions closely correspond to applicable Community law. The Swedish competition authorities are also empowered to apply the prohibition rules in the Community competition legislation.</p>
<p>In these circumstances two questions arise. Do the changes in Community law imply a need to change the Swedish rules concerning national competence to apply Community law? Should the Swedish competition rules be changed in any respect to preserve conformity with Community law? One point of departure for the Committee has been that the Swedish competition legislation should continue to follow Community law as closely as possible.</p>
<p>The relationship between Community law and national law</p>
<p>The Committee first deals with the question of whether any national competition legislation is necessary at all besides Community law and reaches the conclusion that such is the case, for example in the light of the fact that it is not known what the effect on trade criterion in Community law will imply and thus also how far the Community competition rules will reach.</p>
<p>Article 3 of the implementing regulation contains provisions concerning the relation between on the one hand Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty and national competition law on the other. After an analysis of these regulations the Committee arrives at the conclusion that they imply that Community law must be applied as soon as the effect on trade criterion is met and that Community law in other cases may not be applied. It is true that the provisions allow that national law be applied in parallel with Community law, but such an application may not lead to any other result than an application of Community law, except in certain cases of unilateral conduct. The Committee therefore proposes a system whereby Community law shall be applied when the effect on trade criterion has been met and the prohibition rules in the Competition Act shall be applied when the effect on trade criterion is not met.</p>
<p>The role of the national courts</p>
<p>Article 15 of the implementing regulation deals with co-operation between national courts and the Commission and the national competition authorities. This article stipulates that the courts may request information and statements from the Commission. Further, national competition authorities and the Commission may make written statements to national courts. With the court’s permission they may also make statements orally.</p>
<p>The Committee has considered how such statements should be treated in a Swedish court case and has arrived at the conclusion that most questions concerning procedure can be solved without special legislative measures. What is needed is a rule that a written statement may be ignored if considerable inconvenience would otherwise arise in the legal proceedings.</p>
<p>A more problematical question is the extent to which the court ex officio may use a statement as a basis for its decision. The ques-</p>
<p>tion must be seen in the light of the case law of the European Court of Justice, which indicates that competition law is often not amenable to out-of-court settlement. The Committee proposes a rule of law entailing that a statement from the Commission or the Swedish Competition Authority may be considered by the court without any party having invoked it.</p>
<p>Exemptions and negative clearance</p>
<p>One of the major new features in the new implementing regulation is that the Commission’s prior authorisation through decisions on exemption and negative clearance has been abolished and replaced by a directly applicable exemption rule. In this light the Committee proposes that the corresponding system at national level should also be abolished and likewise replaced by a directly applicable exemption rule, both when the Competition Authority applies Community law and when the Authority applies the prohibition rules of the Competition Act. The proposed system means that undertakings would assess for themselves whether their contracts and procedures were compatible with the competition rules.</p>
<p>Block exemptions</p>
<p>Under the new implementing regulation the system of block exemptions is to remain. Under the provisions of a Council Regulation the Commission shall thus be able to declare that Article 81.1 is not to be applicable to certain categories of contract, decisions by associations of undertakings or concerted practices.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the Swedish rules on block exemptions be abolished. The reason put forward by the Committee is that the block exemptions cannot function any longer as an administrative relief when the system of individual exemptions has been abolished. Nor will Swedish block exemptions be able to serve as guidance when there are block exemptions at Community level and the limit of the area of application of Community law is unclear. Finally, it may be questioned from the point of view of the constitution that block exemptions, which have important civil law effects, should be issued in the form of a regulation.</p>
<p>Injunctions and commitments</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the Competition Authority continue to be able to enjoin undertakings to discontinue infringements of Sections 6 and 19 of the Competition Act and Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty. Under the new implementing regulation the Commission may enjoin undertakings to take structural measures, which it would seem includes the dissolution of an undertaking into different parts. The Committee does not propose any corresponding rule for the Swedish Competition Authority. A previous Committee reached the conclusion that dissolution is not viable as a method of rectifying distortion of competition (see SOU 2001:94 – Swedish Government Official Reports 2001:94). Even after renewed consideration the Committee maintains that it is not appropriate to introduce dissolution rules at national level.</p>
<p>According to Article 9 of the implementing regulation the Commission may approve a commitment from an undertaking that in the preliminary assessment of the Commission has violated a prohibition. Through the decision the Commission may make the commitment binding. According to the regulation a national competition authority shall also be able to approve commitments and the Committee proposes provisions in the Competition Act to that effect. The fact that the Authority approves a commitment means that the question of an injunction does not arise. The Committee, however, proposes rules stipulating that a decision giving approval may be recalled on certain explicitly specified conditions.</p>
<p>Investigations</p>
<p>In Articles 20–22 of the implementing regulation there are provisions on inspections determined by the Commission, on assistance to national authorities and on other co-operation on investigations.</p>
<p>The Committee notes that the present Swedish rules on this are sufficient in most respects. Two questions, however, require statutory regulation. Under Article 21 the Commission may decide on inspection at a place other than at the undertaking concerned. Such a decision may not be implemented without prior authorisation by the national legal authority in the member state concerned. The Committee proposes that the Stockholm City Court should consider matters concerning prior approval. Further, supplementary rules are needed to allow the Competition Authority to carry out investigations at the request of the Commission and other EU member states.</p>
<p>Co-operation in the network</p>
<p>The Competition Authority will represent Sweden in the network co-operation. How the co-operation will manifest itself is not as yet clear, but it will probably not require any legislative measures in Sweden.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes in this section an amendment to the Secrecy Act so that secrecy is to apply to information held by the Competition Authority that the Authority has obtained through investigations on behalf of the Commission or the competition authority in another EU member state. Further, the Committee proposes an exemption from the special right to take legal action under the present Section 23, second paragraph of the Competition Act for such cases where the Competition Authority has rejected a complaint due to the fact that another competition authority in the EU is dealing with the case. In such a situation, in the opinion of the Committee, it is not warranted to refer the question to the consideration of the Market Court.</p>
<p>Date of coming into force</p>
<p>The new implementing regulation shall be applied from 1 May 2004 inclusive. The Committee proposes that the Swedish amendments to the law come into force on that date. Further, the Committee proposes transition rules among other things for contracts and procedures for which exemptions or negative clearance have been determined or that are covered by a block exemption. These transition rules only apply, however, to contracts and procedures where the effect on trade criterion is not met.</p>
