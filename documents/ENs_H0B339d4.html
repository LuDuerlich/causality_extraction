<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Costs for new roads and railways presently add up to more than</p>
<p>SEK 20 billion per year (€2 billion). A project’s first step is a prestudy and the projecting is a further vital component of the process leading up to the actual construction. The purpose of projecting is to describe the way in which a project is to be built, the ultimate purpose being to establish a design which minimizes costs for procurer and society at large. Costs include both design expenses, construction costs as well as costs for future use of new road or railway, including not only maintenance but also user costs.</p>
<p>The purpose of the present report is to address the way in which projecting tenders may be designed: How can the tendering process and the subsequent layout of the designer’s remuneration be crafted in order to contribute to life cycle cost minimisation? The answer to this question is particularly pertinent in view of that the possibility to find cost minimizing solutions is larger in the early phases of the process when it is still feasible to adapt to the specific circumstances at each construction site.</p>
<p>The bulk of the report addresses projecting of investments contracted under the unit price format; this is by far the most common type of contract in use in Sweden. Under this regime, a designer is contracted separately from the tendering of the construction firm. The projecting tender is based on a description of the documents which are to be delivered. The bidder with the economically best submission is contracted, meaning that it is not only price but typically also quality aspects of the bids that are selected. Quality is defined in order to capture the respective bidders’ competence.</p>
<p>Two problems in the current way to tender projecting are identified. The first is that current payment mechanisms provide poor brakes on cost increases during the design process. In particular, a reference is made to a paragraph in the standard framework for this type of consulting contract which establishes that the consultant is entitled to being paid for actual time spent on the assignment irrespective of the maximum time in the initial contract. In addition, there is a risk for strategic bidding by way of unbalanced bids where a bidder makes the assessment that the principal has made a mistake in the assessment of time required to undertake a task. Moreover, bidders can speculate over the possibility of future additions to the original contract, opening up for bilateral negotiations and better (higher) prices than in the original contract.</p>
<p>The risk for strategic bidding means that the ultimate purpose of tendering to select the most efficient bidder is jeopardized and also that contracts get to be more costly than originally contracted. There is, however, scant empirical evidence on this matter. Information during the present study, however, points to that most design contracts turn out to be more costly than in the signed version and that cost overdrafts range from 25 up to 300 percent.</p>
<p>A second challenge is to identify a bid which combines price and quality. The tendering agency wishes to buy highly professional consultants but does not want to pay more than necessary for quality. A well prepared project design may contribute to a low cost for the subsequent construction project. But the more time spent to identify innovative solutions, the more costly will the design phase be. Today’s approach to identify quality includes promoting bidders with good training, much experience etc. These qualities do however not guarantee that the most innovative designers are hired. The conventional way of design tendering does therefore not promote creativity and the minimization of life cycle costs.</p>
<p>One policy change which may contribute to the handling of these problems is to avoid references to the standard contract design model. In particular it may be reason to pay for the “thinking about alternative approaches” in the design by a cost plus contract while the more mechanical production of drawings etc. is rewarded under a fixed price scheme.</p>
<p>A second recommendation is to deliberate further on the precise model to combine price and quality when the winning bid is to be identified. A reference about how this could be done is given.</p>
<p>A third possibility is to choose bidder based not only on the costs for preparing the design but also to include an estimate of the subsequent construction costs in the mechanism. The designer would therefore be paid not only for the drawings etc. which are prepared but also for any cost savings relative to an ex ante estimate. Likewise, the payment would include a deduction if subsequent costs turn out to be higher than anticipated. This creates incentives for the consultant to be involved also during construction and to try to find cost saving solutions during the whole process.</p>
<p>This study is preliminary in that the suggestions for policy improvements are still vague. It is therefore strongly recommended that further development shall be based on controlled experiments in order to better understand which contract designs best promote the minimization of life cycle costs for new infrastructure.</p>

<h2>Foreword</h2>
<p>This study titled “Improving Productivity Using Procurement</p>
<p>Methods – an international comparison concerning roads” was ordered by “Sweden’s Productivity Committee” and was performed by Transportation and Highway Engineering Department of Aalto University. The main purpose was to identify project delivery methods that best influence productivity of the road building contractors and includes both capital investment projects and maintenance contracting practices. The project anticipates finding better practices, lessons learned, and factors that relate to productivity increases from a procurement perspective.</p>
<p>There was a concern that the productivity levels in the construction sector in Sweden were in general weak, lagging behind other sectors and needed further examination. This study is not aimed at productivity measurements or statistics, but mainly how productivity relates to project delivery methods. A comparison or so called benchmarking approach was conducted to determine different practices and how procurement methods influence productivity from the selected countries.</p>
<p>The results of this report identify factors that influence to productivity and which procurement models might perform better. It is important to understand the practices used elsewhere and hopefully new findings can be adapted into the Swedish context. The results are presented in the subsequent sections and we hope that other practitioners can benefit from the findings.</p>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p>Productivity is an important measure and is an important indicator of the industry’s performance. Productivity is also controversial and difficult to measure accurately, especially when attempting to identify productivity levels of road building contractors. However, productivity data can be used as an indicator to show trends and whether it is favorable or unfavorable. The objective of this study was to examine how the infrastructure clients can influence the productivity of contractors through the procurement practices. This was accomplished by responses to questionnaires and face-toface interviews.</p>
<h2>Capital Projects</h2>
<p>The Design-Build (DB) method is clearly seen as the most promising method used to influence the productivity of contractors. The main benefits of the Design-Build model are the potential to foster innovation, efficiency and customer oriented solutions (especially time savings) by integrating the design and construction phases.</p>
<p>The variants of the Design-Build such as; Design-Build-OperateMaintain (DBOM), Design-Build-Finance-Operate (DBFO & DBFM) and the more private financial models of Build-Own-OperateTransfer (BOOT, BOO & BOT) also include the Design-Build component and they have the potential to positively influence productivity. These variants of Design-Build do not have the test in time for any objective conclusions. However comments during the interviews have been quoted as “somewhat promising” and often results in quicker project completion and various forms of innovation. Further information on the Design-Build model is discussed in more detail in Sections 2 and 3.</p>
<p>One significant finding is that it is possible to foster productivity in any procurement method by including factors and concepts mentioned in this report or accrued elsewhere. Another significant outcome is that many countries do not perform a systematic evaluation that objectively compares the results of different project delivery methods, but merely a subjective approach.</p>
<p>In the final state, the productivity is driven by the contractors’ processes, methodology, ingenuity, project management skills, innovation, and lean construction practices (this means reducing waste in all phases). The main influence by the client is to use the best procurement method for the project and allow enough freedom for the contractors without corrupting the objectives of the customers using the roads. There is no guarantee for success, but the clients should provide the best opportunity or framework for success.</p>
<p>Also, what works in one country may not necessarily function properly in another country and it is wise and practical to implement those features that produce productivity gains in their own application. The DB model and the Performance Based Service Agreements (PBSA) are considered the mostly likely forms to increase the productivity.</p>
<p>Some factors contributing to productivity are included in the following list. These factors can be broadly applied and a few are procurement related while others are not.  Performance-based requirements (functional requirements)  Innovative or Alternative Technical Concepts (ATCs)  Time based criteria, like lane rental and A + B Bidding (Accelerate projects)  Prefabricated & off site production  (self-propelled bridge transport)  Building Information Model (BIM) – not fully developed  Intelligent/automated machinery  Bundling of projects  Partnering – Indirectly  Risk balancing</p>
<h2>Maintenance</h2>
<p>Productivity measurements for maintenance are even more difficult and not measured by any public entity. The main productivity factor in maintenance contracts is open competition for services. Most countries included in the study outsource maintenance and most use a performance based approach. Further information on Performance Based Service Agreements (PBSA) is discussed in more detail in Section 4.</p>
<p>The main factors contributing to productivity in maintenance contracts are listed as follows:  Using the hybrid model as a balanced approach  Performance based approach  Longer term contracts (greater than five years)  Incentives & disincentives (if possible/practical)  Bundling and integration of services (economies of scope)  Increasing the length of area based contracts (economies of scale)  Partnering – Indirectly  Measuring the performance of the service providers  Clearly defined risks in the contract and having a balanced approach (equitable)  Encouraging innovation (difficult in practice without a reward scheme)</p>
<p>A hybrid method in maintenance contracts seems to be a trend as the risks may be more equitably balanced. Only one country (Ontario, Canada) has contract durations that are over 10 years, and some are taking advantage of integrated services and the economies of scale and scope.</p>
<p>What works well in one country may find cultural differences in another country that do not necessarily achieve the same benefits. It is wise to implement those features that produce productivity gains in their own application and the PBSA are considered the mostly likely forms to increase the productivity.</p>
<p>Having a well-organized and efficient maintenance regime certainly improves productivity, but they are mainly dependent upon the contractor’s processes and practices. The main influence by the clients is to establish a framework for success by using maintenance contracts that provide opportunities for efficiency and productivity. This may require a learning process and reengineering the practices to influence the proper results. The biggest challenge is to create a healthy and competitive market for the maintenance services so that innovation, efficiency and productivity can be realized.</p>
<h2>1. Introduction, Background and Objectives</h2>
<p>This research study originated from Sweden’s Productivity Committee and was performed by the Transportation and Highway Engineering Department of Aalto University, in Helsinki, Finland. The project manager for the project is Pekka Pakkala from Aalto University and the steering was provided by Monika Selahn from the Sweden’s Productivity Committee. The main purpose is to derive international examples, practices, lessons learned and significant findings that are related to the productivity of the infrastructure (road building) contractors with the focus on procurement methods. The findings are based upon an international study that investigates both capital intensive projects as well as maintenance contracts.</p>
<p>This study is not aimed at productivity measurements or statistics, but mainly at how productivity relates to project delivery methods.</p>
<h2>1.1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Statistics collected and reported from Swedish governmental authorities reveal that the productivity in the construction sector, in general, has been weak, and lagging behind other sectors. Productivity is a link to the economy of a country and is an important measure to pursue and track.</p>
<p>The Productivity Committee was assigned the task to evaluate how the Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) procures road infrastructure and how the agency fosters or promotes productivity and innovation in the road sector. The main tool that clients can influence productivity is through the public procurement processes. Therefore, it was necessary to evaluate productivity from a procurement perspective. The Committee ordered this international study to further examine issues related to productivity from a procurement viewpoint.</p>
<h2>1.2 Background</h2>
<p>A preliminary survey revealed that some countries have been using alternative procurement methods (compared to the traditional model or Design-Bid-Build) to gain efficiencies, cost savings, quicker delivery of projects, and value added benefits to society. The Design-Build model and some of its advanced variants have been endorsed through practical results, reports, studies and benchmarking. It is important to examine if such practices might be more profound to promoting productivity. Therefore, it was decided to seek practices from progressive countries in order to help stimulate productivity and be applied to the Swedish context.</p>
<p>Six countries were selected which include England, Finland, Holland, Sweden, Ontario, Canada, and three states in the USA. Virginia Department of Transportation, Maryland State Highway Administration, and the Minnesota Department of Transportation (by telephone interview) were selected from the USA. Many of these countries are considered pro-active in the use of alternative procurement methods for road applications and were selected as good examples of different and broad approaches.</p>
<p>Productivity is generally reported in terms of productivity of the entire construction sector and not only from the infrastructure (road) contractors. The true productivity results are virtually impossible to determine under the present scenarios.</p>
<p>Considering the time constraints and the funding, a quantitative approach was not feasible. Instead the paper is based on more of a qualitative approach through structured interviews and a thoughtful analysis of the most significant aspects related to procurement methods and productivity. The duration of this project is from December 2010 through November 2011.</p>
<h2>1.3 Methodology</h2>
<p>The research methodology gathered resources through published reports, technical papers, internet searches, and with experts in the industry. Structured interviews with the respective road authorities using a custom-made questionnaire were the main source of data collection and the questionnaire is shown in Appendix B. The interviews were conducted during January through June in 2011 and Appendix C shows a listing of the organizations interviewed.</p>
<p>The author’s long-term experience, previous reports, and practical experience in procurement practices, especially in DesignBuild, provided additional insight by information contained in Pakkala (2002) and Pakkala et al. (2007).</p>
<p>This study is a qualitative approach as opposed to a rigorous and statistical approach as time and budget were a consideration.</p>
<h2>1.4 Objectives</h2>
<p>The objective of the study was to determine what factors can potentially increase or decrease the productivity of road building contractors through the public procurement processes and potentially identify how productivity is influenced in these models. The research objectives are summarized as follows:  To identify the types of procurement practices used in other countries  To identify practices used in other countries  To determine the benefits, challenges, and issues with alternative project delivery methods  To determine arguments used for differing models  To identify factors that influence to productivity and innovation  To determine the lessons learned from other countries</p>
<p>The expected/predicted benefits were that the outcomes from the study will be a catalyst for increasing the usage of procurement methods that may provide an increase in productivity. Some of the expected results include:  Determining procurement methods that have better results  Identification of practices that promote innovation and productivity  Determining factors that increase productivity and efficiency  Can there be any Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) relating to productivity  What are the challenges for implementation</p>
<h2>1.5 Procurement Methods</h2>
<p>The main tool available for clients or owner agencies to influence the productivity of contractors is through public procurement processes. One cannot just simply demand productivity from the contractors, but has the opportunity via the procurement process. The delivery methods used for capital construction projects have been mainly traditional methods that have typically evolved from history. Architects, engineers, specialty contractors, and the industry have adopted a segmented rather than an integrated approach with design and construction. This might be referred to the specialization of professionals and organizations. Recently and over several decades there has been a slow and deliberate paradigm change that is seeking so-called “alternative methods” or integration of services for the infrastructure. One main theme is the integration of design and construction.</p>
<p>In Sweden, the Swedish Transport Administration describes their guidelines in a form of a “business model” and how they should function. The functions are divided in four areas:</p>
<p>Before the tendering phase, the organization is liable to decide on these four areas and in the decision motivate their choice of business-model.</p>
<p>There are numerous forms and models for the procurement practices and Appendix A includes a list of definitions. The typical project delivery models used for road projects can be highlighted as follow:  Design-Bid-Build (D-B-B)  Design-Build (DB)  Construction Management (CM  At-Fee)  Construction Management (CM  At-Risk)  Design-Build-Operate (DBO) or Design-Build-Operate-Maintain (DBOM)  Design-Build-Finance-Operate (DBFO) or known as DesignBuild-Finance-Maintain (DBFM)  Build-Own-Operate (BOO), Build Operate Transfer (BOT) and Build Own Operate Transfer (BOOT)  Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) – a form of the Alliance model  Recently the “ Alliance model ”</p>
<p>The Design-Bid-Build (DBB) or so-called traditional method has a separation between the design phase and the construction phase. The design phase is completed first and usually by a professional design firm or by the in-house resources and experts of the owner agency. Once the design documentation is completed, the construction is tendered separately and in a linear process. The contracts are typically “unit prices”, but some are using fixed price or lump sum agreements. DBB projects typically require a significant amount of administration and manual processes, and how quality control is organized and managed. The quantities in the unit priced contracts can sometimes be a source of negotiations and tension, which may lead to additional compromises and possibly increases in costs.</p>
<p>The Design-Build (DB) model is defined as an agreement when an organization agrees to complete the remaining portion of the client’s design and to construct the project. This essentially means that the design and construction are integrated and that the contractor typically takes on more risks because there is both design and construction work in a single contract. The contracts are typically fixed price or lump sum.</p>
<p>In some countries, the Construction Management – At Fee or</p>
<p>At Risk (CM@Fee & CM@Risk) is often referred to as “ Construction Manager General Contractor ”. This is typically used when the agency/client does not have sufficient management skills or resources to manage and administer the project execution phase. The owner agency is responsible for the design, bidding process, and construction of a project. In the CM@Fee, the CM organization takes on the responsibility for administration and management, constructability issues, day-to-day activities, and assumes an advisory role throughout the project. The CM organization has no contractual obligation to the design and construction entities and merely acts like a design consultant advisor. When using the Construction Management - At Risk (CM@Risk) approach, the owner/client has one agreement with the Construction Manager, who then interacts with the design consultant and subsequently takes on the role of a general contractor. Generally, the CM@Risk model assumes more risk because the contractor is at risk for the project cost and schedule. Most road agencies have strong project management skills and the CM model mainly provides additional quality oversight. However, when an organization is downsized too thin or does not have the sophistication required in project management, then this form of procurement might be a substitute. Presently, this is being tested in a few countries and the model offers an alternative approach (termed as Construction Manager General Contractor), but the design and construction is still separate.</p>
<h2>Progression of Project Delivery Steps</h2>
<p>The alternative variants of the DB model include DBOM, DBFO, DBFM, Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) and the Alliance model. The BOT and BOOT are similar to the DBOM and DBFO model, but there is an official transfer of ownership, with potential leasing and other options. The main goals of these are to produce projects that have better or equivalent quality, longer life cycles, bring savings to the client, transfer risks (to the organization best able to manage risks), include integrated processes, and potentially complete projects faster than traditional methods. Many of these methods are recent practices and are on-going, so there has not been any significant Value for Money (VfM) results to date. Some of these more advanced models (DBFM & DBFO) require significantly increased knowledge, understanding, wisdom, and their application when going into unknown territory, especially if it is the first time implementing the model.</p>
<p>The ECI and Alliance model are like an extreme Design-Build model, where an alliance is formed early on to take advantage of inputs/impacts during the project planning phase. It includes the design and construction in one contract. Pakkala et al. (2007) and Koppinen & Lahdenpera (2004) provide more details on the Alliance model. There is a significant variation known as  multi-parameter bidding called A + B Bidding, but it is not a project delivery method. It is actually a contractor selection method on how to determine the winning bid by using a time component to build the project and costs per day. The “A” portion is the total cost bid by the contractor for completion of project and the “B” portion is the total number of days to complete the project. The “B” portion is multiplied by the estimated cost per day (client supplied statistical data), times the number of days that the contractor expects to complete the project. The “A” and “B” component are added together and contract is awarded to the lowest combination price. There are also options like incentives and disincentives, which are typically used in conjunction with the A + B bidding method.</p>
<p>Also, a few have used the option of “quality” in the form of warranties. This method is more commonly used in the USA.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that one size does not fit all and that each project delivery method has its advantages and challenges. A wise client will understand and choose the right delivery mechanism for the right project. This requires good benchmarking, knowing the strengths and weaknesses, and the key drivers for the given project. All models are capable of delivering a successful project and each model should be used appropriately.</p>
<h2>1.6 Productivity Issues</h2>
<p>During the literature review, productivity can be defined in many ways and not always interpreted in the same manner. Sometimes productivity is broadly described in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, performance, and even profit. In the manufacturing industry productivity is fairly well recognized and is typically described as the relation of output to all inputs. Increases in productivity are generally favored and decreases are typically frowned upon.</p>
<h2>Productivity Definition and Measurement</h2>
<p>This leads to the issue of having a common definition of productivity that is used consistently. A simple definition of productivity is defined as the amount of output per unit of input, which could be labor, equipment, or capital. Productivity in this study is defined as the value of output divided by the value of all inputs. If value can be added or increased into the numerator portion of the productivity equation, then there should be productivity gains. Likewise, if the denominator portion can be reduced (more for less), then there are productivity gains too. So the real challenge is how do we get more value or less cost , so that productivity can increase, since most project budgets are fixed?</p>
<p>Tangen (2005) describes productivity in several ways, such as:  faculty to produce  units of output per unit of input  actual output per expected resources used  total income per costs and profit  value added per input of production factors  as the ratio of what is produced to what is required to produce it</p>
<p>According to Huang et al. (2009) there can be three main levels of productivity to consider. First is the task level, which is measured by the contractors and is considered confidential or unattainable because this is the contractor’s competitive advantage. The second is the project level productivity, which potentially is a reasonable measure that clients could benchmark, but requires significant administration and understanding to the consequences of productivity. The third level is the industry level, where the productivity comparisons are typically benchmarked across differing sectors. Timmer et al. (2007) and Chapman et al. (2010) recommend consideration of a multifactor approach and where deflators can be applied during differing price levels, quality changes, and other indexing variables.</p>
<p>There are also indirect ways to influence productivity. The normal research and development practices of contractors, if available, have an effect on productivity. As an example, newer modern equipment is much more flexible and multi-purpose as opposed to older equipment, and can influence the productivity. Some of the most dramatic inventions in history were reported by the Building Futures Council (2006) highlighted as:  Electricity and electric motors  The internal combustion engine  Petroleum &  molecular-engineering processes  Cluster of entertainment, communications, & information systems</p>
<p>This study is not aimed at productivity measurements or statistics, but mainly how productivity relates to project delivery methods.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>One challenge is that the infrastructure clients are not directly measuring the productivity of the infrastructure contractors. Productivity statistics are generally measured by other governmental institutions and organizations, such as statistical authorities, and as an aggregate measure. Even then, the productivity is a representation of all construction types and not merely of those for the road infrastructure. In Sweden, the productivity is an aggregate measure for companies constructing buildings and infrastructure for energy as well as transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>Productivity measurements are usually measured at the same time construction is put in place. Some roads are more durable and have longer life cycles compared to others. As an example, if a better quality road is desired, it may be more durable over time, but may have lower productivity values. It is therefore difficult to assess the productivity over time and especially when compared to quality. This is an interesting and somewhat challenging aspect when assessing productivity data.</p>
<p>A productivity comparison in the construction sector is typically compared with the manufacturing industry and other industries. However, this is an unfair comparison. Road construction is normally performed in outdoor environment, susceptible to all types of weather related impacts, and not in ideal indoor environments as with typical manufacturing. Also, according to Olander (2010) maintenance is not included in the other sectors, but may be included in the road sector. This is something to consider when comparing results. This is where conflicts usually occur and where it is virtually impossible to compare the total construction productivity values, because there are no uniform measures that can be used for systematic comparisons.</p>
<p>Some of the challenges when discussing productivity include: are we measuring the right attributes; is the data accuracy high enough; is the definition used and understood by all stakeholders; is it a fair comparison when benchmarking one industry against others; at what level do you measure productivity; is it possible to determine productivity impacts using different procurement methods; and are you able to determine what caused the increase or decrease of true productivity .</p>
<p>If productivity is currently not measured by the clients, should they begin measuring productivity? This can lead to many challenges for the clients and could be a significant amount of administration and cost.</p>
<p>Productivity is certainly an issue that will continue to be discussed and debated. It should be as objective as possible in order to allow comparisons.</p>
<h2>1.7 Productivity via Procurement</h2>
<p>The intent of this project is to investigate productivity from a procurement perspective and is usually accomplished through the public procurement process. If productivity gains are a priority, then it is important to determine which procurement methods increase the potential for productivity. Even if a certain model might be potentially more advantageous, the productivity gains may not always be automatic. It is important to understand what practices are used and why? Do alternative practices provide better performance, success, time savings, quality, or Valve for Money (VfM) compared to traditional models? These are important issues to obtain a comprehensive understanding of what models are available and which ones produce better outcomes or benefits.</p>
<p>Factors that reduce productivity are also important to identify so that clients are not directly contributing to any unproductive consequences for the contractors. It is not the intent of this report to concentrate on the productivity statistical measurements and mechanisms, but it is important to understand that there are significant challenges when measuring productivity.</p>
<p>Alternative project delivery methods are relatively new to the infrastructure sector, especially for roads. Therefore, it is important to understand the implication of using different project delivery methods and what are the challenges for implementation.</p>

<h2>2. Design-Build Model</h2>
<p>This section discusses the details, research findings, benefits, challenges, and important features in the Design-Build (DB) model, also called Design & Construct. DB has been termed as an innovative or alternative model compared to the traditional model of DesignBid-Build (DBB). All advanced variants of Design-Build namely DBOM, DBFO, ECI and Alliance models, use the Design-Build component. More information and aspects of the DB model are provided hereafter.</p>
<p>The traditional model or DBB is widely understood and has been the common method for centuries during the industrial revolution. The Design-Build method has its roots to ancient times according to Dorsey (1997) when it was used as the main procurement method during the time of the pyramids and the “Master Builder” concept. The design and construction were performed by one organization and in an integrated fashion. The Design-Build model is basically described as a procurement method, where the contractor is responsible for completing the client’s remaining design portion and constructing the project.</p>
<h2>2.1 Studies & Observations</h2>
<p>There have been numerous studies around the world addressing the Design-Build model and its use. Probably the most comprehensive study involved the comparison of DBB, DB and CM@Risk, and was termed as the Construction Industry Institute study in CII (1997). The results of this study clearly identified Design-Build as the best performer based upon data from the research. Even though the study was applicable to buildings and industrial projects, the  Design-Build  component is the main feature that provides the overwhelming benefits . Some of the key findings from the study are summarized in Box 1.</p>
<h2>Box 1. Main Results from CII Study</h2>
<p> Design & construction speed in DB is faster compared to DBB & CM@Risk  Design & construction cost growth in DB is lower than DBB & CM@Risk  Design & construction schedule growth is lowest in CM@Risk, but DB is lower than DBB  Quality of DB is equivalent to CM@Risk and greater than DBB  Intensity of DB is greater than DBB & CM@Risk</p>
<p>A more recent study by Ellis et al. (2007) contains interesting findings from road transportation projects at the Florida Department of Transportation. The study benchmarked a total of 3130 road projects and the results clearly showed that the project delivery method chosen does indeed affect the project performance . The study compares alternative project delivery methods with the traditional method (DBB). The alternative project delivery projects included Design-Build, A + B bidding, lane rental, incentives and disincentives, lump sum, warranties, and a few others not commonly used by the participants in this productivity study. The main findings include:  Design-Build projects had about 50% less cost growth compared to traditional projects  Lump sum projects have experienced the lowest average cost growth  Alternative contracting projects had four times lower total time growth compared to traditional ones  Alternative and traditional contracting have about the same contractor performance  Design-Build projects saved about 54 455 project days (from 68 projects)  The comparison of award cost to the FDOT official estimate were about 10% higher for alternative project delivery compared to traditional projects  A + B contracting produced the highest time savings for construction  Contractors achieved bonuses on 86% of the projects using A + B with bonus contracting and 68% using bonuses alone</p>
<p>The Federal Highway Administration in the USA also performed a study termed the “Design-Build Effectiveness Study” in FHWA (2006). The conclusions revealed similar findings and showed that the Design-Build method typically does enhance time savings, lower cost growth and less change orders.</p>
<p>Adetokundo and Anderson (2006) also mention that the project delivery system selected greatly influences the efficiency and constitutes a success factor. Also, by having a structured process, it allows for greater insights for decision making.</p>
<p>Gransberg et al. (2010) also conclude that there is no optimum or best project delivery model that is applicable to all transportation modes.</p>
<p>Mostafavi and Karamouz (2010) also agree that there is no ideal project delivery system and selecting a method involves criteria that meet the client’s needs and requirements. As clients needs vary, then the criteria should be flexible.</p>
<p>Ibbs et al. (2003) addresses productivity in terms of cost change and schedule change. Discussion indicates that productivity levels for both DBB and DB were very similar even though DB showed a slight increase in productivity when the project schedule is reduced (this is the main advantage of DB). Interestingly, the cost increased when the level of productivity decreased. It was also mentioned that cost savings are debatable when using DB.</p>
<p>The key issue is to determine the appropriate project delivery method for any given project, and not all projects are applicable to only one method.</p>
<p>Projects that have design development almost completely finished probably should use the DBB method.</p>
<h2>2.2 Benefits & Challenges</h2>
<p>The benefits  of the Design-Build model and main advantages are summarized in the following:  Time savings (accelerate projects)  Potential cost savings  Lower cost growth  Co-location enhances the teamwork, productivity and project interactions  More Alternative Technical Concepts (ATCs)  More innovative construction techniques (especially bridges)  More freedom and flexibility compared to traditional model  Integration of design and construction stimulates productivity  Functional requirements (performance requirements) go handin-hand with the DB model</p>
<p>There are challenges  to DB and some are listed as follows:  Client cultural change and internal resistance  Design-Build projects typically require significant client involvement  Implementation takes time when using alternative methods  Sometimes the designers have been treated unfairly (like lowbid)  The tendering cost can be significant (consider using stipends to offset expenses)  Sometimes contractors have difficulty pricing the risks  Ability to accept alternative proposals and ATCs  Quality control decision made by the contractor can be challenging and difficult  Large DB projects are more suitable for large construction companies as they reduce competition  Lack of real teamwork, partnering, creative thinking and sharing rewards</p>
<p>Some other issues  when using DB are as follows:  Performance and technical requirements are sometimes conflicting  Keeping the design development to a minimum to stimulate contractor’s innovations (typically this means design is about 30% maximum)  Allowing enough time for thorough examination for proposal preparation  Specify the design review times required by owners/clients  Having enough competitors to take advantage of DB  Risks should be clearly identified and allocated appropriately  DB has been used as a viable method to enhance project outcomes, but is not a solution for all projects  Takes time to become savvy in all aspects of DB</p>
<h2>2.3 Characteristics or Factors when Selecting DB Projects</h2>
<p>It is important to identify potential projects that might be suitable for the Design-Build model. Not all projects are suitable for Design-Build and it is important to understand what characteristics or factors might steer the project to be considered for DesignBuild.</p>
<h2>Other studies</h2>
<p>A successful framework for the Design-Build model requires above all, a cultural change in both the client and contracting industry. This also includes the participation of the design community, which should understand how to solve challenges, yet retain their previous expectations as a quality proponent for the clients, even though their contract is with the contractor.</p>
<p>Songer and Molenaar (1997) investigated the characteristics of successful public sector Design-Build projects and revealed six important factors:  Projects were on budget  Projects were on time  Project met the specifications  Project met the users expectations  There was a high quality of workmanship</p>
<p>Molenaar and Songer (1998) provide insights into significant characteristics of a projects to be considered as a successful framework for Design-Build. These findings include:  The schedule duration or completion date  High confidence in budget definition  Applicable to complex projects  Having sufficient owner/client experience and staffing resources  Adequate time to prepare proposals and work better with performance requirements  Using a combination of quality and price for contractor selection criteria  Having prequalification for  Design-Builders</p>
<p>Gordon (1994) looked at project drivers, owner drivers, market drivers, contracting issues and risks. The main project drivers include time constraints, flexibility needs, preconstruction services, design interaction and financial constraints. The owner drivers evaluated construction sophistication, current capabilities, risk aversion, method restrictions, and external factors. These are included in a flowchart scheme that will guide the owner selecting the correct method.</p>
<p>Touran et al. (2009) provides guidelines for transit professionals as a practical tool to help transit agencies selecting the most appropriate project delivery method. The tool includes a three tier process for the selection of project delivery methods and the guidelines can be applied to the road sector. The three tiers include an analytical, a weighted matrix and an optimal risk-based approach.</p>
<h2>2.4 Lessons Learned in  Design-Build</h2>
<p>When considering Design-Build it is important to consider lessons learned from other colleagues, publication resources and international practices. It is wise to study the practices and challenges from others because Design-Build is not a traditional way of doing business. Some lessons learned from Design-Build are presented in Box 2.</p>
<h2>Box 2. Design-Build Lessons Learned</h2>
<p> Selection of project delivery method does matter  Development of a systematic process to determine project delivery selection  Not all projects are suitable for DB  Changing the internal culture and practices  It takes time to change the culture and implement DesignBuild successfully  DB is appropriate for time critical and complex projects  DB usually provides savings, but not always  Use functional requirements as much as possible  Develop a successful approval process for ATCs  Use incentives and disincentives appropriately  Keep  Design-Builder’s equipment and employees working throughout the project (fast tracking)  Co-location of client, contractor & designer on large DB projects. Co-location often improves the teamwork. The client should be actively involved throughout project duration.  Good project management from client and contractor  Partnering is an important feature when  co-located</p>
<h2>3. Results from Capital Investment Project Interviews</h2>
<p>Selecting the appropriate project delivery method can be a complex decision making process and it should be made as early as possible in the planning and design stages. The results in this section are mainly from the interviews with the road clients and the influence between procurement practices on productivity. Other published resources are included to enhance the discussion. Capital investments are those projects that consume a great deal of capital or money and it represents the building of new roads, bridges, tunnels and significant rehabilitation or road widening.</p>
<h2>3.1 How Infrastructure Clients Affect Productivity</h2>
<p>The infrastructure clients can affect the productivity of contractors mainly through the procurement processes. Indirectly, the clients can also communicate their wishes to improve contractor’s productivity through close communications, sharing of ideas, and some loose forms of client-contractor activities or associations.</p>
<p>Outsourcing or competition is the main avenue to increase productivity. In most cases the works or construction has been introduced into competition for a long time, and maintenance is the new competitive market. The issue then becomes, what forms of procurement potentially enhance the productivity of contractors.</p>
<p>One of the challenges is to have a fully functional competitive market for alternative project delivery methods, which may not exist in all the Nordic countries. The experience in the Nordic countries is that there is limited competition when using alternative project delivery methods.</p>
<h2>3.2 Factors that Potentially Influence Productivity</h2>
<p>One question in the survey was to determine the “ factors ” that influence the productivity of the contractors. Based upon the literature review there were several reports that listed several factors that lead to productivity gains. Chapman et al. (2010) describe the usage of life-cycle processes, technology/innovation utilization, highly skilled workforce, offsite prefabrication and modularization, and the Building Information Model (BIM) as factors that influence productivity. Also, CII (2008) states that newly developed construction equipment (intelligent machinery), automation and integration of project information systems, prefabrication and modular components, and interoperability via the BIM could all influence to improved productivity.</p>
<h2>General Factors that Potentially Influence Productivity</h2>
<p>Box 3 summarizes the results from the interviews that describe the general factors that possibly improve productivity. These aspects have the potential  to increase productivity, efficiency and even innovation.</p>
<h2>Box 3. General Factors that Potentially Influence Productivity</h2>
<p> Open and healthy competition  Incentives and disincentives in contracts  Use of  performance-based requirements  Prefabricated and  off-site production (self-propelled bridge transport)  Innovative or Alternative Technical Concepts (ATCs)  Time based criteria; like lane rental and A + B Bidding  Building Information Model (BIM): not fully developed  Intelligent machinery  More freedom and flexibility for the contractors  Risk balancing  More  in-house work performed by main contractor  Dynamic Traffic Management (DTM) during construction  Warranties  Partnering and teamwork – collaborative process – indirectly  Bundling of projects  Project management  Standardization broadly applied</p>
<p>Healthy Competition</p>
<p>Open and healthy competition is very important, especially if alternative and innovative practices are desired. Where there is a healthy and competitive market for the services, there is more potential to increase the productivity and efficiency. In some countries the competition in Design-Build contracts is not optimum.</p>
<p>Incentives and Disincentives</p>
<p>Some infrastructure clients are using incentives and disincentives in the contracts and these have often led to productivity gains because there was a motivation and reward mechanism in place. Reward mechanisms have been mainly time-based criteria, where a completion date must be adhered or travel during peak periods must be avoided (lesser working days or evening work). Several reported success stories have been reported especially when integrated with time-based aspects.</p>
<p>Performance/Functional Requirements</p>
<p>The use of performance-based or functional requirements was agreed by all to increase the productivity of contractors. Functional requirements can provide flexibility, freedom to use alternative materials or methodology, and it enables contractors to be more savvy and innovative. FHWA (2002) shows the relationship of performance specification toward more innovative type practices shown in Figure 4. The “x” denotes the client’s main responsibility in referring to the type of specifications required. The figure shows that performance specifications are highly related to the application in Design-Build methods and its variants. Development of functional requirements is more of a long-term process and it takes time to create measures that produce the correct behavior for the contractors. It is also known that there are many proven standards and long-term research efforts in the background of functional requirements and should not be considered as cure or a solution. It requires a robust and proven approach before performance requirements can be applied broadly.</p>
<p>Source : FHWA (2002).</p>
<p>Prefabrication and SPBT</p>
<p>Prefabricated bridges, off-site bridge production, and Self-Propelled Bridge Transport (SPBT) are used in some countries but rarely in the Nordic countries. The main issue is to reduce congestion and traffic reductions, when constructing or replacing bridges or structures. This is an innovative solution without significantly impeding or disrupting passenger or freight traffic. Prefabrication techniques have vastly improved since earlier years and are gaining acceptance. However, these new and innovative techniques may not be utilized due to untested/unknown results and they require a new way of thinking from the bridge engineering departments. It is especially true in the Nordic countries, where this has not widely gained acceptance.</p>
<p>Approving ATCs</p>
<p>Alternative Technical Concepts (ATCs) have been used successfully in some countries, but the difficulty arises when the evaluation of these technical concepts is included during the tendering phase. When ATCs are accepted, the contractors have often provided the client with increased productivity, savings, and innovations (usually go hand-in-hand). ATCs can be used by any procurement method, provided that they are accepted and approved by the client. It is difficult to conclude why they are not used more often, but comments from the interviews indicate it may be due to the lack of time constraints or expertise approving these ATCs. The inclusion of ATCs has been more of an exception than the normal processes. ATCs that present untested or unfamiliar techniques to the clients may be casually rejected due to the unknown risks and potential consequences for negative results. One example is the use of bridge advancements seen in some countries, where bridges are built near the site and placed in position within a few days.</p>
<p>ATCs are a significant challenge and it appears that the clients have to take the risks and be courageous to test these innovations. How can the client become more willing to accept the risks of ATCs? This may require further study and research. This is a key challenge since ATCs are examples of innovations and productivity gains. One possible solution is to test these innovations via pilot projects and possibly applied to non-critical locations.</p>
<p>Time-Based Criteria</p>
<p>Time-based criteria such as, A + B bidding and lane rental, have an influence on productivity, because there is a sense of urgency to use lean construction principles and make the methods more efficient. A + B bidding in the USA has been used quite successfully and there have been some lane rental projects. Finland has used A + B bidding with incentives and disincentives with both good and unfavorable results.</p>
<p>BIM</p>
<p>The Building Information Model (BIM) is gathering momentum for infrastructure applications in many countries and was agreed to increase productivity. BIM is expected to decrease the amount of errors and omissions to a point where productivity gains can be achieved. Land mass calculations, visualization of the end product for the key stakeholders, automated calculation of cost, and other parameters can be used from the BIM. When the BIM is fully operational it can be used directly into the production processes of the contractors or supply chain.</p>
<p>Intelligent Machinery</p>
<p>Intelligent machinery allows performing repeatable operations and has been applied to graders, pile drivers, excavators and bulldozers. Not only is the equipment getting savvier and highly interchangeable, but the quality control data from the outcomes can be automatically generated through Information and Communications Technology (ICT) systems. In addition to productivity gains, the quality of the end results has been quoted as better than that with traditional equipment. In general, the equipment has significantly improved and is more functional compared to traditional ones.</p>
<p>Flexibility and Freedom</p>
<p>Allowing the contractors more freedom and flexibility when performing the work can lead to productivity gains. There are numerous rules, regulations, and restrictions that are placed upon the contractor and there needs to be more freedom and flexibility. This can be applied generally throughout the project and can be challenging to release perceived control issues.</p>
<p>Risks</p>
<p>Risks play a significant role in most capital projects. It is wise to know what factors cause risks to increase or decrease, as contractors will bid them in the contract. There is a tendency to reduce the risks for the contractors in order to achieve lower prices, but there is a proper balance or tradeoff. Balancing the risks usually comes from experience. When using alternative contracting methods, the risks are often transferred to the contractor, but there are some risks like geotechnical risks that should be shared or use a sliding scale risk for those difficult and challenging areas. A sliding scale risks may usually include a maximum risk that contractors will be responsible.</p>
<p>Self-Performed Work</p>
<p>One interesting factor noted from a few countries suggested that a main portion of the work was self-performed or used by the contractors owned subsidiaries which increased the integration and production. This is a very unusual finding because many contractors in most countries have divested their internal operations (downsized their organizations) and have relied on project management in the supply chain. Generally, when there is an ownership interest there is generally more control, which may lead to better results.</p>
<p>Dynamic Traffic Management (DFM)</p>
<p>The use of Dynamic Traffic Management (DFM) where there are significant traffic volumes in and around construction work zone areas have encountered better results and increased the productivity. The contractors can use larger than planned work areas to maximize efficiency. The area allowable for construction not only can influence productivity gains by the contractor, but can significantly affect worker safety.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Factors</p>
<p>Other factors like warranties, partnering, bundling of projects or individual activities, the project manager’s competence, and standardization broadly applied, will most likely have a positive influence on productivity. Almost all interviewees stated that these influence productivity, but are difficult to evaluate quantitatively.</p>
<h2>Factors in Procurement that Potentially Influence Productivity</h2>
<p>The factors in general that potentially influence productivity were previously described and most of these can be included in the procurement practices. According to the results from Ellis et al. (2007) and from practical experiences, it does matter which project delivery method is chosen and which ones influence productivity. Adetokundo and Anderson (2006) also state that the project delivery system selected greatly influences the efficiency and success of a project. They also mention that having a structured process allows for greater insights for decision making.</p>
<p>The results from the interviews are subsequently listed and provide insights to those methods that potentially influence productivity. Box 5 shows those factors that potentially influence productivity.</p>
<h2>Box 4. Factors in Procurement that Potentially Influence Productivity</h2>
<p> Healthy competition  Design-Build model and potentially its variants  Early Contractor Involvement (ECI)  Incentives and disincentives  Performance/functional requirements  Innovative or Alternative Technical Concepts (ATCs)  Warranties  Time based criteria like Lane Rental, A + B Bidding and Dynamic Traffic Management (DTM) during construction  Prefabricated or off site fabrication  (Self-Propelled Bridge Transport)  Building Information Model (BIM): not fully developed  Value engineering (both design and contractor inputs)  Bundling of projects  Partnering - indirectly  Stipulation of  in-house work performed by main contractor (e.g. 40% minimum)  Standardization broadly applied</p>
<p>Design-Build Model and its Variants</p>
<p>It was unanimous that all interviewees stated that Design-Build has the potential  to improve productivity and provide better performance. The integration of design and construction provides the framework for potential innovations, efficiencies and time savings. When implemented correctly, Design-Build permits problem resolution, integration of many services and creativity. However, there are certain characteristics that need to be implemented and some prerequisites were mentioned in Section 2.</p>
<p>It was interesting to observe that only England and Holland have used the Alliance or ECI model . The findings vary and the overriding experiences are that cooperation, partnering, teamwork and problem resolution functions extremely well. It is uncertain at this time if Value for Money (VfM) was achieved as the model is quite new. A significant challenge when attempting to use the Alliance model would be limited competition.</p>
<p>There have also been some Design-Build projects that have performed poorly and any project delivery model can be abused  or have some unsuccessful outcomes. On the other hand, there have been so many numerous examples of good outcomes and successful projects that override the subjective evidence, in favor of Design-Build.</p>
<p>It is believed that the teamwork between the client, designer and contractor (when used successfully), and the integration of design and construction potentially drives productivity. This may not be conclusive, but inference and responses during the interviews indicate that this is the main difference between DB and traditional methods. However, there are certain characteristics that need to be implemented and some pre-requisites were mentioned in Section 2.</p>
<p>Other Factors</p>
<p>Other factors like incentives and disincentives, more performance requirements, allowing for contractor innovations and ATCs, warranties, time-based criteria by minimizing delays and disruptions, bundling of projects or individual activities, partnering, standardization broadly applied, the project manager’s role, and the potential of the BIM will most likely contribute to the positive influence on productivity. These were already discussed and highlighted in Section 3.2.</p>
<p>Value Engineering</p>
<p>Value engineering can be defined as a systematic process to improve upon the value or products and services by thoroughly evaluating other functions or possibilities, and is related to the cost. Value can be increased by improving the products or services or by reducing cost. Value engineering was noted to affect productivity, especially when both design and constructability are included in the early planning phases. Value engineering is extensively used in the USA.</p>
<p>The Alliance model  is the main procurement model that incorporates value engineering attributes because the value engineering attributes are included in the model and performed by the Alliance team. A study by Koppinen and Lahdenpera (2004) describes features of the Alliance model in more detail. Unfortunately, the Alliance model has not been tested significantly and results are not known (too early to evaluate) from the countries in this study. It has been commented that cooperation and teamwork make the model work well, but there are no objective results on costs, quality, construction speed and overall better value. Reported results from Australia and New Zealand using the Alliance model have shown significant reduction in the overall project time, better environmental value, and superior teamwork and partnering. A significant challenge when attempting to use the Alliance model would be the limited amount of competition, especially in the Nordic countries.</p>
<p>The main challenge or difficulty is measuring the quantitative influence of each aspect towards productivity. This was not possible in this study and requires further study.</p>
<h2>Factors in General that Potentially Decrease Productivity</h2>
<p>There are also factors that contributed to lowering  the productivity and may be attributed to several causes. A list of factors that potentially decrease productivity is presented in Box 4. Each is elaborated upon.</p>
<h2>Box 5. Factors in General that Potentially Decrease</h2>
<h2>Productivity</h2>
<p> Constraints in working times  Too many  method-based requirements  Traditional cultural between client & industry  Lack of approval by client to ATCs  Not maximizing the usage of labor and equipment  The quality of design was decreasing (increasing amount of errors and omissions)  Yearly budgeting system that requires spending at a net zero yearly balance  Project approval cycles are not optimum  Additional environmental or administration burden, or other requirements  Skilled worker shortages</p>
<p>Constraints in Working Times</p>
<p>Some countries have constraints in working periods, especially where projects are located in large habited areas and bigger cities. Even weekend work is sometimes not allowed, which can results in an inefficient usage of working equipment that reduces productivity.</p>
<p>Method-Based Requirements</p>
<p>Just as functional requirements increase the potential of productivity gains, the significant amount of method-based requirements reduces the flexibility and freedom of the contractors to obtain productivity gains. Korteweg (2002) explains the need for more functional requirements when using alternative project delivery methods. Some of these countries continue to have method-based requirements that were created a long time ago and sometimes cannot even determine why these were used. It is difficult to remove method-based requirements as it requires due diligence. Sometimes it is just difficult to find good functional requirements.</p>
<p>Traditional Culture</p>
<p>A “stove-piped” or traditional culture exists in many client organizations with a long standing of ways and means to accomplish road building. Typically, the client has absorbed most of the risks in infrastructure projects and the contractors have been risk adverse. A long history of doing things a certain way requires change management. It is a significant challenge, as people are individuals and individuals do not desire change, but desire conformity, comfort and security. This also applies to the contractors, but is more noticeable in the client organizations. Many contractors are also not willing to take risks unless rewards are substantial.</p>
<p>Difficulty Approving ATCs</p>
<p>Just as ATCs have the potential to stimulate productivity, the lack of expertise in approving ATCs by the client organization’s staff is potentially reducing the productivity. The client may not be able to quickly approved ATCs during the tendering process and may reject them due to inexperience or simply not knowing the consequences. Despite the use of alternative or innovative practices in other countries external to this study, it has been difficult for clients to accept these ATCs. Perhaps when a system of balanced risks between the client and contractor is created, then there is potential to take advantage of these newer concepts.</p>
<p>Not Maximizing Resources</p>
<p>Only in Sweden were there comments of not maximizing the use of labor and equipment during the construction period. There is a perception that the labor and equipment may be used 4 days a week and not utilized to its maximum potential. This may be due to labor rules or worker flexibility, but it may cause a negative effect on productivity.</p>
<p>Design Degradation</p>
<p>In all countries there is a perception of degrading design quality. The cause of this was uncertain, but all countries in the study have reported more errors and omissions as well as simply poorer design quality as in the past. This may require a further study to determine the cause, but it was a surprising outcome.</p>
<p>Financial Considerations</p>
<p>Most countries require a net zero yearly balance budget for all projects. In other words, actual spending must match the calculated/estimated yearly expected costs required by the government finance agencies. Project overruns or savings are not desired by the financial governmental institutions and require close scrutiny and monitoring of the spending accounts. Sometimes these conflicts may cause project delays and have a negative impact on productivity.</p>
<p>Projects Approval Cycles</p>
<p>Some project budgets in the Nordic countries are not approved until December (year ending) by the political decision makers. A typical result in construction tenders being awarded in the fall or winter of the following year, when very little physical work can be done. It would be more efficient and productive to have the design available during the winter periods and construction starting as soon as possible in the springtime. So project approvals can be affected by governmental requirements.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy</p>
<p>The additional administrative burden along with increasing environmental requirements may decrease productivity. These may not have a significant impact on the overall outcome, but the client should demand compliance with procedures and processes only for those administrative issues that are relatively important. On the other hand, sometimes environmental requirements may also trigger innovations and ATCs.</p>
<p>Skilled Worker Shortages</p>
<p>More recently, some countries have been experiencing shortages in skilled labor as the technology gets more sophisticated. Equipment and systems are technically challenging and there were comments of not having enough skilled workers. This could potentially limit the use of equipment and systems, and cause a downturn in productivity.</p>
<h2>3.3 Discussion and Observations</h2>
<p>The experiences from the Design-Build projects show mixed results, some have performed well and some not so well. Some of the poor performing DB projects might be explained by a lack of experience with DB, not having enough resources for the client and contractor (phasing of projects), not treating the design entity fairly, lack of performance/functional requirements, lack of creativity with local designers, and not considering risks in the project. On the other hand, there have been numerous examples of good outcomes and successful projects. The Design-Build (DB) method was considered having the most positive effect on productivity due to the integration of design and construction.</p>
<p>Ibbs et al. (2003) address productivity in terms of cost change and schedule change. Discussion indicates that productivity levels for both DBB and DB were very similar even though DB showed a slight increase in productivity when the project schedule is reduced (main advantage of DB). It was interesting to note, as cost increased, the level of productivity decreased. It was also mentioned that cost savings are debatable when using DB. These results come from building and industrial applications and it would be interesting to complete a systematic study for the road contractors.</p>
<p>In most cases DB has provided savings, but not always. It depends upon the different motivators for the project and what constraints might be applicable. Most countries have experienced savings when using the DB method.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the Alliance or ECI models have been used only in England and Holland and is used in a limited amount as the model is quite new. There needs to be a systematic appraisal in order to properly allow comparisons with other models. The teamwork and cooperation were outstanding and the participants engaged in the project are very satisfied. Some experiences were that some personnel felt disappointed by returning to traditional practices. The Value for Money (VfM) has not been evaluated or compared with other models.</p>
<p>A long term procurement strategy or plan should be introduced by the client organization in order to drive the process and communicate the long term needs, so contractors are able to react accordingly. This would assist meeting the challenges previously described and knowing that it takes time to change the traditional practices. Announcing a procurement strategy is a common practice in many countries.</p>
<p>There have been some examples of innovations in DB projects and they have been in line with using alternative materials and by adopting working methods that have increased productivity and reduced cost. Some examples of innovations from these countries are as follows:  Better traffic management during construction periods  Noise wall alternatives  Standardizing bridge sections for increased efficiency and possible prefabrication  Temporary bridge structures – made of structural plastics</p>
<p>Cost certainty was mentioned by some clients and the importance of collecting the cost data and unit prices. It is important for the client to determine what costs affect which elements or categories and what influences prices. Despite collecting the cost data, the market prices, contractor behavior and other factors could influence the knowledge of cost certainty. It may be inconclusive to have cost certainty, but collecting the cost data is important.</p>
<p>Table 1 shows the project delivery methods used in each country by quantity and project costs. The DBOM, DBFO and Alliance models are represented by the number of projects using these methods. Both England and Holland do not use the DBB method, unless there are extenuating circumstances. England has the highest use of the Alliance or ECI model and accounts for 73% of their project selection. In Finland, the progression favors the DB method as the main choice while most other countries are using DBB. Sweden has used the DBOM model on two projects in 2010 and 2011, each with a responsibility for 20 years by the contractor. Another DBOM project was completed earlier and had successful results. Comments from the interview reported at least a 10% savings.</p>
<p>Note : Data is collected from the last 5-6 years.</p>
<p>Table 2 shows a summary of the project delivery methods used by each country. Most countries have tested the DB model and some have used the advanced Design-Build variants. DBFO and privately financed projects have captured attention mainly due to the lack of public resources. However, the financial crisis will have an effect on privately financed projects. .</p>
<p>Every project has a different set of requirements, objectives, challenges, and the owner should carefully consider these requirements in the context of their own culture, environmental issues, and technical characteristics to decide which project delivery method provides the best opportunity for success.</p>
<p>It is possible to foster productivity in any procurement method by including those factors and concepts mentioned or accrued elsewhere.</p>
<p>It is also possible to obtain productivity gains, by measures not included in this report. The main benefit of the Design-Build model is the potential to foster innovation, reduce project duration, and address customer oriented solutions (especially disruptions) by integrating the design and construction phases.</p>
<p>Productivity on the other hand is mainly driven by the contractors’ processes, methodology, ingenuity, project management skills, innovation, and lean construction practices (reducing waste in all project phases). The main influence by the client is to use the best procurement method for the project and allow enough freedom for the contractors without corrupting the objectives of the customers. There is no guarantee for success, but the clients should provide the best opportunity or framework for success.</p>
<h2>3.4 Characteristics or Factors when Selecting DB Projects</h2>
<p>Another topic in the structured interviews was to describe some pre-requisites, characteristics or factors when selecting DesignBuild. Many factors or characteristics were already described in Section 2.3. This can be valuable information for those who are not experienced in what makes a good Design-Build project or who use Design-Build for the first time. It is interesting that many have a set of issues or perceived pre-requisites, but did not have a comprehensive guidebook or framework for successful Design-Build projects, or what characteristics promote a good framework. Box 6 shows the characteristics collected from this study.</p>
<h2>Box 6. Characteristics or Factors when Selecting DB Projects</h2>
<p> Less design development – strive for about 30% or less  Budget is fixed and approved  Schedule driven or urgent completion dates  Suitable for innovation  Amount of  in-house staffing resources  Environmental permitting is approved  Complex utility relocations  Too many constraints  Some politically driven</p>
<h2>3.5 Potential Indicators</h2>
<p>A single measure of productivity or index is extremely difficult or not measurable for the infrastructure contractors and therefore not reported. Labor and construction productivity results are typically used and are for the entire construction industry and a fair comparison is not practical.</p>
<p>Project interviewees were asked if there are any indicators that might represent some relationship to productivity. It was very difficult to objectively correlate any indicators of productivity, but cost (€/km) was the most common recommendation. Only a selected number of clients in the study collect the unit prices, which is more common in Anglo-Saxon countries. The unit prices collected were not used for productivity requirements, but merely to assist in the cost estimation of future projects. It is also very difficult to compare the costs that are not homogenous and to compare prices of urban areas versus rural areas. Since all clients in this study do not measure productivity, it is difficult to recommend any objective indicators.</p>
<p>However, it is possible to have qualitative productivity indicators or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that resemble some form of productivity, even though they may not be measured objectively. Some of these KPIs stated by some clients are included in Box 7.</p>
<h2>Box 7. Potential KPIs in Capital Projects</h2>
<p> Project cost (on budget)  Schedule (on time)  Quality (subjectively)  Number of change orders submitted by contractors  Customer satisfaction during construction (subjectively)  Safety (both to workers and road users)</p>
<h2>3.6 Other Findings</h2>
<p>There were other findings not specifically related to procurement or productivity measures. Some are general in nature and others are indirect, but do have an effect or some correlation with productivity. Findings from the interviews are highlighted in Box 8.</p>
<h2>Box 8. Other Findings</h2>
<p> Lack of systematic evaluation in procurement methods  Lean construction practices (at the discretion and control of contractors)  Collaboration, communication and teamwork  Head-to-head competition of contractors (even internationally)  Contractor working methods (difficult to determine in practice)  Contractor working area  Co-location of parties in Design-Build  Lack of trust and openness between client and contractors</p>
<p>Lack of Systematic Evaluation</p>
<p>The main finding shows a lack of systematic benchmarking between the objective results used from different project delivery methods. Many comparisons were more of a subjective nature and not based upon quantitative measures. There was a significant consensus that prices were lower for Design-Build projects, but lacked real comparisons.</p>
<p>Most agree that DB produces shorter project duration, but should be calculated and reported. This is one lesson to be learned and that a quantitative evaluation should be performed for each project and used for comparisons.</p>
<p>Lean Construction Practices</p>
<p>Lean construction principles and practices do increase the productivity along with the type of working methodology/practices of contractors. These factors are mainly determined by the contractors and are difficult for clients to demand. It would behoove clients to use those factors in the contracts that provide a framework for success and drive the correct behavior.</p>
<p>Other Findings</p>
<p>Head to head competition is very important to take advantage of outsourcing. Even international competition is beneficial even though there are some concerns when international players are involved. In some countries, there is not a healthy competition between contracts in Design-Build.</p>
<p>It is the contractor’s working methods, practices and ability to reduce waste throughout the project that provides benefits and productivity gains. This was agreed by the contractor interviews and they desire more freedom so that they can maximize the use of labor, equipment and resources.</p>
<p>If a contractor has a larger operational working area, the productivity of work can be improved, especially when working areas are close to congested roads.</p>
<p>When the designer, contractor and client are co-located (all working together at the same site/location) there is much more potential for productivity gains because decisions are made quicker and without a significant administrative burden. This goes hand in hand with collaboration, communication and teamwork philosophy.</p>
<p>When there is a lack of trust and openness between the client and contractors, the productivity may be affected negatively. This behavior can potentially cause a backward movement towards profit seeking, increased claims, and lack of cooperation, which are all undesirable.</p>
<h2>3.7 Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>There were many inputs and comments during the face-to-face interviews that can be considered as lessons learned. A collection of the lessons learned are presented in Box 9. Some of these were discussed in earlier sections, while others are from experiences and practical concerns. This is not an exhaustive list, but provides a broad perspective.</p>
<h2>Box 9. Lessons Learned from Capital Projects</h2>
<p> Productivity is difficult to measure  Pick the right project with the right procurement method  Develop a systematic evaluation of all delivery methods  There are many good examples of successful DB projects and its variants  It is a challenge to change the internal culture and practices  It takes time to change and to implement alternative methods  The Alliance Model has good potential, but lacks proof of VfM  The good practices in DB and its variants can be also applied and added into the traditional model - DBB  Cultural differences affect acceptance and implementation  Requires training throughout the organization  Lump sum contracts may provide benefits  Some innovations are driven by the contractors  Lean construction thinking should be applied by the contractors  Consider collecting cost data and unit prices  Providing flexibility and freedom to the contractor  Alternative practices are more applicable for time based issues and innovation potential  Client should be an active participant in alternative models  Consider using upset prices  Contractors desire more performance requirements, longterm contracts, incentives and disincentives, more client investigations before tender, better communications before tender, and approval of innovations (ATCs)  Formal or informal partnering is important  Encourage development of the Building Information Model (BIM)  Use factors that drive the correct behavior  Contractor selection should not be low bid</p>
<p>Probably the biggest lesson learned is that the project delivery method used should be grounded on good business decisions, client goals, and specific projects characteristics.</p>
<h2>4. Results from Maintenance Interviews</h2>
<p>Again a structured questionnaire was used as data collection method for the interviews. The interviews included client organizations, contractors, and experts involved in maintenance projects. Maintenance projects significantly differ from capital type projects, and the productivity of maintenance work is not measured by any country in this study. A productivity measure is therefore not available and it is virtually impossible to measure productivity for maintenance. It may be possible to measure the performance of maintenance contractors, but lacks measurements related to productivity. The main focus is to determine those factors that potentially influence productivity used in maintenance contracts.</p>
<p>Selecting the appropriate contracting model for maintenance is not as complex as compared with capital projects. The results in this section are mainly from the actual interviews with the road clients and how the procurement practices relate to productivity and what factors potentially influence the productivity of maintenance services.</p>
<h2>4.1 Background Information on Maintenance Contracting</h2>
<p>Maintenance is defined as the act of fixing or replacing things as opposed to constructing or building things. Most countries in this study are now using or have used some form of Performance Based Maintenance Contracts (PBMC), also called Performance Based Service Agreements (PBSA). The definition of PBMC or PBSA (using PBSA from this point forward) is defined as a maintenance concept where a private service provider is responsible for the maintenance and management  of assets to a predefined set of conditions or service levels. Performance specifications have thought to provide flexibility and boost innovation by the contractors as stated in Highways Agency (2004). The challenge to performance specifications (functional specifications) is the need for robust data and re-evaluation, and finding the best measures based upon existing practices. PBSA seems to be the main practice used in all countries, except for a few states in the USA. Most are using some variation of the PBSA contract model. Box 10 shows a list of various terminologies around the world that practically refer to the PBSA terminology. The point is that the terminology varies, but refers to the outsourcing of maintenance usually using a performance-based approach.</p>
<h2>Box 10. PBSA Terminology</h2>
<p> Performance Specified Maintenance Contracts  Asset Management Contracts  Long-Term Maintenance Contracts  Long-Term Performance Contracts  Managing Agent Contracts (MAC)  Alliance Contracts or eMAC (enhanced MAC)  Area Maintenance Contracts  Maintenance Area Contracts  Term Maintenance Contracts  Maintenance By Contract  Performance-Based Contracts  Term Network Contracts  Performance Contracting  Total Contract Maintenance  Performance Based Maintenance Contracts  Performance Based Service Agreements  Turnkey Asset Maintenance Services (TAMS  -VDOT)  Integrated Service Agreements (ISA – Australia and New Zealand)</p>
<p>There was a noticeable variation in the implementation and amount of performance-based requirements used in the contracts from the study. The hybrid model (combination of performance requirements and method based) seem to be the most common approach as it is difficult to have all measures defined in terms of outcome based criteria.</p>
<p>Most countries are using PBSA for routine maintenance, and three countries include resurfacing into the contract using fixed unit prices. Area based contracting is the most common practice used as it is easy to quantify the amount of work in a certain road network area, but Virginia DOT in the USA is the only one using a corridor based approach.</p>
<h2>4.2 How Infrastructure Clients Affect Productivity</h2>
<p>For maintenance contracts it is even more difficult to increase the productivity, as maintenance is the repair or preventive approach to keep assets in reasonable condition. The infrastructure clients can affect the productivity of contractors mainly through the procurement processes. Indirectly they can also influence contractor’s productivity through close communications, sharing of ideas, and some loose forms of client-contractor cooperation through activities or associations.</p>
<p>The main influence on productivity for the clients is to choose the best/optimum maintenance contract model. There is no guarantee that productivity will be increased, but allows the opportunity for higher degree of performance, efficiency, better practices, and therefore may positively influence productivity. Open and healthy competition is probably the best way to improve productivity, efficiency and cost savings.</p>
<h2>4.3 Factors that Potentially Influence Productivity</h2>
<p>Open and healthy competition is probably the main avenue to increase productivity. This can be done in many ways and each country included in this study had used different approaches to PBSA. The success varies from country to country and some have achieved significant savings compared to others. Productivity occurs as a result of competition, performance orientation, and using long-term agreements.</p>
<h2>General Factors that Potentially Influence Productivity</h2>
<p>During the course of the study, there are many general factors that potentially influence the productivity of maintenance service providers. These factors are listed in Box 11.</p>
<h2>Box 11. General Factors that Potentially Influence Productivity</h2>
<p> Open and healthy/functional competition  Using a  performance-based approach  Longer term contracts (greater than five years)  Bundling of activities (economies of scope)  Larger area contracts (economies of scale)  More flexibility (e.g. yearly replacement plan)  Incentives and disincentives  Measuring the performance of the service providers  Risk balancing  Using modern, interchangeable and intelligent equipment  Pro-active asset management  Use of GPS and ICT systems (for quality and efficiency)  Fewer restrictions (client added administration and practices)  Standardization broadly applied  Partnering – indirectly  Identification of  non-planned work (and additional work)  Flexible payment plans versus constant monthly payments (expedite work)  Encouraging innovation (difficult in practice without a reward scheme)  Developing a past performance rating system  Stipulation of  in-house work performed by the main contractor (e.g. ~25%.)</p>
<p>Healthy/Functional Market</p>
<p>It is very important to have a healthy/functional market of maintenance service providers, because a monopoly is not desired as was done in the past when performed in-house by the client organizations. There must be open head-to-head competition among the service providers and it should be a healthy or functional market. The road maintenance market in many countries is considered an oligopoly and in Lodenius et al. (2010) there are typically on average about 3–5 bidders for maintenance contracts. Since maintenance services are required on a cyclic basis, it is important to maintain a healthy market and in the future. This should be studied on an ongoing basis and there is a need to re-evaluate the market of maintenance contractors.</p>
<p>Main Factors</p>
<p>The main factors influencing productivity in the PBSA are the performance based approach, long-term agreements, bundling of activities, larger area contracts, providing flexibility for long lead items (preservation systems), including incentives and disincentives, measuring the contractor’s performance, balancing the risks, and newer high-tech equipment. These factors all have the greatest influence, but again it is not known how much each factor influences the overall productivity.</p>
<p>Asset Management</p>
<p>Pro-active asset management is another important challenging issue. This assumes that you have automated tools and systems for decision making. Collecting the asset condition data is important as well as the ability to use the data to make good and pro-active decisions. One of the challenges is to predict or estimate time to failure of the assets. The purpose of maintenance is extending the service life to its functional limits, which can be very difficult to determine in advance. This in essence requires good asset management practices and having systems that measures the asset conditions, so that the maintenance services are efficiently and effectively delivered. It would be beneficial to have a Life Cycle Costing (LCC) system utilized. Asset management systems are important and may be take time, resources, and re-engineering. The benefits and return on investment often take time to be rewarded.</p>
<p>Other Factors</p>
<p>Other factors that were discussed in the interviews include the use of modern GPS and ICT systems, fewer restrictions, standardization broadly applied, good project management, partnering, identification of non-planned work (additional work and long-led items), flexible payment plans versus constant monthly payments (expedite work), encouraging innovation (difficult in practice without a reward scheme), developing a past performance rating system, and stipulation of in-house work performed by the main contractor.</p>
<p>Also, the use of incentives and disincentives often led to productivity gains, but very few have used these concepts. It is difficult to use a reward scheme in maintenance contracts, possibly due to the lack of objective measuring schemes. It is also more difficult to implement incentives and disincentives mainly due to the budget restrictions, difficulty to measure, and what rewards drive the correct behavior in productivity gains.</p>
<p>Since there is no systematic evaluation, it is difficult to determine which aspects have the greatest influence toward productivity. Most contracts were implemented using many of these factors, so it is virtually impossible to determine a quantitative value from each variable.</p>
<h2>Factors in Procurement that Potentially Influence Productivity</h2>
<p>The factors influencing productivity in general were described in the previous section and many of these can be used in procurement practices. Some countries are experiencing more cost savings (some form of productivity gains) than others which can be partially explained by the differences in the implementation practices. For those countries that have been outsourcing via PBSA for many years, the savings may eventually diminish and prices will probably increase at some point. Since the costs are lower, there has been some form of productivity increases. However, it is difficult to quantitatively measure the causes of productivity gains. Obviously, competition has resulted in productivity gains and using performance-based contracting. Many of the productivity increases were due to less staffing resources needed to meet the desired quality standards. That means the limited resources have positively affected productivity.</p>
<p>It also does matter how the implementation of PBSA is developed in each country and what practices are utilized. It is important to establish and maintain a healthy/functional maintenance industry for these services, because they will also be needed in the future. Box 13 shows those factors that can be used in the procurement process for potentially influencing the productivity.</p>
<h2>Box 12. Factors in PBSA that Potentially Influence Productivity</h2>
<p> Head to head competition (healthy market)  Performance-based contracting  Longer term contracts (greater than five years)  Increasing the length of areas (economies of scale)  Bundling of activities (economies of scope)  More integrated services helps increase productivity (like resurfacing)  Risks clearly defined in contract (consider a sliding scale)  Incentives and disincentives (if possible/practical)  Partnering – Indirectly  Measuring the performance of the service providers  Flexible payment plans versus constant monthly payments (expedite work)  Encouraging innovation (difficult in practice without a reward measurement scheme)  Stipulation of  in-house work performed by main contractor (e.g. ~25% minimum)</p>
<p>These were already discussed in the previous section and the most important aspects are the performance based approach, long-term agreements, larger area contracts, bundling of activities, providing flexibility for long lead items (preservation systems), measuring the contractor’s performance, balancing the risks, and newer hightech equipment. These factors have the greatest impact.</p>
<h2>General Factors That Potentially Decrease Productivity</h2>
<p>There are also factors that contributed to a productivity decrease, which could be due to additional requirements in administration or management. These factors that potentially decrease productivity are shown in Box 12.</p>
<h2>Box 13. General Factors that Potentially Decrease Productivity</h2>
<p> Cultural change required in the client agencies; internal resistance  Prices are being squeezed and less additional work included for compensation  Restrictive requirements on the use of certain equipment and materials  Inability to accept proposed innovations (possibly proprietary)  Additional requirements placed upon the contractor (e.g. requiring several project managers)  Lack of skilled workforce  Not maximizing the usage of labor and equipment  Extra work required to add data into Maintenance Management Systems (MMS), and the need for better integration of these web based systems</p>
<p>Traditional Culture</p>
<p>A “stove-piped” or traditional culture exists in many client organizations and sometimes within the construction industry. There is a long standing history of doing things a certain way and often requires change management principles to overcome. This also applies to contractors, but is more noticeable in client organizations.</p>
<p>Many countries still resist the notion of outsourcing maintenance services to the private sector and rely on in-workers to perform the services. This traditional approach is challenging to breakup and requires a paradigm shift. Outsourcing on the other hand requires a functional market and a shift of being the service provider to being a steward of the maintenance services.</p>
<p>Lower Budgets</p>
<p>There is significant pressure to reduce the prices for maintenance services, and governmental authorities typically apply budget cuts to maintenance as a first choice. This is not a wise decision as it is important to keep the existing assets in good condition. This could potentially have a negative effect if maintenance is withheld and there is a continuing backlog of assets to be repaired. Many countries are in their second or third generation of contracts and it is difficult to find further reductions to prices. Ontario in Canada has now gone forward to 10-13 year contracts that include resurfacing in an attempt to reduce yearly budgets. It remains to be seen where future price reductions can be achieved and how this influences productivity.</p>
<p>Restrictions</p>
<p>There are some restrictions with the use of wider snow plows and other material substitutions that contractors would like to use. Some clients are restricting their use and not allowing innovations in a general sense. This could potentially stifle productivity and innovations.</p>
<p>Other Factors</p>
<p>Other factors that potentially reduce productivity include more administration in the sense of additional project managers required in the contracts, a shortage of skilled workers in some instances, not maximizing the use of equipment and labor, and the potential of additional work by adding data into two maintenance management systems owned by the contractors and clients.</p>
<h2>4.4 Discussion and Observations</h2>
<p>Placing maintenance in open competition is the main productivity impact, but it needs to be done properly and opening the market is a key challenge. In today’s world, there is typically a market available for maintenance services.</p>
<p>PBSA seem to be the most appropriate contract type and using a hybrid type model that contains mostly performance measures, with the remaining being method-based requirements. The contract duration can be five years or longer, using as many services and being on a large scale as possible.</p>
<p>Risks need to be described and allocated properly to improve transparency. Perhaps a sliding scale risk scheme might be a logical consideration, when there are not enough robust performance measures. Risks need to balanced or equitable, or they might influence the contract prices.</p>
<p>Finland uses a customer service and lower salt usage incentive in the contract. These can be considered quite innovative as there are not many countries using incentives and disincentives.</p>
<p>Many countries have the capability to measure the performance of the maintenance contractors through the performance measuring regimes provided in the MSS or asset management systems. So if the performance is good, the productivity should increase to some degree; and if the performance is lower, then the reverse occurs. The asset management system or MSS is a tool to measure the response times, input asset conditions, and other miscellaneous information. Some functions are automated as the data is captured in real time and though automated systems, but much of the data is done by observations and human inspections. Asset management systems are important and may be take time, resources, and reengineering. The benefits and return on investment often take time to be rewarded.</p>
<p>Encouraging innovation is important and rewarding seems to be a second thought. Contractors will typically use innovation to their advantage if it produces lower costs or better efficiency. Maintenance budgets typically do not have any additional funds to reward innovations and may be a mute issue. However, rewarding innovation can be beneficial, but may not necessarily increase productivity, unless there are significant output gains.</p>
<p>Finding the best PBSA contract usually takes time and needs determination of what works best in your own culture. It requires a cultural change from all participants and a savvy client organization to create a new market for maintenance. Reengineering the practices and continued benchmarking can provide a successful journey. The productivity in maintenance contracts is difficult to influence, but providing the correct framework in PBSA, may increase the successful outcomes.</p>
<p>Table 3 shows a summary of PBSA contracts used in each country. The common trends appear that the contract duration is increasing, the contract awards are moving toward lowest conforming price, includes a certain amount of fixed work (for possibly summertime), and seems that a hybrid type model is preferred.</p>
<h2>4.5 Potential Indicators</h2>
<p>The interviews did not reveal any quantitative productivity measurements applicable to the maintenance contractors. However, there may be some indicators that resemble some indicators that resemble some productivity achievements or factors related to productivity, efficiency or performance. It is possible to have qualitative indicators or Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). A possible consideration of an overall indicator of maintenance might be cost per kilometer (€/km). This may not be a balanced measure, but can serve as a general guideline. If costs have decreased, then some aspect of productivity occurred, even if it cannot be traced to an exact source.</p>
<p>Road agencies have collected maintenance costs that are often reported as cost per kilometer; but there are too many variables to conclude that unit prices are a proper way to compare, even if the assets are homogenous. For example, replacing a 20-inch drainage pipe that is imbedded in concrete versus the same size pipe running along the roadway can have drastically different maintenance prices. This is similar to other assets and highlights the difficulty when comparing unit prices. Also, most contractors are able to transfer costs across various maintenance categories, which further complicates the calculations.</p>
<p>Some of these potential KPIs are included in Box 14. Some are very difficult to measure, if at all, and are quite subjective.</p>
<h2>Box 14. Potential KPIs in Maintenance</h2>
<p> Project cost  Measuring contractor’s performance  Customer satisfaction (difficult to measure and very subjecttive)  Safety (amount of accidents attributed to maintenance)  Traffic performance during maintenance activities or mobility  Quality (subjectively and difficult to measure)  Number of complaints  Asset group condition ratings (bridge, asphalt and roadside for the entire network)</p>
<p>Some countries are able to measure the performance of maintenance contractors through a performance measurement system. Project interviewees were asked if there are any indicators that might represent some relationship to productivity, but the closest productivity indicator is to measure the performance of the contractors. It is very difficult to objectively correlate any indicators of productivity, but overall cost may be the best measure.</p>
<p>Other potential KPIs suggested include safety, quality, a customer complaint system, asset condition group ratings, and customer satisfaction.</p>
<h2>4.6 Other Findings</h2>
<p>Most countries in this study have benefited from PBSA and have experienced other general issues when outsourcing to the private market. There may be some hidden factors that are not known by all, but come with experience and moving forward.</p>
<p>There were other findings not specifically related to procurement or productivity measures. Some are general in nature while others are indirect and may not have an effect on or correlation with productivity. These other issues are presented in Box 15.</p>
<h2>Box 15. Other Findings</h2>
<p> Most contracts are Hybrid type contracts  Most performance requirements are time and response  Most performance measures are pass/fail systems with disincentives applied  Many countries have now progressed to Lowest Price Conforming Tender (LPCT)  General tendency to reduce contractor’s risks (byproduct is more bidders)  Most countries use some form of price indices for inflation and price increases  Most contracts include small improvements at a fixed cost  A few countries are including more periodic activities in the contracts (assists balancing summer and winter workloads)  Innovations were not as expected and mainly ICT, GPS and equipment innovations  A few countries are using a sliding scale risk, for example: salt usage due to shortages  Labor rates and market prices may affect productivity and costs  Cost certainty is lacking (mainly known by the contractors)</p>
<p>Hybrid Model</p>
<p>Other issues noted is the trend towards a “ hybrid model ” where they are not 100% performance based. There are a majority of performance requirements, but some are method or technically based mainly because of risks, market reaction, or simply not knowing the consequences.</p>
<p>Time and Response Measures</p>
<p>Most countries are using time and response in their performance measurement regime and typically use a “ pass or fail ” system. Some other countries not in the study are using a performance scorecard that measures the actual performance rating of a contractor in various asset groups. This requires more resources to measure the performance and provides more information on how good or bad the performance has actually been.</p>
<p>Lowest Price Conforming Tender (LPCT)</p>
<p>In most PBSA the prices also trend toward the Lowest Price Conforming Tender (LPCT), which means that there is a certain threshold that must be achieved and then the lowest price offer wins the competition. Since most contracts are about five years or longer, there is a cost or price index used in the contracts.</p>
<p>Risks</p>
<p>Risks are a significant part of the PBSA and it is wise to know what causes risks to increase or decrease, as contractors will bid them in the contract. In order to achieve lower prices, there is a tendency to reduce the risks for the contractors. One clever idea is to develop a sliding scale risk for those difficult and challenging performance measures. A byproduct of lowering risks also attracts more bidders and market entry.</p>
<p>Using Price Index</p>
<p>Most contracts include some form of price indexing to take into account inflation or increased prices. These indexes vary from country to country as the cultures are different. The main intent is to use an index or system that represents true increases beyond the control of contractors. One example is fuel prices, which fluctuate from year to year.</p>
<p>Additional Work</p>
<p>Most maintenance contracts also include a provision for small improvements included in the PBSA. This means that some small projects can be added into the scope of the maintenance contract. These are typically included as an upset price in the main PBSA contract as potential extra work, up to a certain monetary threshold. Also, road resurfacing is included in some PBSA and others have some periodic maintenance activities into the contract. These are usually in the form of unit or fixed prices.</p>
<p>Innovation</p>
<p>Most PBSA were expecting significant innovations. However, they have not been quite as expected. Most innovations have been in the form of equipment and ICT innovations. Also, the project management has seen improvements and the ability to manage resources effectively.</p>
<p>Sliding Scale Risk</p>
<p>There have been resent harsh winters that have resulted in shortages of salt for de-icing of the road surfaces. Prices were on the order of three to five times more expensive than normally. By including a sliding scale risk, it results in a more equitable sharing of risks that may not have been envisioned. This goes hand-in-hand with having equitable risk sharing.</p>
<p>Market Prices</p>
<p>Since most PBSA are outsourced, it is important to follow the market prices and verify that VfM is achieved. Most countries are having between three to six bidders on average, with the exception of Ontario in Canada, which is receiving more bidders compared to other countries. A healthy/functional market is vital to the success, and market prices should be studied on a systematic basis.</p>
<p>Cost Certainty</p>
<p>Most PBSA are lump sum or fixed price contracts. Some clients are under pressure to know the cost of different services or activities and have certainty of costs. It is difficult to obtain cost certainty from each individual maintenance activity under preset conditions. Even though there are unit prices stipulated in the contract, the client is unable to determine cost certainty of the services provided. This may or may not be a significant issue as costs per kilometer provides an overall indicator. It may be an issue if cost certainty of individual items or activities are desired, which may require further changes to the reporting requirements.</p>
<h2>4.7 Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>When developing maintenance contracting practices or PBSA it is important to consider the lessons learned from other agencies and especially internationally, since the developments have been global and progressed further in certain countries. It is wise to study the practices and challenges from others, because PBSA are not a traditional contracting method. A collection of lessons learned from maintenance contracting is presented in Box 16. This is not an exhaustive list, but provides a broad perspective.</p>
<h2>Box 16. Lessons Learned in PBSA</h2>
<p> Productivity is not measured in maintenance  Competition is the main factor to increase productivity  Sustaining a healthy/functional private sector market is very important  Changing the internal culture and practices is difficult – PBSA is a different approach  How to open the market for services is important - it takes time to change the culture  Using a  performance-based approach, as much as possible  Hybrid PBSA are perfectly acceptable  Risks and a sliding scale risk, should be balanced  Longer term contracts are better (greater than 5 years)  Consider bundling of activities (economies of scope)  Larger area contracts are better (economies of scale)  More flexibility and less restrictions, and include small improvements at a fixed cost  Many countries have now progressed to Lowest Price Conforming Tender (LPCT)  Measuring the performance of the service providers (cost and contract management)  Use factors that drive the correct behavior – disincentives and incentives (if possible)  Good project management is needed from both the client and contractor  Formal or informal partnering is essential  Most performance measures are pass/fail system with disincentives applied  Most performance measures are time & response  Contractor should collect the condition assessment data on a regular basis  Have interactive and interoperable MMS and ICT system as they have great potential for focusing resources and tracking performance (relates to  pro-active asset management)  Using modern, interchangeable and intelligent equipment  Cost certainty at the  micro-level is being lost in PBSA  New innovations are desired, but clients at times, have difficulty accepting  Standardization broadly applied (in contracts and practices)  Cooperation with the private market via forums, meetings & other cooperative efforts  Requires good leadership in client organization  Simultaneously using several models for differing circumstances (rural versus urban)  Consider alternative payment schemes to match  pro-active asset management practices  Consider contractor past performance rating system or approved contractor listing  Possibly considering some corridor based contracts (this needs to be tested by VfM)  Not maximizing the usage of labor and equipment  Lack of skilled workforce  Stipulation of  in-house work performed by main contractor (e.g. ~25% minimum)</p>
<h2>5. T-Rex Case Study Example</h2>
<p>One highly successful and visible Design-Build project is called the T-Rex project that was built in Denver, Colorado in the USA. This project was procured by the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) in 2001. This project is a multimodal project consisting of completing 17 miles of interstate highways and 19 miles of a new light rail system. T-REX was also part of the FHWA’s “Highways for LIFE” program designed to achieve safer and better highways as well as faster and more cost effective project delivery. The existing highway was a heavily congested, rapidly growing business corridor with a daily average traffic volume of over 160 000. T-Rex’s is actually a mega-project originally slated to be fully operational by June 2008, using the tradition project delivery method. The use of Design-Build model with value engineering provided the contractor to complete the project approximately 22 months ahead of schedule in the fall of 2006.</p>
<p>Managers and engineers used a traffic management system with sensors and a comprehensive web site (www.trexproject.com) to keep the public informed about the progress of the project. The project incorporates several systems that are according to the stateof-the-art: traffic monitoring, control, and information systems. These were utilized for the construction phase as well as future traffic services. The live traffic monitoring information was available 24/7 to news organizations, travelers and the general public.</p>
<p>Another value engineering initiative included the amount of light reaching the buildings outside the highway boundaries. Lighting requirements were to reduce the light that directly affects surrounding properties while adequately providing lighting for safety features. The original design required 40-foot light poles with 400 watt lamps that were positioned every 180 feet along both sides of both Interstates. The team used a new design scheme that had 1 000 watt lamps mounted on 65 foot poles placed about every 370 feet in the middle of the highway, thus reducing the number of light poles from 1 500 to about 250.</p>
<p>By using the same design-builder for design and construction, the team has realized more savings in time, cost and reduced externalities and inconvenience to the public. Comments from the FHWA mentioned that the design-build contractor had to be innovative in meeting the existing traffic flow on a three lane highway in each direction during the day. This means that the contractor could not shut down the highway during the day, meaning a lot of work at night. One example is the demolition and erection of prefabricated bridge girders, which was completed overnight, with lanes opening for the morning rush hours. Collaboration between the design and construction staff enhances the opportunity for innovation and a total of nine value engineering change proposals were proposed by the designer-builder. A cost sharing in the savings was an improvement and a creative approach.</p>
<p>Typically in a Design-Build project, the owner agencies conduct environmental planning and about 30 percent of the design of the civil elements (a higher level of design for the light rail systems) prior to tender. The design-build contractor was provided with 30% design reference drawings and essentially the design-build contractor took it from there. Using design-build, the construction could begin before the final designs were complete, and design and construction phases were integrated for speed and economy. Innovative techniques were encouraged, creating the potential for cost and time savings.</p>
<p>The design-build concept was formalized within CDOT around 1999, and CDOT and RTD signed an Intergovernmental Agreement to work cooperatively to finance and construct the multimodal project. They also decided to use the “Best Value” approach to contractor selection versus the typical low bid methodology. The partnering and collaboration were included in the DesignBuild approach, because a number of issues required decisions and quick decision-making as opposed to the traditional Design-BidBuild method. The T-REX partnering process allows members to resolve design and constructability issues, before they arise in the field, through a framework by a neutral Dispute Resolution Board (DRB). The project demonstrated that cost savings are often attributed to a closer and cooperative working relationship between the designers and contractor.</p>
<p>The T-REX project used a unique feature of establishing an “upset price” (maximum price) during the Request for Proposals (RFP) of $1.22 Billion. The contractor selection criteria were made using “Best Value”, which includes both technical and price proposal. The winning proposal was approximately $1.2 Billion, which represented a difference of about $39 Million from the original estimate and the proposal. The technical requirements included the ability to meet project goals, team organization and experience, to implement the project according to the RFP, demonstrate innovative solutions to manage construction and traffic, and commitment to public information and stakeholder input.</p>
<p>Other T-REX construction highlights were prefabrication and preassembly, where concrete girders and bridges have been prefabricated offsite. Sound wall panels and fascia panels covered shaft caisson walls, which was a new approach to retaining wall construction. When using Design-Build, you shouldn’t dictate to the contractor on “how to do things”, but rather use performance specifications to the greatest extent possible. One of the benefits is that the contractor is usually in the best position to determine the wall type or other innovations that are most economically viable for a given situation. Another solution reduced construction noise to adjoining neighborhoods by using portable, mobile sound walls that were actually semi-trailers that simply joined together along the side of the highway. This is a lesson learned that innovation often includes novel uses for common resources.</p>
<p>Some of the lessons learned include clearly defining and allocating the risks with the Design-Build contractor early in the process to determine which risks are best carried by the owner and which should be borne by the contractor. Proper risk allocation will usually result in lower overall risk for the project. Other lessons learned are as follows:  Cost validation of early estimates to guarantee realistic cost throughout the process  Make sure project goals are realistic  Co-location of staff  Partnering  Having an effective public information outreach  Third party issues should be defined and resolved early  Clearly define the level of participation in the final design review process  It is essential how contractors will obtain permits, how agency coordination will be managed and the level of participation from the community and neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Some key milestones are included in Box 17.</p>
<h2>Box 17. Key Figures and Milestones in the T-Rex Project</h2>

<h2>6. Significant Findings from Each Country</h2>
<p>This section will highlight some of the interesting and unique findings that were observed from each of the countries included in the study. They are listed alphabetically by country name.</p>
<h2>6.1 England</h2>
<p>England was previously known for its progressive acceptance of innovative practices and for being a forerunner in many areas of alternative contracting. The main project delivery methods for capital projects include the Design-Build, DBFO and the ECI model (a variant of the Alliance model). England is mainly re-engineering and improving the existing practices. A recent governmental audit had criticized the recent application of the DBFO method. The collaborative process continues with the government and industry, and it remains to be seen if there will be some back peddling.</p>
<p>Budgets are very tight and even the maintenance contracts are under scrutiny from a recent governmental audit. As a result, the winter maintenance will be done under a separate contract and in some cases the HA is providing some vehicles using labor rates. The unit prices will be collected to understand the cost associated with maintenance. Also, quality control measures are increasing in certain aspects of maintenance services. The Maintenance Area Contract (MAC) model is the main model used and is being modified with several areas of improvement. The MAC contracts will continue to go forward with future considerations toward costs and quality. Also, the number of contracts has been reduced to 12 contracts as a result of the integration of some areas.</p>
<p>Overall, England is using some of the most progressive project delivery methods and continues to refine the contracting models.</p>
<h2>6.2 Finland</h2>
<p>Finland was previously a good example of utilizing innovative procurement methods, until the recent reorganization and merger of the road, rail and waterways. Part of the transition caused the loss of regional offices to another governmental organization, which displaced the client further from the service delivery. As a result of these changes and staff reorganization there has been a significant backpedaling and loss of gains previously attained.</p>
<p>Design-Build is quoted to have monetary and time savings, but there have not been any quantitative studies or objective benchmarks to support these. Design-Build projects remain the preferred method of choice, but the reorganization has caused tension in the agreements with the contractors. One challenge is that the Finnish construction sector has less than a handful of contractors bidding on large Design-Build projects and very limited competition with the advanced variants of DB. Unfortunately, there has been a recent form of mistrust between the client and contracting industry, which needs to be corrected. The Design-Build model used in Finland has its limitations and should be refined in order to take advantage of innovative bridge technology, innovations in general, teamwork aspects, and reduced design development as was intended in the Design-Build model.</p>
<p>The A + B bidding with incentives and disincentives have been used in a couple projects with both good and unfavorable results. The situation needs to be investigated to determine if the correct behavior is being rewarded, or is the construction industry opposed to the new method.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of public funding for capital investments the DBFO model has now been used for the third time and the newest project was recently awarded. The first project (Lahti Route 4) was considered a success story, which used the shadow toll mechanism. The second project (E-18, Lohja-Muurla) had some problems in tunnels, ICT, and many road closings during the first 6 months. It is still too early to determine if VfM has been achieved. The E-18 and the newest DBFO are using the availability payment mechanism.</p>
<p>Finland is utilizing the BIM in the infrastructure sector as an interoperability tool is several applications. Progress continues with the development and implementation of the BIM for road projects. Some modules are already being used, while others still need development.</p>
<p>Performance based maintenance contracts are working well and have been a success story in Finland when the market was opened to competition in 2001. Now after about ten years of outsourcing, costs are slightly increasing and the market has matured. Finland has also moved to the lowest price conforming tender with three quality levels of service (400, 450 and 500 points must be obtained). Finland is one of the few countries using incentives in the contracts for a customer service bonus and for lower salt usage. This is considered as a world class method that has not been duplicated by others in this study. It will be interesting to see the development of the next generation contracting practices and if the good services will continue. Nevertheless, it has been a best practice and a good example for others to follow.</p>
<p>Overall, Finland has progressed in the use of project delivery methods, but is struggling with the capital project delivery methods. The maintenance contracts are world-class and have been recognized for its development. It remains to be seen if there is continued progress or will there be more back pedaling.</p>
<h2>6.3 Ontario, Canada</h2>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation in Ontario, Canada has been mainly using traditional procurement practices in the form of Design-BidBuild. Design-Build for minor projects (small projects) is being tested and Design-Build major is in the planning stage. There seems to be a movement towards progressive models which requires a significant culture change from the traditional practices. There is also one private finance model (DBFO) in the tendering phase. The ministry is using a cautious approach, working together with the industry in order to make Design-Build a viable procurement model. It will be interesting to determine if alternative project delivery methods become a common practice or will they revert to standard practices.</p>
<p>There have been significant changes and improvements to the performance based maintenance contracts compared to those used in the past. The new generation contracts are now fully outsourced, duration of 10–13 years, using more performance based requirements where applicable, and balancing the risks with the contractors. Resurfacing is also included in the scope of the work using a fixed price at a minimum guarantee level. The service providers are responsible for collecting the condition data and entering the information into the asset management system. Contracts are awarded to the contractor having the lowest price conforming tender (need to pass a given threshold). Savings in the new generation contracts have been conservatively quoted between 10–15%. As a result, productivity gains are achieved in these new contracts and appear to be very fruitful.</p>
<p>Ontario, Canada is struggling with the early adventures in alternative project delivery methods for the capital projects. Maintenance contracting is on a world-class level and contract durations are further than any country in the study.</p>
<h2>6.4 Holland</h2>
<p>Holland has significantly progressed over the last eight years and is mainly using Design-Build and DBFM models for the capital investment projects. Design-Bid-Build is rarely used, except for dredging applications. Design-Build has been a success story and costs are almost always lower. Innovations have been realized in bridge and traffic controls during construction periods. Politically, PPP or DBFM is the preferred method of choice for large projects and needs to be determined if the model provides VfM and is a success story. One Alliance model project is underway, but is too early to make any comparisons. Early comments are that the partnering and teamwork seem to work well.</p>
<p>The contracting industry is also in favor of innovative practices, and is presently driving the right behavior. It was interesting to observe that most construction work is self-performed by the contractors or by their subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Holland has also recently revamped their maintenance contracts and has shifted from a selfdirecting to more of a performance based approach for most activities (except winter maintenance). These new generation contracts include more performance based aspects, using a hybrid type model to balance the risks, and including road resurfacing using a fixed price. The PBSA has duration of 3–5 years and may include some small capital items. The contractor selection process is using a 40–60% price consideration and depends on the region. Savings in the new generation contracts have been quoted as being over 40%, but there have been some quality adjustments. This is a significant improvement from the previous generation of contracts and places Holland in the category of world-class maintenance contracts.</p>
<p>Holland, similar to England, is very aggressive in their capital project delivery and has significantly modified the maintenance contracting practices to be aligned with world-class developments. They have a broad acceptance of alternative project delivery methods and practices, and the future challenge is to continue demonstrating VfM.</p>
<h2>6.5 Sweden</h2>
<p>Sweden like Finland has also merged the road and rail administrations into one organization called the Swedish Transport Administration (STA). STA has made the wise choice in retaining control of the regional offices as compared to its counterpart in Finland. Sweden has completed a few Design-Build projects and has also progressed into some DBOM contracts. They are the only country in this study that is using DBOM. The preliminary results from the DBOM projects have been termed quite well and are providing savings as compared with other models. However, there needs to be a systematic evaluation taking into account VfM over time. A quantitative evaluation of DBOM is not available, which is similar to the situation with using DB and its advanced variants. However, there are a large majority of projects using the DBB model.</p>
<p>Sweden has a cooperation forum with the contracting industry that is termed “FIA”. This is where ideas, practices and a cooperation type atmosphere between the client and contracting industry can be discussed and developed. Communication is an important part of keeping the trust and cooperation. This forum appears to have a positive effect on sharing ideas.</p>
<p>Sweden outsourced the maintenance activities approximately in 1995. They are using performance based contracts similar to Finland, except for using a winter index, where the contractor is paid based upon the actual winter occurrence. The market has matured, but the contract duration is still three years using the lowest price for selecting the contractor. Sweden has not progressed into long-term contracts as might be expected, and it might be a good recommendation to increase the duration to five or seven years for their next generation contracts, and be more aligned with the other progressive countries in the study.</p>
<p>Sweden is cautiously and optimistically moving forward in the use of alternative project delivery methods. There is strong desire and motivation to move forward as in other countries. The new organization will be tested to see if a pro-active approach is taken and if the maintenance contracts are taken to the next level. The industry is favorable toward alternative methods and now the strong push for productivity provides the opportunity to meet expectations.</p>
<h2>6.6 Maryland State Highway Administration in the USA</h2>
<p>Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) has been performing Design-Build projects for quite some time and has good experiences even with smaller Design-build projects. They are receiving approximately 50% fewer change orders compared to DBB and have realized savings in most of the Design-Build projects. MDSHA is also including upset prices, co-location on the largest Design-build projects, using a best value contractor selection criteria, projects completed earlier or on time, and tendering the project early in their design development stage (about 30% design development). Even though Design-Build projects account for about 4% of the number of total number of projects, they account for approximately 27% when compared with the total costs. Also, they do not exclude projects, but determine which project is potentially applicable for Design-Build during the early design phases. They have an internal and simple decision system for knowing which projects are fit for Design-Build projects.</p>
<p>They have tested the DBOM for a wastewater project, but not for road projects. The results were very good and had received innovation concepts that would not normally occur. MDHSA has been accepting several Alternative Technical Concepts (ATCs) in the tenders and have surprisingly received them even when they were not asked. It can be stated that the contracting industry is driving the innovations, which hopefully continue to produce productivity benefits.</p>
<p>MDSHA is having success on their Design-Build projects and are carefully selecting projects that are more applicable for DB usage. It will be interesting if there is any further progression into the advanced variants of Design-Build or will the trend continue is the same direction. On the other hand DBB projects still rule and account for the majority of practices.</p>
<h2>6.7 Virginia DOT in USA</h2>
<p>Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) has been doing Design-Build for over ten years and receiving similar benefits as MDSHA. They are approximately 80% fewer change orders compared to DBB and have realized savings in most of the Design-Build projects. Other factors include upset prices in a few projects, co-location on the largest Design-Build projects, using a best value contractor selection criteria, projects completed earlier or on time, and tendering the project early in their design development stage (about 30% design development). Even though Design-Build projects account for about 4% of the number of total projects, they account for approximately 25% when compared to the total costs.</p>
<p>VDOT has realized innovations with bridges, traffic control and management, which have been mainly contractor lead innovations. There is one DBFO project which is the well known Interstate 495 beltway around Washington D.C. and will be tolled using “hot lanes”. Traffic issues are the highest priority due to the congestion on the highways and near the nation’s capital. As with other DBFO projects, it is too early to make any conclusions as the project is still being constructed.</p>
<p>VDOT had one of the first performance based contracts tendered in the world, which was a total asset maintenance contract that included road resurfacing (few in the world at that time). Recently, a decision was made to have performance maintenance contracts for all the interstate highways in Virginia (corridor approach). The decision makers have now required severe budget reductions and as a result, the new generation contracts are using a hybrid model, which includes performance and method based requirements. These new contracts are five years in duration, measure the performance of the contractor, balance the risks with the contractors, use informal partnering and communications, use the lowest price conforming tender, and contractors must meet the MRP rating system for service delivery. The contracts are now beginning to entice more competition and bidders, as medium sized companies are beginning to understand and become knowledgeable regarding performance based contracts. VDOT is pleased with the outcomes as their internal maintenance crews are servicing the remaining roads under their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>VDOT is quite similar to MDSHA in having success on their Design-Build projects, but there appears to be more freedom (PPTA) to select alternative delivery methods. They are also realizing success on their DBB projects as smart practices can be included in any model. DBB project still accounts for a large number of projects. Maintenance contracts continue to evolve and are considered a best practice.</p>
<h2>6.8 Minnesota DOT in the USA</h2>
<p>Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) has been doing Design-Build for many years and receiving similar benefits as MDSHA and VDOT. MnDOT was the only interview partner with whom the interview was performed via telecom and the questionnaire was answered by email. MnDOT is receiving significant benefits in Design-Build with fewer change orders, less cost overruns, and getting projects completed earlier compared with the DBB model. Other factors include receiving innovations in the ATCs, getting more innovation in the methodology of working methods, and using a best value approach to contractor selection criteria. They are also using A + B Bidding, which has reduced the project completion time. Even though Design-Build projects account for about 1% of the number of total projects, they account for approximately 20% when compared with the total costs. However, one of the experiences is that Design-Build is not necessarily cheaper and sometimes costs more. It is difficult to explain this, but it may be offset by quicker delivery and innovations. It is difficult to compare costs as all projects are different and hard to compare against one another.</p>
<p>MnDOT looks at complex projects, staffing availability, ATCs, co-location of project personnel, and schedule as the main trigger points for using Design-Build.</p>
<p>MnDOT is having success on their Design-Build projects and are carefully selecting projects that are more applicable for DB usage. It will be interesting if there is any further progression or if the trend will decline? DBB accounts for the majority of practices and appears to be performing satisfactorily.</p>
<h2>7. Summary and Principle Conclusions</h2>
<p>Transportation projects require a custom made solution and not a one size fits all solution, and it is important to compare many factors during project selection. All project delivery methods have provided successes, not so successful attempts, and results between favorable and unfavorable. Every project has a different set of requirements, objectives, challenges, and the owners should carefully consider these requirements in the context of their own culture, environmental issues, and technical characteristics to decide which project delivery method provides the best opportunity for success. On the other hand, it does make a difference which project delivery method is selected and countries should develop a systematic decision making process to assure that the best method or best likely method is used for each project. Also, having quantitative data will greatly assist the decision making process.</p>
<p>In summary, productivity of the road building contractors is not measured by any of the owners/clients and it is extremely difficult to measure or compare. Design-Build and its variants, if used correctly, have better potential to influence productivity, at least in the long run. There are many factors that can influence productivity both positively and negatively, which were previously mentioned earlier in the report. Early contractor involvement into the design phase usually produces better outcomes. One important feature is how to drive the correct behavior of the road building contractors to be more productive. Perhaps the main role for clients is to have a successful framework, provide enough flexibility, and the ability to accept contractors’ innovations and efficiencies.</p>
<p>For maintenance contracting, productivity is not measured by the public entities. Productivity gains are mainly achieved by open competition for the services. A performance based approach, long term duration, integrated services (bundling services) as much as possible, and a substantial sized road area should contribute to better efficiency and productivity.</p>
<p>In the final state, the productivity is driven by the contractors’ processes, methodology, ingenuity, project management skills, innovation, and by lean construction practices (reducing waste in all phases). The main influence by the client is to use the best procurement method for the project and allow enough freedom for the contractors without corrupting the objectives of the customers using the roads. There is no guarantee for success, but the clients should provide the best opportunity or framework for success.</p>
<h2>7.1 Capital Projects</h2>
<p>Road agencies (clients) can mainly influence factors related to productivity through the project delivery methods. According to this study, even though somewhat subjective, the Design-Build method is more likely to influence productivity. The DBOM, DBFO (DBFM) and other Design-Build variants are speculated to positively influence productivity since they use the DB component, but the test of time and objective data are not available and cannot make any valid conclusions. These advanced DB variants have other benefits and attempt to focus toward Life Cycle Costing (LCC), and subjective comments suggest that these models are “somewhat promising”.</p>
<p>Other factors contributing to productivity are; performance based requirements (functional requirements), to allow more freedom and flexibility of the contractors (done in many ways), to use incentives and disincentives where appropriate, to allow Alternative Technical Concepts (ATCs) or innovations, by using various forms of time based criteria (where appropriate), prefabrication and structural innovations, the Building Information Model (BIM), bundling projects to take advantage from the scale of economy and scope, allow value engineering concepts, and additional design freedom for the contractors. These factors should be used wisely and in accordance to the unique details of each project and their objectives. Also, what works for other countries may not necessarily work as well in your country!</p>
<p>The most important finding is that it is possible to foster productivity in any procurement method by including those factors and concepts mentioned in the report or accrued elsewhere.</p>
<p>The main benefit of the Design-Build model is time savings, the potential to foster innovation and customer oriented solutions (especially time savings) by integrating the design and construction phases. The Design-Build project delivery methods need to be “ implemented correctly ” in order to receive the intended benefits. A classic example is to minimize the amount of design as possible, yet retain enough to have a clearly defined scope and technical solutions. Other arguments or characteristics of Design-Build projects include a clear scope, more suitable to complex project, schedule driven (time demands), budget is approved, environmental approval, no extensive constraints, allowing ATCs, and sufficient client resources to enhance the cooperation and teamwork. A significant enhancement to the DB model is co-location of the client, designer and contractor to enhance the teamwork and expedite the process.</p>
<p>The overall productivity influence is the means and methods used by contractors to organize the work processes and are not typically under the influence or control of the clients, but can be encouraged by providing the right circumstances, the right incentives, and attempting to drive the correct behavior. In essence, creating an environment of opportunities and framework for success can have a positive influence on the productivity of road building contractors.</p>
<h2>7.2 Maintenance</h2>
<p>The public entities are also not measured productivity of the maintenance contractors. Productivity gains in maintenance contracts are more difficult because maintenance is mainly dealing with the repair and upkeep of assets. The main productivity gains are achieved by placing the maintenance services into open competition, which may be a highly contentious and controversial issue in some countries. All countries in this study except for a handful in the USA have placed all their maintenance services in full open competition and are using a Performance Based Service Agreements (PBSA) concept. The PBSA approach deviates significantly versus outsourcing using traditional methods and practices.</p>
<p>Other factors contributing to productivity are; using incentives and disincentives, allowing more freedom and flexibility of the contractors, using longer term contracts (as much as possible), using larger areas (economy of scale), bundling of services (economy of scope), a balanced approach to risks, having innovative and modern intelligent equipment, using partnering, measuring the performance of the maintenance contractors, applying an ICT system that is flexible and easy to use, and using the hybrid model.</p>
<p>Asset management systems need to be robust and flexible to manage the assets and make sure that performance, reliability, efficiency, potential savings, and quality are achieved.</p>
<p>Also,  what works for other countries may not necessarily work as well in your country , as the cultural differences may have a significant impact. Having a well organized and efficient maintenance regime certainly influences productivity, but is mainly dependent upon the contractor’s processes and practices. This requires a learning process and may not be achieved by the novice clients and those having a traditional approach to asset maintenance. In essence, creating an environment of opportunities and framework for success can have a positive influence on the productivity.</p>
<h2>8. Recommendations</h2>
<p>The project has produced significant information on the factors influencing productivity and the procurement methods used in some of the progressive countries. Productivity through procurement was the main theme of the research, and the project delivery system selected has a great influence on the success of a project and is substantiated by practical results and other research studies.</p>
<p>The results also indicate that it is possible to foster productivity in any procurement method by including factors discussed in the text or accrued elsewhere.</p>
<p>The recommendation is that the Design-Build model should be increased and used to a greater potential. It is important to understand that not all projects favor the Design-Build model and it is important to use the appropriate model for that particular project . A teaming and partnering approach and co-location (medium to large sized projects) in Design-Build often produces the better results. Other recommendations include allowing innovations and alternative practices as well as using more performance based requirements, time based aspects when appropriate (A +B Bidding), and incentives that drive the correct behavior/results.</p>
<p>Recommendations are listed as follows in their order of importance.</p>
<p>First Recommendation – Systematic Evaluation</p>
<p>There is a lack of a thorough systematic quantitative evaluation of each project and via project delivery method. This would be significantly useful to practitioners in determining the success level of a completed project. Also, hand-in-hand is to develop a decision matrix for selection of project delivery methods, which could potentially determine the best fit. There are guidelines available from other countries, which could be used for a base reference and be considered for further development.</p>
<p>Second Recommendation – Testing Alternative Methods</p>
<p>It is wise to test each method and learn best practices for each method. Design-Build should be the first step before advancing into the complex variants, because they typically demand more knowledge and resources. It should be understood that it is the Design-Build component in advanced variants that influences efficiency and productivity.</p>
<p>A few projects may not be sufficient to determine its merits and validation. It is not possible to evaluate the success if alternative project delivery methods have not been used or tested to some degree.</p>
<p>Third Recommendation – Freedom, Flexibility and Innovation</p>
<p>Allowing the contractors more freedom and flexibility when performing the work, can lead to productivity gains. Innovations are strongly desired and the best approach should be determined, whether by Design-Build or other methods. Also, a process should be created to determine the acceptance of ATCs. This also includes the use of more performance/functional requirements, which requires due diligence and robust data.</p>
<p>Fourth Recommendation – Collect Cost Data</p>
<p>There is a concern that the cost data in the form of unit prices need to be collected and used for evaluating productivity. The question then becomes at what level do you desire to compare the productivity and if it is the clients’ obligation? Cost data is a good benchmark as it is a quantitative measure. However, collecting the cost data is not a means to an end, even though the cost data is important. Even if data is collected, it is important to have homogenous elements within the cost data to make objective comparisons. Cost data is also important politically and not knowing the costs of various elements/groups is not a good outcome. Knowing the cost is also important when considering Life Cycle Cost (LCC) and also important in asset management.</p>
<p>Fifth Recommendation – Implementing Robust Factors</p>
<p>Factors that influence productivity have been gathered and demonstrated. The next step is the implementation of these diverse factors into the practices and project delivery methods.</p>
<p>It is also important to identify which factors are more favorable and their relative importance. This means that a robust collection of data and results is needed to determine the scale of importance. This may or may not be possible to determine objectively, but may be qualitatively inferred.</p>
<p>Sixth Recommendation – Continue Benchmarking</p>
<p>The study shows several findings and the complexities of productivity related to procurement. The Design-Build method shows strong evidence and results, but should not be considered a panacea. It is recommended to continue benchmarking as there may not have been enough projects to objectively compare results. It is possible that the lessons learned and best practices were not utilized properly during the first few Design-Build projects so this should be taken into consideration for the next application of DB.</p>
<p>Seventh Recommendation – Design Degradation</p>
<p>The study revealed that the design quality is not as good as in the past. This seems to be a common problem internationally. This requires further analysis to determine if this is possibly related to the outsourcing of design, the procurement practices (lower bids), a loss of expertise, or other factors.</p>
<p>For maintenance contracts, healthy/functional competition is a vital aspect in order to have success now and in the future. Each country needs to find ways to make it happen. The other recommendations are continue adding more performance requirements when appropriate (not all aspects have fully developed robust performance requirements), use a hybrid model which has the possibility to allow for innovations, and to balance the risks.</p>
<p>Five to seven year contract duration (the longer the better) is also recommended and aligned with international practices. This would provide economies of scale and assist in the investment of equipment which is difficult in three year contract durations.</p>
<p>The winter index should be re-evaluated to determine if risks are properly distributed to the contractors. This may require further study.</p>
<p>Asset management systems need to be robust and flexible to manage the complexity of the road assets and make sure that performance, reliability, and quality are satisfactorily maintained.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>Knowing that the implementation of alternative methods and changing the culture takes time, it is still considered being a worthy process. Design-Build for infrastructure projects should be seriously considered, because the time element is the benefit most widely accepted by professionals around the world. Most infrastructure projects today consider time, innovation and productivity as important features. Teamwork was an original intend in the DB method and is an important tool to solve problems and disputes.</p>
<p>In both capital and maintenance contracting, productivity gains are mainly at the control and destiny of the contractors. Productivity is driven by the contractors’ processes, methodology, ingenuity, project management skills, innovation, and by lean construction practices (reducing waste in all phases). The main influence by the client is to use the best procurement method for the project and allow enough freedom for the contractors.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee for success, and implementation may be burdensome or take time to fully develop a viable practice. The clients should take the lead position and provide the best opportunity or framework for success.</p>

<h2>Appendix A: Definitions</h2>
<p>Design-Bid-Build (DBB -Traditional Method):</p>
<p>In this model, an owner/client procures the services of a design consultant to develop the scope of the project and complete design documents. After the design is essentially complete, the owner/client procures a contractor to build the project according to the design and all related documentation and specifications. It is a linear process or segmented approach. Typically, in a public organization the proposal is in an open competition according to the procurement rules. (Countries in the EU must conform to the EU rules for procurement). After the project is completed, the owner is responsible for operations and maintenance.</p>
<p>Construction Management (At Fee - CM@Fee):</p>
<p>This is a process similar to the DBB model (traditional model), where the owner/client is responsible for the design, bidding, and construction of a project. However, the CM organization takes on the responsibility as an advisor to the client for administration and management, constructability issues, day-to-day activities and possibly quality verification. The CM organization has no contractual obligation to the design and construction entities, and is usually paid a fee for the services.</p>
<p>Construction Management - At Risk Advisor (CM@Risk):</p>
<p>In this scenario the owner/client has one agreement with the Construction Manager, who then has an advisory role with the design consultant, and then usually becomes the general contractor (or assumes the risk if another contractor is used) to complete the project. CM@Risk assumes the risks for constructing the project, which differentiates this model from CM@Fee. After the project is completed, the owner is responsible for operations and maintenance.</p>
<p>Design-Build (DB):</p>
<p>Design-Build is a project delivery method in which the owner/client selects an organization that will complete both the remaining design portion and the construction of a project in one agreement. The completion of design and construction may occur simultaneously. Usually the initial design is procured by the design consultant. After the project is completed, the owner is then responsible for operations and maintenance.</p>
<p>Design-Build-Operate-Maintain (DBOM):</p>
<p>Design-Build-Operate-Maintain is a project delivery method in which the owner/client selects an organization that will complete the design, construction, maintenance and an agreed upon period of operational parameters under one agreement. Upon termination of the contract agreement, the owner is responsible for operations and the maintenance of the project. The DBOM model has the potential to be more aligned with Life Cycle Costs (LCC).</p>
<p>Design-Build/Finance/Operate (DBFO) and Design-</p>
<p>Build/Finance/Maintain (DBFM):</p>
<p>Design-Build/Finance/Operate is a project delivery method similar to DBOM, except that the contractor is also responsible for financing the project. The contractor assumes the risks of financing, design, construction, and maintenance until the end of the contract period. There are various types of payment schemes used to receive payment for the services. The DBFO model has the potential to be more aligned with Life Cycle Costs (LCC).</p>
<p>Build Own Operate Transfer (BOOT):</p>
<p>Build Own Operate Transfer is a project delivery method similar to DBFO, except that there is an actual transfer of ownership. The Contractor is responsible and assumes the risks for the design, construction, maintenance, operations, and financing of the project.</p>
<p>Lump Sum:</p>
<p>Lump Sum is considered as a fixed price agreement for the total work and products of a given project. Sometimes this is also referred to as a “Fixed Price” contract.</p>
<p>Unit Price or Schedule of Rates:</p>
<p>This refers to price considerations for specific activities or services performed for the project, such as construction work and/or materials. For example, the cost per unit for a guard rail is measured in €/meter.</p>
<h2>Appendix B: Questionnaires</h2>
<p>Capital Projects:</p>
<p>Design-Build? 10.What are Designer’s concerns, challenges, and perception of</p>
<p>Design-Build? 11.How do you tender the projects? What Contractor Selection Criteria is used? 12.What are some of the Best Practices in Contractor Selection Criteria? Are there any Incentives used? What are the challenges? How can a contractor propose innovations during the tendering phase and also during the actual project implementation? Any examples? 13.Does the use of Performance Specifications/Measures increaseing productivity or innovation? Please explain how? 15.Does Project Management affect productivity? What are some examples? 16.What type of evaluation is done after each project? What factors are considered? Do you have a systematic approach? Is there any government agency involved in evaluation of the project? Or involved in evaluation of the procurement process? What are you measuring in terms of cost? (Unit prices, overall cost or other)? 19.How do you train the client’s staff in becoming procurement experts? Are you using consultants? Are there any official training classes? How is this implemented all the way into the organization and to the local offices? Please provide some examples?</p>
<p>Maintenance Contracting: 10.Does the use of Performance Specifications/Measures increaseing productivity or innovation? Please explain how? 12.Does Project Management affect productivity? What are some examples? 13.What type of evaluation is done after contract duration? What factors are considered? Do you have a systematic approach?</p>
