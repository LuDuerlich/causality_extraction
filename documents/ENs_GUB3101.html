<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>June 2004 to appoint an all-party committee of inquiry (the Rural Development Committee, Jo 2004:05) with the remit of drafting a long-term strategy for national policy for rural development. The strategy is to build on the objective of the ecologically, economically and socially sustainable development of rural areas, including the role of agriculture, forestry, fishing and reindeer husbandry and their conditions for development.</p>
<p>The Rural Development Committee has identified the following important conditions for the attainment of the overall objective:</p>
<p>– Local influence and a  “bottom-up perspective” in order to benefit from differences and distinctive features.</p>
<p>– A stronger position for the rural perspective in all policy areas and in all policy design.</p>
<p>– A holistic perspective and  inter-sectoral cooperation in view of the distinctive features and special needs of rural areas.</p>
<p>– Clarification of responsibility for the implementation of rural policy.</p>
<p>Based on this, the Rural Development Committee has given the following titles to the five chapters that make up the core of its final report.</p>
<p>– Local perspective on democracy, responsibility and roles.</p>
<p>– Rural business and the rural labour market.</p>
<p>– Landscape change – agriculture, forestry, fishing and reindeer husbandry , nature and the cultural environment.</p>
<p>– Challenges to make everyday life work – living conditions in rural areas.</p>
<p>– Skills, learning and research.</p>
<p>The proposals of the Rural Development Committee are summarised below under these headings.</p>
<p>Local perspective on democracy, responsibility and roles</p>
<p>Social changes due to globalisation, EU membership and regionalisation have created new structures in the democratic system. New decision-making levels have been added at the same time as sectorisation and specialisation present obstacles to the application of a holistic perspective to important social issues. In central government there is a centralising tendency that results in different functions being brought together in fewer organisational bodies. One important part of a strategy for sustainable economic, social and environmental development is to drawn on people’s commitment to their local community.</p>
<p>The Rural Development Committee’s proposals to the</p>
<p>Government:</p>
<p>Underline the fundamental importance of the local level and the non-profit sector for local development.</p>
<p>Put in place the conditions needed to give the local level continuous influence on municipal, regional and national processes of change and development.</p>
<p>Strengthen the participation of local development groups, associations, popular movements and organisations in the development and implementation of activities that create good conditions for making everyday life work.</p>
<p>Clarify roles and responsibilities throughout the public structure for rural development.</p>
<p>Develop a better-coordinated central government sector for rural areas.</p>
<p>Strengthen cooperation between planning and decision-making bodies at all levels.</p>
<p>Develop public-sector leadership and support local leadership so as to draw on people’s initiative and abilities.</p>
<p>Take account of local needs in development planning and physical planning.</p>
<p>Cooperate with local interest groups to draft municipal comprehensive plans that highlight the resources and potential of rural areas.</p>
<p>Stimulate and enable municipalities to actively develop strategic local development planning for rural areas rooted in the municipality’s overall strategies and visions, in cooperation with the local level.</p>
<p>Promote the formation of partnerships between public administration, companies and non-profit organisations as a powerful method tool in development processes in which democratic scrutiny has to be secured.</p>
<p>Strengthen political influence and involvement at municipal and regional level concerning the preparation and decision process for the Rural Development Programme in the parts where this is possible, especially in axes 1 and 3. This also applies to other programmes of importance for rural development.</p>
<p>Clarify and strengthen the rural dimension of regional development planning.</p>
<p>Significantly reinforce the role of the municipalities in regional work on strategies and programmes (RDP work) in which rural areas must be highlighted, stimulated and given priority.</p>
<p>Develop coordination at regional level for preparation of and decisions on issues concerning regional development (especially issues concerning the regional development programme).</p>
<p>Strengthen coordination in the Government Offices and improve the Government’s control of agencies and state-owned companies in order to stimulate the development of rural areas.</p>
<p>Describe the impacts for rural areas ahead of all planned political decisions and instruct public authorities and publicly owned companies to describe the consequences of decisions and measures for rural services and other rural development (ruralproofing).</p>
<p>Follow up how public authorities fulfil these instructions in a broad cross-sectoral perspective.</p>
<p>Make sure that follow-ups and evaluations are carried out continuously as part of the learning and development process.</p>
<p>Rural business and the rural labour market</p>
<p>Rural Sweden needs a more diverse business sector with a dynamic labour market. Green industries are a base for growth and development. The cross-fertilisation of agriculture, forestry, fishing and reindeer husbandry and other industries accounts for an important part of the major assets of rural areas. Combined with expansive entrepreneurship and good infrastructure this can help to give the</p>
<p>whole country a more growth-oriented and socially responsible economy with a good and varied living environment.</p>
<p>The Rural Development Committee’s proposals to the Government:</p>
<p>Develop the special conditions and assets of rural areas in issues concerning enterprise and the labour market by reinforcing the rural dimension of the relevant policy areas.</p>
<p>Deepen the knowledge and understanding of the resources and potential of rural areas for economic development and employment among municipalities, government authorities, financial institutions, education coordinators, and business and organisations.</p>
<p>Improve the conditions for rural businesses and entrepreneurs through a considerable reinforcement to enable active use of comprehensive infrastructure in the form of communications and IT systems. The public sector has a particular responsibility for sparsely populated and rural areas.</p>
<p>Reinforce the possibilities for rural companies to develop their operations. Important areas are: generation shifts, supply of skills, financing/investment opportunities, innovation/R&D, and expanded markets and market knowledge. Particular attention must be given to the ability of rural companies to access capital.</p>
<p>Clarify the special conditions of place-bound companies as potential for strategic growth. Strategic areas are production and processing of food products and forest raw materials, the production of renewable energy, tourism, recreation, and landscape and nature conservation.</p>
<p>Give supplementary terms of reference to the Working Committee on Constitutional Reform to present proposals for a clarification of Chapter 2, Section 18 of the Instrument of Government (right to property) with the intention of paying particular attention to the conditions for the development of place-bound industries.</p>
<p>Secure a long-term and sustainable balance between the conservation of arable land for the production of food and energy, on the one hand, and the use of such land for community development and other public purposes, on the other.</p>
<p>Clarify that in selecting locations for community development consideration is to be given to arable land as a production resource both through physical planning and through the application of the Environmental Code’s general rules of consideration concerning land and water management in certain areas.</p>
<p>Improve the conditions for small-scale activities and production in the application of existing regulations.</p>
<p>Simplify the regulations for public procurement and their application for small-scale activities and production.</p>
<p>Landscape change – agriculture, forestry, fishing and reindeer husbandry, nature and the cultural environment</p>
<p>The landscape as a resource builds on an economic, social and environmental dimension of great importance for people’s quality of life. Landscape values are to be conserved and developed through protection, management and planning. At the same time, the landscape has several important functions for economic growth. The balance between private and public interests in the landscape is a positive challenge that can generate new jobs. The Rural Development Committee considers that a landscape that is experienced as attractive can be used in an effective, sustainable and productive way at the same time. The balance between private and public interests in the landscape provides the opportunity of creating new jobs on condition that more people get involved.</p>
<p>The Rural Development Committee’s proposals to the</p>
<p>Government:</p>
<p>Make the resources of the landscape visible to the general public by increasing the interfaces between town and country. It is particularly important to make knowledge about the links to and dependence on the landscape clear to children and young people.</p>
<p>Strengthen knowledge about the landscape’s values at all political and administrative levels.</p>
<p>Develop planning tools and design processes so that they build on a holistic perspective and enable local participation.</p>
<p>Develop assessment tools so that the contribution of environmental producers to public goods can be assessed and made visible.</p>
<p>Support active new initiatives that seek to combine various social, economic and environmental objectives set up by society.</p>
<p>Create demonstration environments, evaluate trials and spread knowledge about good examples, where land with high nature and environmental values is also accessible.</p>
<p>Strengthen active use through advice, skills development and simplified application of various regulations.</p>
<p>Make use of the landscape’s potential as a producer of sustainable energy.</p>
<p>Strengthen knowledge about links between nature values, employment and energy production linked to society’s energy needs.</p>
<p>Take account of the change to the landscape when it is used for energy production and shed light on the effects of this change.</p>
<p>Strengthen preparedness ahead of future climate changes. Take account of the different conditions for meeting possible needs for areas for cultivation and for other land areas.</p>
<p>Strengthen knowledge about how climate changes can impact on different parts of the country.</p>
<p>Challenges to make everyday life work – living conditions in rural areas</p>
<p>The needs people have in order to make their everyday lives work for them are pretty similar. But their conditions differ. This is why different solutions must be possible, irrespective of where in the country we live, as well as what phase of life we are in.</p>
<p>The Rural Development Committee considers that everyone living in rural areas is entitled to good housing, social security, safety and accessible services, good communications and guaranteed access to technical solutions like broadband and mobile telephony. Living patterns are constantly changing. For instance, today more people are choosing to live in their recreational home for larger periods of time.</p>
<p>The Rural Development Committee’s proposals to the</p>
<p>Government:</p>
<p>Develop a balanced and varied mix of types of housing for young people, old people and families with children in rural areas.</p>
<p>Investigate the consequences of more seasonal residents in order to find solutions that give municipalities with a large proportion of seasonal residents the right to compensation and the seasonal residents better democratic rights in the municipality they stay in for long periods of time.</p>
<p>Increase the ability of municipalities to provide good and attractive housing through more flexible rules on shoreline protection.</p>
<p>Strengthen and expand the state housing guarantee system in order to facilitate new-build and renovation in rural areas.</p>
<p>Strengthen the possibilities of conserving, developing and making use of housing environments of cultural and historical value.</p>
<p>Develop positive incentives for immigrants to move to rural areas.</p>
<p>Ensure basic social security and safety for people in rural areas.</p>
<p>Carry out a coordinated, long-term national programme of development work in order to enhance access to secure, accessible services at regional, municipal and local levels.</p>
<p>Instruct government authorities and state-owned companies to take more responsibility for rural development and to participate in new, coordinated service solutions.</p>
<p>Investigate the conditions for coordinating and developing other types of services via the rural postal delivery service.</p>
<p>Instruct the national traffic agencies to improve their followup of the distribution of funds for rural infrastructure.</p>
<p>Coordinate the operation and maintenance of and investments in the public and private road networks in rural areas, along with local, regional and national actors.</p>
<p>Take special action to develop and coordinate logistics for rural passenger, freight and goods transport.</p>
<p>Secure flight connections in areas with major geographical distances and also ferry connections to islands for both passenger and freight transport.</p>
<p>Adapt the possibilities of making tax deductions for work travel with private cars to energy costs.</p>
<p>Stimulate the development of environment-friendly traffic systems in sparsely-populated environments.</p>
<p>Secure the possibility of nationwide access to high-speed data communication and mobile telephony in rural areas and accelerate cooperation between different actors in society in order to reinforce preparedness to secure electricity supply, radio and telecommunications.</p>
<p>Skills, learning and research</p>
<p>Knowledge-based society makes greater demands for continuous learning by its citizens. This is why conditions must be created for lifelong learning. The system that has been built up for education is facing major challenges and renewal needs, not least on the basis of the situation in rural areas. It is extremely important to give special attention to the area of education and matching processes in small local labour markets, but the concept of learning in a broad sense also touches on questions of democracy, influence and participation. Rural meeting places for learning and development are important. Analyses need to be made of and strategies formulated for how these needs are to be satisfied in the future.</p>
<p>In an international comparison, Swedish rural research is relatively thin with a small amount of published work and limited participation in international research cooperation. In part this reflects the fact that rural areas and rural policy carry more weight in many other countries. Rural areas are not seen as a scientific field in Swedish research, and this has probably contributed to the relative invisibility of the rural dimension in Swedish policy. Swedish researchers who study conditions in rural areas mainly do so as part of research in their own disciplines. Exchanges between researchers are limited, mainly because there is a lack of contexts and arenas for this.</p>
<p>Land-based production and environmental issues have research structures with research councils, research strategies, established research fields and subjects. The Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research (MISTRA), the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas), the Swedish Farmers’ Foundation for Agricultural Research (SLF)</p>
<p>and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) play a major role for this research. SLU’s sectoral role has recently been investigated. However, there are no such structures and contexts for rural social and economic issues. Action should therefore be taken to support the development of a systematic body of knowledge on social and economic conditions in rural areas. There is also a need for cross-disciplinary research that brings social science and natural science perspectives to bear on rural development.</p>
<p>The Rural Development Committee’s proposals to the</p>
<p>Government:</p>
<p>Develop new organisational solutions and flexible forms for satisfying the need for education in rural areas.</p>
<p>Develop the forms for cooperation between local authorities, within local authorities and between actors in different policy areas in order to coordinate resources to satisfy the need for learning and education in rural areas.</p>
<p>Develop and strengthen centres of expertise that are of strategic importance for the situation and needs of their regions on the basis of existing resources and actors.</p>
<p>Influence attitudes and change gender roles in educational and vocational choices, both to meet the demand for labour in shortage occupations and to influence gender equality.</p>
<p>Strengthen critical and theory-generating research on social and economic change in rural Sweden.</p>
<p>Strengthen problemand action-oriented research that supports, examines and helps to bring about development work and innovations that can contribute to sustainable rural areas.</p>
<p>Strengthen empirical research that can inform politicians and other actors about the impacts of various measures.</p>
<p>Strengthen cross-disciplinary and multidisciplinary research on natural resources management and rural development.</p>
<p>Create contexts for exchanges and cooperation between Swedish rural researchers.</p>
