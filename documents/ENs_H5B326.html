<h1>Summary: Sharing economy – on the terms of the users</h1>
<h2>General starting points</h2>
<p>The sharing economy has been the object of great media interest in recent years. It has given rise to considerable debate and many questions. Several new enquiries and reports deal directly or indirectly with this type of economy. In simple terms, the sharing economy refers to that part of the economy in which private individuals, often via websites and mobile apps, can hire, hire out, exchange or loan resources from each other, such as machines, tools, vehicles, accommodation and labour. The number of platforms within the sharing economy has grown quickly. There are several predictions pointing to that this economy will grow considerably, not least in quantitative financial terms.</p>
<p>However, the sharing economy is not a new phenomenon. Neighbours, friends and acquaintances have always lent each other tools, machinery and agricultural implements or helped each other out with services and favours of various kinds. The new factor is that websites and mobile apps now permit a more systematic sharing with a much wider circle of users than before.</p>
<p>The enquiry uses the term sharing economy to designate that part of the economy in which private individuals  grant each other access to under-used   resources, property as well as services, both free of charge and in return for payment. This can be done with the aid of digital platforms or via analogue forums, but their common feature is that resources can be shared with users beyond one’s own circle of acquaintances . Examples of such platforms, whereby private individuals can come in contact with each other, include Airbnb and Couchsurfing, which mediate short-term accommodation between private individuals in many countries via their websites.</p>
<p>The main model of the sharing economy typically comprises a tripartite structure whereby the users, i.e. those who offer and provide or request and use a service, enter into an agreement with each other. The service and contact between users is mediated by a platform which may be digital or take analogue form. The new factor, and the background to this assignment, is the growth of digital platforms which are adapted specifically to transactions in the sharing economy.</p>
<p>As a rule, therefore, the model involves three different agreements. Each of the two users enters into an individual user agreement  with the mediating platform. The third agreement is concluded between the users  and may, for instance, relate to the hire or loan of objects, accommodation or services, i.e. various kinds of work input.</p>
<p>The development of the sharing economy evokes many questions from a user perspective. A first question concerns the status of the user on the basis of consumer law. Laws such as the Consumer Protection Act and the Consumer Services Act apply when traders sell goods or services to individual consumers. Both these acts protect consumers and supersede any contractual conditions which provide less effective consumer protection. The starting point is that the weaker party, namely the consumer, typically needs to be protected. However, consumer rights do not apply to transactions within the sharing economy as long as the supplying party does not act as a trader: the assumption is then that both parties are equally strong.</p>
<p>When private individuals enter into an agreement with each other, it can in many cases be unclear as to which of them really is the stronger or weaker party. It may even be unclear in which situations a party is a private individual or whether he/she should instead be treated as a professional trader. In the sharing economy, the mediating platform is added to the equation. In many cases this lack of clarity can extend to the responsibility of the platform vis-à-vis the users as well as to the relationship between them.</p>
<p>If a dispute arises between users who are private individuals, the litigation options are more limited than in an agreement between a consumer and a trader. Thus the National Board for Consumer Disputes (ARN) does not examine disputes between private individuals. Product safety and product responsibility can also become unclear when private individuals loan or hire objects from each other, are passengers in each other’s cars or hire accommodation from each other. In this way, the sharing economy challenges several of the basic assumptions of our current economy and society, such as established business structures, regulatory frameworks and relationships. The enquiry should thus be seen against this background.</p>
<p>In its introductory survey of sharing economy platforms, the enquiry applies a broad perspective. The survey covers platforms in a wide sense, such as web-based platforms and apps adapted to transactions in the sharing economy, other types of web-based platforms used to mediate sharing economy transactions, such as</p>
<p>Facebook, as well as analogue platforms, such as swop markets, bicycle kitchens, clothing and tool banks.</p>
<p>In a later phase of the enquiry, which deals with the roles of the users and platforms, their legal status and the need for legislation and inspection, the enquiry applies a narrower perspective. It then focuses principally on web-based  commercial platforms  whose market activities are regulated by market law. In this context, it also covers the rules which apply when private individuals enter into mutual agreements, irrespective of the type of platform used, and how such rules can be applied in the sharing economy.</p>
<h2>Models of sharing economy transactions</h2>
<p>In its  survey of sharing economy models, the enquiry has collected information from online searches and social media. These searches have resulted in a large number of recent reports, newspaper articles, overviews, fact books and other documentation which describe the sharing economy and its various players. This information has been collated and resulted in a directory of platforms within the sharing economy.</p>
<p>The directory covers some sixty platforms or platform types. They represent an extensive range of types of activity, geographical reach as well as the dimension of non-profit versus commercial activities. The various types of goods, services and other utilities shared via these platforms represent widely disparate sectors, such as shortterm accommodation, as well as movable property of many different types such as tools, machinery, clothing, toys and leisure equipment. Furthermore, there are platforms for sharing transport and a wide variety of other types of service such as childcare, garden work, cleaning, computer support, transport services, etc.</p>
<p>The directory gives a picture of the offer side of the sharing economy in Sweden in autumn 2016, but only in qualitative terms. It provides no basis for quantifying  how widespread the various types of platforms are as regards the utilities which are offered, the distribution between web-based and analogue platforms or distribution between commercial and non-profit platforms. There are, for example, a large number of local Facebook groups and analogue local marketplaces which could not be mapped and quantified within the scope of the enquiry.</p>
<p>From a geographical perspective, the survey shows that the platforms of the sharing economy can be divided up into the following main groups: 1. International platforms that address users in many countries, whereby the sharing of resources can take place at international level (Airbnb, etc.). 2. International platforms that address users in many countries but where the sharing of resources takes place locally (Streetbank, Care.com, etc.). 3. National platforms that address users in Sweden and where the sharing of resources takes place locally (Rentl, Yepstr, etc.). 4. Local platforms, practically exclusively analogue ones, where resources are shared locally (swop shops, clothing banks, etc.). 5. Groups on Facebook and other social media not adapted specifically to sharing economy transactions and which share resources locally.</p>
<p>By far the most common payment model  for the services of commercial platforms is that of payment by commission , but payment via the purchase of “ premium or gold membership ” is also seen. A basic level of service may be free of charge, but paid membership offers additional functions and is considered to increase the users’ chances of finding a counterparty and completing a transaction. As a rule, both users pay in one way or another for the service. Those who are looking for a service can, for example, pay a service charge. It is also common for both users, according to the conditions of use, to pass their personal data on to the platform. That too is a form of payment.</p>
<p>Payment between users  can take place in many different ways. This is sometimes regulated in greater or lesser detail in the conditions of use. In certain cases it is prohibited for users to accept payment from each other. In other cases, an interval or various guidelines are stipulated for calculating the compensation between the users. Pricing can also be completely free and be left up to users to agree among themselves.</p>
<p>The platforms of the sharing economy offer various functions designed to create security and trust between the users and between them and the platform. One such method is to provide some form of review system , i.e. more or less sophisticated systems allowing users to rate each other and submit reviews.</p>
<p>Identification via bank IDs, for example, to confirm the identity of users is another example of a function designed to create security among users. This can also be done by logging on to the platform via a Facebook account. Users can then obtain information about the counterparty via his/her Facebook profile.</p>
<p>Especially in the hiring of short-term accommodation, various types of financial guarantees are found which are designed to cover the costs of any damage caused by the counterparty. These guarantees may be issued by the mediating platform or take the form of a deposit that is handled by the platform and is paid before the transaction takes place, e.g. before hired accommodation is entered.</p>
<p>In some cases there is also a manned customer service, although this is relatively uncommon. In many cases, the platforms can be contacted only via an electronic contact form. Chat functions are also found, which in some cases resemble a customer service.</p>
<p>An overall impression of the survey is that the platforms often emphasize how easy it is to use their service, and often illustrate this by short animations or images. At the same time, the information on the platforms is often deficient in addressing issues that the enquiry deems to be of importance to the users. This refers, for example, to the preconditions for any tax liability and the criteria for deciding when a supplying user is to be considered as a trader. The latter is important for the type of legislation to be applied between the users in the event of a dispute. Furthermore, the enquiry, in most cases, found a lack of easily available information about the cost of using the platforms, as well as contact information to the platform. Another general impression is that commercial platforms sometimes portray themselves as non-profit operations.</p>
<h2>Users in the sharing economy</h2>
<p>The enquiry has a distinct user perspective. Its main task is to examine the existing legal rules in order to determine the extent to which they are fit for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of the users and, if that is not the case, to indicate the need for constitutional changes or other measures designed to strengthen and clarify the position of the users, both among themselves and in relation to the platforms.</p>
<p>Against this background, the enquiry commissioned the market research company Novus to carry out a broad-based user survey which comprised a pilot study of focus groups, a quantitative survey as well as in-depth interviews with “super-users”, i.e. people who have extensive user-experience of the sharing economy. The aim of the user-survey was to map the experiences of the Swedish population of the sharing economy in both qualitative and quantitative terms. A primary concern was to understand the occurrence and types of problems which may have occurred in user relationships or with respect to the mediating platform.</p>
<p>The results show that less than about ten per cent of the population have used sharing economy services at some time during the last two years. Most of them used these services only occasionally.</p>
<p>A clear majority, namely 80 per cent, of those who have participated in the sharing economy state that their experiences have been primarily positive . Three per cent stated that their experiences of transactions within the sharing economy have been primarily negative .</p>
<p>Almost seven out of ten respondents (68 per cent) who have used sharing economy services state that they did not experience any problems with another private individual in such transactions. On the other hand, a quarter state that they did run into problems. The most common was single  problems. The most widely reported problems concerned unfriendly treatment , delays or  non-appearance   as well as problems with payment . Between six and 18 per cent of the group which experienced problems describe situations to which consumer legislation would be applied, if it had been applicable to the relationship in question. This means that, generalised across the population as a whole, approximately 0.3 per cent have experienced problems in the sharing economy of a type which, in contrast to aspects such as unfriendly treatment, can be countered or remedied by civil legislation.</p>
<p>The respondents reported that some sharing economy services felt safer to use than others. The result is essentially the same irrespective of whether it concerns the provision or use of a service. Hire of short-term accommodation and small services are considered to be the most secure. The greatest insecurity is found in connection with boat and car hire and when a residence is made available as a workplace.</p>
<p>The respondents were also asked to state what would be needed for them to start using sharing economy service, or to use them more than at present. The most selected alternative, namely 37 per cent, related to laws  that would protect users more effectively in sharing economy transactions. An official quality labelling  or certification of the type “Safe e-commerce” is another measure supported by the respondents. A third of them stated this alternative. In third place comes access to a simple and inexpensive form of dispute settlement , which was selected by 28 per cent of respondents.</p>
<p>The survey showed that the main reason for not  using sharing economy services is simply that the respondents were unaware of their existence. Those who were aware of the availability of these services stated in the first place (83 per cent) that they did not need such services  as the reason for not using them. Just under a fifth stated insecurity in relationships with private individuals and that they preferred professional counterparties as the reason for avoiding the sharing economy.</p>
<h2>The roles and legal status of users and platforms</h2>
<p>Against the background of the existing rules in civil and market law, the enquiry analysed the possible roles and legal status of users and platforms in sharing economy transactions. No unequivocal answer was forthcoming, especially as the relevant laws cannot be enforced unless a user is treated as a trader.</p>
<p>The legal circumstances can be regulated in an agreement between the parties, and where such an agreement exists, its contents offer a starting point. However, the enquiry departs from a situation in which contractual rules between users are lacking, apart from those relating to matters such as the price, place and time of the transaction.</p>
<h2>Relations between users</h2>
<p>When the users, both those who supply and those who use goods or services, are to be considered as private individuals, their mutual relationships are regulated, apart from any private agreements between them, by the general civil law expressed in contract and purchaser-protection laws. If the supplying user is to be counted as a trader in the sense of consumer rights, then the Consumer Protection Act or the Consumer Services Act would be applicable. These give the accepting user greater protection and place greater responsibility on the supplying user than the general Sales of Goods Act, for example. So the question as to whether the supplying user is to be counted as a trader is central for deciding what laws should be applied in the agreement between the parties.</p>
<p>Thus if the Consumer Services Act is to be applied, the supplying user has a special responsibility to ensure that the service is provided in a professional way. Furthermore, he or she has a responsibility to dissuade the counterparty from accepting the service if it cannot ensure him/her a reasonable advantage. Price information may not be exceeded by more than 15 per cent. The requirements on information to the counterparty are higher in consumer relationships than in other business relationships and the law implies that the trader shall safeguard the interests of the counterparty to a higher degree than in other cases. Another significant difference between consumer law and other types of civil law is that the former is mandatory  to the benefit of the consumer, i.e. any contractual conditions that grant the consumer worse rights than those stipulated by law are invalid.</p>
<p>The preliminary work for the relevant consumer legislation indicates that the term trader  should be interpreted in a broad sense. This term covers all physical or legal persons who run an economic operation of a certain size and duration and of such a character that it may be designated as professional. The requirement for professionalism  aims mainly to avoid cases where a person may indeed be considered as a trader but in a particular case acts in his or her capacity as a private individual. In practice, the requirement on the size and duration of the operation plays a secondary role. As soon as more than a single transaction is carried out, this indicates that the seller, i.e. the provider, shall be considered as a trader. There is no requirement for the operation to run at a profit or that there be a profit motive. Even an operation which is classified as a hobby activity in fiscal law may be considered as a business activity in the sense of the consumer law.</p>
<p>This leads to the situation whereby a retired painter who carries out occasional painting and decorating work, via a sharing economy platform, for private individuals can be considered both as a user of a sharing economy service and as a trader in the sense of consumer law with respect to the ordering party. However, his or her status must be determined on a case by case basis and involves interpreting a diverse set of data such as the size of the operation, the professional expertise of the service provider and the form of association that may be applied.</p>
<p>There is rarely any special legislation which regulates the legal relationship between the users in a sharing economy transaction, when these act as private individuals. Here we ignore the purchase of objects that imply a transfer of ownership between private individuals as this is not within our definition of the sharing economy. In such cases the law relating to sales transactions applies. In other cases where relevant contractual conditions are lacking, this law must be applied in an analogue manner, together with the Consumer Protection Act and the Consumer Services Act. This applies for example when a private individual carries out garden work or hires out machinery or tools to another private individual where it is assumed that the supplying party is not a trader. These contract types constitute a significant share of the transactions that take place in the sharing economy.</p>
<p>In the business world too, for example in the hire of cars, machinery and tools between companies as well as for services, there is a lack of special legislation for hire and service agreements. In practice, however, pre-printed contractual conditions are always applied in such relationships to regulate the legal situation in the absence of relevant legislation. Examples of such contractual forms are the General Rules regularly applied in the construction sector as well as the rules applied by car hire companies, such as Hertz and Avis. When private individuals enter into mutual agreements, however, for example for small services or the hire of objects, the contractual relationship is as a rule unregulated apart from questions of the price, place and time of the transaction.</p>
<h2>Relations between users and platforms</h2>
<p>In relations between users and the platform,  as a rule consumer law applies in the event of a dispute between the users and the platform company. This presupposes that the dispute concerns the service, or a part of it, that the company has provides against payment, for instance to handle the payment flows between the users. An exception is when a supplying party is to be counted as a trader, where there is no consumer relationship between the user and the platform. Both are then traders. Moreover, the actions of a platform company on the market in consumer relationships can be verified in accordance with the market-law rules in those parts covered by the agreement. Inspections can be carried out on aspects such as marketing, price information and general conditions of use.</p>
<p>The contents and scope of the service offered by the platform to individual consumers must be determined on a case by case basis, not least from the information given on the platform and the contents of the general user conditions applied by the platform. This requires the application of the relevant laws and involves determining when a user does not act as a private individual with respect to the platform but as a trader.</p>
<p>A user can address a claim against the platform with respect to the other user as long as the platform has assumed such a responsibility directly or indirectly in its contractual conditions. It has for instance happened that, against the background of the general conditions of use, a sharing economy platform was recommended by the National Board for Consumer Disputes to pay compensation for the late return of a car for which the user of the car was liable.</p>
<h2>Observations relating to fiscal law</h2>
<p>The enquiry has not specifically investigated effects within the scope of fiscal law. However, it should be noted that tax rules can have a major impact on users of sharing economy platforms. Thus it should be stressed that the hire by private individuals of objects such as cars and machinery is taxed as capital gains at a thirty per cent rate.</p>
<p>In contrast, income from services that does not constitute business income is taxed as income from a hobby or individual assignment and benefits from a tax deduction of SEK 10,000 every year. Income derived from for instance providing services in the sharing economy, which exceeds this tax deduction, is added to other income from services, such as a salary or pension, and is taxed differently in each case depending on the amount of the marginal tax.</p>
<h2>The sharing economy internationally</h2>
<p>There has so far been no binding EU legislation pertaining directly to activities in the sharing economy. However, the growth of this economy has been noted by the Commission in a number of policy documents within the work aiming to achieve a more effective single market, and in particular its digital sector .</p>
<p>The notifications by the Commission relating to aspects such as the sharing economy and online platforms highlight both the opportunities and concerns regarding the question of the rights and obligations of users and platforms. The aim is to achieve a balanced and sustainable development of the sharing economy.</p>
<p>An international perspective shows that few countries have so far applied systematic national measures to promote or, if required, regulate the sharing economy. Among those European countries that have come furthest in analysing the function and effects of the sharing economy and applied measures are France, Great Britain and Italy.</p>
<p>The French measures include new legislation in force from October 2016. This stipulates e.g. that sharing platforms must apply clear and easily accessible general conditions. Public documents and data shall be made available via the Internet “ in a format that can be easily reused ”. This includes source code from software and algorithms that are used to handle data within the sphere of public administration, such as for calculating income tax. Moreover, the platforms must send an annual summary of their generated income to their users. Finally, it should be noted that private individuals should also pay social fees and register as traders if their income exceeds certain levels. Thus for hiring accommodation via a platform such as Airbnb, an annual sum of €23,000 applies, corresponding to about SEK 220,000. For hiring cars, boats, lawnmowers and similar items, the figure is €7,720 annually, corresponding to about SEK 73,000.</p>
<p>The national measures taken in Great Britain do not primarily concern new legislation. However, an exception is the new tax deduction which was introduced in order to promote transactions within the sharing economy. In the first place, the measures concern information services, quality certification of the sharing economy platforms and, in the absence of specifically adapted constitutional rules, standardised rental contracts for the short-term rental of private residences.</p>
<p>These are examples of measures which in practice presuppose the existence of functioning trade association bringing together sharing economy platforms. That is the case in Great Britain, where the trade association SharingEconomyUK  plays an important role, not least as regards the quality certification of these platforms.</p>
<p>In Italy, a legal proposal is currently being prepared for the regulation and registration of these platforms. It also requires them to deduct the users’ preliminary tax on income from all sharing economy transactions. This tax is accounted on the basis of a new income law, and at 10 per cent up to a limit of €10,000 annually, lower than the tax on other service incomes in Italy.</p>
<p>The enquiry has not found any examples of legislation being introduced or considered with the aim of regulating the legal relationship between the users  in the sharing economy. In contrast, there are examples, as we have seen, of legislation which regulates the activity of platforms and certain user-related aspects such as monitoring records and tax deductions. It seems to be the case that the reviewed countries are still looking into whether the existing rules of market law  can be applied to companies that run sharing economy platforms.</p>
<p>The Nordic countries have not got quite that far. Here, the sharing economy and its various user aspects are currently under study. In Norway, the governmental Sharing Economy Committee presented several proposals in February 2017 aiming to strengthen and clarify the position of the users, like extending the mediating function of the Consumer Board in consumer disputes to cover disputes between private individuals. The Committee also calls upon public authorities and companies to initiate a dialogue on the development of industry standards for sharing economy platforms.</p>
<h2>Overall assessment</h2>
<p>The term “ the  so-called  sharing economy ” is found in the first line of the government’s directive (Dir 2015:136). This expression indicates that the term and its meaning are not completely clear or generally known. In contrast, the phenomenon  of a sharing economy is better known, especially if operators with broad media exposure such as Airbnb or Uber are named as examples.</p>
<p>One reason for this is that the sharing economy is highly diversified, with its operators extending over a broad range of different goods and service areas, and may be non-profit, commercial, multinational or geographically limited to an urban centre, suburb or district. The sharing economy is quite simply a phenomenon that is hard to pin down. It has been the object of significant media interest in recent years. It has and continues to evoke considerable debate and many questions. Many new studies and reports deal with the sharing economy.</p>
<p>From a historical perspective, it is often the case that the significance of new phenomena can be vaguely felt while their character, extent, meaning and effects remain unknown, diffuse, hopeful or scary depending on who is observing them.</p>
<p>It has always been easy to overestimate or underestimate the significance, advantages and dangers of new phenomena in our epoch such as railways, cars, electricity, home videos, satellite TV, the</p>
<p>Internet, e-commerce or the sharing economy. In Sweden, the memorable phrase “the Internet is merely a passing fad!” has come to illustrate how, in the light of history, a new phenomenon can be completely re-evaluated within a short time.</p>
<p>E-commerce, which began to be introduced in the late 1990s, produced fast and dramatic effects, such as a stock market bubble which burst, major business failures in the wake of overly optimistic investments (Boo.com) and, like the sharing economy, an intensive debate and similarly intensive studies by interested organisations, governments and public authorities in many countries. The “socalled” e-commerce has over time improved market transparency and produced a wider range and lower prices thanks to increased competition to the benefit of the consumers. Both regulations and consumer information were important components in this development.</p>
<p>The enquiry is tasked, among other things, to determine to what extent existing legislation is fit for purpose in the sharing economy or whether there is a need for constitutional changes or other measures. In practice, there is a lack of regulations, adapted to sharing economy transactions between mutual users. It is unusual for this legal relationship to be regulated in contracts, apart from the price, time and place of the transaction. This means that the legislation for this relationship cannot be considered as fit for purpose. In fact, it is nearly absent. The same applies to contracts between companies such as hiring and service agreements. In this context, however, conditions are often regulated by more or less standardised contractual conditions which are issued by one of the parties or developed by a trade association.</p>
<p>A central question in the relationship between users is if the supplying party should be considered as a trader . The above considerations have shown that the threshold to trader status is low. A private individual who offers a certain type of service in the sharing economy on more than a few occasions and in a professional manner may be considered as a trader after legal examination. This applies irrespective of whether there is a profit motive or whether the operations constitute a business from a fiscal perspective.</p>
<p>This may constitute an obstacle to the sharing economy and the question then arises as to whether special regulations should be introduced which create some kind of free zone for transactions in the sharing economy. This would then mean that the threshold to a status as a trader would be raised specifically for the transactions of the sharing economy but not in other similar cases.</p>
<p>However, from the viewpoint of the enquiry, such an arrangement would be problematic for several reasons. Consumer law has been applied since the early 1970s when the first consumer sales law and the first law on the contractual conditions in consumer relationships came into force. Subsequently, several laws were introduced in the sector of consumer law. With time, extensive practical experience has also been gained, not least by the National Board for Consumer Disputes (ARN), as regards the interpretation of the terms consumer  and trader . The question of when a private individual should be considered to act as a consumer or as a trader occurs frequently in the Board’s practical experience.</p>
<p>The enquiry deems that it is problematic to introduce special rules in this respect, basing rules on the way in which, and via which media, two private individuals contact each other prior to a transaction. This would mean that a low threshold should be applied if the parties contacted each other via a second hand digital market place like Blocket , an analogue notice board, a newspaper advert or via acquaintances, but that a higher threshold should apply if the contact was mediated by some type of platform within the sharing economy. The enquiry cannot find convincing reasons as to why the need for protection, rights and obligations should be valued in different ways depending on the way in which the parties had contacted each other. It should also be noted that consumer law does not make unreasonable demands, and its judgments take into consideration whether a trader is a large company or a single physical person. Special rules as described above would probably also lead to major demarcation problems.</p>
<p>In its overall assessment, and against the background of the very limited experience of problems and disputes relating to sharing economy transactions, the enquiry does not yet see any reason to consider constitutional changes in those parts relating to the relationship between the users of the sharing economy. The enquiry further notes that the use of previously drawn up standardised contract forms stipulating general conditions would likely fulfil an important function. This applies especially to the types of contract commonly found in the sharing economy, such as for the hire of cars, machinery and accommodation as well as for small services.</p>
<p>The relationship between users and platforms typically constitutes a consumer relationship in those parts relating to services by the platforms for which the users pay in one way or another, such as via a commission, membership fee or by providing data. This relationship is subject to the consumer law. Market law may also be applied. This means for example that the marketing and information content of the platforms can be examined against the background of the rules set out in the marketing law, while the suitability of the contractual conditions can be judged on the basis of the law relating to contractual conditions. The law on price information can be applied to the information about prices for services, etc. offered by the platform.</p>
<p>Against the background of the survey of platforms, the enquiry deems that it is the time to examine the platforms from the perspective of the market law. The information content on the platforms varies, but in general information deemed to be essential for users is lacking. In many cases no guidance is offered about the roles assumed by the platforms and users, for example under what conditions a user shall be considered to be a trader. Moreover, information is rarely given about the fiscal consequences of sharing economy transactions and what is incumbent upon a user according to various kinds of special legislation, such as food legislation or transport regulations. Information on prices and contact information to the platforms are also deficient in many cases. The user survey carried out by the enquiry showed that significantly more users stated that such information is important than those who stated that it was easy to find. Finally it should be noted that the enquiry found user conditions whose reasonableness can be questioned against the background of the rules set out in the law on contractual conditions in consumer relationships.</p>
<p>The enquiry deems that the market law, which in various respects regulates the way that the platforms act on the market, appears to be fit for purpose. However, as far as the enquiry was able to determine, they have not yet been applied to sharing economy platform companies.</p>
<p>The results of the enquiry show that those who have so far taken part in the sharing economy are characterised by curiosity and openness to new phenomena, have strong social driving forces and a certain willingness to take risks. These early adopters who are the most frequent users of sharing economy services tend to be young people in large urban areas. They are tolerant towards defective functions and frictions in their relationships with other users and with the platforms. They therefore differ in some key respects from the population at large.</p>
<p>A clear majority, more than four fifths of those who made no  use of sharing services state that they did so because they did not need  these services, irrespective of the service sector. This is a striking result in the eyes of the enquiry, as there are now sharing economy services for a long series of everyday or rarer needs, such as overnight accommodation, car and cycle use, holiday accommodation, garden maintenance, snow clearance, cleaning, childcare, dog care, hand tools, homework help, etc.</p>
<p>This indicates a lower degree of curiosity and willingness to experiment compared to the group that uses sharing economy services.</p>
<p>Other reasons given for not using sharing economy services relate to the uncertainty about what it means to hire from or negotiate with private individuals and that professional counterparties are preferred. About a fifth of those who know about sharing services but choose not to use them give this reason. A similar number state in a survey recently carried out by Nordea that they do not use sharing services because “... it is unclear how to proceed if something goes wrong. I don’t feel entirely safe ”.</p>
<p>The enquiry has, in the user chain, nevertheless identified obstacles to the growth of the sharing economy in Sweden. These can in the first instance be related to uncertainties among a large part of the population about the applicable legal rules, relationships between the parties, access to dispute settlement services and the status of the platforms.</p>
<p>In the view of the enquiry, this leads to the conclusion that there is a need for some type of additional security-promoting measures and functions if the sharing economy is to grow and become established outside the circles of curious, socially engaged and somewhat risk-inclined early adopters.</p>
<p>Sharing economy.</p>
<p>These measures should be of various kinds. The enquiry considers that, in the first instance, this situation presents a challenge to those companies and organisations that offer sharing economy platforms. In its contacts with representatives of the platform companies, the enquiry noted a growing insight into the importance of information and functions that create security and trust, not least as a strategic success factor for the players themselves. It is also, to a certain degree, up to the insurance industry to inform people about the applicability of various (e.g. car and home) insurance policies to the transactions of the sharing economy and to develop a suitable range of insurance products.</p>
<p>If the state wants a positive development of the sharing economy, this would also mean that a certain selection of carefully balanced statutory measures should be considered in order to clarify the position of the users in the sharing economy. This also involves following developments and gathering more information. Moreover, the state should assume responsibility for ensuring that current and prospective users of the sharing economy have access to independent information and guidance.</p>
<p>The enquiry also considered the need for a simple and inexpensive form of dispute settlement for sharing economy transactions and found that such a need does indeed exist. Such a function may possibly be established by extending the assignment of the National Board for Consumer Disputes. However, this solution involves certain difficulties of practice and principle. In the first place, it would require constitutional backing. Furthermore, the main volume of disputes between private individuals cannot be expected to occur in the transactions of the sharing economy, but rather in connection with purchases between private individuals via digital market places as Blocket  and Tradera . It would appear odd to the general public if a new form of dispute resolution were to be introduced in an area where it can be expected to be least in demand. Nor is the composition of the Board with representatives of consumers and traders, who are generally not lawyers, well adapted to examining disputes between private individuals where consumer law does not apply.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the enquiry noted that own actions  from an industry or trade associations have in many cases proved a suitable way of improving market activities. This can be seen, for example, within e-commerice, where a system of quality certification of e-commerce companies is applied by the trade association Svensk digital handel . This certification means that the certified company must meet 14 requirements on its activities. A similar quality certification has been set up in Great Britain for platforms in the sharing economy. However, such an arrangement presupposes the existence of a an interest or trade association within the area of the sharing economy. This is still absent in Sweden.</p>
<h2>Proposal for a sharing economy on the terms of the users Independent information</h2>
<p>The enquiry proposes that the Swedish Consumer Agency be tasked with providing information about what sharing economy transactions imply, the risks and opportunities, as well as giving individual guidance to users in conjunction with such transactions. This should be done within the scope of Hallå konsument  and Konsument Europa , in consultation with relevant public bodies such as the Tax Agency, sector authorities and the insurance industry. There is also good reason to provide information to companies that run sharing economy platforms on their statutory rights and obligations. Such information should be mediated via the Agency’s website.</p>
<h2>Following developments</h2>
<p>The enquiry has shown that the sharing economy is still at an early stage in Sweden and that experience of its use among the population is still very limited. This applies particularly to difficulties and problems which may be countered by legislation.</p>
<p>Against this background, the enquiry suggests that the Consumer Agency in cooperation with the Competition Authority and in consultation with other relevant authorities be tasked over a period of three years to follow up the development of the sharing economy from a user perspective, consider efforts designed to clarify the status of the users of this economy, and report the results to the government.</p>
