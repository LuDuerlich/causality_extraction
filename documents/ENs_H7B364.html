<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The inquiry has been tasked with analysing the rules governing religious aspects in the education system (ToR 2018:15). Based on this analysis, we are to study the need to amend the provisions of the Education Act (2010:800) governing religious aspects in education. Our remit has included:</p>
<p>• analysing what follows from the European Convention on Human Rights, other international undertakings regarding human rights and the Instrument of Government in relation to religious aspects in schools, preschools and  after-school centres, irrespective of whether the management is in the public or private sector;</p>
<p>• analysing the advantages and disadvantages of religious aspects in various types of schools, for example preschools, compulsory schools and upper secondary schools, including from the perspective of the rights of the child;</p>
<p>• proposing i) a clarification of the delineation between education and teaching and ii) a definition of religious and  non-religious orientations;</p>
<p>• surveying regulatory compliance by independent faith schools, preschools and  after-school centres;</p>
<p>• studying whether there is a need to impose specific requirements for approval as a manager of an independent faith school, preschool and  after-school centre, in addition to the proposals presented by the Owner Assessment Inquiry and the Welfare Inquiry;</p>
<p>• examining whether there is a need to amend the Education Act to allow for exceptions to the prohibition on denominational aspects, irrespective of management and orientation, in conjunction with the celebration of the end of the school year and other traditional festivities. If we believe this to be the case, we should analyse how a proposal for such a change relates to provisions that express the school’s values; and</p>
<p>• presenting necessary statutory proposals.</p>
<p>A report on the remit was originally supposed to have been presented not later than 31 December 2018. However, through supplemental terms of reference adopted on 20 June 2018, the inquiry period was extended so that a report on the remit would instead be presented not later than 31 May 2019 (ToR 2018:59). Through supplemental terms of reference adopted on 29 May 2019 (ToR 2019:25), the Government decided to expand the remit and extend the inquiry period so that a report on the remit would instead be presented not later than 19 December 2019. According to the supplemental terms of reference, the inquiry shall now also</p>
<p>• present such statutory proposals as required to enable the implementation of a stop to the establishment of independent faith schools; and</p>
<p>• analyse and report the consequences that such statutory changes might possibly have in relation, inter alia, to the constitution, EU law and Sweden’s international undertakings, as well as in respect of existing independent faith schools.</p>
<h2>Survey and analysis Different perspectives on religious aspects in the education system</h2>
<p>The inquiry has analysed the advantages and disadvantages of religious aspects in various types of schools and based on different perspectives, including the perspective of the rights of the child. We can note that the attitude towards independent faith preschools, schools and after-school centres is often essentially ideological and to some extent a subjective issue. It has, therefore, been difficult to determine the advantages and disadvantages of religious aspects in the education system on a purely objective basis.</p>
<p>The inquiry has addressed this task by meeting various representatives and stakeholders in the area. It has been particularly important to obtain the views and perspectives of children and pupils. This has, among other things, taken place through school visits. The inquiry has also met a large number of different organisations and authorities in reference groups.</p>
<p>In our analysis, we have concentrated on four perspectives:</p>
<p>• the child’s positive freedom of religion, i.e. the right to practice religion;</p>
<p>• the rights of the custodial parent;</p>
<p>• the child’s negative freedom of religion, i.e. the right to refrain from religion; and</p>
<p>• the public perspective, including questions of values, integration, segregation and supervision.</p>
<h2>Survey</h2>
<p>The inquiry has surveyed compliance with governing regulations regarding religious aspects in the education system. We have also compiled existing statistics regarding faith schools.</p>
<h2>Statistics</h2>
<p>During the 2018/19 school year, more than 9,400 pupils attended a faith school within the compulsory school system. This corresponds to almost one per cent of compulsory school pupils. There are great differences between faith compulsory schools. They vary in terms of size, pupil composition, the percentage of teachers with a university degree in education, and in terms of the pupils’ school results.</p>
<p>With the help of the National Agency for Education’s SALSA model, the inquiry has compared the performance of faith schools, after having taken into consideration the composition of the schools’ pupil population. There too, large variations are seen between schools, with some faith schools having high average study results relative to the composition of the pupil population, while others have lower results.</p>
<p>In addition, the inquiry has committed a study of answers of pupils at faith schools to surveys carried out by the Swedish Schools Inspectorate, compared with answers given by pupils at other schools. On average, faith schools differ positively from other schools on most of the issues studied by the school questionnaire, apart from on issues of pupil health, where faith schools differ negatively. Factors such as the schools’ size or composition of the pupil population might, however, explain some of the differences between faith schools and other schools.</p>
<h2>Decisions of the Swedish Schools Inspectorate</h2>
<p>As an element in surveying compliance with applicable regulations with respect to religious aspects in the school, the inquiry has conducted a review of decisions by the Swedish Schools Inspectorate.</p>
<p>From the decisions it is evident that there is criticism with respect to religious aspects, both at faith schools and also schools which have not notified such orientation. The criticism has consisted, inter alia , of the management failing to satisfy the requirement that the teaching must be non-denominational. There are also several decisions concerning whether the requirement that participation in religious aspects must be voluntary has been fulfilled. There are also cases where the teaching has been deemed not to satisfy the requirement of comprehensiveness and objectivity.</p>
<p>Another area addressed in decisions concerns the schools’ use of the school option subject for profiling or in-depth study in the religion which constitutes the school’s religious orientation. It transpires from decisions in several cases that managers and school principals have difficulty in distinguishing between what constitutes education and what constitutes teaching and that there have been impermissible religious aspects within teaching in the school option subject. Other decisions show that religious aspects have occurred within the scope of teaching also in other subjects, for example in mother tongue tuition and biology.</p>
<h2>School visits</h2>
<p>The inquiry has conducted nine school visits, mainly to schools that have notified a religious orientation. In conjunction with the visits, the inquiry has met representatives of the management, teachers and in most cases also pupils. In some cases, the management’s representatives have also been present.</p>
<p>In several cases, school management, teachers and preschool teachers stated that it was difficult to delineate between teaching and education, not least in preschools where the work method is integrated. On one occasion, the inquiry observed that the personnel also failed to reflect over the way in which different religious texts are used and how the texts can affect children and pupils. This may, for example, involve reading out loud or other use of religious texts in teaching situations, where a denominational aspect is not allowed.</p>
<p>The schools visited addressed voluntary participation by children and pupils in religious aspects in different ways. Some considered that pupils must attend all of the school’s activities, i.e. also those with a religious aspect, and that pupils may not, for example, decline to participate in a religious service without the approval of the pupil’s custodial parent.</p>
<p>Another observation is that the teaching includes elements which mix together religious and non-religious aspects, a factor which can make it difficult for a pupil who wishes to refrain from religious aspects to actually do so. This may, for example, involve the school day beginning with a morning assembly in which religious aspects such as prayers are mixed with non-religious aspects such as information about field days, tests, homework or school parties. One variant is that such more general information is provided at weekly assemblies in denominational places of worship. In one case, a description was provided that the pupils are given the possibility to receive the information at another place which is devoid of any religious aspect.</p>
<p>Also in conjunction with school visits, on several occasions issues arose regarding in-depth studies in the religion which constitutes the school’s religious orientation, e.g. extra teaching in religion within the scope of the school option subject. One observation sometimes made is that the person teaching the subject is also the children's religious leader in the local community, which may require specific positions to be taken as to how the school keeps religious aspects out of teaching.</p>
<h2>Survey of faith schools</h2>
<p>The inquiry has carried out a survey covering the 72 schools which, at the time of the study, were registered in the National Agency for Education’s register of schools as faith schools. The survey was aimed, inter alia , at obtaining a more comprehensive view of the various religious aspects that exist and any problems as regards regulatory compliance. In total, 50 schools answered the questionnaire.</p>
<p>The questionnaire responses show that most of the schools that answered had religious aspects in their education. The most common features were morning assemblies and morning prayers, or other types of assemblies and prayers, aspects at the end of school terms and other festivities, prayers, songs and special aspects at mealtimes. It was common that religious aspects occurred on a daily basis.</p>
<p>With respect to the pupils’ right to refrain from participating in religious aspects, one school answered that non-participation was not possible. Other responding schools stated that there was such a possibility. Information about the possibility not to participate was usually provided in writing or orally to the pupil’s custodial parent at the beginning of the school year, through oral information to children and pupils in conjunction with religious aspects, or at progress discussions with custodial parents each term.</p>
<p>Just over one half of the responding schools stated that they offer additional in-depth teaching in the religious orientation, primarily within the school option subject.</p>
<h2>Survey of municipalities regarding independent preschools and certain independent after-school centres</h2>
<p>The municipalities are responsible for approval and supervision of independent preschools and independent after-school centres that do not belong to independent schools. In order to survey regulatory compliance by these activities, the inquiry carried out a questionnaire survey focused on Sweden’s 290 municipalities. In the questionnaire, the municipalities were initially required to answer whether there were any independent activities within the municipality and whether any of them had a religious orientation. Municipalities which answered affirmatively were then required to answer questions about supervision of those activities and whether, in conjunction with the supervision, any particular observations had been made with respect to religious aspects, etc.</p>
<p>The questionnaire was answered by 221 out of 290 municipalities, i.e. 76 per cent. In those municipalities, there were 242 independent faith preschools and 22 independent faith after-school centres, corresponding to just over 10 per cent of the independent preschools, and just over 17 per cent of the independent after-school centres over which the responding municipalities exercise supervision. The preschools were spread over 89 municipalities and the after-school centres over 18 municipalities.</p>
<p>According to the questionnaire responses, it was quite rare for the municipalities to receive complaints or reports about religious aspects in preschools or after-school centres. During the period 2014–2018 six complaints or reports with a bearing on religious aspects were received, divided over four municipalities. Two municipalities stated that they had received a complaint or a report which did not primarily concern religious aspects, but where the municipality believed that the criticised shortcomings were based on the preschool’s or after-school centre’s religious orientation or the religious aspects that occurred there. One example of a reported matter was that boys receive benefits that girls do not receive and that adult women and men are treated differently, e.g. when greeted.</p>
<p>In the questionnaire, the municipalities had an opportunity to describe observations made in conjunction with supervision and in other contexts, e.g. shortcomings observed at faith entities. The observations can be summarised in three main groups:</p>
<p>• lack of clarity regarding religious orientation and religious aspects;</p>
<p>• difficulties in distinguishing between teaching and education; and</p>
<p>• voluntariness.</p>
<p>With respect to  lack of clarity regarding religious orientation and religious aspects, several municipalities emphasised that it was difficult to learn about any shortcomings in  faith-based  activities. It may be the case that activities provide insufficient information as to the religious aspects that occur or do not openly declare that they have a religious profile. One municipality considered that independent faith preschools have difficulty in separating religious values from their task regarding norms and values as set forth in the preschool curriculum, and thus multifaceted outlooks on life are not always elucidated.</p>
<p>With respect to  difficulties in distinguishing between teaching and education , several municipalities were of the view that it was difficult to delineate between teaching and education in preschools and that current legislation does not provide a sufficient basis for doing so, and clarification was sought. Several municipalities stated that they often receive questions about this from individual managers and they also noted that it can be difficult for the management to delineate between teaching and education – a boundary which the municipalities also considered can be difficult to draw in conjunction with supervision. Furthermore, it was considered that it was not entirely clear what constitutes a religious aspect and what such aspects entail in activities.</p>
<p>Voluntariness  for children and pupils to participate in religious aspects was raised by several municipalities. The municipality provided advice and guidance as to how voluntariness can be ensured, and the municipality drew the attention of faith-based activities to the importance of ensuring voluntariness and verifying how to ensure that participation by young children is voluntary. One municipality stated that voluntariness and the possibility to refrain from e.g. saying grace should always be raised in conjunction with supervision.</p>
<h2>Municipalities’ supervisory decisions</h2>
<p>Based on the findings of the municipality questionnaire, the inquiry has requested and reviewed supervisory decisions from the municipalities. Simply put, these decisions can be said to fall into two main groups: i) decisions that in some way address whether religious aspects have been deemed to occur not only in the education but also in the teaching at preschools or after-school centres; and ii) decisions which point out shortcomings as regards the fact that participation in religious aspects must be voluntary for children and pupils. Certain decisions address both issues. In the inquiry’s assessment, the reviewed decisions reinforce the impression gained from the questionnaire as to what constitute problem areas for independent faith preschools and after-school centres.</p>
<h2>International comparisons</h2>
<p>According to the committee terms of reference, the inquiry shall conduct a comparative analysis of the regulation of religious aspects in the education system in other comparable countries and the way in which other countries have interpreted the European Convention on Human Rights and case law from the European Court of Human Rights. In this respect, the inquiry has compared circumstances in Sweden with Norway, Denmark, Finland, France and Germany.</p>
<p>Our analysis shows that the countries in question have different educational systems with varying scope for religious aspects in the education system. It is, therefore, difficult to draw any far-reaching conclusions from the regulations of the various countries. It can, however, be noted that in none of the comparison countries is there an education system that does not allow faith schools. In addition, all comparison countries have acceded to the European Convention on Human Rights and to Protocol 1, Article 2 of the Convention.</p>
<p>The inquiry has also conducted a general review of the countries that are members of the Council of Europe which have acceded to the European Convention on Human Rights, Protocol 1, Article 2. In the review, we have not encountered any country that has acceded to the Protocol and which, at the same time, has prohibited the establishment of faith schools.</p>
<h2>The provisions of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child</h2>
<p>The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) includes the child’s right to a comprehensive education as well as the right to religious and cultural identity. According to the CRC, the school environment should reflect a spirit of understanding, peace, tolerance, equality of sexes and friendship among all peoples, ethnic, national and religious groups and persons of indigenous origin, and the education shall prepare the child for a responsible life in a free society in this spirit. The education shall also aim at developing respect for the child’s parents, for the child’s own cultural identity, language and values, for the national values of the country in which the child is living, the country from which he or she may originate, and for civilisations different from his or her own.</p>
<p>The CRC provides scope for parental responsibility on issues involving religious aspects in the education system. According to the CRC, the child is entitled to freedom of religion and the parents are entitled to provide direction to the child in the exercise of this right in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child when the child exercises the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Direction and guidance by the parents must be exercised in accordance with the entire CRC, which inter alia  means that the child’s right to be heard must be respected. The CRC supports the child’s right to adopt and exercise the parents’ religion. A child belonging to ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with other members of his or her group, to enjoy his or her own culture, to profess and practice his or her own religion, or to use his or her own language.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the CRC, the child also has an independent freedom of religion which is not automatically dependent on the parents’ religion. The child has an express right to an independent freedom of religion in terms of a negative freedom of religion, i.e. the right to freedom from religion and the right to have no religion. According to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, this means that the child has a far-reaching right to be released from participating in religious aspects at school.</p>
<p>According to the CRC individuals and bodies are entitled to establish and direct educational institutions. However, principles regarding human rights must be respected and the education at the institution must conform to certain minimum standards.</p>
<h2>The Instrument of Government and international undertakings</h2>
<p>The inquiry has analysed the provisions of the Instrument of Government as well as the European Convention on Human Rights and other international undertakings with respect to religious aspects in the education system. The perspective of the rights of the child and the Convention on the Rights of the Child have also served as important starting point for the analysis. To summarise, we have reached the following conclusions.</p>
<p>Children and pupils are entitled to education pursuant to the Instrument of Government, the European Convention on Human Rights and Sweden’s international undertakings. This right is enshrined, inter alia , in the European Convention on Human Rights, Protocol 1, Article 2, first sentence, and entails a right for children and pupils to receive the education provided by the State. On the other hand, Protocol 1, Article 2 does not require that the State provide a particular type of education or education on a particular level. The European Court on Human Rights has stated that the right to an education is of fundamental importance in a democratic society and that a restrictive interpretation of the right to education would be contrary to the purpose of the provision. However, the State enjoys a margin of appreciation in determining how the education system in general is to be organised in order to meet the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p>However, individuals, e.g. parents, are not entitled, based on the right to education, to demand that the content of education arranged by the public sector shall differ from that which is stipulated in the Education Act and other statutes. The parents’ right to ensure education and teaching in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions, as stated in the second sentence of Protocol 1, Article 2 to the European Convention on Human Rights, does not thereby entail any restriction on the right of the State to determine how the education system shall be organised in order for the right to education to be satisfied.</p>
<p>Freedom of religion, as enshrined in the Instrument of Government and international conventions, entails inter alia  a right for individuals to exercise their religion. For children and pupils, the right to exercise their religion applies also at school, preschool and after-school centre. Accordingly, a prohibition on the exercise of one’s own religion, e.g. banning the bearing of religious symbols during school hours, can take place only under certain conditions.</p>
<p>Freedom of religion also entails a right to refrain from religion. This means that children and pupils are entitled to refrain from religious aspects at the school, preschool and after-school centre. Therefore, religious aspects in the education system must always be voluntary for children and pupils. However, based on international undertakings it is up to the State to determine the manner in which the right of children and pupils to refrain from religious aspects is to be guaranteed. However, the inquiry concludes that, from the perspective of the rights of the child, it is important to emphasise that all measures within the education system must protect the child's right to live and develop in accordance with her or his own circumstances and needs.</p>
<p>Inter alia  under EU law, there is a right to establish and operate private schools. Accordingly, it is not possible to prohibit certain natural or legal persons from being considered for approval as managers of independent preschools, schools or after-school centres. If individual natural or legal persons with a religious basis were denied consideration for approval as managers of preschools, schools or after-school centres, this might run the risk of constituting discrimination under the European Convention on Human Rights. The freedom of movement and right of establishment entitle natural or legal persons from other EU countries to apply for approval as managers of preschools, schools or after-school centres on the same terms as Swedish persons. The same rules must apply to all applicants. However, the State has the possibility to impose requirements for approval as a manager if justified by a compelling public interest and provided that such takes place in a non-discriminatory manner.</p>
<p>According to case law and the preparatory works to the European Convention on Human Rights, Protocol 1, Article 2, there is a freedom to establish private schools. However, the State is entitled to impose certain requirements, e.g. regarding the teachers' qualifications and minimum number of pupils. According to the European Court of Human Rights, Protocol 1, Article 2 is also aimed at ensuring that there is a pluralistic education system and that the State has no intention to indoctrinate when providing education. Parents also cannot deny their children education or impose requirements regarding content of the education based on religious or philosophical convictions, provided that teaching and education take place in an objective, critical and pluralistic manner.</p>
<p>It is the inquiry's assessment that current legislation is in conformity with Sweden's international undertakings regarding respect for religious or philosophical convictions within the education system.</p>
<h2>The inquiry’s proposals and assessments</h2>
<p>The inquiry's assessments and proposals are based on the Instrument of Government, the European Convention on Human Rights, the CRC, EU law, and other international undertakings regarding human rights.</p>
<p>The CRC provides that the best interests of the child are to be assessed taking into account primarily all measures that affect the child, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies. Furthermore, the right of the child to freely express his or her views must be guaranteed and such views shall be given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child. In relation to education, the equal treatment dimension of the perspective of the rights of the child has been emphasised, i.e. that all pupils and children had the same right to an education based on equality of opportunity.</p>
<h2>Clarificatory definitions</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s remit includes proposing i) a way in which the delineation between education and teaching can be clarified, and ii) a definition of religious and non-religious orientation. Definitions of education and teaching are set forth in Chapter 1, Section 3 of the Education Act. On the other hand, there is no legislative definition of denomination in the education system, although certain statements are found in the preparatory works (Govt Bill 2009/10:165 p. 225 et seq.).</p>
<h2>The definitions of education and teaching must be adjusted</h2>
<p>The inquiry makes the assessment that the terms education  and teaching  are well established within the education system and therefore should be retained in the education statutes. However, definetions of the terms should be adjusted and simplified so as to clarify the difference between them.</p>
<p>The inquiry’s proposal is that teaching  be defined as processes led by teachers or preschool teachers in accordance with objectives stated in the Education Act and other statutes, which shall lead to development and learning through children or pupils obtaining and developing knowledge and values . It is thereby clarified that teaching is the learning and development process that takes place between teachers or preschool teachers, on the one hand, and pupils or children, on the other.</p>
<p>We propose that education be defined as activities pursuant to the Education Act and other statutes that are conducted by a manager and within which children or pupils are offered teaching . It is thereby clarified that education is an omnibus term for everything for which a management is responsible in a school, preschool or  after-school centre, and that teaching constitutes a part of the education. Thus, the term ‘education’ also includes, e.g. school transport, school meals, school trips and breaks.</p>
<h2>Definitions concerning religion shall be inserted in the Education Act</h2>
<p>The inquiry has formulated definitions of the terms religious orientation  and non-religious  orientation . As part of this work we have also identified a need to define the term denominational aspects . The definitions are to be included in Chapter 1, Section 3 of the Education Act and should be structured in light of international undertakings, e.g. the European Convention on Human Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. These undertakings include, inter alia , protection against discrimination and a right of children belonging to ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities or persons belonging to an indigenous population to have their own cultural life.</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that a statutory definition of the term denominational aspects  should be relatively narrow. We believe that the term should be defined in a manner which relates to a more active exercise of religion and which is close to the core of religious freedom. The term denominational aspects should therefore be defined as elements which include confessional or declaratory aspects of a particular religion . Professions of faith, prayers or worship may be mentioned as examples of denominational aspects. The provision does not extend to the performance of other acts that are merely inspired or motivated by a faith.</p>
<p>Both religious orientation and non-religious orientation are subsequently defined based on the term ‘denominational aspects’. We propose that religious orientation  be defined as an activity which may include denominational aspects initiated and performed by the management . This means that the key factor is that the management is responsible for deciding upon, and performing, the regularly occurring denominational aspects in the activity, although the management can, of course, engage some other person to actually perform the aspect.</p>
<p>We propose that  non-religious orientation be defined as  activities which may not include denominational aspects that are initiated and performed by the management . Accordingly, this means that the management may not, on its own initiative, initiate or perform such aspects within the activity. However, there is nothing to prevent children and pupils within an activity with a  non-religious  orientation from exercising their individual freedom of religion by, on their own initiative, e.g. saying grace over meals, or that a manager facilitates the exercise of religious freedom by pupils through, e.g. the provision of a prayer room in which the pupils can pray.</p>
<p>The term ‘denominational aspects’ has led to a number of interpretation difficulties. One starting point for the inquiry’s proposal in this respect is that religion and creed are multidimensional phenomena. Another starting point is that the Swedish education system has been structured in, and is closely connected to, the Protestant tradition, which tends to constitute the basis for the understanding of denominational aspects in the form of declaration and confession. This may be explained by the fact that Sweden has had a state church and that a majority of the Swedish population are members of the Church of Sweden. A third starting point is that the view as to what is to be regarded as a secular tradition or a religious rite can differ, among other things from the perspective of the majority and minority. For example, that which may be regarded by the majority as a traditional advent celebration devoid of religious symbols may, to someone belonging to a minority religion, be regarded as a religious matter. By way of contrast, seasonal festivities which members of a minority regard as traditional, may be ascribed a religious meaning by outsiders. Thus, the same act can be imbued with both secular and religious meaning depending on context and the subjective approach to religious issues of those involved.</p>
<h2>Denominational orientation must be notified</h2>
<p>In accordance with the inquiry’s proposal, denominational aspects may occur at an independent school, an independent preschool or an independent after-school centre only if the manager of the activity has notified the supervisory authority that the activity has a religious orientation. An individual who applies for approval as manager of a preschool, preschool class, compulsory school, compulsory special school, upper secondary school, upper secondary special school or after-school centre must, correspondingly, state in the application whether the activity is to have a religious orientation. An application should merely state that the activity has a religious orientation – not which religion.</p>
<p>The management of a faith-based activity must also notify the supervisory authority in the event the activity is no longer to have such an orientation. It is proposed that provisions in this respect be inserted in Chapters 1 and 2 of the Education Act (Chapter 1, Section 7 and Chapter 2, Section 5e). With respect to independent preschool classes, compulsory schools, compulsory special schools, upper secondary schools, upper secondary special schools and after-school centres, the inquiry’s proposal regarding a stop to establishment means that applications regarding a religious orientation can no longer be made with respect to such activities.</p>
<h2>Requirements that participation is voluntary should be strengthened</h2>
<p>Participation in parts of the education that include denominational aspects at an independent faith preschool, an independent faith school or an independent faith after-school centre must, as previously, be voluntary. The inquiry believes that demands placed on management of faith-based activities must be strengthened in two respects.</p>
<p>• Firstly, the inquiry proposes that the manager must ensure that custodial parents and children or pupils are aware of the fact that participation in the denominational elements of the education is voluntary.</p>
<p>• Secondly, the inquiry proposes, with respect to independent faith preschools, that denominational elements may only occur to the extent, and on the occasions of which, the management has notified the children’s custodial parents. Such information must be provided in writing.</p>
<p>The inquiry believes that both of these proposals create increased clarity with respect to i) voluntariness and ii) the extent to which denominational aspects may occur in preschools. A provision in this respect should be incorporated into Chapter 1 of the Education Act (Chapter 1, Section 7a).</p>
<h2>End of school year ceremonies and other traditional festivities</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s remit has included studying whether there is a need to amend the Education Act in order to allow for exceptions from the prohibition on denominational aspects, irrespective of management and orientation, in connection with the celebration of the end of the school year and other traditional festivities.</p>
<p>The definition of denominational aspects that we propose entails that denominational aspects shall be defined as, and be limited to, elements which include confessional or declaratory aspects of a particular religion. This means that the performance of other acts that are inspired or motivated by a belief is not to be regarded as a denominational aspect within the meaning of the Education Act. For example, this means that a visit to a church or another place of worship does not always constitute a denominational aspect within the meaning of the Education Act.</p>
<p>The starting point for the inquiry’s proposal is that all schools, preschools and after-school centres must be able to use places of worship for celebrating the end of the school year and traditional festivities. No denominational aspects may occur when schools, preschools and after-school centres with a non-religious orientation celebrate the end of the school year or traditional festivities in places of worship. Furthermore, attendance by children and pupils at such activities in places of worship must voluntary. A provision to this effect should be inserted in Chapter 1 of the Education Act (Chapter 1, Section 7b).</p>
<p>The proposal constitutes, in all essential respects, a clarification of governing law as interpreted by the Swedish Schools Inspectorate and the National Agency for Education. However, it is clarified that participation by children and pupils must be voluntary.</p>
<p>Our proposal thus entails that no denominational aspects may be included when schools, preschools or after-school centres with a public sector management celebrate the end of the school year or traditional festivities, irrespective of whether the celebration occurs in places of worship or other premises. The aforesaid applies also to schools, preschools and after-school centres with private managements who have not notified any religious orientation.</p>
<p>We also believe that if schools, preschools or after-school centres with a non-religious orientation celebrate the end of the school year or traditional festivities in places of worship, the celebration should not be located in premises where the religious community requires that, on such occasions, visitors perform acts of a confessional nature or separate visitors based on gender.</p>
<p>In light of the inclusive aspect required by the perspective of the rights of the child, school principals should also plan the celebration of the end of the school year and other festivities in such a manner that all children and pupils can participate. Children and pupils who do not wish to participate should, as far as possible, be offered an equivalent alternative.</p>
<p>In order to clarify the voluntary nature of participation by pupils in denominational aspects, as well as attendance at activities held in places of worship, we propose that an informative provision of this nature be inserted in Chapter 7 of the Education Act, where the compulsory nature of school attendance is addressed (Chapter 7, Section 17).</p>
<h2>Proposal concerning a stop to establishment and the consequences thereof</h2>
<p>According to the supplemental terms of reference, the inquiry shall submit such statutory proposals as required in order that a stop to the establishment of independent faith schools might be introduced. We are also required to analyse and report on any consequences that such statutory proposals might have, inter alia  in relation to the</p>
<p>Swedish constitution, EU law and Sweden’s international undertakings, as well as in respect of existing independent faith schools.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the inquiry’s statutory proposals concerning a stop to establishment be incorporated in Chapter 2 of the Education Act, adjacent to Chapter 2, Section 5 of the Education Act (Chapter 2, Section 5e). The stop to establishment shall also be stated in the section in Chapter 1 of the Education Act, which provides that a management who wishes to conduct a faith-based activity must so notify the supervisory authority (Chapter 1, Section 7).</p>
<h2>Consequences of a stop to establishment and which activities are covered</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes that a stop to establishment shall mean that, after a specific date, no approvals shall be granted to private managements who wish to operate a faith preschool class, compulsory school, compulsory special school, upper secondary school, upper secondary special school or after-school centre. Thus, it is these activities which will be covered by the stop to establishment.</p>
<p>Existing independent schools and after-school centres that have not notified a religious orientation shall be afforded an opportunity to so notify the supervisory authority prior to the same date.</p>
<h2>Existing activities may continue under certain conditions</h2>
<p>As previously, an individual who has been approved as manager of a preschool class, compulsory school, compulsory special school, after-school centre, upper secondary school or upper secondary special school may conduct the faith-based activity also after the provisions regarding a stop to establishment have entered into force. However, this may only take place on condition that, prior to 1 July 2023, the manager i) has notified the supervisory authority that the activity has a religious orientation; and ii) has actually begun the activity and accepted pupils for education.</p>
<p>The inquiry has interpreted the supplemental terms of reference to mean that a stop to establishment shall be just that, i.e. a stop to establishment which will apply to all types of establishment of independent faith-based educational activities. Accordingly, the stop to establishment should cover also existing activities which apply for additions or changes to their currently applicable approvals, e.g. for new establishment of an activity in a different locality, expansion of the number of grades or the upper secondary school courses that are offered, if such a change is not accommodated within an existing approval.</p>
<p>The inquiry makes the assessment that, in light of the foregoing, no rules should be introduced which allow existing independent faith-based activities to expand their activity beyond that which is stated in their approval.</p>
<h2>A stop to establishment may have long-term consequences</h2>
<p>The reasons on which a stop is based constitute a decisive factor as to whether or not a stop to establishment is legally feasible. Our study of regulatory compliance by independent faith schools, and the inquiry’s work in general, shows that some of these schools have certain problems which may be connected with the school’s religious orientation. It is not, however, obvious that, from a legal perspective, these problems are of such a scope as to constitute such a cogent public interest as required in order for there to be an acceptable restriction on fundamental freedoms and rights. A crucial factor as to whether a stop to establishment is compatible with fundamental freedoms and rights will be the reasons on which, in the future, the committee ultimately bases the stop to establishment.</p>
<p>A stop to establishment entails challenges with respect to fundamental freedoms and rights such as commercial freedom and religious freedom, and as regards equality of treatment and discrimination. To summarise, the inquiry has concluded as follows.</p>
<p>As regards the issue of discrimination , a stop to establishment for independent faith schools and after-school centres may run the risk of having a greater impact on persons who profess a religion which is not represented as a religious orientation of an existing activity. In addition, managers of existing faith-based activities will be treated differently from other managers when assessing approval, e.g. with respect to expansion of the activities.</p>
<p>A stop to establishment runs the risk of constituting an unlawful restriction on commercial freedom , since an individual who applies for approval as a manager of an activity regulated by the Education Act is restricted as regards her or his possibilities to structure the activity once a religious orientation is no longer allowed.</p>
<p>With respect to  respect for religious conviction , the stop to establishment may run the risk of violating Protocol 1, Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, pursuant to which custodial parents are entitled to have their religious conviction respected in connection with their children’s education. It is not possible to determine with certainty that a stop to establishment is compatible with the Convention without the issue being considered by the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
<p>In light of Protocol 1, Article 2 to the European Convention on Human Rights, a stop to establishment runs the risk of violating the free right of establishment  under EU law, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It is not possible to determine with certainty that a stop to establishment is compatible with EU law without the issue being considered by the European Court of Justice. The stop to establishment also appears to be problematic in relation to Article 29(2) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which also concerns establishment of schools.</p>
<p>The inquiry believes that the stop to establishment does not have any immediate consequences for existing independent faith schools and after-school centres, since they may continue their activities in accordance with currently applicable approvals. However, in the longer term the stop to establishment may have consequences for these activities since new approvals cannot be granted, e.g. for expansion of activities or in the event of change of ownership, unless they cease the religious orientation.</p>
<h2>Proposals concerning owner and management assessment</h2>
<p>The inquiry has studied whether there is a need to impose special requirements in terms of owner and management assessment in order to be approved as manager of an independent faith school, preschool or after-school centre, in addition to the proposals presented by the</p>
<p>Owner Assessment Inquiry (SOU 2015:7) and the Welfare Inquiry (SOU 2016:78).</p>
<p>The inquiry’s assessment is that it is not appropriate to introduce special requirements that are imposed solely in conjunction with owner and management assessments of individual managers of independent faith-based activities. Such a solution would entail a deviation from the principle of equal conditions between managements, which for a long time has applied within the education system. It might also be regarded as unlawful discrimination under both domestic law as well as international undertakings, including the CRC.</p>
<h2>Democracy conditions shall be introduced</h2>
<p>Existing provisions regarding owner assessment of individuals who wish to be approved as managers pursuant to the Education Act provide for the possibility, in conjunction with the owner and management assessment, to consider questions concerning whether an private manager possesses conditions to provide an education in conformity with the values expressed in Chapter 1, Sections 4 and 5 of the Education Act. The inquiry believes that this assessment can be strengthened and deepened through supplementation with an assessment which focuses on certain key democracy principles.</p>
<p>Therefore, the inquiry proposes that the owner and management assessment which is carried out prior to approval to conduct activities within the education system in the capacity as managers, be supplemented as regards assessment of whether the individual is suitable to conduct the activity. The supplementation entails that the suitability of the individual must also be considered in relation to certain specifically adopted democracy conditions.</p>
<p>The inquiry believes that a democracy condition for the education system should be formulated in such a manner as to protect the fundamental principles of a democratic society, which are of particular importance within the education system. Therefore, the inquiry proposes that an individual shall not be granted approval as a manager for an activity regulated by the Education Act if there is particular reason to believe that the individual, or a representative of the activity as stated in Section 5a of the Education Act, may, within the scope of the activity: 1. engage in violence, coercion or threats, or otherwise improperly violate fundamental freedoms and rights of individual children or adults; 2. discriminate or otherwise violate the principle of the equal worth of all people; 3. engage in abusive treatment of children or pupils; 4. otherwise undermine the principle of the best interests of the child; 5. undermine the democratic system of government; or 6. justify, promote or encourage such behaviour as stated in  1–5.</p>
<p>The Swedish Schools Inspectorate, and the municipalities as regards preschools and certain after-school centres, shall be responsible for the assessment as regards the democracy condition within the scope of the approval assessment that the authorities are obliged to conduct pursuant to Chapter 2, Section 5 of the Education Act. A provision regarding assessment of the democracy condition shall be inserted in Chapter 2 of the Education Act (Chapter 2, Section 5f).</p>
<h2>Supervisory responsibility shall be expanded and the possibility to withdraw licences shall be expanded to include also democracy conditions</h2>
<p>In order to emphasise the importance of the adopted democracy conditions, the inquiry proposes that the supervisory responsibility of the Swedish Schools Inspectorate and the municipalities be expanded such that they shall also exercise supervision to ensure that private managements who have been approved regularly satisfy the democracy conditions. Therefore, it is proposed that amendments to this effect be incorporated in Chapter 26, Sections 3 and 4 of the Education Act.</p>
<p>The inquiry also proposes that it shall be possible for approval of an individual as a manager within the education system to be withdrawn if the individual no longer meets the requirements for approval with respect to assessment based on democracy conditions and that such withdrawal may take place pursuant to all of the items set forth in Chapter 2, Section 5, second paragraph of the Education</p>
<p>Act. The proposal shall be implemented through an amendment to Chapter 26, Section 14 of the Education Act.</p>
<h2>A manager assurance shall be introduced</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes that a manager assurance be introduced with respect to individuals who apply for approval as manager of an individually operated activity pursuant to the Education Act. This means that natural persons who apply for approval – and, if the applicant is a legal person, the individuals included in the group of persons set forth in Chapter 2, Section 5a of the Education Act – shall provide a written manager assurance to the authority which assesses the application. Through a manager assurance, the undersigned certifies that, within the scope of an activity regulated by the Education Act, he or she will not act contrary to the democracy conditions applicable to the activity, i.e. will not act in the ways described above under the heading ‘Democracy conditions shall be introduced’. The Government or the authority determined by the Government shall issue further regulations regarding the manager assurance. Provisions regarding the manager assurance shall be inserted into Chapter 2 of the Education Act (Chapter 2, Sections 7a and b).</p>
<h2>Support material shall be produced</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s proposal entails that the owner and management assessment to be conducted pursuant to Chapter 2, Section 5 of the Education Act shall be extended and deepened through the introduction of assessment concerning democracy conditions and the manager assurance. This assessment shall be carried out by the Swedish Schools Inspectorate and Sweden’s 290 municipalities. The Government should consider instructing a national education agency to produce support material for the municipalities with respect to owner and management assessments in relation to democracy conditions as well as the manager assurance.</p>
<h2>Consolidated approval assessment and supervision should be considered</h2>
<p>According to current legislation, it is the municipality in which the activity is located which is responsible for issues relating to approval of individuals as managers of independent preschools and certain independent after-school centres. Municipalities in which activities are located are also responsible for supervision of those activities. Thus, this responsibility is borne by 290 municipalities with very varying conditions in terms of finances and personnel for carrying out approval assessments and exercising supervision. The inquiry’s proposal involves the addition of new, advanced duties in the form of an initial assessment regarding, and subsequent supervision of, democracy conditions, administration of the manager assurance, as well as administration of applications regarding religious orientation.</p>
<p>The inquiry believes that, in light of the aforesaid, there is reason to consider whether the task of approving individuals as managers of independent preschools and independent after-school centres that do not belong to an independent school entity, as well as the task of exercising supervision over such activities, ought not to be consolidated in a central authority. At the same time, the inquiry considers that this constitutes such a radical change that it should be the subject of further consideration.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the amendments to the Education Act shall enter into force on 1 January 2022. The provisions regarding a stop to establishment shall be applied for the first time with respect to approval of managements for education activities that are to com- mence in the autumn of 2023 at the earliest. Managements of existing independent schools and after-school centres who wish to have a religious orientation after the stop to establishment must notify the religious orientation to the supervisory authority, i.e. the Swedish Schools Inspectorate or the municipality, not later than 1 July 2023.</p>
