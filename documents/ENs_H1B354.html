<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Inquiry</h2>
<p>The purpose of this Inquiry is to analyse, establish and submit assessments which may form the basis for further investigations of how responsibility ought to be distributed between municipalities, county councils and the state with regard to maintaining the necessary access to pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies before, during and after serious incidents and crises. The inquiry shall also analyse and submit assessments which may form the basis for further investigations of how the financing of the antiviral pharmaceuticals stockpiled by the National Board of Health and Welfare should be organised. The mandate of the Inquiry is specified in supplementary directive 2013:18, which was adopted by the government on 14 February 2013. This supplementary directive replaced the original directive 2011:121 which was adopted by the government on 22 December 2011.</p>
<h2>About the field, boundaries and starting points</h2>
<p>The nation’s crisis management is its collective ability to prevent, resist and deal with crises or serious incidents through education, training and other activities, and by means of the organisation and structures created before, during and after a crisis. Access to pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies is a vital element of crisis management in order to prevent and deal with injuries and illnesses in the event of serious incidents and crises.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the Inquiry, maintaining the necessary access to pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies is primarily an issue for county councils and the state, however in crisis management work the potential needs of the municipalities should also be taken into account. This report relates primarily to the field of pharmaceuticals. However in a future solution the need for other medical supplies in the event of serious incidents and crises should also be taken into account.</p>
<p>The Inquiry is of the opinion that the principles of responsibility, proximity and similarity should continue to form the starting point within the Inquiry’s field and that current legislation should be observed as much as possible.</p>
<h2>Analysis of current system and legal framework</h2>
<p>In its analysis of the current system and legal framework, the Inquiry has identified five primary problem areas:   Current distribution of responsibilities</p>
<p>The Inquiry is of the opinion that county councils have a farreaching responsibility to maintain the necessary access to pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies, which is clear from the legislation in the field. However, it is unclear when the state is responsible for supporting the county councils preparedness. The current state responsibility is based either on the practice whereby the state previously built up extensive stockpiles based on the threat of war, or, as in later years, on government commissions concerning the purchase of stockpiles of pharmaceuticals to manage major outbreaks of communicable diseases.   Ambition level – what Sweden should be prepared for</p>
<p>The Inquiry is of the opinion that there is no continuous, structured, coordinated effort to establish a common ambition level when it comes to maintaining the necessary access to pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies. The state stockpiles that exist have been utilised by the county councils to only a very limited extent, and the analysis and planning of how these stockpiles, particularly of other medical supplies, could be used have largely not taken place. Furthermore, in the opinion of the Inquiry, there is no clear, coordinated view of how the county councils currently maintain necessary access to pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies.   Coordination within the field of the Inquiry</p>
<p>A number of authorities have coordination mandates within the field of the Inquiry. There are no prerequisites within the scope of these mandates on how the regional and national level jointly can develop a common ambition level based on the responsibilities of the respective parties and how this ambition level could be put into practice.  The consequences of a deregulated pharmacy market Deregulation has had implications for the prerequisites of maintaining necessary access to pharmaceuticals during serious incidents and crises. Among other things, current pharmacy operators have no corresponding preparedness obligations or any particular responsibility for the supply of pharmaceuticals which Apoteket AB had previously and which was also regulated in the agreement with the state.  Funding</p>
<p>The current state funding is fragmented. State preparedness is funded from two different areas of expenditure and three different appropriations. Thus there is no scope for a cohesive economic view of the overall cost of preparedness in terms of pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies.</p>
<h2>Assessments</h2>
<p>The assessments of the Inquiry are presented on the basis of the problem areas. As a guideline, the assessments should contribute towards a solution which is as transparent as possible and lead to necessary access to pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies being maintained in the event of serious incidents and crises. Each and every individual must be able to feel secure in the knowledge that this will happen on the basis of a common ambition level and in a consistent manner throughout the country.</p>
<p>The Inquiry thus essentially submits the following assessments:  State responsibility for maintaining necessary access to pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies before, during and after serious incidents and crises should be clarified in law.  A process should be developed for working with a common ambition level. This process should include the following subprocesses: the threats for which Sweden should be prepared and with what objective, the pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies to which necessary access should be maintained, and who should be responsible for ensuring that this is done.  A special board should be established at the National Board of Health and Welfare which involves representatives at regional and national levels, and this board should be tasked with applying the process described above and making decisions on a common ambition level in order to maintain necessary access to pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies.  Responsibility for funding should follow the formal responsibility, in accordance with the responsibility principle, to maintain necessary access to pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies before, during and after a serious incident. The county councils should also continue in the future to bear the costs of utilising the  state-funded pharmaceuticals and/or other medical supplies. A legal basis for the state’s ability to collect payment from the county councils on utilisation should be examined further.  State funding should be based on one and the same appropriation in order to create transparency and facilitate a more consistent  follow-up.  A system should be developed which gives the ability to monitor the availability of pharmaceuticals in Sweden.</p>
<h2>Background and mapping</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has a broad scope when it comes to both legislation and organisations.</p>
<p>In its work, the Inquiry has identified five important areas with bearing on the Inquiry’s issues.</p>
<p>Crisis management in Swedish society is guided by a number of basic principles, including the principles of responsibility, proximity and similarity. Operations within crisis management in society are built up around a geographical structure of responsibility and interaction and a sector-oriented structure of responsibility and interaction. Measures for developing crisis management capability within authorities’ own field of responsibility are funded mainly within the scope of regular operations.</p>
<p>To finance special initiatives, the government has established appropriation 2:4 Crisis management.  State authorities, municipalities and county councils can receive funds from this appropriation. The conditions for the appropriation were altered in 2009, which has resulted in the funding of certain operations being phased out. The funding of the National Board of Health and Welfare’s stockpiles is still in place, however, despite the fact that it no longer meets the present allocation conditions of the appropriation.</p>
<p>The county councils bear primary responsibility for crisis management in the field of health and medical services, as is also stated in the Health and Medical Services Act (Hälso- och sjukvårdslagen). The county councils must plan their health and medical services so that medical crisis management is maintained. The county councils are also responsible for the supply of pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies and for ensuring that necessary communicable disease control measures are implemented within the county council area. In the event of certain serious incidents, county councils and municipalities may borrow equipment from the National Board of Health and Welfare’s stockpiles, or purchase these at cost price.</p>
<p>According to the Swedish Communicable Diseases Act (Smittskyddslagen), the National Board of Health and Welfare holds overall responsibility for the protection of the population against communicable diseases and coordinates this protection at a national level. The National Board of Health and Welfare has also been designated as the national point of contact for the International Health Regulations. The National Board of Health and Welfare must also participate in the total defence service and in crisis management, as well as coordinating and monitoring the planning of civilian preparedness in the fields of health and medical services, health protection, control of communicable diseases and social services. In addition, the authority must work on behalf of the government to coordinate preparations for the supply of pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies in heightened alert situations or to manage serious outbreak of communicable diseases.</p>
<p>Present state stockpiles, managed by The National Board of Health and Welfare, include pharmaceuticals, other medical supplies and certain other equipment. Most of the stockpiled pharmaceuticals are designed to deal with a pandemic or other major outbreak of communicable diseases and include antivirals and antibiotics. A small number of sera and antidotes to chemical or radionuclear agents are also stored. The National Board of Health and Welfare’s stockpiles of medical supplies, in the main, were built up against the background of the threat during the Cold War and the risk of acts of war directed against Sweden in the 1980s and 1990s. When this threat diminished in the 1990s, the National Board of Health and Welfare made the decision to reduce its stockpile, which was then done in several stages in the first decade of the 21st century.</p>
<p>As regards the storage of other medical supplies, the National Board of Health and Welfare states in a 2010 report to the government that it would be possible to phase out a large proportion of the stock. The reasons given state that:  War is no longer considered to pose a threat.  The county councils must be prepared for serious incidents.  Consumables are used in daily medical care within the county councils and are stocked there.</p>
<p>It also states that the contents of the stores fail in a number of instances to meet current requirements regarding patient safety, and that they are obsolete.</p>
<p>The Inquiry used a questionnaire in the autumn of 2012 to map the preparedness of the county councils. The summary indicates that it is difficult to obtain a common view of stockpiling within the county councils. Most county councils work on the basis of the normal, daily supply of goods for medical care and have special resources for prehospital care initiatives. The responses to the questionnaire indicate that the county councils have relatively marginal costs as a consequence of their preparedness. The responses to the questionnaire and data from the National Board of Health and Welfare indicate that the county councils have utilised the state stockpiles of pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies to a very limited extent.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has furthermore examined the consequences arising from the deregulation of the pharmacy market and charted the rules and systems that exist to ensure normal supplies to both retail pharmacies and inpatient care. Prior to deregulation, Apoteket AB’s operations were controlled by an agreement between the state and Apoteket AB, which included certain preparedness obligations. None of the present pharmacy organisations has any regulated responsibility for preparedness duties corresponding to that previously held by Apoteket AB.</p>
<p>The supply of pharmaceuticals to end-users in Sweden consists of two channels. On the one hand, there are pharmaceuticals for outpatient care which are purchased at retail pharmacies and on the other there are pharmaceuticals for inpatient care for which the health authorities bear responsibility. For retail pharmacies, there is regulation of the obligation to provide pharmaceuticals to patients, and parties, which supply pharmaceuticals to pharmacies, are obliged to supply them. This obligation to supply pharmaceuticals is also applicable at times of increased demand, such as when there is an outbreak of a communicable disease. The possibilities to impose sanctions are limited and there are no means to enforce deliveries. Regarding pharmaceuticals for inpatient care, which are procured by the county councils, there is no corresponding regulation of the obligation to provide and supply. This is rather a contractual issue. However, this does not absolve the county council of the responsibility to maintain an effective supply of pharmaceuticals and to ensure that pharmaceuticals are available in sufficient quantities. The Inquiry has noted that the legislation does not include requirements for specific stock levels of pharmaceuticals and that there are indications that supply shortages of pharmaceuticals are becoming more common than was previously the case.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has also mapped the coordination and the coordination mandates that currently exist within the Inquiry’s field. The county councils bear primary responsibility, and there are a number of authorities with coordination mandates. These are primarily the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency and the National Board of Health and Welfare, but the county administrative boards also have a part to play.</p>
<p>An international survey has been carried out by the Inquiry. Development work is taking place within the European Union in respect of the management of cross-border health threats, which also includes issues relating to the stockpiling of pharmaceuticals. The Inquiry has also elected to describe how our nearest neighbouring countries manage the storage of pharmaceuticals. The Nordic countries manage storage in similar ways, with state undertakings which are implemented for certain types of pharmaceutical and situation, although these are expressed in slightly different ways depending on the structure of responsibility for health and medical care. In Finland, the legislation clearly demarcates the responsibilities of the different actors within the pharmaceutical supply chain with requirements for mandatory storage of pharmaceuticals.</p>
<h2>The work of the Inquiry</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has elected to work with a relatively large group of experts, with participants at management level, and also an external reference group known as the high level group, which has included directors general, senior managers and other representatives of authorities, stakeholder organisations and non-profit organisations. Individual dialogue sessions and ongoing anchoring with key stakeholders have taken place between the formal expert meetings and high level meetings. The Inquiry has had a total of four meetings with the expert group and two with the reference group.</p>
