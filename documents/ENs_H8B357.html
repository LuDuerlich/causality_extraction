<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Inquiry’s remit</h2>
<p>Our main remit has been to:</p>
<p>• analyse and consider whether a specific criminal provision, with its own classification, should be introduced expressly targeting  honour-based violence and oppression;</p>
<p>• make proposals for such a regulation, irrespective of our conclusions regarding whether or not a specific  honour-based offence should be introduced;</p>
<p>• make proposals on how more effective criminal law protection against  honour-based violence and oppression can be achieved in some other way, if the Inquiry deems this appropriate, and consider how the statutory limitation period for such an offence should be calculated;</p>
<p>• consider whether special statutory limitation rules should apply where an offence has been committed against a person under the age of 18;</p>
<p>• analyse the jurisdiction of Swedish courts to adjudicate on such offences committed abroad; and</p>
<p>• make proposals for any necessary legislative amendments.</p>
<p>We were also instructed to:</p>
<p>• analyse whether the minimum penalty for gross violation of a woman’s integrity and gross violation of integrity should be increased; and</p>
<p>• make proposals for an increased minimum penalty, irrespective of our conclusions on the implications.</p>
<p>Finally, we were instructed to:</p>
<p>• consider what legislative amendments should be implemented concerning  non-contact orders in view of two Riksdag announcements, and make proposals for necessary legislative amendments;</p>
<p>• analyse and, where necessary, propose any additional amendments in this area that are appropriate in view of the evaluation of Sweden conducted by the Council of Europe’s Group of Experts on Action against Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (GREVIO) with respect to Articles 52 and 53 of the Istanbul Convention; and</p>
<p>• analyse whether the geographical area should be expanded in the case of specially extended  non-contact orders and, if necessary, propose legislative amendments.</p>
<h2>Honour-based violations</h2>
<p>Definitions of honour-based violence and oppression vary. Based on various definitions we have examined, honour-based oppression often consists in standards  being laid down in private (which can lead to ‘parallel societies’ arising) and private threats of – and enforcement of – sanctions  if the oppressed person does not conform to the standards laid down in a context  in which the honour of the immediate or wider family acts as an incentive to lay down standards and to threaten and enforce sanctions that are not accepted in the rest of society. The fact that definitions vary means that it is problematic to compare statistics from different sources, and difficult to draw any conclusions concerning how common honour-based violence and other such oppression are. The available information offers only an indication of the minimum level. According to the information we have seen, honour-based oppression is a major problem internationally, and Sweden is no exception. There is a major and increasing need to combat honour-based violence and other such oppression.</p>
<p>Every person who is subjected to repeated acts that violate their integrity has a considerable need for support. Those who are subjected to honour-based violence and other such oppression are particularly defenceless and vulnerable, since they are often entirely lacking support from relatives. In an honour context, the immediate and wider family or group often sympathise with the perpetrator. In other contexts, there are often at least some people who support the victim. It can therefore be assumed that the willingness to report honour-based violence and other such oppression is low, and the number of unreported cases high. In light of this, it is enormously important that society reacts strongly against all forms of honourbased oppression. This applies on a variety of fronts, not just in criminal law.</p>
<h2>Starting points for a reform</h2>
<p>Our reflections and proposals proceed from the following general starting points:</p>
<p>• Criminal law is about the State’s exercise of its monopoly on violence. The State has assumed the task of ensuring that order and security prevail, and in return citizens are considered to accept or submit to the State having the exclusive right – and a duty – to punish those who commit certain offences defined in law. Given the singular nature of the system of criminal penalties, very high standards must be imposed on its design – and on legislation being based on  rational argumentation .</p>
<p>• The legislator must use  criminalisation  as a last resort, where it is impossible to counter the undesirable conduct in a less drastic way. When criminalising conduct, the principle of nulla poena sine lege  (‘no penalty without law’) must be taken into account. This is a fundamental principle of the rule of law. It includes a requirement that criminal law regulations must be written, exact and well-defined. Legislation must not be applied to acts committed prior to entry into force, or to a greater extent than is supported by its wording.</p>
<p>• The system of sanctions is built on a view of justice under which the  severity of the sanctions  in criminal law, for example the number of day-fines or months or years of imprisonment, must reflect the seriousness of the offence . The starting point is thus that equally serious offences should be punished equally severely, and that a more serious offence should result in a more severe sanction than a less serious offence. The seriousness of an offence is assessed based on the damage, danger or violation caused by it. The fact that the severity of the penalty should be proportionate to the seriousness of the offence must be taken into account both on an abstract level, when the legislator determines the scale of penalties  for a classification of offence, and in a specific case, when the court determines the sanction  for an offence. Imposing a more severe penalty for a certain offence therefore requires that this is called for on grounds of justice .</p>
<p>• Changes to the system of sanctions generally have a limited impact on the general level of crime in society. One starting point for our reflections is thus that the proposals we make, based on the directions in our terms of reference, must be seen against the backdrop of a  need for measures in areas other than  criminal law.</p>
<p>• Fundamental constitutional provisions concerning human rights and fundamental freedoms must also be taken into account when considering the conditions for issuing the various forms of  noncontact orders .</p>
<h2>A specific classification of honour-based offence</h2>
<p>We have noted that there is a major and growing need to combat honour-based violence and other such oppression. On 1 July 2020, a new ground for more severe penalties was introduced in Chapter 29, Section 2, point 10 of the Swedish Criminal Code, targeting criminal offences where honour is a motive. This provision can be applied to both one-off and repeated honour-based offences.</p>
<p>We consider that there is a need for further emphasis within the system of criminal penalties of the fact that honour-based violence and oppression are unacceptable. It is therefore necessary to introduce a specific offence classification for repeated honour-based acts targeting the same victim. We consider that a clear signal of this kind in criminal legislation will have a normative effect that, in the long term, will help reduce honour-based violence and other such oppression in society.</p>
<p>We propose that, taking the integrity violation offences as a model, a new classification of honour-based  offence  be introduced in Chapter 4 of the Swedish Criminal Code. A person who commits criminal acts under Chapter 3, 4, 5, 6 or 12 of the Swedish Criminal Code or under Section 24 of the Non-Contact Orders Act (1988:688) with the aim of preserving or restoring the honour of a person or of an immediate or wider family or some other similar group would, if each of the acts was part of a repeated violation of the victim’s integrity and the acts were liable to severely damage the victim’s selfesteem, be guilty of an honour-based offence.</p>
<p>Unlike the provisions on gross violation of integrity and gross violation of a woman’s integrity, the proposed new provision does not contain a requirement (for the act to be punishable) that the perpetrator and the victim must be in a close relationship.</p>
<p>The requirement relating to honour – that the perpetrator must have committed the criminal acts “with the aim of preserving or restoring the honour of a person or of an immediate or wider family or some other similar group” – mirrors the requirement included in the more severe penalties provision in Chapter 29, Section 2, point 10 of the Swedish Criminal Code that has entered into force in the course of the Inquiry’s work.</p>
<p>The scale of penalties for the new offence should be the same as for gross violation of integrity and gross violation of a woman’s integrity.</p>
<p>At the same time, we propose that Chapter 4, Section 4a, first paragraph and the current Section 4b be amended so that the offences of defamation and insulting behaviour under Chapter 5 of the Swedish Criminal Code can also form part of the offences of gross violation of integrity, gross violation of a woman’s integrity and unlawful harassment.</p>
<p>Several requirements in the honour-based offence provision we propose will thus mirror the requirements in the provisions on gross violation of integrity and gross violation of a woman’s integrity. These common requirements are intended to be applied in the same way to the new honour-based offence as they have been applied to gross violation of integrity and gross violation of a woman’s integrity.</p>
<p>We also propose that the new provision be introduced as Chapter 4, Section 4b of the Swedish Criminal Code, and that the current Sections 4b–4d be shifted to Sections 4c–4e.</p>
<p>Another question we have considered has been whether there are reprehensible acts linked to honour-based motives that are not covered by the catalogue of offences in our proposal above and, if so, whether additional types of acts should be criminalised, subject to the principle of nulla poena sine lege . In this respect, our primary deliberations were based on the existing offences of unlawful coercion  (Chapter 4, Section 4 of the Swedish Criminal Code) and molestation  (Chapter 4, Section 7 of the Swedish Criminal Code). Taking our starting point in a number of different examples of conceivable forms of honour-based oppression, we came to the conclusion that the offence of unlawful coercion can be applied in many situations where a person attempts to control another person, e.g. by forcing the other person to cover their hair or wear long-sleeved or ankle-length clothing, or by forbidding them from taking part in physical education lessons, for example. We have also noted that the offence of molestation has a very broad scope of application in terms of ruthless acts. Overall, our assessment is that – if their scopes of application are used to the full – the existing penalty provisions offer good prospects for crime prevention and law enforcement agencies to combat honour-based violence and other such oppression.</p>
<p>We consider that the general rules on statutory limitation should apply to the new honour-based offence.</p>
<p>We propose that Swedish courts should have jurisdiction for the proposed new honour-based offence, notwithstanding the general dual criminality requirement. Accordingly, Chapter 2, Section 2, fourth paragraph of the Swedish Criminal Code should be amended to include a reference to the new provision in Chapter 4 of the Code proposed by us.</p>
<h2>Scales of penalties and criminal procedure Scales of penalties</h2>
<p>When the offences of gross violation of integrity and gross violation of a woman’s integrity were introduced into the Swedish Criminal Code in 1998, the penalty provided in the provision on gross violation of integrity  was imprisonment for at least six months and at most six years. The provision on gross violation of a woman’s integrity  was introduced in the same section and referred back to the scale of penalties that applied for gross violation of integrity. The section has subsequently been amended, including changing the scale of penalties for both offences to imprisonment for at least nine months and at most six years.</p>
<p>We have considered whether the minimum penalty should now be increased to imprisonment for one year. Before we began our Inquiry, the Swedish Police Authority had proposed such an increase with a view to giving police and prosecutors better tools to gather necessary supporting evidence in the form of medical records and forensic medical certificates in cases where the injured party does not consent. The Swedish Police Authority has also stated that an increased minimum penalty would better reflect the seriousness of the offence.</p>
<p>In our assessment, the scale of penalties for gross violation of integrity and gross violation of a woman’s integrity should not be changed. The penalty for these offences and for the proposed new honour-based offence should be imprisonment for at least nine months and at most six years.</p>
<p>With reference to our general starting points for reform, we note that it must be possible to justify imposing more severe penalties for a certain classification of offence in that individuals who commit such offences thereby deserve  a more severe penalty than that contained in the applicable scale of penalties. Whether perpetrators of such offences deserve a more severe penalty should in turn be assessed in terms of the scale of the damage, danger or violation  involved in the criminal act, for example for the victim. The interest of access to procedural tools does not constitute a rational ground for increasing the minimum penalty. The question has thus been whether imposing more severe minimum penalties for the integrity violation offences can be justified on grounds of perpetrators deserving a more severe penalty.</p>
<p>In our assessment, the current scale of penalties for the integrity violation offences, with a minimum penalty of imprisonment for nine months, means that a person who is found guilty of gross violation of integrity or gross violation of a woman’s integrity receives a penalty that is several times more severe than if they had been guilty of each of the individual criminal acts – for example one count of assault (ordinary degree), one count of unlawful coercion and one count of molestation – that would otherwise have made up the integrity violation offence. It is not justifiable to increase that gap, such that the penalty for criminal acts committed against someone who cannot be considered a family member is only a fraction of the penalty for the equivalent criminal acts committed against a family member.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we note that a more severe minimum penalty for the integrity violation offences could lead courts, in the relatively least culpable cases, to avoid applying those provisions and to adjudicate instead on the component offences. This would, in turn, involve a risk that increasing the minimum penalty would counteract the aim of the provisions.</p>
<p>Despite our position on the implications, in accordance with our remit we propose an alternative scale of penalties for gross violation of integrity and gross violation of a woman’s integrity, whereby the minimum penalty would be increased from imprisonment for nine months to imprisonment for one year. This alternative proposal also covers the proposed new honour-based offence.</p>
<h2>Criminal procedure</h2>
<p>As we have noted as part of our deliberations on the scale of penalties for the integrity violation offences, procedural considerations cannot constitute rational arguments for increasing the minimum penalty for a given offence. However, as we have also noted, wider possibilities to use procedural tools can instead be achieved through changes to the procedural provisions. In light of this, we propose that the provisions in Chapter 10, Section 23 of the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400) and Section 5, second paragraph of the Act on Forensic Medical Certificates in Connection with Crime (2005:225) be amended. The amendments would mean that information about an injured party that is held by health care services and classified as secret could be included in a forensic medical certificate and disclosed to an agency tasked with intervening against an offence, if the information concerns suspicions of a completed offence for which no less severe penalty than imprisonment for six months is prescribed, or of an attempted offence for which no less severe penalty than imprisonment for one year is prescribed, rather than two years’ imprisonment as at present.</p>
<p>The amendment would mean that law enforcement authorities can also obtain access to information from health care services – without needing to obtain the victim’s consent – when investigating integrity violation offences and the proposed new honour-based offence.</p>
<p>The proposed amendment is justified by the fact that the benefits to individual victims and crime victims collectively – in the form of more effective criminal investigations into the relatively serious offences under discussion here – outweigh the victim’s interest in deciding for themselves to what extent law enforcement authorities are allowed to obtain the information. We consider that the proposed amendments would reduce the pressure that a victim may experience if they themselves are responsible for deciding whether information should be disclosed.</p>
<h2>Non-contact orders Penalties for breaches of non-contact orders</h2>
<p>We propose that the scale of penalties for breaches of non-contact orders under Section 24, first paragraph, second sentence of the Non-Contact Orders Act (1988:688) be amended from a fine or imprisonment for at most one year to imprisonment for (at least 14 days and) at most one year, while the current rule on freedom from responsibility in the second paragraph of the same section should be replaced with a provision to the effect that in minor cases, the penalty is a fine.</p>
<p>We consider that the seriousness of the offence justifies increasing the normal penalty for breaches of non-contact orders to the level of imprisonment, i.e. a more severe penalty than a fine.</p>
<p>At present, perpetrators in minor cases are free from responsibility. We consider that the more severe approach to ordinary degree breaches of non-contact orders should also lead to a more severe approach to minor cases. A person who has been issued with a noncontact order should thus not be freed from responsibility with reference to having been invited into the home of the protected person or similar. We consider that a fine is a reasonable penalty for such cases in which the act may not have caused the protected person any immediate damage, danger or violation. Even in minor cases, the person issued with the non-contact order was expected to conform to the order and, by breaching it, they have committed an offence against the State.</p>
<p>In this respect, we have chosen to particularly emphasise that “contact that is manifestly justified in view of special circumstances” is already an exception to non-contact orders under Section 1, first paragraph of the Non-Contact Orders Act.</p>
<h2>Other considerations with respect to non-contact orders</h2>
<p>We propose that an extended non-contact order may – regardless of whether the intended subject of the order has breached a previous non-contact order – be combined with an electronic monitoring  provision. If the intended subject of the order has breached a previous noncontact order, and unless there are special grounds not to do so, the order should be combined with an electronic monitoring provision.</p>
<p>At present, under Section 1a, second paragraph, point 1 of the Non-Contact Orders Act a non-contact order relating to a shared dwelling may only be issued if the grounds for such an order significantly outweigh  the intrusion or detriment for the intended subject of the order. We propose that the intensifier ‘significantly’ be discarded, so that the assessment concerns whether the grounds for such an order outweigh  the intrusion or detriment for the intended subject of the order. The reason for this proposal is that a standard proportionality assessment of the grounds for and against a noncontact order relating to a shared dwelling must already take account of the fact that the intended subject of the order typically has strong grounds to visit and live in their home. A requirement of grounds that significantly outweigh  the intrusion or detriment is thus redundant and may risk an excessively high threshold in practice for issuing non-contact orders relating to a shared dwelling.</p>
<p>With regard to the effectiveness  of the Swedish regulations, we consider that the Swedish judicial system has to be viewed as a whole. The provisions on deprivation of liberty in the form of remand, detention and arrest supplement the provisions on non-contact orders in such a way that Swedish legislation effectively enables the removal of a suspected offender from a shared dwelling.</p>
<p>We also consider that the provision on specially extended noncontact orders should not be amended in terms of geographical area, as it is already possible to order protection in as large a geographical area as is necessary.</p>
<h2>Implications of the Inquiry’s proposals, etc.</h2>
<p>In practice, our reflections and proposals most significantly affect per- petrators who commit repeated honour-based offences against the same victim, and the victims of such offences. Our reflections and proposals also concern the Swedish Police Authority, the Swedish Prosecution Authority, public defence counsels, injured party coun- sels and special representatives for children, the Swedish Prison and Probation Service (including non-custodial care), the general courts and social services. The proposal relating to forensic medical certifi- cates also concerns the National Board of Forensic Medicine and doc- tors who issue such certificates. With regard specifically to the finan- cial implications, our reflections and proposals primarily concern the Swedish Prison and Probation Service.</p>
<p>The estimated annual cost to the Swedish Prison and Probation Service of implementing our proposals with regard to the introduc- tion of a new honour-based offence is around SEK 17.3 million. The courts can be expected to see an increase in costs of around SEK 0.6 million for longer processing times. The estimated increase in costs for legal counsels is around SEK 1.4 million.</p>
<p>Our procedural proposals concerning forensic medical certifi- cates etc. are expected to only lead to a marginal cost increase for those ordering such certificates.</p>
<p>The estimated annual cost increase for the Swedish Prison and Probation Service for implementing our proposals on a more severe scale of penalties for breaches of non-contact orders is around SEK 4.2 million.</p>
<p>The increased costs resulting from our proposals are so limited that they can be financed within the ‘Justice’ expenditure area.</p>
<p>The proposed legislative amendments can enter into force on 1 January 2022, and no special transitional provisions are necessary.</p>
