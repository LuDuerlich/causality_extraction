<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Gender equality is one of the fundamental democratic values which are part of the national goals for schools. Gender equality exists when men and women have the same rights, responsibilities and possibilities. The task of our delegation is to find and develop knowledge about equality in schools, in accordance with the investigation into fundamental values at school (directive. 2008:75).</p>
<p>This report examines the conditions, relationships and behaviour of girls and young women and of boys and young men, in society from the 1990s onward. We also examine changes in the attitudes, behaviour and performance of girls and boys at school over the same period. The report also looks at research findings regarding reasons for gender differences in attitudes and school performance, and assesses the need for further research.</p>
<h2>Boys and girls in society</h2>
<p>Most young people lead healthy and enjoyable lives. But over the last two decades psychological problems have become appreciably more commonplace among young people of both sexes. Now, as previously more girls than boys are not feeling good. Stress has also increased among both girls and boys. Girls experience stress to a greater extent than boys. The reasons for the increased occurrence of psychological problems among the young is not known. There has been a similar development in several comparable countries.</p>
<p>It is more difficult for young people to find a job and somewhere to live when they leave school than it was a couple of decades ago. This may have given rise to increased pressure on young people. Young people with difficulties at school are particularly vulnerable. But even children who perform well at school can experience anxiety when faced with the need for high marks in order to move into higher and further education. Anxiety about the future and the pressure to perform well in school are conceivable explanations for the increased occurrence of mental ill health. Many studies have shown that girls worry more about their appearance and weight than boys. Girls’ body image and self confidence worsen with puberty. Many young people are active both socially and in clubs and societies, at the same time as they deal with the demands of school. There are indications that young people sleep too little, which can lead to stress.</p>
<p>An increase in mental illness and stress over time can appear paradoxical. The Swedish welfare system is highly developed and the number of poor children is low. From a purely objective standpoint many young people have a good life in our country, even if unfortunately there are some who experience difficulties of various kinds. It should be noted that differences over time in mental illness and stress may be an expression of the displacement of values or expectations, and hence these differences do not necessarily reflect actual changes in conditions of life. The concept of stress may also depict different things. The concept is sometimes used to describe a state which derives from a traumatic life experience. Stress is also used as general synonym for not feeling good. It may also be used as a synonym for, for example feeling rushed or fear of not keeping up. In physiological terms it is possible to differentiate between positive and negative stress. A physiological reaction to stress means that the body’s energy store is mobilized, faced with a task or tension of some kind. This can be stimulating and positive. The negative aspect arises if the stress turns out to be extended over time, leading to symptoms or illness, for example reduced immune defence.</p>
<p>The development of the Internet, mobile telephones and televisual media over the last twenty years has influenced young people’s living habits, cultural creativity and values. The development of new media and means of communication has created great possibilities. Girls and boys use the Web in different ways. Girls communicate with others more, by chatting and emailing, and spend time on sites such as Facebook. Boys use the Web more for playing games and watching video clips. The Internet can also be used for bullying, harassment and sexual aggression. One problem is that material which can easily be posted on the Web, say a picture, can quickly be copied a thousand times over and distributed. Even if the original has been removed it is not possible to remove all the copies of the picture. The new communications media has meant that many people are ”permanently online”, which of course facilitates contact between people. But perhaps the need to be constantly reachable is also a cause of stress in the lives of young people.</p>
<h2>Girls and boys at school</h2>
<p>Most students in Swedish schools say they are happy – both with their life at school and their teachers. However this contentment seems higher among girls than among boys. At the same time other investigations show that a large number of pupils in Swedish schools feel stressed, especially so in the case of the girls. Lessons and homework plus their own expectations and demand on themselves are the major factors which induce stress.</p>
<p>Society takes a serious view of violence, threatening behaviour and abuse at school. There area for example several laws which are designed to prevent the occurrence of such problems. Abuse is not always sexual and thereby an expression of a lack of equality, but it sometimes is. Abuse happens and it is a serious problem. Girls feel more vulnerable than boys to practically all forms of abuse at school. Boys show them selves to be more active in treating others badly. Language can be used to maintain power relationships which exist between different groups of people. Words such as “whore” ( hora ) “poof” ( bög ) and “hag” ( kärring ) can be used to oppress by insinuating that one group of people is of less value than another. Sexualised bullying can also consist of various types of physical aggression.</p>
<p>On average boys talk more in the classroom and receive more attention from the educators. Girls generally speak more quietly, and are given and accept roles like organisers. To be allowed to speak and to be listened to are important factors in social life. To deny someone space to express themselves is an effective way of restricting their influence. It is difficult to know what consequences are carried into adult life from the fact that girls at school today still seem to be socialised into roles such as quiet and kind organisers, while boys are allowed to fool around more, and question, interrupt and talk over others and sometimes even subject the girls to verbal abuse. Could the basis for young women’s lower selfesteem stem at least partly from the unequal situation in the classroom? The picture from research in recent years is not without ambiguity. There is research which shows that girls now take more space in the classroom than they used to, while other research shows more traditional gender patterns.</p>
<p>It should be added that the significance of being called a sexual word or for example ”whore” or ”poof” may vary. Young people do not always understand these labels as abusive. The values of the adult world can to a certain degree be different from those of the young. But it can also be the case that some sexual name calling by one pupil to another can be interpreted as abusive by the recipient without that being the aim. Whatever the case it is obviously immensely important that schools put a stop to the use of language of a coarse or sexual nature.</p>
<p>Another gender difference is the attitude to influence at school. Girls state more often than boys that they want to and are able to have a say over their life at school. Questionnaire answers from pupils concerning influence at school suggests that teachers and other school staff listen more to girls than to boys. More boys than girls say that they have no interest in having an influence at school.</p>
<p>There are some pupils who are absent from school because their parents will not permit them to participate in certain classes: the main classes this concerns are sport and fitness and for example swimming, where certain girls are not allowed to take part, but sex and relationship classes are also relevant here. In one survey 8 % of all pupils said that their parents do not allow them to participate in certain subjects and activities.</p>
<p>The choice of subjects at Gymnasium  (Upper secondary schools) is very gender stereotyped. Only 3 of 17 national programs demonstrate an even gender distribution of within 40–60 %. The explanation for this uneven gender distribution in many Gymnasiums  may be assumed to be that society’s expectations of what professions are suitable for young girls and for young men respectively in reality limits the individuals choice of education and profession. Another dimension to the problem is that those “gender rebels” whose go against the gender stereotypes drop out of education more frequently than others. This is especially the case with boys who follow Gymnasium  programs which are dominated by girls and often drop out, but it is also common with girls who follow a ”boy program”. Another thing worth mentioning is that the average cost for a boy at Gymnasium  is 6 % more than that of a girl, given the pupils choice of program and cost per school place and program.</p>
<p>Girls achieve on average better results than boys: about 10 % better marks at Grundskolan  (Compulsory school), and approximately the same at the Gymnasium . In 2008 at the Grundskola  girls achieved higher marks than boys in every subject except sport and fitness. Girls also achieved better results than boys in the national Swedish and English tests. In the Mathematics test girls and boys achieved the same results. The gender differences in marks over the country is more or les constant regardless of the pupils’ socioeconomic background. Girls achieved 10 % higher marks from the end of the 1980’s to the present day. Calculations taking a selection of subjects shows that a more or less similar pattern of differences was already the case in the 1960’s.</p>
<p>Research into reasons for gender differences in performance at school and attitudes to school emphasizes several gender orientated explanations or hypotheses: for example putting effort into performing well at school is not viewed as consistent with a certain type of masculinity. Physical or verbal abuse can be a way of marking out how to be a boy or a girl ”in the right way”. Crossing the line is associated with greater risk for boys than for girls. Another hypothesis is that the subordinate position of girls in society brings out a greater degree of effort. There is also research which sees the pupils distancing themselves from the demands on performance at school as more of a defence to reduce the consequences of failure in school – this strategy can apply to both girls and boys. Gender differences in school performance and attitudes may also be based on biological differences between the sexes, or on the interaction between this and other environmental factors, such as socioeconomic vulnerability.</p>
<p>New knowledge about equality and gender at school is needed. More knowledge about the form and content of education, of the special pedagogic work, and about equality policy in the schools’ activities is needed.</p>
<h2>The Delegation’s continued work</h2>
<p>Gender equality at school means that each pupil is able to develop according to his/her needs and interests, without being constrained by stereotypes or traditional notions of sex and gender.</p>
<p>Gender equality has long been an important political goal in Sweden; in society at large and at school. Our general impression is however that the development of equality at school might be said to be marching on the spot rather than striding forward, notwith- standing some positive examples and good intentions in many places. The question is why is so little happening?</p>
<p>Girls and women are equally unable as boys and men to disregard the culturally determined expectations placed upon them, and which are different depending on the sex of the individual. Schools reflect in many ways the values of the surrounding society, so it is not particularly surprising that schools demonstrate inequalities, so long as the outside world also contains such inequalities. But our schools have a serious duty to promote equality, and this duty places heavy demands on the schools and their staff.</p>
<p>It is our view that gender equality is an area of knowledge. A lack of knowledge and awareness unfortunately often leads to an inability among the school’s senior staff, teachers and other staff, to recognize the gender structures, even if there are also many senior school staff and teachers who are knowledgeable, and aware of gender issues. Through the expectations they place on girls and boys respectively, the school staff may inadvertently be guilty of contributing to the reproduction of gender stereotypes, by for example allowing boys to dominate in the class room whilst at the same time being less hard working and taking less responsibility during school.</p>
<p>In our final report we will gather and evaluate methods for breaking down traditional gender patterns and gender rolls. We will also suggest suitable measures for how a long-term equality policy in our schools can be designed, developed and reinforced. In order to accomplish this we will need a thorough understanding of the nature of the problem.</p>
<p>We do not believe that the primary need is for more rules: the legislation which currently exists in this area is already ambitious. More important is that the school staff are given help to recognize that their own concrete actions in the daily life of the school have repercussions vis-à-vis gender equality at school: in the every day life of the school various forms of gender stereotypes have to be refuted and not reinforced. We also maintain that it is important that the resistance to gender educators and equality policies which clearly exists in a number of schools be addressed and discussed. It</p>
<p>is also important that there is an awareness of the consequences of the fact that boys have a slower biological development curve than girls. These consequences must be dealt with in parallel with the school’s need to act in the knowledge that there is also a wide variation in maturity between individuals of the same gender. In our continued work we will also map out girls’ and boys’ study habits and investigate the effect of schoolwork on their mental health.</p>
<p>Before delivering our final report, we will also, via various means, disseminate the knowledge which has been assembled in this interim-report, and the further knowledge gained as our work progresses. This will take place, for example via regional conferen- ces and via our website. The dissemination of knowledge is to be directed in particular towards research-based methods of breaking traditional gender patterns and gender roles. The scope of our work also includes dialogues with those who work in schools, parents, children and young people and also with politicians and administrative decision makers. This work has begun, but it will be intensified as from Autumn 2009. Our final report will be delivered on August 30st 2010.</p>
