<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>According to statistics from Statistics Sweden, based on the Employment Register, some 4.2 million people between the ages of 18 to 64 were employed in Sweden in 2006. Of these, around 72 000 (1.7 per cent) were employed in ‘the green sector’, a term given to agriculture, forestry and horticulture, and enterprises that are closely related to them.</p>
<p>People born abroad comprise around 11.7 per cent of employed people in this country, but only 4.2 per cent of people working in the green sector. Of the total number of employed people who were born outside Sweden, only 0.6 per cent work in the green sector as opposed to 1.9 per cent of people employed who were born in Sweden.</p>
<p>The proportion of entrepreneurs among people born abroad is generally larger than in other sectors of the population in Sweden. Despite this, the proportion of foreign-born entrepreneurs in the green sector and other parts of the rural business sector is very small. Of 166 088 entrepreneurs in the green sector in 2006, only 2 267 (1.4 per cent) were born abroad. A strong contributing factor is the large number of Swedish-born sole proprietors in the forestry sector. There are some people of foreign origin running companies in different parts of the food sector, but few are active in primary production.</p>
<p>Few newly arrived immigrants settle in rural areas, or get jobs in companies in rural areas. When people born abroad work in the green sector, their form of employment is often temporary seasonal work. Interest in vocational education linked to the sector, such as the upper secondary school natural resource use programme, is increasing, but the proportion of students of foreign origin continues to be very small.</p>
<p>Migration leads to an influx of important human resources and increases opportunities for development of the business sector.</p>
<p>Diversity creates potential. A key issue is therefore to identify the obstacles and to take measures to remove or reduce them so as to make the most of the skills of people born abroad, particularly in view of the demographic realities Sweden is facing. In the near future, large parts of the country may be characterised by a lack of labour, which is a serious threat particularly to the survival of rural areas.</p>
<p>Two stages of the integration process are key opportunities for recruiting people born abroad to the green sector and other parts of the rural business sector. A large proportion of people born abroad are assigned to municipalities in rural areas after their arrival in Sweden. Here there is a chance for what we have termed ‘pilots’(see below) to establish contact between people born abroad and local employers in the green sector or other parts of the rural business sector. At a later stage, recruitment can be targeted at foreign-born people living in urban areas, for jobs in the green sector near those areas, such as horticulture, the horse industry, golf courses and animal husbandry. This can enable people to remain living in their urban municipalities and commute to their jobs in rural areas nearby.</p>
<p>We propose the following concrete measures:</p>
<p>Green pilot</p>
<p>The Inquiry on the Labour Market Entry of New Immigrants</p>
<p>(IJ 2007:02), with which we have consulted, has discussed the introduction of a new player, the pilot. The pilot is a player independent of government agencies who works for faster entry to the labour market. The new immigrant should be able to choose his or her pilot from a ‘pilot bank’ set up by the Swedish Migration Board or the Swedish Public Employment Service, which signs contracts with suppliers on the provision of pilot services.</p>
<p>We propose that a new player, the pilot, be introduced as an instrument to enable better matching between the demand for labour and the skills of newly arrived people born outside Sweden. New or existing associations, companies and organisations could offer green pilots with special knowledge of the rural business sector, who could work towards faster labour market entry in the green sector or other parts of the rural business sector.</p>
<p>Green validation</p>
<p>Models have been developed in several places in Sweden to produce, relatively quickly, ‘translations’ of skills acquired via education or work experience abroad and to identify the additional training that may be needed to achieve Swedish standards.</p>
<p>We propose that resources be allocated to Green validation, that is to developing validation models for occupations in the green sector. This should be done jointly by the Swedish Vocational Board of Agriculture and Gardening, the Swedish Public Employment Service, the county administrative board and an existing or new validation actor.</p>
<p>Green Card</p>
<p>The Green Card supplements the certificates and possible practical experience of students or working people, and helps the employer make an assessment of the person’s employability.</p>
<p>We propose that the Green Card diploma instrument be developed to target the group of people with education or experience acquired abroad in the field of natural resources.</p>
<p>Green Swedish for Immigrants</p>
<p>The general models for Swedish for Immigrant (SFI) programmes, with their resulting lack of motivation and poor performance by those participating, should be replaced by individually adapted, vocationally oriented courses, that are more likely to lead to employment, or to entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>We propose that in regions with a large number of employers in the green sector, a Green SFI or SFG be created, that is Swedish for the Green Sector. This should be done jointly by the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth, the Swedish Public Employment Service, municipalities, companies, local/regional education actors and a national industrial network, such as the Farmers Federation, the Swedish Federation of Rural Economy and Agricultural Societies or the Swedish Vocational Board of Agriculture and Gardening.</p>
<p>Exports with diversity as a resource</p>
<p>There are 36 000 export companies in Sweden, most of which are small and medium-sized and situated in rural areas. Support to the formation of municipally or privately owned export brokerage firms, where non-Nordic-born individuals are trained in exports and sales and in representing their municipalities and its export companies, could lead to the vigorous development of rural business.</p>
<p>We propose purposeful efforts to promote exports, using diversity as a resource, where individuals of non-Nordic origin are trained in exports and sales and in representing their municipalities and its export companies.</p>
<p>Tourism with diversity as a resource</p>
<p>All Swedish municipalities are striving to increase their tourist industries, which in 2005 had a turnover of almost SEK 191 billion. Foreign tourist consumption in Sweden amounted to SEK 62 billion, which is more than the export value of Swedish cars. While foreign tourism currently accounts for 30 per cent of all tourism in Sweden, considerable increases in foreign tourism in Sweden are possible if we make use of the skills of people born abroad, and market Sweden to the world in a wider perspective.</p>
<p>We propose purposeful efforts for tourism, using diversity as a resource, where the skills and knowledge of immigrants relating to other countries and cultures are used in a marketing drive for Sweden as a tourist country, with particular focus on the countyside, and where foreign-born Swedes are trained to become ‘official representatives of Sweden and x municipality’.</p>
<p>General measures for a living countryside</p>
<p>To strengthen the attractiveness of rural areas, and create favourable conditions for permanent business establishment in rural areas, a number of general measures are required to promote a living countryside. We would like to cite some important proposals presented in the Rural Development Committee’s final report ‘Se landsbygden’ (See rural areas) (SOU 2006:101):</p>
<p>• Reinforce the possibilities for rural companies to develop their operations. Important areas are: generation shifts, supply of skills, financing/investment opportunities, innovation/R&D, and expanded markets and market knowledge.</p>
<p>• Particular attention must be given to the ability of rural companies to access capital.</p>
<p>• Improve the conditions for  small-scale activities and production in the application of existing regulations.</p>
<p>• Simplify the regulations for public procurement and their application for  small-scale activities and production.</p>
<p>• Make the resources of the landscape visible to the general public by increasing the interfaces between town and country.</p>
<p>• Instruct government authorities and  state-owned companies to take more responsibility for rural development and to participate in new, coordinated service solutions.</p>
<p>• Take special action to develop and coordinate logistics for rural passenger, freight and goods transport.</p>
<p>• Secure the possibility of nationwide access to  high-speed data communication and mobile telephony in rural areas.</p>
<p>Measures to promote the establishment of foreign-born people in rural areas</p>
<p>To remove specific obstacles that prevent foreign-born people from establishing themselves in rural areas, we propose the following measures:</p>
<p>• Offer driving licence courses in languages other than Swedish.</p>
<p>• Provide information on  interest-free loans and micro-financing.</p>
<p>• Provide information about Swedish rural areas and the legal right of access to private land.</p>
<p>• Develop work placement schemes/apprenticeship systems for rapid contact with working life in rural areas for people with suitable education/experience from their countries of origin.</p>
<p>• Develop a green pilot system for fast introduction into the labour market and voluntary and community organisations.</p>
<p>• Active recruitment in other countries of entrepreneurs and employees that are strategically important for Swedish rural areas.</p>
<p>Creation of a Tool Box for prospective multicultural municipalities</p>
<p>For centres that are interested in attracting and retaining immigrants, the Canadian government has drawn up an extensive, entitled Attracting & Retaining Immigrants – A Tool Box of Ideas for Smaller Centres.</p>
<p>We propose that the Government take the initiative for developing a Swedish equivalent to the Canadian ‘Tool Box’, a Tool Box for prospective multicultural municipalities.</p>
<p>A more demanding assignment for the Swedish Migration Board</p>
<p>A number of authorities have pointed out the lack of systematic knowledge about the skills of people born abroad.</p>
<p>Like the National Commission on Validation, we propose that the Swedish Migration Board be clearly instructed to take responsibility for questioning all those moving to Sweden about their education and work experience, and that support be offered in requesting validation of foreign education and work experience.</p>
<p>Integration Act</p>
<p>Unlike many other countries, Sweden has no Integration Act. We consider that an Integration Act would rectify many of today’s shortcomings and clarify the responsibilities of individuals, municipalities and other actors, thus increasing legal certainty.</p>
<p>We propose that the Government draw up a proposal for an Integration Act, to be presented to the Riksdag.</p>
<p>Efforts for small-scale rural entrepreneurship</p>
<p>Small-scale rural entrepreneurship is a promising area when it comes to making better use of the skills and knowledge of immigrants. Above all, there is potential in their know-how in various traditional handicrafts.</p>
<p>We propose that resources be allocated, over a three-year period, to efforts to develop small-scale rural enterprise, in such areas as tourism, services and handicrafts, where special focus will be given to out-reach activities and information targeted at people born abroad.</p>
<p>Efforts for business advisory services, targeted at people in rural areas who were born abroad</p>
<p>In 2008, the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth (Nutek) has allocated SEK 10 million to ALMI Företagspartner AB and Internationella företagarföreningen (IFS) for business advisory services in metropolitan areas where there are many immigrants. We consider that funds should be allocated to similar advisory services in rural areas.</p>
<p>We propose that the Government allocate SEK 10 million to ALMI/IFS for business advisory services, targeted at foreign-born people in rural areas.</p>
<p>Higher ceiling for micro-loans from ALMI</p>
<p>Micro-loans in Sweden can amount to a maximum of SEK 100 000, while countries in the rest of Europe offer up to EUR 30 000.</p>
<p>We propose that the ceiling for micro-loans from ALMI be raised from today’s SEK 100 000 to EUR 30 000.</p>
<p>New start jobs</p>
<p>New start jobs enable employers to receive financial support corresponding to the employer’s social security contribution if they employ someone who has been outside the labour market, full or part-time, for at least one year as unemployed. The person could also have immigrated to Sweden and have a residence permit not</p>
<p>older than three years. This measure could lead to greater integration, but is under-used in the green sector.</p>
<p>We propose information campaigns targeted at employers in the green sector and other parts of the rural business sector about the possibility of employing people born abroad in the framework of new start jobs.</p>
<p>Green jobs</p>
<p>The job portal www.gronajobb.se aims at increasing the attractiveness of the green sector by showing the numbers and range of green jobs, and making information simple and easily accessible both for employers and those seeking work. There has been a dramatic increase in interest in this website. However, one shortcoming from the integration point of view is that advertisements are only available in Swedish.</p>
<p>We propose that resources be allocated to make job advertisements on gronajobb.se available in languages other than Swedish.</p>
<p>National job and immigration portal</p>
<p>There is a need for an active, national, multi-lingual job and immigration portal, to which people can turn for information about work and housing before coming to Sweden and even after arrival.</p>
<p>We propose that resources be allocated for developing a Swedish job and immigration portal, so as to meet our needs for labour immigration.</p>
<p>Advisory services centre for establishment in rural areas</p>
<p>To obtain a clear, efficient access point for advice to individuals and companies wishing to establish themselves in rural areas, we consider that an advisory services centre should be set up. Several municipalities could cooperate on setting these up, and important contacts for cooperation on greater integration and business development in rural areas could be built up between cities and rural areas.</p>
<p>We propose that an advisory services centre be set up for establishment in rural areas.</p>
<p>Support for broader recruitment</p>
<p>Despite growing interest in green educational programmes, attempts to attract students of foreign origin have not been successful. Information about Swedish rural areas, and their conditions and development potential is practically non-existent.</p>
<p>We propose financial support for broadening recruitment to educational programmes relevant to rural development.</p>
<p>Support to authorities and organisations providing green education</p>
<p>Education providers specialising in green education or targeted at handicrafts and small enterprises have a key role to play in strengthening the conditions for rural development.</p>
<p>We propose financial support over a three-year period to education providers for holding courses and developing course concepts aimed at the education/further education of people born abroad for activities in the green sector or other parts of the rural business sector.</p>
<p>Proposal for research projects, studies and assignments to increase knowledge about integration in the green sector and other parts of the rural business sector</p>
<p>In Section 4.11 we present a number of proposals for research projects, studies and other assignments that we think are important to increase knowledge about integration in the green sector and other parts of the rural business sector.</p>
