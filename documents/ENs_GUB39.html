<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The task of the Commission has been to review the Law (1996:701) on the Powers of Customs at the Border between Sweden and Other Member States of the European Union and the application of the law. An important part of the review has been to consider whether there is a need for further adoption of the rules to the fundamental principles of the legislation of the European Community.</p>
<p>Consistence with EC legislation</p>
<p>The principle of free movement of goods is laid down in the Treaty of the European Community. However, the Treaty contains rules allowing restrictions in some situations and to some extent, i.e. in Article 30. Other exceptions follow from Article 296.1 b. Furthermore Sweden was granted certain exceptions in the negotiations prior to the accession to the EU. The Commission has arrived at the conclusion that controls regarding the movement of goods between Member States are allowed provided that the conditions of Article 30 are met or that the goods fall within the scope of Article 296.1 b or an exception granted at the accession to the EU, and provided that there are no compensatory measures and that the controls are carried out in accordance with the principle of proportionality.</p>
<p>The Commission has taken note of the fact that controls of goods moved within the EU are also made in other Member States. In several countries controls of goods are made both at the border and inland. In some countries it is not specifically noted what sort of goods can be controlled, whereas the legislation of other countries clearly states what goods are to be controlled.</p>
<p>New legislation</p>
<p>The Commission suggests that a new law on the control of goods should replace the present law. The new law must be clearer and more distinct in its wording, and contain regulations facilitating more efficient controls of goods.</p>
<p>As in the present law, the types of goods that may be controlled should be listed. Most of the goods included in the present law should also be included in the new law, e.g. weapons, products of dual use, drugs, child pornography, dogs and cats kept as pets, animals and products made of animals if there is a risk for contagious disease, alcohol, tobacco and objects covered by the Cultural Heritage Act. Goods not to be included are: cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry, fish, and reptiles kept as pets. The Commission has found that there are compensatory measures for controlling these animals in EC Regulations and through the possibility to follow deliveries by means of the network of computer communication, TRACES.</p>
<p>Dogs and cats, transported for commercial purposes, should also be included, as well as polecats. Otherwise Sweden would not fulfil the requirements of EC Directive 92/65/EEG and EC Regulation 998/2003.</p>
<p>Furthermore, for Sweden to fulfil the obligations laid down in the accession treaty, moist snuff should be added to the list.</p>
<p>The aim of the control of goods</p>
<p>The aim of the controls, which are administrative controls, is to prevent goods within the scope of the law from being imported or exported against import or export restrictions. The controls should be carried out in a way that interferes with the free movement of goods as little as possible. The controls undertaken must not exceed what is necessary for the purpose; they must always be proportionate.</p>
<p>Areas where controls of goods can be made and grounds for controls</p>
<p>Controls of goods should also in the future be made at the border or within areas near the border. However, in some cases a control inland might be less burdensome for transport companies. Therefore it should be possible for Customs to make controls inland, if there is an agreement between Customs and a transport company.</p>
<p>No control should be made, and no person should be asked to stop unless there is a reason for selecting the goods for control. Random controls are not allowed. The principle of proportionality is always to be applied. What is required for a selective control varies. For instance, a control of goods is generally looked upon as less disturbing if it is carried out at the border, e.g. at the airport or when a person leaves a ferryboat, than when a person is asked to stop further inland.</p>
<p>Control of consignments</p>
<p>The new law should – as does the present law – contain rules laying down certain restrictions regarding the rights of Customs to open letters and other consignments that are likely to contain confidential messages.</p>
<p>Competent authorities</p>
<p>Customs should – as is the case today – have the main responsibility for the controls of goods. The Coast Guard should continue to have the responsibility for controls at sea. The Police should to some extent take part in the controls.</p>
<p>Officers of the Coast Guard and the Police have the same competence as Customs officers when they carry out controls of goods.</p>
<p>Control of identity</p>
<p>Customs officers should be allowed to ask a person to identify himself/herself if this is necessary as a part of the investigation of a suspected crime. A Customs officer should also be allowed to ask a person to identify himself/herself if there is a suspicion that the person in question is a suspect against whom action should be taken and the suspect is expected to arrive on a certain flight, ferry, etc.</p>
<p>Temporarily reinforced controls</p>
<p>Situations may arise where the import of other goods than those mentioned in the law on control of goods at an inner border could be a serious threat against the life and health of persons or animals. Such a situation may arise e.g. through terrorist activity. The avian flue and other pandemic diseases could also give rise to such a situation.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore suggests that the Government should be given the power of deciding on temporarily reinforced controls regarding certain goods. The reason for such a decision should be that controls of the goods in question are necessary for the protection of life and health of people and animals. Such a temporarily reinforced control could concern other goods than those mentioned in the law. It could also be more extensive than what is otherwise allowed. If there is an urgency, the Head of Customs should be able to take a decision on temporarily reinforced control. That decision must, however, immediately be submitted to the Government.</p>
<p>The investigation suggests that rules on temporarily reinforced controls should also be included in the Customs Act (2000:1281).</p>
<p>Duty to report to the Police</p>
<p>Should an object be found during a control of goods, that does not fall within the scope of the law, but which lead to a suspicions on reasonable grounds that the person that is controlled is guilty of a crime on which imprisonment can be the consequence, the Customs officer carrying out the control must report the incident to the Police. When such a report is made, Customs can decide to detain the person until the Police arrive. Other circumstances that could be of importance for the Police’s work with fighting crime, should also be reported to the Police.</p>
<p>The duties of transport companies</p>
<p>Transport companies should be obliged to inform Customs if the company suspects that a consignment contains narcotic drugs that could be confiscated according to the Law (2000:1225) on Penalties for Smuggling. Transport companies should also give Customs</p>
<p>information on arriving and departing transports. Furthermore Customs should be given the opportunity to get relevant information from the consortium of the Öresund bridge. Express couriers, and not only postal service companies, should be obliged to give Customs information about consignments.</p>
