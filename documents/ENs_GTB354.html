<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The task</p>
<p>The Commission has been instructed to prepare a proposed new Prison and Other Correctional Treatment Act, which is also to regulate the implementation of all sanctions implemented by the Prison and Probation Service. The task included making a comprehensive review of the substance of the existing regulatory framework and the framing and language of the legislation. The Commission was instructed to give special consideration to issues relating to how implementation can be adapted in order to prevent relapses into crime at the same time as complying with the requirements for security and the need to protect society.</p>
<p>A general basis for the work of the Commission has been to make use of the individual’s own willingness to change. The Commission was instructed to consider how implementation can be adapted to the individual without setting aside the need to protect society and to consider in this respect how to achieve a more developed system for positive and negative reinforcement to enhance the ability to influence the conduct of sentenced persons.</p>
<p>The Commission has further been instructed to consider how to strengthen the perspective of preventing recidivism for the alternative sanctions and forms of implementation with respect to conditions, control and influence. Supplementary directives have enabled the Commission to make proposals that entail changes in the date for conditional release.</p>
<p>Our recommendations</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that provisions on implementation of sentences to imprisonment, probation and community service be dealt with in a single act, the Prison and Other Correctional Treatment Act.</p>
<p>The provisions of this Act have been framed in such a way as to be organisationally independent. This means that they can be applied even if the Prison and Probation Service becomes an agency</p>
<p>– as has been recommended in a recently adopted referral from the Council on Legislation. The new Act is constructed in such a way that the Government or, by delegation, the Prison and Probation Service, will be able to notify general directives on the privileges or restrictions in various privileges that are to apply for a particular group or groups of prisoners.</p>
<p>According to the Prison and Other Correctional Treatment Act, the Prison and Probation Service shall take measures to prevent the sentenced person committing new crimes. The Act also includes a general proportionality rule that means that control and coercive measures may only be used if they are reasonably proportionate to the intended purpose of the measures. Less intrusive measures are to be applied, if available.</p>
<p>Working together with other agencies</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the normalisation principle should continue to serve as a guideline in matters relating to the division of responsibility between the Prison and Probation Service and other agencies. No special legal provision is proposed therefore.</p>
<p>The National Labour Market Board should accordingly be mainly responsible for employment-promotion measures. The Commission proposes that the municipalities take over responsibility for theoretical adult education for those who are serving a prison sentence but who are outside the prison in various forms to facilitate reintegration.</p>
<p>The public health service should continue to be available for those serving a prison sentence. This should not prevent the Prison and Probation Service paying for certain care and treatment. If a prisoner needs dental treatment, this should be provided in the first</p>
<p>place at regular dental clinics and paid for in principle in the same way as for other persons entitled to health care.</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that the Prison and Probation Service be responsible for costs in connection with contract treatment until the end of the alternative term of punishment and that the social services bear the costs of subsequent care measures.</p>
<p>The responsibility of the social welfare committees for social and financial assistance should, in principle, continue to include persons sentenced to sanctions implemented by the Prison and Probation Service. This should not be an impediment to the Prison and Probation Service providing support and assistance within the framework of its tasks.</p>
<p>Books, magazines and other media for recreation and education should be available at all prisons to complement the public libraries. The Prison and Probation Service should endeavour to work together with the public libraries and to ensure that the interests of sentenced persons are taken into account when plans are drawn up for municipal and county council public library services for the general public and adult students.</p>
<p>According to the proposed Act, the Prison and Probation Service shall work together with other agencies to facilitate the prisoner’s adjustment in society. According to the Commission, it is particularly important that there is continuous collaboration between the Prison and Probation Service and agencies in the social services, the National Labour Market Board and the health service.</p>
<p>The Prison and Probation Service shall also endeavour to enable the sentenced person to contact representatives of other public bodies, which can undertake measures and inputs during and after enforcement of sentence.</p>
<p>The Prison and Probation Service should further follow up and keep itself informed to the greatest possible extent about measures taken by other agencies during the period of enforcement and provide information which may be important for the handling of matters by the other agency within the framework of the rules on public access to documents and confidentiality.</p>
<p>Enforcement plan</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that an enforcement plan should be established for all those serving a sanction implemented by the Prison and Probation Service. The enforcement plan is to be produced in collaboration with other agencies.</p>
<p>The enforcement plan should provide a summary description of the course of enforcement from the start until the sentence has been completely served. Furthermore, the plan should include the measures that are to be undertaken during enforcement, dates for when this is to take place and who is to undertake the measures. The plan should clearly state what is expected of the sentenced person and the goals that he or she is to endeavour to achieve. The sanctions that may be imposed in the event of misconduct should also be clearly stated in the plan.</p>
<p>The enforcement plan is to be established as soon as possible after the judgment has attained legal force. If the sanction proposed is probation, a preliminary plan is to be prepared before the main proceedings. If contract treatment may be considered, the enforcement plan is to be established before the main proceedings in the criminal case.</p>
<p>The sentenced person is to be informed about the meaning of the implementation plan. Consultations shall also take place with the sentenced person to find out his or her needs and points of view on the measures and goals. Before the plan is adopted, the sentenced person shall have an opportunity to make a statement on the contents. The Prison and Probation Service is to design enforcement in accordance with the agreed plan. When circumstances so require, minor departures may be made from the plan. The sentenced person is to be obliged to comply with the plan.</p>
<p>The enforcement plan is to be reviewed at regular intervals if there is reason to do so.</p>
<p>Categorisation of prisons</p>
<p>The new Act does not include the concepts of closed and open prisons. The categorisation into different security categories is to be made in an ordinance or regulations. The Prison and Probation Service decides furthermore how different prisons are to operate.</p>
<p>Short-term electronic tagging</p>
<p>The provisions in the Intensive Supervision by Electronic Control Act (1994:451) are to be transferred to the new Act. This form of enforcement is to be called short-term electronic tagging. It is clarified in the Act that short-term electronic tagging may not be granted if there is an evident risk that the sentenced person will commit new crimes, evade serving the sentence, or engage in other misconduct.</p>
<p>Enforcement in prison</p>
<p>Placement</p>
<p>A sentence of imprisonment shall normally be served in prison. The starting point is to be that prison placement is to be made under as free conditions as possible taking into consideration the needs for good order and security. In placement, consideration shall be given to the need of the prisoner for a particular kind of work, particular education or training, and the prisoner’s need for a suitable planning for release and closeness to his home to the extent permitted by considerations of good order and security. Otherwise, it is proposed that the rules on placement of young persons and women shall, in principle, be transferred unchanged to the new Act. The rules on the possibility of having infants with the prisoner at the prison are to be made gender-neutral.</p>
<p>Places with particularly high security</p>
<p>Prisoners for whom there is a risk for attempts being made to set him or her free, escape or continued criminal activity of a serious kind during enforcement may be placed at locations with an especially high level of security.</p>
<p>According to the Act, these prisoners may be kept under a particularly high level of control and may be separated wholly or partly from the company of other prisoners. General rules for the contacts of these prisoners with the outside world and for their control may, as applies to other prisoners, be provided in regulations notified by the Government or, after delegation, by the Prison and Probation Service.</p>
<p>Demands on prisoners</p>
<p>Prisoners must show consideration for prison staff and for fellow prisoners and shall obey the rules in force at any particular prison.</p>
<p>A prisoner shall also comply with the enforcement plan.</p>
<p>The Prison and Probation Service should continue to develop the forms for and content of self-management.</p>
<p>Occupation</p>
<p>Prisoners are to be provided with opportunities for appropriate occupation in the form of work, education/training or other activity that facilitates adjustment to society and also otherwise decreases the risk of him or her committing new offences.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the requirement for appropriate occupation requires that the range of work and studies in prison be improved, that occupation can be provided to the prisoner for a programme time of 40 hours, and that the occupation be designed as far as possible in accordance with the needs and prerequisites of each prisoner. The new Act does not include any special rule on a duty to participate in occupations. However, a prisoner must take part in the occupation specified in the enforcement plan to be able to be considered for certain privileges. A prisoner who does not take part in the designated occupation does not have the right to be in the company of other prisoners and may therefore be locked in the living accommodation during the programme time, etc. if the Prison and Probation Service considers it appropriate. A prisoner who does not participate in the designated occupation may not as a rule have access to any means of payment for various expenses at the prison.</p>
<p>Payment</p>
<p>Some payment is normally to be made to a prisoner who takes part in the designated occupation, to a person who is wholly or partly unable to take part in occupation and to a prisoner, who cannot take part in occupation due to lack of employment opportunities. Payment to a person who cannot participate in occupation shall only be made if this is not due to the prisoner. Payment shall in any</p>
<p>case not be made if the prisoner receives the equivalent payment in another way.</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that a part of the payment that the prisoner is to receive from the Prison and Probation Service may be retained in certain circumstances to pay for destroyed property. Payment which is due to a prisoner sentenced to expulsion may also be retained to pay for the prisoner’s home journey.</p>
<p>Personal possessions and related matters</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that substantial limitations be placed on the prisoners’ possibility of having means of payment and personal possessions at prisons and of carrying out financial transactions with one another at the prison. It is recommended that a prisoner not have access to other funds in prison than those earned during the stay in prison or which the prisoner has received instead of such payment. Property shall be provided by the Prison and Probation Service. A prisoner may have private possessions of a simpler kind if there is no risk that possession will jeopardise good order or security at the prison or the intended purpose of the treatment that the prisoner is undergoing.</p>
<p>The Prison and Probation Service shall only under certain circumstances keep property for the prisoner. It is further proposed that the Prison and Probation Service may sell or destroy property left behind at the prison by the prisoner after a period of three months after the prisoner has been released from the prison.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the Prison and Probation Service be able to confiscate property found in the prison, which may not be possessed by the prisoner. Confiscation shall not take place if it is evidently inequitable. The confiscation rule is subsidiary and is not to be applied if confiscation takes place due to a provision in another law. The Act includes provisions on taking care of property, on handling of confiscated property and on early sale or destruction of property.</p>
<p>Leisure activities</p>
<p>A prisoner shall be given the opportunity to take part in suitable leisure activities to the extent that it is possible taking into consideration good order or security at the prison or the prisoner’s need for treatment. Prisoners shall be given an opportunity to spend at least one hour a day out-of-doors unless very special difficulties prevent this. The rules in the proposed Act are substantially the same as in the existing legislation.</p>
<p>To the extent that it is possible taking into consideration good order and security at the prison and the prisoner’s need of treatment, the prisoner should have opportunities to follow events in the outside world through newspapers, magazines and other publications, radio and television and in other ways. A prisoner who wishes to exercise his or her religion at a prison shall be given the opportunity to do so to the extent possible taking into consideration good order and security.</p>
<p>Association with other prisoners</p>
<p>The main rule in the new Act shall continue to be that the prisoner shall be in the company with other prisoners during both the programme time and free time. The special circumstances that apply at prisons means that it is necessary to have rules that make it possible to separate prisoners from one another when required by good order and security. The need to separate prisoners from other prisoners will probably decrease slightly due the introduction of a privilege system.</p>
<p>The existing rules on separation of a prisoner from the company of other prisoners are, in principle, transferred unchanged to the new Act. The Commission recommends, however, that it shall be easier to separate a prisoner from the company of other prisoners if the prisoner refuses to take part in designated occupation and when order and security so require. In the latter case, it also applies to a prisoner who cannot be linked to the event, which occasioned the decision on separation. There shall not either be a requisite of a minimum sentence of two years imprisonment for it to be possible to separate a prisoner from the company of other prisoners due to plans to escape or that others are planning to set him or her free or the risk of relapse into criminal activity of a serious kind.</p>
<p>The prisoner’s contacts with the outside world</p>
<p>The present rules on visits, telephone calls and letter contact are to be transferred to the new Act. New rules are to be introduced which enable the Prison and Probation Service to decide that visits are to be controlled by use of a visiting room, which is designed in such a way as to make impossible the handing over of objects, i.e. visiting rooms with a glass partition. However, the main rule is to be that if a visit is to be controlled, this is to take place by staff being present during the visit. The visiting room with the glass compartment may only be used if this is insufficient for reasons of security and the alternative would be for no visits to take place. However, a visiting room of this kind may be used in other cases at the request of the prisoner.</p>
<p>According to the Act, the prisoner and the visitor may be locked in during the visit.</p>
<p>With a view to obtaining rules independent of technology, it is proposed that the ability of the prisoner to communicate with persons outside the prison by telephone calls or other electronic communications be regulated uniformly in the Act.</p>
<p>The rules on inspection of letters are, in principle, transferred unchanged to the new Act. The Prison and Probation Service can in certain cases refrain from notifying a prisoner that a letter has been retained.</p>
<p>It is clarified in the Act when copies, translation, recordings or records made in connection with control of a visit, electronic communication or letter may be destroyed. It is further clarified that information that has emerged during a control of this kind may be used in the work of security and crime prevention.</p>
<p>Control of prisoners and visitors, etc.</p>
<p>A provision is included in the Act to the effect that the prisoners shall be controlled to the extent that it is necessary to maintain good order and security at the prison and that a prisoner who is placed at a place with particularly high security is to be kept under particularly high control.</p>
<p>Provisions are also included in the Act that the Prison and Probation Service may investigate all areas at a prison and all property found at the prison. The Prison and Probation Service</p>
<p>shall also have the right to photograph the prisoners. The provisions on body searches, testing and other physical inspection and on handcuffs during movement within a prison are transferred in principle unchanged to the new Act.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that general surveillance by camera may take place at the prison in accordance with the rules in the special legislation to that effect. The Commission further considers that consideration should be given to rules on electronic surveillance of prisoners at the prison after the ongoing trial activity has been evaluated.</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that control of visitors etc. by general entry control are to apply until further notice and that it be made possible for the Prison and Probation Service to check vehicles and objects in connection with vehicles entering or leaving the prison.</p>
<p>It is further proposed that the Prison and Probation Service may use the information obtained in control of visitors, etc. in the security and crime prevention work.</p>
<p>Sanctions for misconduct</p>
<p>A prisoner who engages in misconduct may be given a warning. An overall assessment of the prisoner’s conduct can also lead to the prisoner being demoted to the basic level in the privilege system or to conditional release not being granted.</p>
<p>Temporary stay outside the prison for humanitarian reasons</p>
<p>A prisoner can be given permission for a temporary stay outside the prison to limit serious damage from a long-term sentence of imprisonment or if there are special distressing reasons.</p>
<p>The Prison and Probation Service shall decide on the conditions and control that is to apply to such stay outside the prison.</p>
<p>A system of privileges is to be applied during the prison sentence</p>
<p>Legal drafting solution</p>
<p>The motivation and taking of responsibility of the prisoner should be made use during implementation by introduction of a system of privileges. At the start of implementation, the prisoner shall be given a basic range of privileges (the basic level). A prisoner who complies with the enforcement plan and also otherwise complies with the rules that apply for enforcement may be granted special privileges by being promoted to a higher level. If the prisoner no longer complies with the demands made on him or her, the prisoner shall be demoted to the basic level.</p>
<p>Matters relating to promotion or demotion are to be considered in connection with review of the enforcement plan. Issues relating to promotion from the basic level are to be reviewed very other month.</p>
<p>The privilege system in practice</p>
<p>The more detailed regulations on the privilege system and its content are shown by regulations notified by the Government or the Prison and Probation Service. However, the Commission is presenting certain assessments of how these could be designed.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that there should be four levels in the privilege system: a basic level (level 1) and three higher levels (level 2, 3 and 4).</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the following special privileges can be used in the privilege system: the possibility of having one’s own room; a greater range of occupations, higher payment levels, increased ability to have own possessions, access to more of the Prison and Probation Service’s property, a greater range of TV programmes, the ability to have and wear own clothing, an increased component of self-administration, an increased range of leisure activities, increased association time, more generous terms for contacts with the outside world, the opportunity for stays outside the prison to be granted within the framework of the system for facilitating reintegration into society and more intensive content in work with preparations for release.</p>
<p>There should be certain basic rights for all prisoners, regardless of the level they are on. It should accordingly always be possible to obtain leave for strong humanitarian reasons. All prisoners shall be able to have a certain number of visits by those nearest to them and also to be able to call them. Special consideration is to be given to the prisoner’s children.</p>
<p>Facilitation of reintegration into society</p>
<p>Starting points</p>
<p>A person serving a prison sentence shall be able to stay outside prison as a component is a successive facilitation of reintegration from the prison to life outside.</p>
<p>It is recommended that the opportunity to stay outside the prison be expanded. The reintegration measures that can come into question are leave, the work release system, care stay, residence at a half-way house, and release with electronic tagging. It is generally the case in these stays outside the prison that the prisoner must be at a higher level in the privilege system. There must furthermore not be a risk that the prisoner, during the stay outside the prison, will engage in criminal activity, evade completion of the sentence or engage in misconduct in another way.</p>
<p>The work release system, care stays, residence at a half-way house and electronic tagging are to be planned so that the measures can continue until the date that the sentenced person is granted conditional release.</p>
<p>The Prison and Probation Service may impose conditions for stay outside prison. If the conditions for stay outside prison are no longer met or if the sentenced person does not comply with his or her obligation, the Prison and Probation Service shall rescind the decision on stay outside prison. The sentenced person shall then be returned to prison.</p>
<p>Conditional release is the last component of measures to facilitate reintegration into society.</p>
<p>The stay outside prison is as a rule counted as sentence served. Exceptions can be made if the sentenced person does not comply with the conditions applicable to the stay.</p>
<p>Leave</p>
<p>The current rules on leisure activities outside the prison and leave are combined into a single form for temporary stay outside the prison, called leave.</p>
<p>Leave may be granted for a short period on one or a few occasions per month. Leave outside Sweden may only be granted if there are exceptional reasons.</p>
<p>One prerequisite for leave is to be that the prisoner has complied with his or her obligations under the enforcement plan. The sentenced person shall have served at least a quarter of the sentence, although at least two months. If there are special reasons, leave may also be granted earlier.</p>
<p>The conditions that apply for stay outside prison are to be attached to the leave. The Commission does not make any recommendation on electronic control of persons on leave.</p>
<p>Work release</p>
<p>It shall continue to be possible for a prisoner to have work release during daytime to work, to take part in education or training, to obtain treatment or to take part in some approved activity.</p>
<p>The area of application for work release is considerably expanded. If the prisoner has been promoted to the highest level in the privilege system, he or she may be granted work release for the whole 24-hour period (extended work release). Extended work release requires that occupation and housing have been organised. The sentenced person shall furthermore have served half of the sentence, although at leas six months.</p>
<p>Expanded release can be combined with conditions that the sentenced person shall remain in his or her home at certain times. This condition may be checked by means of electronic aids.</p>
<p>Care stay</p>
<p>A prisoner shall be able to stay outside the prison for a longer period before conditional release at a home for residence and requisite care and treatment (care stay).</p>
<p>If the prisoner interrupts a stay at a family home or other institution prematurely on his or her own initiative, only a third of</p>
<p>the time that the prisoner has spent outside the prison shall be deducted from the sentence as time served. However this does not apply if special reasons exist to deduct a longer period.</p>
<p>Half-way house</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that an opportunity be introduced for prisons to stay in one of the Prison and Probation Service’s controlled housing facilities, half-way houses. Certain of the rules that apply on stay in prison also apply to such residence.</p>
<p>For stay at a half-way house to come into consideration, it is required that at least half of the sentence has been served, although at least six months.</p>
<p>It shall be possible for the homes to be run by private organisations. More detailed regulations on this and the homes otherwise are to be notified by the Government or authority designated by the Government.</p>
<p>Electronic tagging</p>
<p>The current possibilities for facilitating re-integration with intensive supervision are to be maintained under the name of electronic tagging.</p>
<p>The opportunity for voluntary activities should be increased the longer the period the prisoner has stayed outside the prison in this form. It shall also be possible to grant electronic tagging as an introduction to work release at night.</p>
<p>Conditional release</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that the rules on conditional release be given an increased facultative component.</p>
<p>Conditional release is to take place when two-thirds of the sentence has been served unless there are exceptional reasons against this.</p>
<p>The assessment of whether there are exceptional reasons against conditional release is to be made on the basis of the conduct of the prisoner during enforcement of the sentence.</p>
<p>If the sentenced person has stayed outside the prison at home for care and residence, conditional release shall as a principal rule take place when the care at the home is to be concluded in accordance with the plan drawn up.</p>
<p>Decisions on conditional release are made by the Prison and Probation Service. Appeal may be made against the decision if conditional release is not granted. If conditional release does not take place at the stipulated time, the matter is to be taken up again at a later date.</p>
<p>Supervision</p>
<p>Starting points</p>
<p>The rules for supervision after conditional release and during probation should be the same to the greatest possible extent.</p>
<p>The Prison and Probation Service shall in good time before conditional release consider whether the prisoner shall be subject to supervision after release. A decision on supervision shall be made if during the consideration or subsequently it emerges that supervision is needed to reduce the risk of the sentenced person committing crimes after release.</p>
<p>Probation shall be combined with supervision in accordance with current legal provisions.</p>
<p>The period of supervision shall continue to be a year.</p>
<p>The Prison and Probation Service may decide that supervision after conditional release is to be terminated early if no longer required. The Prison and Probation Service may make a decision on extended supervision if the sentenced person does not comply with his or her obligations. As at present, supervision shall not continues after the end of the period of conditional release.</p>
<p>Probation officers etc.</p>
<p>An official at the Prison and Probation Service (corresponding to the present employed probation officer) is to be appointed as probation officer. Unless there are special reasons, a suitable lay person for the task is to be appointed as support person during the period of supervision (corresponding to the present lay probation officer).</p>
<p>The Prison and Probation Service shall decide on appointment of probation officers and support persons.</p>
<p>It shall be stated on the judgment on probation which probation office is to be responsible for supervision and how the sentenced person can make contact with officials at the office.</p>
<p>A person who is made subject to supervision shall be clearly informed at the beginning of the period of supervision about the conditions that apply to supervision.</p>
<p>If the sentenced person is in prison, he or she may already have met the probation officer before the conditional release. If the sentenced person is not in prison, a meeting shall take place as soon as possible. In the case of probation, the first meeting after the beginning of the period of probation shall take place at the latest a week after the judgment.</p>
<p>The obligations of the supervised person</p>
<p>The supervised person shall be obliged to maintain contact with the probation officer and support person in accordance with the provisions in the enforcement plan.</p>
<p>The supervised person shall furthermore be obliged to notify the Prison and Probation Service of his home address, occupation and other circumstances of significance for supervision.</p>
<p>A person sentenced to probation shall be obliged at the latest within a week of the judgment to contact the responsible probation office. The court shall draw attention to the obligation in the judgment. The supervised persons shall keep regular contact with the probation officer and the support person. The frequency of contact and time, place and way of the contacts are to be stated in the enforcement plan. The contacts that have been and the outcome of these are always to be noted.</p>
<p>Apace with the sentenced complying with his or her obligations under the enforcement plan, the contact frequency can be reduced.</p>
<p>Special provisions</p>
<p>The Prison and Probation Service takes over the ability of the probation committees to notify and rescind special directives on what is to apply during the period of supervision. Special</p>
<p>provisions notified by the court may only be changed if new circumstances have emerged after the judgment that entail that the directive should no longer apply. A new directive may be notified if it can be assumed to reduce the risk of the supervised person committing new crimes or to facilitate supervision during the period of supervision. A possibility of making it obligatory to provide blood, urine and breath tests in community service is to be introduced.</p>
<p>If it is needed to reduce the risk of the supervised person committing new crimes, the Prison and Probation Service shall be able to notify a special provision that the supervised person shall take part in specially arranged activity (programme activity).</p>
<p>Checks</p>
<p>The Prison and Probation Service shall check that the sentenced person complies with his or her obligations and complies with the conditions for supervision.</p>
<p>The checks are to take place, in among other ways, by contact calls and reports from the support person and by obtaining information from other authorities, etc.</p>
<p>Consequences on misconduct</p>
<p>If the sentenced person does not comply with his or her obligations during the period of supervision, the Prison and Probation Service may notify a warning, extend the period of supervision and conditional release, notify or change special provisions on what is to apply during supervision or notify conditions on the obligation to keep contact with the probation officer and the support person.</p>
<p>If such a measure is not considered sufficient, the Prison and Probation Service may declare the conditional release forfeit, although at most for fifteen days on each occasion. If the misconduct consists of new crimes, the court shall in the first place decide whether the conditional release is to be forfeit under the provisions of section 34 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>If more intrusive measures are required during probation, the Prison and Probation Service shall request that the prosecutor institute proceedings to change probation into another sanction.</p>
<p>The existing possibility of detaining the sentenced person shall remain. The Prison and Probation Service shall take over the powers of the probation committees to make such decisions.</p>
<p>Decisions and appeals</p>
<p>Starting points</p>
<p>Under the current prison treatment legislation, the sentenced person has extensive possibilities to request decisions in individual issues and to appeal against the decisions. There are not only several different decision-making and review instances but also superior bodies to the same court of first instance. This leads to a system that is hard to overview, which is not least to the detriment of the person wishing to appeal against a particular decision. The starting point for the Commission is that the system of decisionmaking and appeal within the Prison and Probation Service is to be simplified and made more uniform at the same time as guaranteeing the legal security of the sentence person.</p>
<p>The Commission’s recommendation on enforcement better adapted to the individual means that the Prison and Probation Service must make many assessments. A system of this kind requires legal security guarantees to avoid the risk of injustices and arbitrariness. One such guarantee is that the sentenced person is able to appeal against a decision that is negative for him or her. However, there are other ways to safeguard legal security. The circumstance that decisions are made at a suitable level by persons with sufficient knowledge and competence may be seen as a guarantee for legal security as well as the opportunities for review of decisions. A well-functioning supervision of the application of the rules and a good insight into the activity also reinforce legal security. The Commission wishes to underline that it is important that there is an effective supervisory organisation at any rate within the Prison and Probation Service and that this includes representatives for the public.</p>
<p>Decisions are to be made by the Prison and Probation Service</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that the Prison and Probation Service shall, in principle, make all decisions concerning enforcement of a sanction administered by the Prison and Probation Service. In the view of the Commission, an arrangement of this kind provides good opportunities to create a simpler and more uniform process of decision-making than previously. It is also the Prison and Probation Service that is best informed about the sentenced person and on the current circumstances. Making the decisions there is therefore a prerequisite for an effective and appropriate planning of enforcement.</p>
<p>Appeals</p>
<p>With respect to opportunities to appeal against decisions, the Commission has had the starting point that it shall be possible to appeal against decisions that appear as particularly intrusive or restrictive compared with what can normally be considered to follow from the sentence imposed. It shall not be possible to appeal against other decisions, unless it otherwise follows from the European Convention. It shall be explicitly stated in the law which decisions may not be appealed against. The Commission also recommends that the opportunity of appealing against “norm” decisions, i.e. decisions that do not relate to particular cases and which are appealed against to the Government, shall be abolished.</p>
<p>With regard to the issue of which or which bodies are to consider appeals from decisions by the Prison and Probation Service, the Commission consider that it cannot be considered to be an appropriate solution and probably not either in compliance with the Convention to allow the probation committees or the National Prison and Probation Service to be the final instance for decisions, which, according to the Convention, are to be considered by a court. A general court of law or a public administrative court must accordingly be the final body for at any rate some decisions by the Prison and Probation Service.</p>
<p>Already under the current legislation, the general administrative courts consider many prison and probation decisions. The Commission consider that it appears directly inappropriate to allow the general courts to consider these decisions. However,</p>
<p>there are no strong reasons that speak against a general administrative court also considering prison and probation decisions that are now considered by general courts. It is accordingly possible to achieve a uniform system only if appeals from the Prison and Probation Service’s decisions in enforcement issues are considered by the administrative courts. The Commission finds therefore that the general administrative courts should be the final instance for the enforcement decisions of the Prison and Probation Services.</p>
<p>With regard to the probation committees and the Prison and Probation Service, the Commission considers that the committees have per se performed well and provide scope for good insight into the work of the Prison and Probation Service. The Commission has, however, recommended that the decisions made today by the probation committees as first instance shall instead be notified by the Prison and Probation Service. This will entail a large change for the committees. Even if they were to consider the same kind of cases to a great extent, it will be a matter of reviewing decisions of the Prison and Probation Service. In the view of the Commission, it is not so appropriate for appeal to be considered by an agency that is not freestanding in relation to the body that made the decision even if there is subsequent possibility of appeal to a court. Of greater importance is, however, the requirement for swift court consideration of issues relating to deprivation of liberty that follows from the European Convention. If the probation committee were to consider the decisions of the Prison and Probation Service on detention, this would entail a delay in consideration by a court. A delay of this kind cannot be considered acceptable. With regard to the Prison and Probation Service, it should further be taken into consideration that, according to the Commission’s recommendations, there will be fewer cases for the for the National Paroles Board to consider. The Commission has also found that the National Paroles Board cannot be the final instance for decision where court considerations required.</p>
<p>The Commission does not either consider justified the cost of the necessary changes of the organisation of the committees would require. The need for insight into the activity of the Prison and Probation Service can furthermore be met by lay jurors taking part in the decision-making of the administrative courts and by special supervision measures within the Prison and Probation Service. A uniform and fast decision-making system with good opportunities</p>
<p>to clear practice will only be possible to implement if the decisions of the Prison and Probation Services can be appealed against to an administrative court. The Commission therefore finds that the probation committees and the National Paroles Board shall be abolished.</p>
<p>Rules on handling cases</p>
<p>With regard to the handling of prison and penal administration cases, special rules shall guarantee swift consideration of the case that entail specially intrusive measures and which entail deprivation of liberty.</p>
<p>To retain the insight into the activity of the Prison and Probation Service that the probation committees and the National Parole Board have entailed, the lay jurors shall serve in the court when considering, among other things,, conditional release, forfeiture of conditional release and termination of certain measures to facilitate reintegration into society.</p>
<p>The Commission also recommends that the sentenced person shall be entitled to a public counsel in the cases where this entitlement exists today and in connection with consideration of conditional release. Furthermore, the sentenced person shall be entitled to oral proceedings in the most intrusive measures.</p>
<p>As a main rule, leave to appeal shall be required for consideration of prison and probation administrative cases at the administrative court of appeal. However the Commission considers that it should be possible to appeal to the administrative court of appeal without such leave to appeal against decisions that a prisoner shall not be conditionally released after two-thirds of the sentence and decisions on forfeiture of conditional release.</p>
<p>According to the Commission’s regulations, appeal against the decisions of the Prison and Probation Services shall as a rule be made to the county administrative court within whose district the prison, detention prison or probation office is located where the sentenced person was first registered when the first decision was made in the case.</p>
<p>Special rules</p>
<p>There are two exceptions from the uniform decision and court arrangements recommended by the Commission. One is the issue of detention that shall be considered by a general court of law and not by an administrative court when the prosecutor initiates proceedings for cancellation of probation. The other is that the ability of the Government to make and review decisions on contact with the outside world and stays outside the prison for certain categories of prisoners, taking into consideration the safety of the realm and similar matters, shall remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Financial consequences and coming into effect</p>
<p>In the assessment of the Commission, the recommendations taken as a whole will not entail any increase or decrease of the public expenditure. It is expected that the provisions can come into force on 1 April 2007.</p>
