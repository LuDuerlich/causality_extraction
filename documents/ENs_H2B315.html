<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Inquiry remit</h2>
<p>The Government decided on 16 May 2013 to appoint an Inquiry to propose changes to the process for how the Government controls defence equipment investments and for how the Riksdag and Government can make investment decisions at strategic level. Under its terms of reference, the Inquiry is to also propose a process by which the Riksdag and the Government make longterm decisions that have clear traceability to the operational capability requirements of the operational organisation. Furthermore, the Inquiry is to propose how a focused decision point for equipment investments for the coming planning period can be devised, and how greater transparency can be achieved in reports to the Riksdag and the Government on the financial status and content of approved objects.</p>
<h2>Current shortcomings in equipment planning</h2>
<p>In the Inquiry’s terms of reference, the Government  describes its view of the current shortcomings of the equipment planning process. The current system entails a risk that the Government’s control will be indirect at strategic level but extensive at the detailed level. The Riksdag decides on a financial framework for the appropriations related to equipment investments, but neither the Riksdag nor the Government take a position on the Swedish Armed Forces’ long-term investment planning.</p>
<p>The Government’s view is that it has no influence on the longterm supply of equipment; rather it is faced with decisions that have in practice long been taken by the Swedish Armed Forces and the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration. The options available to the Government are therefore very limited. The current process involves the Government making a decision on the acquisition of individual objects or, in certain cases, decisions on acquisition at a relevant system level. Under its directives, it is not possible to make a holistic decision at a strategic level for the coming planning period. Nor is there a clear link to the financial frameworks and operational capability requirements. The equipment planning and budget processes are not coordinated.</p>
<p>The Government considers that it is difficult for it to have any influence over which projects the Swedish Armed Forces and Defence Materiel Administration are allowed to begin planning, or the scope of the projects that have been initiated. Furthermore, there no clear process for terminating or reprioritising investments once they have been initiated.</p>
<p>The Inquiry  notes the fact that in the area of defence there is no written officially established system for how equipment supply is to be planned, approved or followed up between the Government and relevant authorities, or between the Government and the Riksdag. This is different than in the area of transport infrastructure, for example.</p>
<p>The Inquiry notes that the decision-making data provided to the Riksdag and the Government is incomplete. At various phases, the costs of an individual equipment system may be charged to several of the Swedish Armed Forces’ different appropriations, from development, through acquisition, operation and maintenance, an international mission and, finally, phasing out.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that this division means that analyses and measures that may be rational to minimise total costs from a lifecycle perspective are rendered more difficult, as there is a certain lack of clarity about the costs to different appropriations, and follow-up is complicated. It is therefore difficult for the Government, and ultimately the Riksdag, to estimate all the future expenditure effects of an investment, and accordingly the potential impact an acquisition may have on the defence budget and central government finances. It is difficult to weigh up the comparative advantages of acquiring a new equipment system or extending the lifetime of an existing system.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>Process for planning, decision-making and follow-up</p>
<p>Once per electoral period, the Riksdag and the Government should make a decision on the investments that should be included in a long-term plan covering 12 years. To focus the efforts of the Swedish Armed Forces in drawing up proposals for such a plan, the Government should issue planning directions to the Swedish Armed Forces, which establish the Government’s priorities based on the current direction for defence policy and within a set financial framework.</p>
<p>The data on which the Government and Riksdag base their indicative decision should be clearly linked to how the proposed investments tie in with the operational capability requirements. It should describe the context of the technical systems, infrastructure costs and the estimated life-cycle costs, and the opportunities for international cooperation.</p>
<p>The indicative decision should be divided into three parts with different content and degrees of detail. The period of years 1–3 should cover investments that are ready to be acquired . The period of years 4–6 should cover investments that are proposed to begin being prepared for acquisition  during these years, while the period of years 7–12 should cover the future operational capability needs that should be further analysed .</p>
<p>The Government should submit a performance report to the Riksdag in connection with the Riksdag’s consideration of the proposed 12-year plan for investments. The performance report should give an account of how earlier investment decisions have been realised and be a basis for the proposed indicative decision. The 12-year plan and the performance report should be part of the Budget Bill.</p>
<p>The Swedish Armed Forces should then be tasked with submitting annual proposals within the applicable financial framework to the Government as support for investment decisions for the next six years. This information should be a part of the Swedish Armed Forces’ budget documentation.</p>
<p>Each year the Riksdag should approve the Government’s proposals on investments that may be acquired  in the immediately following three years (years 1–3). The Government's proposals should be included in the Budget Bill. The Riksdag should also be informed annually about investments that are proposed to begin being prepared for acquisition  in the three subsequent years (years 4–6).</p>
<p>Each year the Riksdag should approve the Government’s proposal on investments that may be acquired  in the immediately following three years (years 1–3) and a decision on investments that may begin being prepared for acquisition  in the three subsequent years (years 4–6). The decisions should be included in the Swedish Armed Forces’ appropriation directions.</p>
<p>A structured and systematic follow-up process, similar to that found in the area of transport infrastructure, involving regular meetings, should be introduced between the Government Offices and the relevant authorities. Follow-up should cover ongoing investments and describe the equipment’s delivery status, important decision dates, financial outcomes, and financial outcomes that are not yet registered.</p>
<p>Budgetary proposals</p>
<p>The appropriations within expenditure area 6, ‘Defence and contingency measures’, relating to equipment, should be more clearly distinguished. The approach should be that appropriation 1.1 Unit activities and preparedness  is cleared of in-service support costs, and 1.2 Swedish Armed Forces’ International missions  is cleared of investment and in-service support costs so that 1.3 Acquisition of equipment and facilities  becomes a pure investment appropriation and 1.4 In-service  support, and  phase-out  etc. of equipment and facilities  becomes an appropriation for in-service support.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes, in line with the National Financial Management Authority, that all investment expenditures should be included in the investment plan, but that authority expenditures should be reported separately. The investment plan should be divided into objects or object groups.</p>
<p>Authorisations to place orders should be developed to clarify the objects or object groups that are referred to, their financial scope and the years in which the expenditures are expected to be incurred. As in the case of the transport infrastructure area, the authorisation to place orders should not cover intra-governmental commitments between authorities.</p>
<p>An appropriation credit of 10 per cent should be granted on the share of appropriation 1.3 Acquisition of equipment and facilities  that relates to extra-governmental investment expenditures.</p>
<p>Implementation of the proposals</p>
<p>Based on the proposals in this report, a process for planning, decision-making and follow-up should be devised that is established by the Government and that describes the process between the Government and the Riksdag, and between the Government and government authorities. This work should be conducted in project form by the Government Offices in close cooperation with the Swedish Armed Forces, the Defence Materiel Administration, and with external support.</p>
<h2>Impact of the proposals</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals will create a more long-term and strategic control of equipment investments. This will enable the Riksdag and the Government to take more holistic decisions, without limiting their short-term decision-making mandate.</p>
<p>This process will make it possible for the Government to influence investments at an early stage and give the Riksdag and the Government more frequent decision points during ongoing project work. The process offers improved coordination between the Government and defence authorities in their work ahead of defence equipment investments. The investment planning will be based on the needs and operational capability – and hence equipment – requirements of the operational organisation, as approved by the Government and Riksdag, and on the operational organisation’s priorities over time.</p>
<p>The financial frameworks approved by the Riksdag and the Government will steer planning and more clearly link the proposals to the central government budget process.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a better arrangement for the Government’s follow-up of approved investments which will put the Government in a better position to follow up the objects from both a financial and capability perspective.</p>
<p>These proposals create greater transparency in the reporting on the financial status of the approved investments to the Riksdag, which the Riksdag has requested. The Riksdag’s insight, its opportunity to have more long-term and strategic influence and follow-up of earlier decisions are improved.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals make it possible for the Government to create greater openness in relation to the Riksdag. They offer focused decision points, improved follow-ups of approved investments and the ability to influence investment planning at an early stage. Overall, the proposals will make it possible for the Government and Riksdag to make investment decisions at strategic level.</p>
<p>The Government’s decisions will be communicated to the Swedish Armed Forces once a year  in the appropriation directions. This will bring about clearer and more predictable feedback to the requests of the Swedish Armed Forces. The process will improve the possibility of the Swedish Armed Forces to receive early decisions from the Government on proposed investments and for any investments that may be prepared for future acquisition.</p>
<p>All in all, the proposals provide greater transparency, clarity, structure and stability for all authorities concerning the Swedish Armed Forces’ equipment supply.</p>
