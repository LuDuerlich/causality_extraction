<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h2>In November, 1997 the Committee of Inquiry into Attitudes to Persons with Disabilities (S 1997:04) commissioned the Social research Foundation in Uppsala to carry out a study on whether and in what way working conditions and employees’ general attitudes affect their encounters with persons with disabilities. The reason for commissioning this study was that persons with disabilities have reported in various connections that they increasingly often feel that they are met with negative attitudes and bad approach when they apply for assistance from the authorities and other public bodies. In order to find out more about the underlying causes of these experiences, the Committee wanted to put a number of questions to staff in the social services, social insu- rance offices, the health- and medical care services and schools who in their daily work assist disabled persons in various ways. The questions were formulated in such a way as to relate to persons with disabilities’ experiences of the attitudes of such staff as reported to the Commission.</h2>
<h2>It must be borne in mind that public sector services other than those covered by this sur- vey have also been criticized for a lack of understanding of citizens’ needs and for not list- ening to the individual. This survey only examines a sample of the staff who come into contact with disabled persons in their work. Report on the results of the survey The survey was conducted in the form of a postal questionnaire that was sent to staff whose work brings them into contact with disabled persons. The staff concerned worked in the following four sectors: social insurance offices, the social services, the health and medical care sector and schools. As regards the social insurance offices, the questionnaires were sent to a random sample of 300 individuals who were representative of the staff who deal with cases involving disabled persons in social insurance offices. As regards the other three sectors, the questionnaires were sent to a sample of staff in three counties: Dalarna county, Uppsala county and Halland county. About 100 people were included in the sample in each county and sector. Altogether, the survey included about 300 people from each sector. The total sample consisted of 1230 individuals, selected in such a way as to be representative of certain staff categories in the country as a whole or in the three selected counties. The questionnaire survey was carried out during the period February-April, 1998. The response rate was high. Altogether, 1071 (87.1%) of the 1230 questionnaires that were sent out were answered. The questionnaire contained 29 questions, not including subquestions, grouped under four headings. First, there was a brief background section containing questions on the sex, age, education, position etc. of the respondents. This was followed by a section containing questions on working conditions, with the focus on aspects relevant to the problem of atti- tudes to disabled persons. The third section contained questions about contacts with disab- led persons and about the respondents’ perception of their situation and their relations with authorities etc. The last section was addressed exclusively to staff in schools and contained questions on matters relevant to the situation of disabled pupils. Generally speaking, the respondents were asked to respond to multiple-choice alternatives. But there were also some open-ended questions which gave the respondents a chance to formulate answers of their own. These open-ended questions are referred to and commented on, where it appears relevant, in the main report, but are dealt with in greater detail in the appendices. On the basis of the answers to the questions in the background section, the following conclusions may be drawn about the respondents: the four different sectors are more or less homogeneous as regards the different staff categories that are represented in the survey. When it comes to schools, headmasters/deputy heads are almost the only staff category included in the survey, the reason for which is that in this sector we were obliged, due to the scarcity of resources, to limit the survey population to this category. The staff catego- ries in the adminstration of the social insurance program on regional and local levels were also relatively homogeneous. They were virtually all administrators dealing with matters relating to persons with disabilities, social insurance officers. The staff profile in the social service sector was more varied, and the sample included many different staff categories. The most frequent categories were care administrators, heads of sections, supervisors of shared residential accommodation for the disabled, administrative officers dealing with ca- ses under the Act concerning, Support and Service for Persons with certain Functional Im- pairments, and area managers/work supervisors. In the health care sector the questionnaire was addressed to virtually all types of staff in the rehabilitation services, which, as in the social service sector, involved a wide range of professions. Occupational therapists, youth activities advisers, technical aid advisers, counsellors, physiotherapists, speech therapists and psychologists were the categories most widely represented. (For the sake of simplicity, all these staff categories are referred to as the health care sector). Unlike the school staff, hardly any of the social insurance staff held supervisory posts. Two-thirds of the social services staff were supervisory staff, while about one-sixth of res- pondents in the health care sector were supervisory staff. The question about the employees’ length of service in their current posts revealed dif- ferences between the various sectors. However, a common feature of all sectors was that the staff had rarely been in their current posts for less than one year. Almost half the staff in social insurance offices had worked for more than ten years in their present post. The corresponding percentage in other sectors was much lower. But in all sectors the majority of respondents had been in their present post for at least five years. Relatively few respondents belonged to the younger age groups. About 35% in the so- cial services and health care sectors, 46% in social insurance offices and as many as 56% in schools were aged 50 or more. The majority of the staff in the health care and social service sectors tend to be women. The dominance of women among the staff in the survey sample was overwhelming; only about 15% of the staff in social insurance offices and the social service and health care sectors were men. Men were in a majority among school staff, which is presumable due to the fact that the respondents were headmasters. The gender distribution in schools was quite well-balanced, however. It is interesting to note that in social insurance offices and the health care sector – where female dominance was greatest – the percentage of supervi- sory staff was lowest. In social insurance offices this is because the questionnaires were only sent to staff in the local insurance offices. The survey shows a correlation between su- pervisory staff and gender which indicates that fewer women than men held supervisory posts. For obvious reasons, the educational background of the staff in the different sectors va- ried. The percentage of staff who had only attended compulsory school was largest in so- cial insurance offices. The percentage of staff with university or college education was largest in schools, followed by the social service and health care sectors. The greatest diffe- rence as regards education was that between social insurance offices, where the percentage of staff with university or college education was less than 30%, and the other sectors, where it varied from less than 80% to over 90%. However, it must be borne in mind that the questions related to the respondents’ formal education. Extensive in-service staff trai- ning occurs in all sectors, and perhaps most of all in social insurance offices. The results must therefore be considered in this light. Working conditions Operational goals, influence on the work situation and in-service training A negligible proportion of the respondents stated that they were completely unaware of the operational goals set for their workplace. However, a small group in the social service and health care sectors – about 8% of respondents – admitted that they were only partly aware of these goals. It may be asked whether awareness of operational goals is lower in these sectors than in social insurance offices and schools, or whether the finding was due to other causes. A correlation analysis indicates that familiarity with operational goals is greater among supervisory staff than among those in subordinate positions. There is also a correla- tion between this factor and a variable that measures the employees’ scope for influencing their work which indicates that awareness of operational goals is related to influence over the work situation. The proportion of staff who agreed only partly or not at all with the statement that they receive the support they needed to achieve the declared goals varied from about 20% in schools to almost 60% in social insurance offices. Consequently, quite a large number of respondents agreed only partly or not at all with the statement that they received the sup- port they needed. Several correlation analyses were carried out in order to explain why the staff felt that they received insufficient support from their superiors, and they revealed that lack of support has to do with the fact that management does not make it clear what it ex- pects of its staff, is not available when needed and is incapable of running operations in a competent manner. As regards the need of in-service training, several respondents said that this need was not fully met. A majority of respondents in schools and the health care sector considered that they were offered good opportunities to improve their skills. Less than 30% of the res- pondents in schools and 40% in the health care sector agreed only partly or not at all that they had good opportunities to improve their skills, i.e. they experienced shortcomings in this respect. This view was shared by more than half the social insurance staff and about 60% of those in the social service sector. The proportion of respondents who considered that they only had limited influence, or none at all, over their own work was highest in social insurance offices and lowest in schools. We believe that the reason why this view is so prevalent in social insurance offices is that their work is highly regulated and that the percentage of respondents in supervisory posts was lowest in this group. When it comes to the organization’s willingness to try out the ideas and suggestions of its staff, the response pattern was similar to that concerning the possibility of influencing the work situation, i.e. the proportion of respondents who were dissatisfied was largest in social insurance offices and smallest in schools. About 60% of the social insurance staff agreed only partly or not at all that their organization showed great interest in trying out their ideas and suggestions. The corresponding percentages in the other sectors were 47% in the social service sector, 32% in the health care sector and 6% in schools. One analysis indicates that there is a correlation between interest in the ideas and suggestions of the staff and high standards in terms of knowledge, support and management among immediate su- periors. Changes in organization and their effects on attitudes to persons with disabilities A large number of respondents irrespective of sector stated that their tasks had changed in the last five years. The greatest changes have taken place in social insurance offices (84%) and the social service sector and schools (about 80%), while fewer respondents in the he- alth care sector stated that their tasks had changed (65%). Few of those who have been as- signed new duties in the last five years felt that this had an adverse effect on their behaviour towards persons with disabilities. On the contrary, over half the staff in social insurance offices and more than 40% in the social service and health care sectors stated that the changes had had a favourable effect on their contacts with disabled clients/patients. The corresponding proportion in schools was 29%. The majority of headmasters stated that the changes had no effect on the way they related to persons with disabilities. We also asked whether there had been an increase in work duties during the last five ye- ars. Depending on the sector, 70-90% of the staff stated that their duties had increased in the last five years. The percentages were highest in schools and social insurance offices. 27% of respondents in the health care sector stated that they had not been assigned new duties. In social services, the duties of non-supervisory staff had not increased to the same extent as for supervisory staff. One correlation analysis shows also that a broader range of duties leads to a sense of pressure at work. The great majority did not feel that increased duties had an adverse effect on their relations with disabled persons. The most significant effects were reported by the social services staff, one-fifth of whom stated that increased duties had had an adverse effect on their relations with disabled persons. Judging by the respondents’ replies, staff cuts have a more negative impact when it comes to attitudes towards disabled persons. 95% of respondents in social insurance offices stated that there had been staff cuts in the last five years; the figure for schools was 74% and for the social service sector 49%. The figure for the health care sector was much lower, 19%. One reason for this may be that there have been fewer staff cuts in rehabilitation ser- vices than in other health care fields. About one-third of those who had witnessed staff cuts in social insurance offices and the social service and health care sectors stated that these had an adverse effect on their relations with disabled persons. But only 14% of the headmasters confirmed that staff cuts had had an adverse effect in this respect. Only a small minority stated that staff cuts had had a favourable effect. The majority view was that staff cuts had no effect on attitudes to clients/patients one way or the other. Perception of the work situation The questions about the work situation concerned the respondents’ assessment of job satis- faction, their workload and their qualifications for the work they were doing. As regards this last aspect, the competence factor, the overwhelming majority of res- pondents in all sectors considered that they had sufficient knowledge and information to cope with their work. Nor did the majority have any great doubts about their work perfor- mance. Nevertheless, 12-13% of respondents in the health care sector and social insurance offices, 20% in the social service sector and 24% in schools stated that they were very or rather doubtful in this respect. A number of correlation analyses were performed with a view to identifying the reasons for this uncertainty. The results indicate that the employees’ doubts about whether they performed their duties properly were related to uncertainty about operational goals, the vaguely defined demands of their immediate superiors, constant changes in the rules, new tasks, the lack of in-service training, vague rules and pressure due to inability to meet clients’ demands. As regards the job satisfaction factor, there was little variation between the various sec- tors, and the proportion of respondents who complained about their work situation was low in all sectors. A relevant question in this connection concerned the element of responsibi- lity at work. Responses to this question were generally positive. Only a few per cent of res- pondents stated that they were not trusted with any responsibility at all. This finding is not consistent with the distribution of responses to the question about the possibility of influ- encing work and the organization’s interest in the staff’s ideas and suggestions. On the one hand, the staff were expected to take great responsibility for their work, but on the other they did not have much influence over their work situation or much opportunity to present ideas and suggestions within the organization. As regards the workload factor, many respondents felt that they had too many matters to deal with, that their work demanded too much attention and responsibility of them, that they had to deal with great expectations and demands and that the work involved mental stress. 70-90% stated that they found that their work involved a high or very high degree of mental stress. The largest percentage (95%) of respondents was to be found in schools; al- most half the respondents in this sector stated that the degree of mental stress in their work was very high. Perception of the role of management Almost half the respondents in the social service and health care sectors stated that manag- ement did not make it clear what it expected of the staff. 32% of respondents in social insu- rance offices stated that this was true of their immediate superior. The percentage of headmasters who said the same of their immediate superiors was also high: 24%.</h2>
<h2>A comparatively large proportion also felt that they did not get sufficient support from management. For example, 45% of respondents in social insurance offices stated that their immediate superior was not available when they needed advice and support. About one-third of the staff in social insurance offices, the social service sector and schools, and about half the staff in the social service sector did not think that the manage- ment made the necessary effort to implement changes. A relatively high proportion of res- pondents also painted a pessimistic picture of their superiors’ appreciation of their work situation. The social insurance staff were most critical in this respect, one-third of respon- dents considering that their superiors did not show any appreciation of their work. Superiors’ ability to give feedback is illustrated by the question whether they knew enough about the field of work. Two-thirds of employees in social insurance offices had little confidence in their superiors’ knowledge, and more than half the staff in the social service sector agreed. The number of respondents in the health care sector and in social in- surance offices who did not feel that their immediate superiors knew enough about their work was much lower (33% and 27%, respectively). More than 65% of the staff in the he- alth care sector and schools considered that the management was sufficiently knowledge- able. There were differences between the sectors both as regards superiors’ ability to get things done (make it clear what was expected of the staff and make the necessary effort to bring about changes) and their knowledge, but we consider that the overall picture repre- sents a serious criticism of the management and their competence. Correlation analyses also indicate that the ability of immediate superiors to support and guide their staff have a significant effect on job satisfaction: there is a very strong correla- tion between job satisfaction and support from immediate superiors (i.e. they are available, show understanding and have the relevant knowledge). There is also a clear indication that job satisfaction is greater among those whose superiors make well-defined demands on their staff and make the necessary effort to bring about changes. Perception of pressure at work The proportion of respondents who experienced great pressure at work on account of constant changes in the rules varied; it was lowest in the health care sector and highest in social insurance offices. In social insurance offices it was the rule rather than the exception. It was also very common among headmasters. Another common reason for the sense of pressure at work was the addition of new duties. This problem was greatest in schools, where it was mentioned by four out of five respondents, and least in the health care sector, where it was mentioned by about half the respondents. Great pressure at work on account of vague rules was experienced by half the staff in the social service sector and two-thirds of the social insurance staff. The incidence of great pressure at work on account of being obliged to reject clients’ applications or not being able to fulfil the wishes of patients/pupils/parents was slightly less frequent. It was mentio- ned by about half the headmasters and 40% of social insurance staff. This cause of pressure was least significant in the social service sector. The proportion of respondents who experienced great pressure on account of the lack of in-service training varied between about 25% in the health care sector and schools and about 40% in the social service sector, while job insecurity was a less common cause of pressure. Contacts with and attitudes to persons with disabilities In this section we asked questions relating to the communications between staff and per- sons with disabilities and their relatives. In the sectors studied in the survey, communica- tion and contacts are of the essence as they affect job performance, job satisfaction and, not least, clients, patients and pupils. The staff included in the survey had frequent contacts with disabled persons. In social insurance offices, four out of five had daily contacts in some form, in the health care sector three out of five and in the social service sector two out of three. Frequent contacts were less common in schools, although more than half the school staff had contacts with disab- led persons at least once a week. The reason why respondents in schools had less frequent contacts than the other categories is that virtually all the staff included in the survey were headmasters. The survey shows that staff, regardless of the sector in which they work, considered that in recent years persons with disabilities and their relatives have become more aware of their rights and are better at presenting their case, at the same time as they are more de- manding. However, there are differences of opinion as to whether they have become more understanding or more impatient. The conventional wisdom is that persons with disabilities do not make very great demands, accept the decisions that are made and seldom criticize or make objections. Generally speaking, the reason that is given by researchers for this beha- viour is that persons with disabilities have a sense of guilt for being a burden on society, they feel isolated, grateful and dependent. The picture of persons with disabilities presented by the staff categories studied in the survey is very different. The staff are not dealing with helpless, submissive and grateful clients, but with competent, confident and demanding persons. The survey also reveals that the staff’s perception of persons with disabilities as more impatient and demanding in recent years tends to be related to whether they think they have jobs that cause stress or pressure because of insecure conditions or because they cannot fulfil the wishes of patients/clients/pupils. Between 15% and 27% of the staff in the various sectors said that they thought society’s efforts on behalf of persons with disabilities were sufficient. The highest proportion was to be found among social insurance staff and the lowest among staff in the health care sector and schools. Naturally, it may be asked whether this indicates negative attitudes on the part of certain employees in relation to persons with disabilities or whether there are other rea- sons for these responses. The fact that so many of the social insurance staff replied that re- sources are adequate in this area may, in our view, be a result of the Assistansce Benifit</h2>
<h2>Act that was introduced in 1994, which has made it possible for many persons with disabi- lities to lead a more independent life than before. However, in view of the lack of resources and unsatisfied needs mentioned by some respondents, one may well wonder what lies be- hind the answers given to this question. (SOU 1998:48)</h2>
<h2>The staff were also asked directly whether they thought that persons with disabilities and their relatives often encountered negative attitudes in their contacts with the health care sector, schools, social insurance offices or the social service sector. Respondents in the he- alth care sector often considered this to be the case, both as regards contacts with their own sector (25% of health care sector staff) and contacts with other sectors (28-38%). The res- pondents in the social service sector gave a less pessimistic picture in this respect, although quite a large proportion (36%) believed that negative attitudes occur in the health care sector. Not many respondents in social insurance offices, and even fewer in schools, thought that attitudes towards disabled persons were sometimes negative. Another question concerned the reasons why disabled persons are dissatisfied with the way they are treated by authorities and other public bodies. Many respondents thought that the main cause of dissatisfaction had to do with the conditions prevailing in the public sector; the fact that the staff do not have sufficient time for each disabled individual was mentioned as a common reason by half the social insurance staff and schools and by two- thirds of staff in the health care sector. The shortage of staff was mentioned by half the he- alth sector and school staff and more than 40% of the social insurance staff. The organization’s lack of economic resources was mentioned by over half the school staff, 46% of the health care sector staff and more than 40% of the staff in the social service sector. The vagueness of the regulatory framework was mentioned by more than half the social insurance staff and more than one-third of the staff in the social service and health care sectors. The lack of necessary in-service training was mentioned by almost half of the staff in the health care sector and about one-third of the social insurance staff and schools. Fewer respondents mentioned staff attitudes as a common reason for dissatisfaction. 26% of respondents in the health care sector and 16% of respondents in the social service sector mentioned staff attitudes, while 21% and 18%, respectively, believed that the ab- sence of an equal rights philosophy was a common cause of dissatisfaction among persons with disabilities. Explanations involving disabled persons themselves were not generally considered a common reason by staff. However, almost 20% of social insurance staff believed that the unrealistic expectations of persons with disabilities are a common reason for the poor reception they are sometimes given. Only a small percentage of the various staff categories considered disabled persons’ behaviour a common reason, although two-thirds or more believe that this might be the reason in some cases. Slightly less than half the social insurance staff stated that persons with disabilities so- metimes complained of the way they are treated. About one-third stated that relatives of persons with disabilities sometimes complained. Fewer of the respondents in the health care sector had received complaints; over one-fourth had received complaints from persons with disabilities, but more than 40% had received complaints from relatives. In the health care sector and among headmasters the number of complaints received from relatives (29% and 19%, respectively) was greater than that from the disabled persons themselves (15% and 7%, respectively). Very few respondents in any of the sectors said that they had recei- ved complaints; those who had done so stated that they were a rare occurrence. About 75% of the staff in social insurance offices stated that they had received com- plaints and that in the majority of cases they were about things beyond the staff’s control. This applies both to complaints from persons with disabilities and complaints from relati- ves. In the social service sector about half of the respondents stated that complaints, whet- her from disabled persons or from their relatives, were about things beyond their control. Almost as many respondents in the health care sector (47%) who had received complaints stated that they were about matters beyond their control, while fewer (40%) stated that complaints from relatives concerned matters beyond their control. The corresponding figu- res for headmasters were 60% as regards complaints from disabled persons and 40% as re- gards complaints from relatives. What are these complaints about? When it comes to complaints from persons with disa- bilities a large percentage of social insurance staff (86% of those who had received com- plaints) said that these related to long processing times. A large number of complaints had also been received for insufficient assistance (67%), failure to provide assistance (48%) and complaints that the client had not been assessed in relation to his/her individual needs (41%). Many respondents in the social service sector (66% of those who had received complaints from persons with disabilities) received complaints about insufficient assi- stance, long processing times (46%) and complaints that the client had not been assessed in relation to his/her individual needs (38%). In the health care sector, many respondents (74% of those who had received complaints from persons with disabilities) had received complaints about long processing times and insufficient assistance (50%). Finally, in schools many respondents (74% of those who had received complaints from persons with disabilities) had received complaints mainly about insufficient assistance. The picture is similar when it comes to complaints from relatives, but there are some differences: there appear to be less complaints from relatives about long processing times. Furthermore, particularly in the social service and health care sectors, and also to some extent in schools, it is more common for relatives to complain about the lack of informa- tion. The incidence of complaints from disabled persons and/or relatives covaries with job satisfaction, stress and competence in such a way that more complaints are received by staff who experience low job satisfaction (the correlation applies to social insurance offices and the health care sector), great stress and a lack of necessary training (the social service and health care sectors). More complaints also tend to be received by those who find that disabled persons have become more impatient and demanding in recent years. The staff were asked to give reasons for the uncertainty experienced by some people in contacts with disabled persons. The lack of experience of such contacts was considered one of the main reasons. The number of respondents who mentioned the fear of offending the person or a feeling of one’s own vulnerability or helplessness was much smaller. The answers to the question how often respondents find themselves in moral dilemmas in their work in connection with decisions concerning persons with disabilities shows that the proportion of respondents who never experience such dilemmas was lowest in the so- cial service sector (6%) and highest among headmasters (29%). Moral dilemmas arose of- ten, or quite often, in the social service and health care sectors, where they were experienced by 25% and just under 25% of the staff, respectively. Experience of moral dilemmas covaries with the workload and a sense of pressure due to inability to fulfil the wishes of patients/clients/pupils; in other words, such situations are experienced more frequently by staff with a heavy workload and those who are under great pressure. In order to find out more about the causes of negative values and attitudes, the respon- dents were asked to react to some statements about the rights and social status of persons with disabilities. One of these statements was: "Persons with disabilities have the same rights to educa- tion, social welfare benefits etc. as others". In view of the formulation of this statement, the answers that indicate less than total agreement are the ones that are interesting as indicators of negative attitudes, and such answers were given by 5-7% of the staff depending on the sector. Another statement was: "In some situations (e.g. economic crises, widespread unemployment) giving lower priority to assistance to persons with disabilities is justified". 22-29% agreed with this statement in varying degrees. The highest percentage was to be found in the social service sector. A third statement was: "Nowadays the assistance given to disabled persons is suffici- ently great as to make further measures unnecessary". 27-49% of the staff agreed with this statement in varying degrees. The lowest figure was that for the health care sector and the highest for social insurance offices. The fact that so many respondents agreed with this statement was surprising in view of the fact that the complaints received from persons with disabilities and their relatives usually mentioned insufficient or non-existent assistance. The fourth statement was: "Disparaging treatment makes the disability harder to bear". The purpose of this statement was to test respondents’ awareness of the fact that disability is a relative concept and that functional impairments are perceived as handicaps in relation to the response – attitudes, accessibility – of other people. 2-6% in the various sectors did not agree with this statement, and 5-13% only partly agreed. The higher figure related to staff in social insurance offices. It is difficult to explain such answers. One explanation might be that some respondents consider that the individual himself rather than the people around him is the cause of the disability. Another explanation might be failure to under- stand the question or the fact that the respondents had not given much thought to what a disability involves. An open-ended question was asked to give the respondents the opportunity to give their views on the alleged problem that cases involving persons with disabilities "fall between two stools"; comments were given by almost all respondents. An obvious pattern was ap- parent in these answers, e.g. the absence of a clearcut division of responsibilities between public bodies. Cutbacks were often mentioned by staff as a reason why persons with disa- bilities feel that their cases fall between two stools. The two reasons mentioned most frequently were the economy and the regulatory framework. Persons with mental disabili- ties, or with diffuse functional disabilities, and those who cannot speak for themselves or do not have articulate spokesmen are assumed to be the groups that are hardest hit. There is a consensus among school staff that pupils with MBD, DAMP, autistic conditions, Asper- ger’s syndrome and pupils with social handicaps have the greatest problems. Another open-ended question offered respondents the opportunity to state whether they experienced any particularly difficult problems in this area. The headmasters often mentio- ned the lack of resources. The comment most frequently made in the health care sector was the feeling of insufficiency. Many of the social insurance staff stated that the number of staff must be increased or the workload reduced in order to improve working conditions. Questions about schools As regards the questions addressed to headmasters only, the results show that the main areas in which changes are needed in order to provide disabled pupils with an education that is on a par with that enjoyed by other pupils are resources and competence. The replies given by the headmasters do not allow an unambiguous assessment of whet- her the resources allocated to disabled pupils have increased or decreased compared with resources for other pupils during the last five years. The majority stated that resources in relation to other pupils have remained unchanged. However, the number of respondents who considered that resources for persons with disabilities had decreased was greater than those who thought they had increased. The headmasters stated that having disabled pupils in normal classes was generally a positive experience. Teaching methods and the classroom atmosphere improved. A large majority claimed that this situation also tends to eliminate prejudice and negative attitudes towards disabled pupils. On the other hand, the majority stated that it also increased the teachers’ workload, while only 4.7% thought it had an adverse effect on the performance of other pu- pils. As regards the question what headmasters needed to be able to supervise the schooling of disabled pupils, many stated that they did not know enough about specific functional impair- ments or about appropriate teaching methods.</h2>
