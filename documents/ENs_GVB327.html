<p>The remit of the Professional Secrecy Inquiry</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit has been to review the possibility of enhanced protection for the professional secrecy of professionals providing advisory services on matters of patent law. Particular attention was to be paid to the need of and arrangements for education, authorisation and supervision of such professionals. The remit has included making proposals for the legislative amendments that the Inquiry has deemed appropriate.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s legislative proposals</p>
<p>In its report, the Inquiry proposes amendment of Chapter 36, Section 5 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure. The effect of the amendment is that a person who has been specially authorised as a patent attorney and their assistants may not be heard concerning confidential information during legal proceedings ( prohibition of questioning ). To be more precise, this prohibition of questioning applies to information relating to matters of patent law that has come to the attorney’s knowledge in the course of his or her professional activities.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes a new act on authorisation of patent attorneys. The act will include provisions stating that a person who has been authorised is subject to professional secrecy regarding information received from clients.</p>
<p>Finally, the Inquiry proposes amendments to the Secrecy Act to the effect that secrecy is to apply to certain information in matters coming under the act on authorisation of patent attorneys.</p>
<p>Limitation of the obligation of authorised patent attorneys to give evidence</p>
<p>In patent applications, patent attorneys are often engaged as advisers. In the report, the term ‘patent attorney’ means an adviser who deals with matters of patent law on a professional basis. These patent attorneys may be independent patent consultants or advisers working at a company, as engineers or lawyers.</p>
<p>At present, there is no limitation on the obligation of patent attorneys who are not lawyers (members of the Swedish Bar Association) to give evidence about matters that have come to their knowledge in connection with a patent application. However, under Chapter 36, Section 5 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure, a patent attorney may not be heard as a witness concerning information entrusted to the patent attorney in his or her capacity as legal counsel.</p>
<p>In certain other countries, patent agents and patent attorneys who are not lawyers have a limited obligation to give evidence, or are exempt from this obligation. This is true, for example, of the UK, Germany and the USA. One prerequisite for a US court to grant a foreign patent agent or patent attorney confidentiality ( at-  torney-client  privilege ) in litigation taking place in the USA is that the legislation in the agent’s or attorney’s home country guarantees a degree of confidentiality in legal proceedings that in all essential respects is equivalent to that that exists in the USA.</p>
<p>During revision of the European Patent Convention (EPC), attention was drawn to the problems that European patent attorneys (epi representatives) have encountered in connection with legal proceedings in the USA. Provisions have been adopted under Article 134a and Rule 101a (Rule 153 according to the approved renumbering) of the revised Convention, EPC 2000, to the effect that a person who is a member of the Institute of Professional Representatives before the European Patent Office (epi) shall not be obliged to disclose confidential information of a professional nature in proceedings before the European Patent Office (EPO). Confidentiality at the EPO therefore confers more farreaching protection for confidential information than the corresponding rules in Swedish law.</p>
<p>This is the context in which the Inquiry proposes, first, a new act on authorisation of patent attorneys, and second, an amendment of Chapter 36, Section 5 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure.</p>
<p>In order to enable advisory services on matters of patent law to be conducted in a manner that is satisfactory for those seeking advice, it is proposed that authorised patent attorney and their assistants should not be available for hearing as witnesses in questions concerning matters of patent law. As is evident from Chapter 38, Section 2 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure, the prohibition of questioning applying to authorised patent attorneys will be accompanied by an equivalent exemption from the obligation to produce written documents by order of a court.</p>
<p>A new act on authorisation of patent attorneys</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s opinion, regulation of authorised patent attorneys under public law is an essential condition for any limitation of the general obligation to give evidence and the Inquiry therefore proposes a new act on authorisation of patent attorneys.</p>
<p>Authorisation is to be voluntary and will therefore not be a condition for the right to represent applicants in cases before the Swedish Patent and Registration Office or in a general court or elsewhere. However, only authorised patent attorneys will be covered by the proposed prohibition of questioning under Chapter 36, Section 5 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure.</p>
<p>Patent attorney</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that with regard to authorisation and the obligation to give evidence, a patent attorney who is employed by his or her client should be treated in the same way as a patent attorney who is employed at a patent agency. The right to authorisation will therefore not be reserved for employees of other authorised attorneys or patent agencies.</p>
<p>Qualifications required for authorisation</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that eligibility for authorisation should be conditional on the applicant, first, having an appropriate academic higher education qualification (a degree of magister) and at least four years of professional experience, and second, having passed a special knowledge test. In addition, applicants must be professionally</p>
<p>engaged in activities relating to assistance in matters of patent law. Requiring both academic education and practical experience ensures that the person authorised has a high level of both theoretical and practical knowledge. However, the Inquiry proposes that if there are special grounds for doing so, it should be possible to grant an exemption from certain requirements, notably education, in the case of a person who has many years of professional experience but lacks an academic education. The purpose of the special professional examination is to check that the applicant also meets a high standard as regards the ability to practically apply the knowledge that is needed to practice the profession of patent attorney.</p>
<p>Professional secrecy established by law</p>
<p>Typically, a patent attorney has duties that by their nature depend on the general public being able to rely on the patent attorney not to pass on information entrusted to him or her in confidence. Furthermore, a condition of professional secrecy that is legally explicit and subject to penalty if violated is often a prerequisite for obtaining commissions.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that professional secrecy should be established by law. This professional secrecy will have broad coverage and apply to all information that has been entrusted to a patent attorney in the course of his or her profession or that he or she has learned as a patent attorney in this connection. The authorised patent attorney will also have an obligation, generally by contract, to ensure that his or her assistants are bound by professional secrecy.</p>
<p>Public supervision</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals envisage a new government agency (the Patent Attorneys’ Board) to authorise patent attorneys and exercise supervision of them. The Board’s responsibilities will consist of examining applications for authorisation and exemption, making decisions in disciplinary cases and dealing with educational issues, register maintenance and information services.</p>
<p>Public access to official documents and secrecy</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that certain restrictions should apply to the right to access public documents at the Patent Attorneys’ Board. An addition is proposed in Chapter 9, Section 12 of the Secrecy Act (1980:100) to the effect that secrecy can apply at the Patent Attorneys’ Board to information concerning the financial status of a person applying for authorisation or a person who is an authorised patent attorney or someone else’s financial or personal circumstances. The Inquiry also proposes that, to the extent directed by the Government, secrecy will apply to information about an individual’s commercial or operating circumstances and to other financial or personal circumstances held by the Patent Attorneys’ Board (cf. Chapter 8, Section 6 of the Secrecy Act).</p>
<p>Supervisory activities of the Swedish Competition Authority and the Swedish Tax Agency</p>
<p>The Inquiry has considered whether the regulations of the Competition Act (1993:20) concerning the obligation to supply information and investigations are consistent with the limitations in the obligation to give evidence and obligation to provide written documents that are now proposed for authorised patent attorneys. The proposed prohibition of questioning for authorised patent attorneys with regard to matters of patent law will only apply in court proceedings. In contrast, no proposal is made, alongside situations involving legal proceedings, to limit the obligation to provide documents to the Swedish Competition Authority. In the Inquiry’s view, any such regulation would entail far too substantial an interference in the activities conducted by the Swedish Competition Authority. The Inquiry has observed that a patent attorney may give advice concerning business conditions relating to patents and the commercial use of patents that may come into conflict with competition provisions. However, the Inquiry’s proposed definition of the concept ‘matters of patent law’ in the new act on authorisation of patent attorneys does not include measures that may come into conflict with the provisions of the Competition Act or Articles 81–82 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has also concluded that the prohibition of questioning and restriction of the obligation to provide documents ap-</p>
<p>plying to authorised patent attorneys will not impinge on the auditing activities of the Swedish Tax Agency, as the documents that are protected in court proceedings under the Inquiry’s proposals are documents that relate to matters of patent law. Such documents are not normally examined in an audit.</p>
