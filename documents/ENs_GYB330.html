<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The New Electricity and Gas Markets Inquiry (the Inquiry) has been asked to implement EU’s third legislative package for electricity and gas into the Swedish legislative framework. The Enquiry’s work is part of the work within the EU intended to create common internal markets for electricity and gas. The legislative package contains for instance new and also more detailed measures intended to promote the harmonization and its results. In addition an agency for the cooperation of energy regulators is established (ACER). Through harmonization the legislative framework and promoting the development of cross border trade the prerequisites for efficient and competitive markets for electricity and gas are created.</p>
<p>The third legislative package consists of the following acts: – Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 2003/54/EC. – Regulation (EC) No 714/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on conditions for access to the network for  cross-border exchanges in electricity and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003. – Directive 2009/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas and repealing Directive 2003/55/EC. – Regulation (EC) No 715/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on conditions for access to the natural gas transmission networks and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1775/2005. – Regulation (EC) No 713/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 establishing an Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators.</p>
<p>The third package contains measures in several areas. Included in the package are measures intended to improve unbundling between transmission system operators and companies acting on the competitive market, rules resulting in an increased level of protection for customers, and a more detailed regulatory framework concerning the duties and powers of the national energy regulators. The need for cooperation is also emphasised, and in this area the Agency for cooperation between national energy regulators (ACER) now being established, is given an important role. Within the framework of the Electricity Regulation and the Gas Regulation two organisations are established, ENTSO for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and ENTSO for Gas (ENTSOG). These organisations are to have cooperative function for the certified transmission system operators for electricity and gas. They are to fulfil an important role in the harmonisation of the European regulatory framework and will among other things develop the network codes and investment plans for the internal markets for electricity and gas.</p>
<p>The processes contained in the third package are based on the principle that the market participants having the relevant knowledge are to develop the more detailed rules covering routines and recommendations etc, which later are to be noted/approved/confirmed by ACER and/or the Commission. This approach has e.g. been used for the development of the network codes by ENTSO-E and ENTSOG. In the report the Inquiry has chosen to use the term grid codes for the so called network codes for the Swedish electricity market as this term better reflects the purpose of these codes in a Swedish setting.</p>
<h2>The Assignment</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s assignment is to develop proposals for the necessary legislation and other regulatory framework necessary to implement the Electricity Directive and the Gas Directive into the Swedish legislative framework. The Inquiry has also been given the task of recommending adaptations to the relevant laws and other regulatory framework based on the Electricity Regulation, the Gas Regulation and the Agency Regulation. The Inquiry’s assignment also includes analysing whether there is a need for changing the rules on unbundling on the gas market. Actual conditions on the Swedish electricity and gas markets have formed part of the basis for the Inquiry’s analysis.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals cover changes in the Electricity Act, the Natural Gas Act, the Electricity Ordinance and the Natural Gas Ordinance. In addition the report also proposes changes in the ordinances containing instructions for the Energy Markets Inspectorate, Svenska kraftnät, the Swedish Energy Agency, the Swedish Consumer Agency and the Swedish Competition Authority. The Inquiry also proposes a new ordinance about certification – the Certification Ordinance.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has elected to limit the scope of the proposed changes to a minimum, i.e. the Inquiry only proposes the changes necessary to comply with the explicit demands of the Directives. This approach means e.g. that the general terms and conditions which are common practice for the majority of the companies concerned have been used as the basis for many of the suggested changes with regard to consumer protection. The Inquiry has also put great emphasis on safeguarding consumer rights in accordance with the intentions of the third package.</p>
<h2>The Third Legislative Package for Electricity and Gas</h2>
<h2>The Electricity and Gas Directives, and the Electricity and Gas</h2>
<h2>Regulations</h2>
<h2>A Strenghtened and Clarified Position for Customers</h2>
<p>The Directives sometimes mention consumers in the Swedish meaning of the word meaning a natural person, sometimes they mention customers which includes all customers, i.e. both juridical and natural persons. Some of the Inquiry’s proposals only concern consumers while others concern customers in general. There are great similarities between the Electricity and the Gas Directives e.g. in the areas of consumer related issues.</p>
<p>Already Sweden is applying provisions which are similar to the ones in the Directives within the scope of the general terms and conditions used by the majority of the companies in the electricity and gas markets. To the extent possible, the Inquiry has elected to propose provisions corresponding with existing common practice in order to avoid larger cost increases than necessary for the companies concerned.</p>
<p>The Inquiry is putting forward a number of proposals aimed at strengthening and clarifying the position of the customers on the electricity and gas markets. Several proposals concern the relationship between the consumers and the electricity and gas suppliers, or the distribution companies for electricity or gas. The Inquiry proposes that a contract between a consumer and an electricity or gas supplier should contain information about the supplier’s name, address, and telephone number, the supplier’s commitments to the consumer, the date when the contract was entered into, where the consumer can find information on the price and other terms of the supplier including cost-per-unit-price, when billing will take place and at what intervals, the duration of the contract, the conditions for renewal if it is a fixed term contract(i.e. a contract limited to a certain period of time), the conditions for terminating the contract, the principles on which the calculation of the costs for terminating a fixed term contract ahead of schedule are based, the terms for compensation and refunds if the services are not provided in accordance with the terms in the contract regarding inaccurate or delayed billing, and what will happen when invoicing based on preliminary data is used to beyond what has been agreed on in the contract, the method of initiating procedures for settlements of disputes according to the Electricity Act and the Natural Gas Act, and information on other consumer rights in relation to the electricity and gas suppliers. The rules proposed here are mainly a codification of existing general terms and conditions. The Inquiry proposes a provision specifying that a consumer is permitted to terminate a supply contract for electricity or gas free of charge and free of other liabilities. This provision should apply if it is not a fixed term contract.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that the companies should send out information to the consumers before a change in the conditions of the contract takes effect, and that the consumer shall be entitled to terminate the contract without cost if they are not willing to accept the change in the conditions. In proposing that the change in the conditions should be notified before taking effect the Inquiry is diverging from the provisions in the Directives.</p>
<p>Another proposal means that the invoice shall carry a reference to the web page of the company. The web page shall contain information on where dispute settlement is available. The web page shall also contain information on consumer rights.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes provisions limiting the extent of time the companies can demand advance payment, and when the demands for advanced payment should be re-considered to see whether it should remain in place. For consumers of gas this will mean that the time period the suppliers of gas will be allowed to demand advance payment will be shortened. There is also a proposal covering the principles for the calculation of the advance payments.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a ban on conditions discriminating between different methods of payment in order to avoid discrimination between different groups of consumers. The Inquiry also proposes that the consumers should get their final bill within six week of changing their supplier of electricity or gas.</p>
<p>The Inquiry is also putting forward a proposal on shortening the process for switching suppliers to three weeks. According to assessment of the Inquiry this proposal will mean that the IT systems and routines of the companies concerned need to be adapted to the shorter time frame for the switching process. The proposal concerns the switching process, i.e. the longest time allowed for switching a supplier.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes introducing provisions signifying an obligation for electricity and gas suppliers, as well as for network companies for electricity and gas, to have a well functioning process for handling customer complaints. The Energy Markets Inspectorate is the regulatory authority and will monitor the companies’ handling of customer complaints.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes a provision obliging the distribution companies for electricity to provide consumers with information on their electricity consumption at least once a month. The information must be available based on calendar month and be available in such a way that all customers will be able to access it. The Inquiry has considered the same provision for gas, but based on the conditions on the Swedish gas market the Inquiry has chosen not to put forward such a proposal.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that network companies for electricity with more than 100 000 connected customers which form part of a vertically integrated company shall state who is responsible for the communication in question when communicating with one or more customers. The intention is that it should be unmistakable when it is the monopolist within a group of companies that is the sender and when other companies are the senders so that confusion about who is the sender is avoided. So as not to go beyond the scope of the provision in the Directive the Inquiry has elected to apply the provision only to network companies for electricity. In order to not raise the costs unnecessarily for small companies the Inquiry proposes that the exemption for companies with less than 100 000 customers should be applied.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that all vertically integrated electricity and gas companies, irrespective of their number of connected customers, shall appoint a compliance officer responsible for the company’s compliance programme. The compliance officer can be nominated within the company.</p>
<p>To improve access to the networks for electricity the Inquiry proposes that the network companies for electricity shall give reasoned decisions in those cases when they deny third party access to the network or refuse to transport electricity for another party in their network. A reasoned decision will make it easier for the party denied access to evaluate whether there is cause to appeal against the decision.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes a definition for vulnerable customers to be included in the Electricity Act and in the Natural Gas Act.</p>
<h2>Unbundling</h2>
<p>The Directives contain new and more detailed provisions regarding the rules on unbundling. Based on these the Inquiry among others things proposes rules on the separation of network companies for electricity from companies producing and selling gas, and vice versa, i.e. that network companies for gas are kept separate from companies active in the production or selling of electricity.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has put forward a proposal concerning the rules on unbundling in the gas market. The Natural Gas Act should be amended with a provision clarifying that a company active in the gas networks business is not allowed to produce or sell natural gas or any other type of gas which technically and safely can be injected into the natural gas system. The part of the provision which is new concerns production which includes the production of bio gas.</p>
<h2>Certification</h2>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes provisions which state that the transmission system operators and other relevant parties will have to apply for certification. The provisions on certification are important from a European perspective as they are intended to support the unbundling regime applied to transmissions companies in the internal market.</p>
<p>The certified companies will participate in the work undertaken by ENTSO-E and ENTSOG. For gas the Inquiry also proposes a provision covering certification in relation to third countries.</p>
<h2>Closed distribution systems</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes the introduction of rules about closed distribution systems into the Natural Gas Act. The proposal is intended to confirm the common practice of today which works well, and at the same time to contribute to increasing transparency and long term stability for the market participants. Concerning storage of gas the Inquiry proposes that a provision should be included in the Natural Gas Act stating that the regulator should consult with the system users when developing the tariffs for storage and for storage in transmission pipes or the methodologies underlying their calculation.</p>
<h2>Energy Markets Inspectorate</h2>
<p>The third legislative package contains rules intended to harmonise and ensure the independence of the regulators. The Energy Markets Inspectorate will be assigned new tasks while at the same time the existing tasks will be affected both with regard to their scope and their level. To ensure that it will be possible for the Energy Markets Inspectorate to perform these tasks it is important that the Inspectorate is given access to sufficient resources and competences.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the instructions governing the work at the Energy Markets Directorate should be updated with references to the revised Electricity and Gas Directives, as well as the Gas Regulation. In addition they should be amended with a reference to the Electricity Regulation and the Agency Regulation.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the head of the inspectorate should be appointed for a period of five to seven years, and that the appointment only can be renewed once.</p>
<p>The Inquiry will put forward a proposal meaning that each party having a complaint against a network company for electricity or gas with regard to their obligations according to the Electricity Act or the Natural Gas Act respectively may complain to the Energy Markets Inspectorate. The Inspectorate will have to come to a decision within two months’ time. The decisions should be immediately binding and subject to appeal.</p>
<p>The new provisions do not encompass disputes already subject to regulation in the Electricity Act. The Energy Markets Inspectorate will also handle the new rules on certification described above. The proposals also include that the Inspectorate shall make public descriptions of the roles and responsibilities of the network companies for electricity and gas, the suppliers of electricity and gas and customers, and if needed other market participants. The Inquiry also proposes that the Energy Markets Inspectorate shall decide on the level of earnings for the national grid.</p>
<p>With regard to the Agency Regulation the Energy Markets Inspectorate will, in their role as a national energy regulator, participate in the work undertaken by the Agency.</p>
<h2>Svenska kraftnät</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that Svenska kraftnät’s instructions should be amended with provisions making it clear that Svenska kraftnät shall collect congestion charges, participate in the development of the regional markets for electricity and gas within the Nordic area and within the EU, inform the Energy Markets Inspectorate of the results of Svenska kraftnät supervising the reliability of the Swedish national electricity grid, and perform the tasks assigned to the transmission system operator for electricity in accordance with the Electricity Regulation. The Inquiry also proposes that Svenska kraftnät should be given the opportunity to transfer income from congestion charges between different years so as to use them for maintaining or increasing capacity on the interconnector in question or for counter trade. Based on the present conditions Svenska kraftnät is expected to participate in the work undertaken by ENTSO-E and ENTSOG as one of the certified parties.</p>
<h2>Other authorities</h2>
<p>The proposals of the Inquiry will also affect the Swedish Energy Agency, the Swedish Consumer Agency, and the Swedish Competition Authority. The Swedish Energy Agency should assist Svenska kraftnät and other certified parties with energy forecasts for electricity and gas. For the Swedish Consumer Agency the proposals will mainly mean that the Agency shall assist the Energy Markets Inspectorate with information about consumers in the electricity and gas markets. The Inquiry also proposes that the instructions for the Swedish Competition Authority are amended in such a way that the Authority now shall assist the Energy Markets Inspectorate with data for use in connection with the Inspectorate’s annual reports on the electricity and gas markets.</p>
<h2>Other organisations</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Consumer Electricity Advice Bureau is designated as the contact point for consumers in regard to issues concerning suppliers of electricity and gas, and concerning network companies for electricity and gas.</p>
<p>The Directives also contain rules stating that consumers are to have access to out-of-court dispute settlements procedures which are fast, simple and inexpensive. The Inquiry has come to the conclusion that the existing procedure handled by ARN is sufficient, and there is no need at this point to change the regulatory framework in this regard.</p>
<h2>Other issues</h2>
<p>The Directives encompass provisions stating that the national regulatory authorities are to change legally binding decisions when the Commission finds that such a decision does not comply with the guidelines in the Directives or the Regulations. Taken together the Inquiry is of the opinion that it would not be in accordance with the Swedish Administrative Procedure Act or the principles which form the basis for such administrative decisions to change such a decision when it benefits an individual person and the decision has gained legal force.</p>
<h2>The Agency Regulation</h2>
<p>The Agency Regulation is new and encompasses provisions covering both the establishment and the organisation of the Agency, and its tasks.</p>
<p>ACER will among other things be given the task to strengthen the supervision of the markets and to handle certain disputes concerning cross border interconnectors. Under certain circumstances the Agency will be able to take decisions in some of the areas normally belonging to the national regulators. The new legislation also encompasses provisions on how certain issues are to be processed. Here the Agency has an important role as the Agency is to give its opinion on several issues.</p>
<p>Many of the tasks are also covered by the provisions in the Directives and other Regulations which form part of the third package and except for ACER they also concern the Commission, national regulators, ENTSO-E and ENTSOG. These tasks have been handled with regard to the aforementioned Directives and Regulations with regard to proposals for new and amended legislation. In this context the Inquiry only proposes that the instructions for the Energy Markets Inspectorate shall be amended with a reference to the Agency Regulation.</p>
<p>It will also be possible for the member states to station national experts as personnel at the Agency. Such a post would most likely be of interest for Sweden.</p>
<h2>New investigations into the gas market and the electricity markets are being suggested</h2>
<p>Based on the provisions of the third legislative package the Inquiry also suggests that certain issues need to be analysed further.</p>
<p>On the gas market the Inquiry is of the opinion that the system responsibility for the national supply of gas within short should be analysed further. The purpose would be to identify the changes necessary in the Swedish rules and regulations to enable the handling of the system responsibility of the national supply of gas in accordance with the TSO solution presented in the Gas Directive. Also the Swedish market model for natural gas should be analysed in more detail to determine whether it needs to be adapted to harmonise with the current legislations in the EU. An important issue is how the handling of the system responsibility and the choice of market model will contribute to a more efficient Swedish market for natural gas and how it will contribute to increasing the opportunities for competition on the internal market.</p>
<p>For the electricity market the Inquiry suggests an overhaul of the level of the exemption in the electricity market for vertically integrated companies valid for companies with more than 100 000 connected electricity customers. The purpose of such an overhaul would be for the exemption to better reflect the conditions on the Swedish market, where under today’s rules all but about five companies are covered by the exemption.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also suggests that the Energy Markets Inspectorate should evaluate the introduction of smart meters for electricity and gas, and to assess the costs and benefits associated with these both for the market and for the consumers. When undertaking such an evaluation it is important to note that the circumstances differ in several regards between the electricity and the gas markets.</p>
<h2>Demands for stricter rules on unbundling in the natural gas market</h2>
<p>In addition to the implementation of the third legislative package the Inquiry has also been asked to look into the need for changing the provision on functional unbundling in the gas market.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has come to the conclusion that there appears to be no need for rules for the transmission companies on the gas market corresponding to the changes implemented in the Electricity Act.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that they would contribute to clarify the effects of efficient unbundling and an efficient form of independence, the Inquiry is however of the opinion that this does not constitute sufficient grounds for introducing new rules for the transmission companies in the gas market.</p>
<h2>Funding</h2>
<p>The Inquiry suggests that the Energy Market Inspectorate’s need for increased resources is funded through the appropriation received by the inspectorate, which also is proposed to include the compensation to the contact point for the consumers in the electricity and gas markets proposed by the Inquiry.</p>
<p>Svenska kraftnät’s costs for cooperation on an international basis will in the same manner as before be covered by the tariffs for the national grid. It should be possible to accommodate the other duties imposed on Svenska kraftnät within its present scope.</p>
<p>The new investigations into the system responsibility for the national supply of gas and the market model for natural gas and the overhaul of the level of the exemption for companies with fewer than 100 000 connected customers in the electricity market should to a large extent be able to be accommodated within the normal scope for such analysis within the Ministry or the Energy Markets Inspectorate.</p>
