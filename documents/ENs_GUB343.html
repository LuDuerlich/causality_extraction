<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Basis of the Inquiry’s remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s overall assignment has been to conduct a review of the regulations given in Swedish law on liability for damage caused by radiological accidents and to identify financial solutions that could provide a basis for covering the liability of operators of nuclear installations as far as possible. The Inquiry sets out from the international commitments that Sweden is bound by in the area and that have also been subjected to quite far-reaching review in recent years.</p>
<p>The present Swedish regulations on liability for damage arising as a result of radiological accidents at nuclear installations and during carriage of certain types of nuclear materials or nuclear waste are provided in the Nuclear Liability Act (Atomansvarighetslagen, 1968:45) 1 . This Act is based on Sweden’s international commitments.</p>
<p>The conventions that bind Sweden, and that have been drawn up within the OECD, are the 1960 Paris Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy and the 1963 Supplementary Convention (as amended by the protocols adopted in 1964 and 1982). Corresponding international liability regulations in the area are given in the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage, developed under the auspices of the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA. Only states that are outside the Paris Convention and the Supplementary Convention are parties to the Vienna Convention.</p>
<p>The Paris Convention and the Supplementary Convention have now been amended in several important points by a protocol adopted in 2004. The process of revision has been greatly influenced by the previously conducted review of the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage.</p>
<p>The basic liability regulation remains unchanged in the revised conventions. This means that an operator of a nuclear installation (an operator) is liable without fault. The operator is therefore liable irrespective of culpability, i.e. on objective grounds, for damage that arises in connection with operation of the plant. The liability for radiological damage is channelled to the operator. With few exceptions, this means that only the operator of the nuclear installation can be liable to pay compensation for radiological damage.</p>
<p>In addition, even after the amending protocols, the Paris Convention and Supplementary Convention constitute a three-stage system of compensation.</p>
<p>As previously, the first stage expresses the level of operator liability that applies under the Paris Convention, but the level of liability is considerably raised and is now expressed as a lowest acceptable amount (“reference amount”). This must be covered by insurance or some other financial guarantee. This solution means that Convention States now have the explicit option to introduce unlimited third party liability for operators.</p>
<p>The second stage, which under the Supplementary Convention consists of the interval between 700 and 1 200 million euro, assumes that liability rests with the state in which the liable operator’s installation is located. This liability can diminish, or even disappear, depending on how far the first-stage liability of the operator itself extends.</p>
<p>In the third stage, the Convention States are jointly liable under the Supplementary Convention for compensation in the interval between 1 200 and 1 500 million euro.</p>
<h2>Main points of the report</h2>
<p>Sweden’s accession to the amending protocols and the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (radiological damage)</p>
<p>The task of the Inquiry has been to investigate the conditions for Swedish accession to the amending protocols.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s deliberations have led it to conclude that Sweden should accede to the protocols amending the Paris Convention and the Supplementary Convention as they entail an obvious improvement of compensation protection in the event of radiological accidents. This means that the legislation must be adjusted and several central provisions amended (transformation) in order to bring Swedish law into line with the partially or completely new commitments that follow from the revised conventions.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has also been instructed to assess whether Sweden should accede to the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (radiological damage). This fourth convention in the area of liability has been developed at the IAEA and regulates compensation from public funds outside the Supplementary Convention. The convention has not yet entered into force.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s view there is not sufficient reason at present for Sweden to accede to the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (radiological damage).</p>
<p>Proposed new act on liability and compensation in the event of radiological accidents</p>
<p>The legislative amendments that the Inquiry considers necessary relate to a large number of provisions in the Nuclear Liability Act. They affect, for example, the scope of the Act, the definitions of certain concepts, the regulation of liability and levels of liability, the level of obligatory insurance, the rules on compensation out of public funds and the rules about competent courts.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has also been instructed to propose possible measures to modernise the Nuclear Liability Act and make it more accessible. Consequently some provisions need adjustment in linguistic and other respects.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has furthermore found there is reason to bring the present definitions of central concepts into line with more modern and more current usage. This means that the concepts atomolycka (nuclear accident) and atomskada (nuclear damage) will be replaced by radiologisk olycka (radiological accident) and radiologisk skada (radiological damage) respectively. The Inquiry also proposes replacing the concepts atombränsle (nuclear fuel), atomsubstans (nuclear substance) and radioaktiv produkt (radioactive product) with the concepts kärnämne (nuclear material) and kärnavfall (nuclear waste).</p>
<p>The changes are so extensive that this in itself – added to which the need for a new legislative structure – has led the Inquiry to propose a completely new act on liability and compensation in the event of radiological accidents.</p>
<p>The basic approach has been to start out from the present regulations given in the Nuclear Liability Act, analyse the amendments that are required or are considered appropriate following accession by Sweden to the amending protocols and, based on this, create more modern and more accessible legislation. It follows from the Inquiry’s proposals that the present Nuclear Liability Act will be repealed.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes unlimited liability with guaranteed funding up to 1 500 million euro</p>
<p>In the latest relevant legislative matter, which concerned the issue of increased third party liability for operators, the Government emphasised, as it has done elsewhere, that liability should rest in the first instance with the nuclear energy industry and that unlimited liability should therefore be introduced as soon as possible (Govt. Bill 2000/01:43).</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit has included giving special consideration to how unlimited liability for operators of nuclear installations should be implemented in Swedish law and to propose the level up to which this liability must be covered by insurance or other financial security.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that as a general rule, unlimited third party liability with financial coverage up to 1 500 million euro shall be introduced for operators of nuclear installations in Sweden. The Inquiry proposes further that in cases where radiological damage arises outside Sweden the Government shall have the option of directing that the operator’s liability to compensate shall be limited to the amount of liability that applies in the other state with regard to Sweden (reciprocity). Under the Inquiry’s proposal, however, such a limitation of the liability to compensate can never be considered with regard to states that have no nuclear installations in their territory.</p>
<p>The following sections describe the level up to which liability must be covered by insurance and the other securities and systems of compensation that have been considered capable of financing the unlimited liability.</p>
<p>The first step towards funding liability: liability insurance</p>
<p>Under the revised Paris Convention the general rule is that an operator is obliged to have liability insurance or other acceptable financial security up to a sum of at least 700 million euro.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has been able to establish that at present there is a lack of insurance capacity in the private market above a level of 550 million euro. This liability insurance then also covers damage caused by acts of terror. It has been established that even if acts of terror are excluded, the insurance capacity cannot be increased. It follows from this that in order to reach the reference amount set by the Paris Convention, the operator is required to provide other acceptable security from 550 million euro up to at least 700 million euro.</p>
<p>However, for certain types of less risky installations and for carriage that in view of the nuclear material or nuclear waste in carriage is considered to involve less risk, the Inquiry considers it essential that the Government has the option of deciding that the amount to be covered by insurance or other financial security can be set lower than 700 million euro. A provision providing a basis for lower insurance levels in these cases has therefore been proposed in the new act. On the basis of the revised Paris Convention, however, the level of insurance must never be less than 80 million euro. The Inquiry’s proposals in this area mean that the state bears secondary liability for damage in the interval between the lower insurance level and 700 million euro.</p>
<p>Additional steps: Funding to supplement liability insurance and financial solutions that can guarantee the operator’s unlimited liability</p>
<p>One important element of the Inquiry’s task has been to consider what financial or legal solutions in the private market could principally serve to supplement liability insurance so as to achieve the highest possible levels of compensation.</p>
<p>In view of the level of liability insurance available, the Inquiry has proceeded on the assumption that there is a need for a system in which financial guarantees or public commitments provided subject to charges are used as a supplement to liability insurance from 550 million euro upwards.</p>
<p>As part of a legal solution the primary issue considered has been ‘piercing the corporate veil’. The Inquiry has arrived at the assessment that there is no legal possibility at present of securing additional assets alongside the operators’ share capital. In the opinion of the Inquiry, the principles concerning piercing the corporate veil that have developed in the case law do not imply that shareholders can become personally liable for the debts of the company in which they hold shares, or that the parent company can be forced to assume responsibility for the subsidiary’s liabilities in situations where the operator is unable to compensate any persons suffering damage after a radiological accident. In addition, the Inquiry has made the assessment that at present introducing such an arrangement exclusively in the area of nuclear liability would have too far-reaching implications.</p>
<p>The other financial solutions that the Inquiry has considered are security interests provided by guarantees or pledges, systems in which compensation funds are built up, risk-spreading by pooling arrangements or bilateral agreements and a system of ‘catastrophe bonds’. After examining these financing solutions in the private market, the Inquiry concludes that there are no working solutions that can be regarded as a satisfactory alternative to insurance. To be sure, an operator’s parent company may conceivably provide a guarantee for the interval between 550 and 700 million euro, but such a commitment is only a partial solution as it cannot realistically extend to substantially higher levels. The Inquiry has found, on the other hand, that there is a basis for financing subject to charges within the framework of the state guarantee model, which can supplement the level that is currently possible to insure.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Government be authorised by the Riksdag to shoulder the state with financial commitments in the area of nuclear liability, against charges that reflect the risk. In the Inquiry’s view, such a commitment should preferably take the form of a reinsurance commitment. The Inquiry makes the assessment that such financing of the operator’s liability may be warranted up to 1 200 million euro. The Inquiry has found this level of financing reasonable with reference to the deliberations that have taken place internationally, taking into account on the one hand the costs that may be associated with a radiological accident and on the other hand the risk of such an accident, as well as the total burden of charges and taxes on the nuclear energy industry. Another factor that the Inquiry has taken into account is that having an amount that is limited in advance increases the likelihood of finding insurance on the private market in future.</p>
<p>Above the level up to 1 200 million euro, which the Inquiry proposes the operator itself should finance as a consequence of the unlimited liability for compensation, the situation is that in the event of an accident with disastrous consequences the joint public responsibility provided for in the third stage of the Supplementary Convention kicks in for the interval between 1 200 and 1 500 million euro. This means that all States Parties to the Supplementary Convention contribute in proportion to each state’s energy production (based on nuclear technology) and to a lesser extent in proportion to their gross national product. If the damage after an accident should exceed even this level, the question may arise of claiming all the operators’ assets within the framework of their unlimited liability. There is no guarantee of how far these assets would suffice and for reasons just discussed it is not considered realistically possible to obtain any such guarantee. Just as is now the case, the Inquiry proposes in addition to this that the Riksdag be given the option of setting any supplementary compensation by special decision. The issue of such compensation may arise if an accident has such extremely harmful effects that even the level above the Supplementary Convention is passed and the total assets of the operator do not suffice or the state considers it would be inappropriate to claim these assets in a bankruptcy situation.</p>
<p>To sum up, the effect of the Inquiry’s proposals is therefore that an unlimited third party liability for an operator of a nuclear installation should in general be covered by insurance or other financial security up to 1 200 million euro.</p>
<p>Settlement of claims</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit has also included addressing issues associated with the settlement of claims in the event of a radiological accident.</p>
<p>After going through the provisions in current law that are relevant to the settlement of claims in the event of a radiological accident, the Inquiry notes that by and large, as in the legal systems of most other Convention States, there is a lack of special rules for how to settle claims after a serious radiological accident.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers this to be a deficiency and believes it would be preferable to have a system for settling claims worked out in advance. The coordination of compensation funds is particularly important, since as mentioned these come from different sources. The Inquiry notes that such coordination can be achieved either by the state assuming overall responsibility for the settlement of claims or by the responsibility for settlement of claims being tied to the insurer. Another possibility, in the opinion of the Inquiry, would be to let each of the actors making funds available for compensation responsible exclusively for the settlement of claims pertaining to their own funds and to supplement this arrangement by an obligation for them to consult one another. Such an obligation to consult could be regulated in legislation.</p>
<p>If the responsibility is tied to the state the Inquiry has found that a system in which a court handles the settlement of claims cannot be recommended. In the opinion of the Inquiry, a better alternative is to let a government agency or board take care of the settlement of claims. However, the Inquiry notes that there is no agency that is obvious for this purpose in advance and therefore does not find this solution very appropriate either.</p>
<p>Even though the Inquiry certainly considers that a claims settlement model involving an obligation to consult could be a fully conceivable solution, the Inquiry advocates an alternative model for settling claims in which the funds for paying compensation are consolidated in the Nordic Nuclear Insurers or some other direct insurer operating in the future. A natural way to arrange this consolidation of compensation funds is for the state to take on the role of reinsurer within the framework of the state guarantee model. The direct insurer is then responsible for the settlement of claims up to 1 200 million euro. With regard to the compensation out of joint public funds that may be paid above this limit and up to 1 500 million euro, an agreement must be made in advance between the insurer and the state, tying the settlement of claims for these compensation funds to the direct insurer as well, in return for a reasonable charge. The Inquiry has also considered supplementary legislation designed in the first place to gather the compensation funds together in case some new Swedish or foreign insurer other than the Nordic Nuclear Insurers were to emerge in future. However, the Inquiry has found that this is not a practicable way forward.</p>
<h2>Consequences and implementation of the Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s assessment is that the proposals in the report do not immediately entail any increased public costs. For individual operators, on the other hand, the proposals lead to increased costs with regard to insurance premiums and the state’s commitment subject to charges within the framework of the state guarantee model. These costs are expected to be modest compared with the large sums generated by energy production in this country and cannot be thought to have any more than a marginal impact on the competitiveness of the Swedish industry.</p>
<p>The new act that is proposed and other legislative amendments that arise are to enter into force on the day on which the 2004 Protocol amending the Paris Convention and the Supplementary Convention enters into force for Sweden. It is not now possible to establish when this will happen. The Government should therefore be authorised by the Riksdag to determine the date of entry-intoforce.</p>
