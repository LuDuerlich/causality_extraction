<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>The main remit of the Inquiry was to take a position on whether Sweden should accede to the 2001 Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment, which was signed in Cape Town, South Africa (the Cape Town Convention), and the associated Protocol on matters specific to aircraft equipment (the Aircraft Equipment Protocol). Following an analysis of the two international agreements, the Inquiry proposes in its report that Sweden should take measures as soon as possible to accede to the Convention and the Protocol. The main reason for the Inquiry’s proposal is the financial benefits that Swedish airlines stand to gain in the financing of new aircraft and aircraft engines. In light of the competitive market in which Swedish airlines operate and the fact that the Swedish aircraft fleet will need to be renewed over the coming years, financing terms are very important.</p>
<p>SAS, with its special position among Swedish airlines as partly owned by the Swedish State, is awaiting delivery of new aircraft from 2016 and onwards. The final financing terms will be determined at the time of delivery. If Sweden accedes to the Cape Town Convention and the Aircraft Equipment Protocol before the planned deliveries, SAS estimates that this would enable the company to make savings of between SEK 350 million and SEK 700 million over a ten year period, partly depending on the financing solutions used. Other Swedish airlines will, of course, also be able to make similar savings. The airline Malmö Aviation AB is also awaiting deliveries of new aircraft in the coming years and has estimated that Sweden’s accession could bring savings of between SEK 50 million and SEK 100 million over a ten year period.</p>
<p>The financial benefits to be gained from acceding to the Convention and the Protocol require the individual State to have made certain declarations specified by the OECD, known as qualifying  declarations. The Inquiry proposes that Sweden make these declarations in connection with its accession and choose the alternatives that maximise the scope of application of the Convention and the Protocol. This is a requirement in order for Sweden to be included on the OECD’s Cape Town List .</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that the Convention and the Protocol be given the status of Swedish law through the introduction of an act on international interests in mobile equipment (2015:XXX), and that certain legislative amendments be made to the Aviation Act, the Act on the Registration of Rights in Aircraft, the Bankruptcy Act and the Debt Enforcement Code. This proposal also means that the Swedish Register of Rights in Civil Aircraft, which is maintained by the Swedish Transport Agency, would be kept in its current form and would operate in parallel to the International Registry regulated in the Convention.</p>
<h2>Financing of aircraft – opportunities and challenges</h2>
<p>The Cape Town Convention and the Aircraft Equipment Protocol regulate how interests in certain types of mobile assets are to be dealt with in terms of asset-based financing. Aircraft, such as aeroplanes and helicopters, constitute a type of mobile asset which represent extremely high financial value and move across national borders. Moreover, they represent the most important asset in an extremely competitive industry that has been hit hard by the latest financial crisis, resulting in bankruptcies and reduced profitability. To be able to compete in the international market, airlines need to constantly update their aircraft fleets with more modern models, which are made from lighter materials and consume less fuel. The Swedish aircraft fleet is currently for the most part relatively old and Swedish airlines are facing major investments in the coming years as new aircraft must be acquired.</p>
<p>The financing of aircraft is mainly arranged through leasing and loans from banks and other credit institutions. With certain types of loans and credits, favourable terms can be obtained through state-supported guarantees, known as export credits. Secured bond financing, or Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (EETCs), is a financing model that is on the rise for aircraft but still, in practice mainly reserved for US airlines.</p>
<p>Common to the majority of types of financing of aircraft is that the financier acquires an interest in the aircraft. Because of its high financial value and long life, an aircraft is highly suited to this kind of asset-based financing. But the fact that aircraft move across national borders makes things difficult for financiers with interests in aircraft, as these interests are not regulated in the same way in different legal systems. This is primarily an issue of what measures the creditor, such as a lessor, can take if the debtor fails in fulfilling its obligations. Another important matter is what protection the creditor has in the event of insolvency proceedings against the debtor. Issues concerning the creditor’s rights in relation to other creditors are regulated through provisions of property law that differ between countries.</p>
<h2>The Swedish Register of Rights in Civil Aircraft</h2>
<p>In Swedish law, aircraft are treated as mobile assets. However, when aircraft are pledged as security, certain rules based on mortgaging of claims on aircraft apply. The mortgage is registered in the Swedish Register of Rights in Civil Aircraft, which is maintained by the Swedish Transport Agency.</p>
<p>When a mortgage is registered, a fee is due, as is stamp duty of one per cent of the amount of the mortgage. The relatively high stamp duty has been criticised by parties such as the Swedish Transport Agency, which advocates the abolition of the duty or, failing that, a reduction. The stamp duty may also be one of the reasons why the register is not used to any great extent by Swedish airlines. According to the Swedish Transport Agency, it contributes to increased ‘flagging out’, i.e. Swedish airlines choosing to register their aircraft in other countries so as to obtain more favourable terms.</p>
<p>In addition to mortgages, the aircraft register may also include acquisitions and rights of use that by virtue of their registration enjoy protection under property law. A title reservation cannot be registered, but a note of it can be made.</p>
<p>According to the airlines, one shortcoming of the Swedish register is that it is not possible to register aircraft engines or register mortgages on such assets separately.</p>
<h2>Need for common rules for interests in aircraft</h2>
<p>It is not the first time the question as to how different national rights and interests in aircraft should be dealt with internationally is raised. Some progress was made in 1948 through the adoption of the Convention on the International Recognition of Rights in Aircraft (henceforth called the ‘Geneva Convention’) , which Sweden ratified in 1955. In brief, the Geneva Convention states that the contracting States must recognise a number of rights and interests that may exist in aircraft, provided that these have come about in accordance with the law in the State in which the right or interest has been registered. The Geneva Convention is a choice of law convention and does not contain any material rules. For it to be applied, it is necessary for both the country in which the aircraft is registered and the country in which the right or interest is to be enforced to have acceded to the Convention.</p>
<p>Within the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT) efforts have been made since the end of the 1980s to draw up common material rules for interests in certain types of mobile assets that will simplify international financing and reduce the risks involved. This work resulted in 2001 in the Cape Town Convention, which entered into force on 1 March 2006, together with the Aircraft Equipment Protocol.</p>
<h2>The Cape Town Convention, the Aircraft Equipment Protocol and the International Registry</h2>
<p>In October 2014, 62 States had acceded to the Cape Town Convention and 56 States had acceded to the Aircraft Equipment Protocol. The number of States which have acceded is constantly growing and</p>
<p>Denmark, the United Kingdom and Australia are expected to accede within the coming years.</p>
<p>Both the Cape Town Convention and the Aircraft Equipment Protocol are what is known as mixed agreements, which means that they regulate certain legal areas in which the EU Member States have transferred their competence to the EU, such as applicable law issues and the recognition of judgements. In 2009 the EU acceded to the Convention and the Protocol and issued a declaration stating the areas in which the EU has competence. The EU’s accession does not bind EU Member States to the agreements, but it was a prerequisite for Member States to be able to accede.</p>
<p>The Cape Town Convention is unique in that it creates a completely new system based on the establishment of ‘international interests’ that must be recognised in all contracting States. Under the Convention, three different types of agreement can give rise to an international interest: 1. leasing agreements, in which the lessor grants a right of possession or control of an object to the lessee; 2. title reservation agreements, in which ownership does not pass to the buyer until fulfilment of the condition or conditions stated in the agreement; and 3. security agreements, by which a chargor grants or agrees to grant to a chargee an interest in or over an object to secure the performance of any existing or future obligation of the chargor or a third person.</p>
<p>International interests can be – but do not have to be – registered in the International Registry in which their internal order of priority can be established. The International Registry of Mobile Assets is placed in Dublin and registrations and searches in the registry can be made round the clock every day of the year.</p>
<p>In addition to questions of priority among various international interests, the Convention regulates what should happen if the debtor (i.e. a chargor under a security agreement, a conditional buyer under a title reservation agreement or a lessee under a leasing agreement) does not fulfil their obligations or if insolvency proceedings are initiated against the debtor. The measures offered to the creditor (i.e. a chargee under a security agreement, a conditional seller under a title reservation agreement or a lessor under a leasing agreement) by the Convention are intended to be powerful and effective and must, as far as possible, be taken without the involvement of a national court or authority.</p>
<p>The regulatory framework set up by the Convention is applicable for three types of mobile assets: aircraft objects (aeroplanes, helicopters and aircraft engines), railway rolling stock and space assets. For each type of property there is an associated protocol. The Convention is also designed in a way that leaves scope for new protocols on other types of assets. Of the three protocols, only the Aircraft Equipment Protocol has entered into force to date. The Convention and the Aircraft Equipment Protocol are intended for major financial transactions and therefore only aircraft and aircraft engines of a certain size/capacity are covered by the two agreements.</p>
<p>For the provisions of the Cape Town Convention to become applicable, it is necessary for the debtor in the agreement that stipulates the international interest to have its main operations in a country that has acceded to the Convention. Where the creditor is located is not important for the application of the Convention. In order for Swedish airlines to enjoy the benefits of the Convention and Protocol, it is therefore necessary for Sweden to accede to the two agreements.</p>
<h2>The system of declarations</h2>
<p>One reason for the success of the Cape Town Convention and the Aircraft Equipment Protocol is the system of declarations. The market for aircraft financing is global and the Cape Town Convention and the Aircraft Equipment Protocol are designed to be applicable in different legal systems. The intention is for as many countries as possible to accede, regardless of what their national legal system is like. To achieve this, the two agreements are based on a system of declarations that affect the applicability of the provisions.</p>
<p>Certain declarations are ‘opt-in’ declarations, which means that by giving a declaration, a certain provision becomes applicable. This often applies to provisions that increase the protection of creditors and make the proceedings in the event of the debtor’s insolvency or a breach of agreement quicker and more efficient. Other provisions in the Convention and the Aircraft Equipment Protocol are so fundamental that they require a declaration from a country for them not to apply (‘opt-out’ declarations).</p>
<p>The Cape Town Convention is not a convention that a State can simply choose whether to accede to or not. Upon accession, the State must decide which declarations to make, and in certain cases, also choose an alternative in the provision. The same applies to the Aircraft Equipment Protocol.</p>
<p>EU law prohibits Member States to make declarations concerning provisions in areas in which the EU has competence. The Inquiry has taken this into consideration in its proposal on declarations and has only proposed declarations that are compatible with EU law.</p>
<p>The accession document and the declarations are to be submitted to UNIDROIT, which in its capacity as depositary keeps a list of which declarations each country has made. The list is updated continuously and is available at the UNIDROIT website, where there is also a list of the States that have acceded.</p>
<h2>Qualifying declarations and the Cape Town List</h2>
<p>Which declarations a State chooses to make determines which financial benefits can be obtained from acceding to the Convention and the Protocol. The Cape Town Convention and the Aircraft Equipment Protocol were created to reduce the risks involved in financing aircraft objects and to ensure predictability in respect of what would happen in the event of insolvency and default. In the event of insolvency, it is important for the creditor to be able to quickly safeguard its interest without impediment by national legislation. The model for the insolvency rules in the Aircraft Equipment Protocol are the US insolvency rules in the Bankruptcy Code, which international financiers are very familiar with and which provide an effective way for the creditor to safeguard its interest in the event of insolvency.</p>
<p>Insolvency law differs from country to country. Therefore, the material insolvency provisions contained in the Protocol are such that the contracting State, by making certain declarations, can choose whether the provisions are to be applied or not. These declarations – whereby the creditor is given far-reaching opportunities to safeguard its interest in relation to other creditors – have been called ‘qualifying declarations’ by the OECD. A State that has acceded to the Convention and the Protocol and made all qualifying declarations can be included on the OECD’s Cape Town List. When a State is included on this list, airlines in that State have the opportunity to receive discounted financing through state-supported export credits (the Cape Town Discount).</p>
<h2>Consequences of accession</h2>
<p>If Sweden accedes to the Cape Town Convention and the Aircraft Equipment Protocol, Swedish airlines and financiers will be able to make use of the material rules that are currently applicable by law in almost 70 countries. This presupposes that the aircraft and aircraft engines are of the size and capacity necessary to be covered by the Aircraft Equipment Protocol. It would then also be possible to register interests in aircraft engines separately and there would be no need to pay stamp duty when an aircraft is provided as security. For smaller aircraft and aircraft engines that are too small to be covered by the Aircraft Equipment Protocol, the Swedish Register of Rights in Civil Aircraft will remain the only alternative and companies wishing to take out mortgages on such property will still be required to pay stamp duty.</p>
<p>Accession to the Convention, in combination with making the ‘right’ declarations, will most likely result in a number of other financial benefits for Swedish airlines. If Sweden makes the declarations the Inquiry proposes it make, the protection afforded to other types of rights and interests that arise through Swedish law will remain; for example, liens in favour of repairers for repairs to objects in their possession.</p>
<p>The system of registration in the International Registry is optional and Sweden’s accession would therefore not result in any obligations for Swedish companies. On the contrary, in each individual case the holder of the interest will be free to decide whether or not registration will be made with the International Registry. Sweden’s accession to the Cape Town Convention and the Aircraft</p>
<p>Equipment Protocol will not affect the existing Swedish Register of Rights in Civil Aircraft, which can continue to operate independently of the International Registry.</p>
<p>It will not cost the Swedish State anything to accede to the two agreements as the system is already in place and the International Registry is self-financed through fees paid by the users. However, there is reason to assume that central government would lose revenue in the form of stamp duty that is currently paid when mortgages are taken out on aircraft. But in the Inquiry’s view, this loss is far outweighed by the financial gains and other benefits that would be available to Swedish companies.</p>
<p>Sweden’s accession would also reduce the risk of Swedish airlines choosing to move parts of their operations or their aircraft to countries that have acceded so as to achieve certain financial benefits. Swedish airlines are currently experiencing a competitive disadvantage in relation to Norwegian airlines, for example, as Norway has acceded to the Convention and the Protocol. Sweden’s accession to the Cape Town Convention is also a prerequisite for our accession to other protocols to the Convention and our participation in international cooperation in this area.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>The Cape Town Convention and the Aircraft Equipment Protocol will enter into force on the first day of the month following the expiration of three months after Sweden has deposited the instrument of accession with UNIDROIT. Only when Sweden is bound by the Convention and the Protocol can the proposed act on international interests in mobile equipment (2015:XXX) enter into force. The act should therefore begin to apply on a date determined by the Government. No new Swedish system needs to be established or amended as a result of Sweden’s accession and no transitional pro- visions are deemed necessary.</p>
