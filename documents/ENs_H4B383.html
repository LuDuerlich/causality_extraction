<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Inquiry was instructed to analyse and submit proposals on the possible design of a tax on air travel. The tax aims to reduce the climate impact of aviation to help achieve the environmental quality objective Reduced climate impact . The remit included analysing the structure and design of models for levying aviation taxes in other EU Member States that have an aviation tax. In addition, the Inquiry analysed the situation in Member States that have had but abolished an aviation tax or that investigated such a tax but chose not to introduce it. A fundamental starting point for the remit has been that the tax must be compatible with EU law. Under the terms of reference, the Inquiry is to draw up the necessary legislative proposals. The remit did not include assessing the suitability of introducing a tax on air travel.</p>
<p>The Inquiry was also instructed to assess whether the ‘public authority fee in the field of aviation’, levied by the Swedish</p>
<p>Transport Agency, should be abolished. The remit also included describing other measures that could be effective in achieving the environmental quality objective Reduced climate impact . Finally, the remit included describing the consequences in various respects of introducing an aviation tax.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has interpreted the remit to mean that the tax is to be a tax on passenger transport. With this starting point, the Inquiry chose to draw up proposals on a specific tax based on passengers, similar to the aviation taxes found in Norway and Germany, for example.</p>
<h2>Tax on air travel</h2>
<p>The proposed tax on air travel has been designed as a tax on commercial flights. Accordingly, transport of passengers in military aircraft, state aircraft of other states, air ambulances, search and rescue aircraft, humanitarian aircraft, and customs and police aircraft will not be subject to the tax.</p>
<p>The proposal means that the aviation tax will be paid for passengers travelling from a Swedish airport in an aircraft approved for more than ten passengers. The aviation tax is not to be paid for children under the age of two; passengers who, as a result of technical disruption, weather conditions or any other unexpected event, have not reached their destination airport resulting in a new departure; flight staff who are in service during the flight; and transit and transfer passengers.</p>
<p>The airline that carries out the flight shall be liable to tax. The liability to pay the tax arises when the aircraft takes off from an airport in Sweden. Various levels of tax will be levied based on whether the passenger travels to a final destination in a country located</p>
<p>The proposed tax levels are based on an assessment of the climate impact of air travel and it is proposed they amount to SEK 80, SEK 280 and SEK 430 for the different distance categories. The tax levels are on par with similar taxes in other Member States and were determined accounting for the fact that aviation already pays for emission rights through the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). In determining the tax levels, no consideration was taken of the new global market-based measure scheme to limit the climate impact of international aviation that was adopted by the UN International Civil Aviation Organisation in October 2016. This is because the scheme will not be introduced with a voluntary phase until 2021 to then become mandatory in 2027, and because the price levels of the scheme’s offset credits are not known. When the scheme is in effect and the pricing of the offset credits are known, the levels of the aviation tax may need to be adjusted. The same applies if the prices in the EU ETS change considerably.</p>
<p>The procedural provisions in the Tax Procedures Act (2011:1244) shall be applicable to the aviation tax.</p>
<h2>Public authority fee in the field of aviation</h2>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the public authority fee should be abolished in connection with the introduction of a tax on air travel. If the public authority fee continues to be charged, however, the grounds for charging the fee, in the Inquiry’s view, should be regulated by law.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the tax on air travel</h2>
<p>The net income for central government finances of the proposed tax on air travel is expected to amount to SEK 1.75–1.78 billion per year.</p>
<p>It is expected that the tax will lead to a reduction of 3.6–4.8 per cent in the demand for air travel for domestic flights, 1.4–1.9 per cent for flights within Europe, and 1.5–2.1 per cent for flights outside of Europe. The total reduction of passengers departing from airports in Sweden is estimated to be 450 000–600 000 per year, compared to the situation of no tax being introduced. Even if a tax on air travel is introduced, the total number of passengers departing from airports in Sweden can be expected to rise. A tax on air travel is expected to reduce the increase in the number departing passengers, but the increase will nonetheless continue. Approximately 40 per cent of passengers can be expected to shift to other modes of transport, primarily cars, in cases when the distance allows for it. The greatest reduction in demand for air travel can be expected to take place when access to alternative means of travel is good. For this reason, it is likely the tax will not impact accessibility to</p>
<p>Sweden’s sparsely populated areas to any great extent, provided that the current selection of flight routes continues and is procured in the current volume. Since the impact on businesses and residents in</p>
<p>Sweden’s sparsely populated areas is deemed to be limited, if not marginal, no regionally-based exemption from the tax is proposed. The regional consequences that arise should be able to manage through procuring flight routes and state subsidies for regional airports.</p>
<p>The tax is expected to lead to limited but positive effects for the climate through reduced carbon dioxide emissions and a reduction of other aviation climate impacts. When increased emissions from other modes of transport are taken into account as a result of the modal shift from aviation, the net effect is expected to amount to a reduction of 0.08–0.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents.</p>
<p>The tax is expected to have only a minor impact on employment. The likely scenario is that job opportunities will primarily move between sectors and that certain jobs will disappear while others will be created. The impact on Sweden’s competitiveness, in both a national and international perspective, is also deemed to be limited.</p>
<p>However, a certain shift of passengers to airports close to the border in neighbouring countries, primarily the Öresund region, can be expected. This effect is expected to be minor since the flight selection differs between Malmö Airport (Sturup) and Copenhagen Airport, Kastrup. Competition and a certain shift of passengers may increase, however, on certain flight routes that the two airports have in common.</p>
<p>The tax will entail certain consequences for airlines. The administrative burden and handling costs for the airlines are expected to be minor. If the act does not come into force until just over one year from now, the airlines, which often sell air tickets well in advance of travel, will be able to adapt their systems and ticket prices to the new tax.</p>
<h2>Financial consequences for the Swedish Transport Agency if the public authority fee is abolished</h2>
<p>Abolishing the public authority fee in connection with introducing the tax will result in a fee revenue reduction of around SEK 120 million per year for the Swedish Transport Agency. Although this means a reduction in fees for airline operators paying the fee, it also means that the equivalent amount that is budgeted for fee-funded operations will no longer be covered by fee revenues.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>Under the proposal, the air travel tax act will enter into force on 1 January 2018.</p>
