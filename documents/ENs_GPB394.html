<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Terms of Reference of the Committee</h2>
<p>According to the Terms of Reference, the Committee shall analyse certain issues relating to the efficiency of the current system of rules to combat violations of the competition legislationâ€™s prohibition of collaboration between undertakings to restrain competition (anticompetitive co-operation) and abuse of dominant position. The Committee shall propose the changes to the system of rules that are considered justified.</p>
<p>The task of the Committee includes considering the need of and the preconditions for rules relating to</p>
<p>N  reduction of the competition damage penalty (konkurrensskadeavgift, also sometimes referred to as an administrative fine) for undertakings that reveal restraints to competition,</p>
<p>N  reinforcement of secrecy protection for information concerning cartel collaboration or other restraints to competition and concerning the person who provided the information about such circumstances,</p>
<p>N  limitation to or impediments for joint board representation in competing undertakings, and</p>
<p>N  the right of the winning party to indemnity for litigation costs.</p>
<p>The assignment also includes investigating</p>
<p>N  whether existing rules for the information obligation and secrecy satisfy the need of a purposeful exchange of information between the Swedish Competition Authority (Konkurrensverket) and competition authorities in other countries for efficient competition compliance work,</p>
<p>N  whether it is necessary and is suitable that the Swedish Competition Authority gathers information on behalf of a foreign competition authority,</p>
<p>N  whether experiences in the application of the law or other circumstances now give cause for another position to be adopted than hitherto on matters concerning the criminalisation of prohibition rules in the Competition Act and also as regards dissolution of concentrations of undertakings, and</p>
<p>N  whether the current rules provide small enterprises that are exposed for competition restraints by other undertakings sufficient opportunities to eliminate such violation.</p>
<p>The Committee shall deal with issues arising taking into account the EC law aspects.</p>
<p>The Committee, on 20 June 2001, submitted a separate Memorandum to Minister Ulrica Messing concerning investigation secrecy.</p>
<p>The Committee, on 4 October 2001, submitted a report (SOU 2001:74) dealing with issues concerning reduction of the competition damage penalty, criminalisation of violations of the competition legislation, secrecy for the identity of information providers (so-called whistle blowers), exchange of information between the Competition Authority and competition authorities in other countries, gathering of information on behalf of foreign competition authorities and indemnity for litigation costs.</p>
<p>This report deals with the remaining issues; i.e. questions related to dissolution of undertakings, joint board representation in competing undertakings and also the opportunities of small enterprises to take legal action on other enterprises in order to eliminate illegal competition restraints.</p>
<h2>Structure of the report</h2>
<p>Chapter 2  contains an outline description of the relevant substantive and procedural provisions of EC Law, Swedish law and the laws of other Member States in the EU, the USA and Canada. Chapter 3  deals with the issue of dissolution of undertakings. In the chapter an overview of studies of the consequences of court orders on dissolution is presented. The overview, which deals with experiences from the United States, has been prepared by Mattias Ganslandt, Ph.D., at the request of the Commission. In Chapter 4  the Committee deals with the issue of joint board representation in competing undertakings, against the background of i.a. a survey carried out at the request of the Commission, on the frequency of such representation. Arguments for and against such a representation are also discussed in the chapter. The application the Swedish Competition Act in favour of small enterprises is discussed in Chapter 5 .</p>
<h2>The deliberations of the Committee</h2>
<p>The Committee states that dissolution of undertakings may promote competition, e.g. through diminishing the market power of a dominant undertaking and facilitating the entering into the market of new competitors. The existence of large undertakings may also have positive effects, e.g. lower production costs.</p>
<p>The studies presented by Mattias Ganslandt in his report show that it is hard to anticipate the effects of an intervention (a decision on dissolution). It seems that there is no generally accepted economic theory answering the questions of when and how enterprises ought to be dissolved, especially if the aim of the dissolution is to adjust an existing concentration. What the Committee learned during its visit to the United States and Canada confirmed these observations. In the view of the Committee, what is now mentioned makes a strong argument against introducing legal rules on dissolution of enterprises. Without a valid economic theory as a basis, it is hardly possible to draft rules about the preconditions under which decisions on dissolution may be taken. Neither is it possible to prescribe the methods that may be chosen and how an intervention shall be arranged.</p>
<p>Objections concerning the right to possession based on the European Convention of Human Rights or on the Swedish Constitution do not imply an insurmountable obstacle to introduce rules making it possible to dissolve existing concentrations of enterprises. The Committee, though, means that nothing new has occurred that would lead to another conclusion than earlier has been drawn. The analysis of the experiences from the United States that has been presented confirms, on the contrary, that rules on dissolution should not be introduced.</p>
<p>The survey, carried out by the Committee, and a few other surveys, described in the report, show that joint board representation in competing enterprises is fairly rare, especiallywhen the market for providing electricity is disregarded. Consequently, the frequency of such representation consequently cannot be considered to be a major problem. When it comes to the three categories of joint representation with any frequency worth mentioning - members of the boards of small enterprises, members representing joint owners and members representing trade unions - there are opposite interests speaking against a rule prohibiting such representation. It might be added that a</p>
<p>prohibition of joint representation in competing undertakings would probably not be effective. It would not prevent persons representing competing companies from exchanging information in other situations. The Committee believes that there are not sufficient reasons for introducing explicit rules limiting or impeding joint board representation in competing undertakings.</p>
<p>As regards the possibilities of small enterprises to take legal action in application of the special entitlement of Section 23, second paragraph, of the Swedish Competition Act, the Committee concludes that the rule in question seems to have had only a limited significance. The special entitlement implies that, if the Swedish Competition Authority (Konkurrensverket) does not order an undertaking to terminate an infringement of any of the prohibitions in Section 6 or 19 of the Competition Act, the Market court may do so at the request of an undertaking that is affected by the infringement. A major reason for the fact that the special entitlement to take legal action is used so rarely is probably that an enterprise taking such an action has also to prove that an infringement has actually occurred. The difficulties to gather evidence and, not least, the costs involved, may imply insurmountable obstacles for, primarily, small enterprises, aiming to terminate an infringement.</p>
<p>An alternative to the current rules might be introducing a possibility for undertakings affected by the infringement to appeal against a negative decision of the Competition Authority. In the view of the Committee, such a regulation would probably not constitute a considerable improvement of the possibility for small enterprises to take legal action against infringements of the Competition Act.</p>
<p>It is not to be expected that associations of undertakings will assist members taking legal action according to Section 23, second paragraph, of the Competition Act.</p>
<p>The Committee discusses also whether a primary right to take legal action should be introduced but finds that such a rule would have only limited effect. The Committee also considers so-called discovery, to be found in Anglo-Saxon legal systems, and concludes that such a rule would probably make it easier for smaller, and also larger, undertakings to take legal action applying Section 23, second paragraph, of the Competition Act. At the same time, the Committee finds that such a procedure would also demand resources and would be hard for small undertakings to use. Furthermore, it would be a novelty in Swedish procedural law and the conditions of introducing such a measure should be analysed in a broader perspective than solely competition law. Therefore, the Committee is not prepared to propose such a solution.</p>
<p>The Committee also finds that a rule that lessens the burden of proof for enterprises taking legal action according to Section 23, second paragraph, of the Competition Act, could have implications in civil matters that would be hard to anticipate, e.g. when it comes to action for damages. Such rules, consequently, are not a suitable solution to the problem.</p>
<p>To summarise, the Committee does not propose any legislative measures to improve the possibility of small undertakings to eliminate violations of the prohibitions of the Competition Act.</p>
