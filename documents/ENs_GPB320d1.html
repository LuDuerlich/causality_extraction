<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The assignment</h2>
<p>The Environmental Advisory Council was instructed by the Government to ”contribute to the formulation of strategies for the development of ecologically sustainable industry and commerce by planning and engaging in a dialogue with certain business sectors concerning their efforts on behalf of sustainable development”. The assignment also included analysing obstacles and opportunities and presenting proposals for future strategies.</p>
<h2>Two dialogues: Building and Living and Tomorrow’s Grocery Market</h2>
<p>The Council engaged in dialogue with companies in two different social sectors. One dialogue focused on the building and property sector – which was named Building and Living. Twenty companies and three municipalities participated. The companies involved were real estate management companies, developers, contractors, architects and consultants, suppliers, banks and insurance companies, and telecommunications companies.</p>
<p>The second dialogue focused on the future grocery market – logistics and sales channels – and was named Tomorrow’s Grocery Market. The subjects discussed in the dialogue were the retail market, carriers, the food industry and the IT sector. Sixteen companies participated altogether.</p>
<p>A wide range of sectors were represented in the groups since we believe that tomorrow’s solutions will require cross sector cooperation.</p>
<p>The two dialogue projects may be seen as pilot projects, the aim of which was to explore approaches to sustainable development through forward-looking dialogue. Using a back-casting technique, the companies and municipalities in each of the dialogue projects formulated and agreed on a vision for sustainable development up to year 2025. Taking this vision as their starting-point, the groups formulated longand medium-term objectives and devised strategies for achieving the objectives and the vision.</p>
<p>Buildings in Sweden, including commercial buildings, are responsible for roughly half of the total environmental impact, and consequently there is great potential in the property sector for a major contribution to sustainable development. More efficient use of energy and resources, a good indoor environment and sound choices of materials were identified as the most important factors for such a development, and the Building and Living Group formulated objectives for these areas.</p>
<p>The objectives with regard to energy were to phase out the use of fossil energy sources for heating and hot water production by year 2025, to meet more than half the energy requirement from renewable sources by year 2015 and, with year 2000 as the base year, to reduce the use of purchased energy by 30 per cent by year 2025. As regards choices of materials, the objective in the construction sector was to phase out the use of hazardous metals and substances in accordance with the Government’s guidelines by year 2008. Another objective was to ensure that all new buildings and at least 30 per cent of the existing building stock are classified with respect to building-related health and environmental impacts by year 2010. By year 2025, waste volumes are to be reduced by 90 per cent compared with 1994.</p>
<p>In order to achieve these objectives, the group agreed to concentrate on studying up to eight areas: sustainable community development, use of the best available technology, research and development, procurement based on a life-cycle perspective and a holistic approach, coordination of the construction and management process, environmental classification of residential and commercial buildings, the marketing of environmental solutions, sustainable management.</p>
<p>Major structural changes are likely to take place in the grocery market if e-commerce becomes mainstream. This may increase the environmental impact, but it may also, if the logistics problem can be solved, yield environmental gains. New solutions for transport and distribution are urgently needed in order to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other substances.</p>
<p>The dialogue group Tomorrow’s Grocery Market focused on logistics, electronic commerce and the content and manufacture of products. The target for year 2025 is to halve transport volumes (transports in the food industry and the grocery market, as well as households’ shopping journeys) and to achieve a much higher percentage of renewable energy sources in the food production chain. The dialogue group also agreed on objectives for phasing out harmful substances.</p>
<p>The dialogue group identified five strategic action areas: collaboration between sectors and transport categories, research and development, development, procurement and introduction of new technology, whole companies geared to sustainable development, environmentally sounder products and dissemination of information about the environmental impact of products.</p>
<p>The dialogue group Tomorrow’s Grocery Market also plans to start a number of pilot projects, including projects on the coordination of transport systems in cities and rural areas, on intermodal transport, on e-commerce systems and on fuel and vehicle technologies.</p>
<p>The Environmental Advisory Council considers that the dialogues generated exciting visions of a more sustainable future, ambitious objectives and sound strategies towards achievement of the objectives. Both dialogue groups proposed that the project should be extended in order to deepen, develop and identify concrete measures in strategic action areas. In October 2000 the managing directors of the companies, the leading councillors of the participating municipalities and the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Industry, Employment and Communications agreed to prolong the two dialogues for another year to make it possible to reach agreement on concrete measures, including evaluation and development.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the two dialogues have great potential for initiating concrete and forceful efforts that can make a significant contribution to the realization of many of the 15 environmental quality objectives that have been adopted by the Parliament.</p>
<p>The two dialogue groups also identified a number of measures that should be taken by the Government to facilitate realization of these objectives. Both the project groups were in favour of tax differentiation to create incentives for improving environmental performance. The Government should review the energy tax system and devise a system that encourages the use of renewable energy sources. The Building and Living Group was in favour of differentiated taxes linked to the environmental classification of buildings. Both groups emphasized the role of the state as a model and the need for it to use its client role to pursue sustainable solutions. They both saw a need for resources for research and development, including training and experience feedback, as well as resources for disseminating information about the adopted strategies.</p>
<p>The results of the dialogues were presented in two separate reports: Think New, Think Sustainable! – Building and Managing Properties for the Future  and Think New, Think Sustainable! – The Future Convenience Goods Trade.</p>
<h2>Strategies for sustainable industry and commerce</h2>
<p>Great changes will be necessary in order to meet the environmental challenges of the future and realize sustainable development. New solutions will have to be found, especially as regards energy supply and transport. Business has a key role in these efforts.</p>
<p>Companies can undertake many measures that are both profitable and yield environmental gains. Costs can often be reduced by investing in more efficient use of resources and optimization of existing systems. There are plenty of examples of such investments with short payback periods. Environmentally sound product development can also be a profitable market strategy.</p>
<p>The business sector’s environmental activities have expanded rapidly in the last decade. More and more companies are examining the environmental impacts of their products and services and taking steps to reduce them. The driving forces in this connection</p>
<p>may be market demand, brand reinforcement, or the threat of new legislation. Companies may also want to guard against unpleasant surprises in the market in the event of their products being linked to adverse effects on health or the environment.</p>
<p>In our opinion, there is a need of technological breakthroughs, entirely new business concepts, new approaches and new kinds of partnerships in order to meet the challenges of the future. Few companies today are engaged in environment-oriented innovation. In order to create incentives for companies to find the solutions that will eventually be needed, but which must be developed today, it will be necessary, in our opinion, to strengthen the available policy instruments considerably.</p>
<p>We consider that the instruments proposed by the companies in the dialogue groups have great potential for contributing to realization of the environmental quality objectives and should be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>We also propose that the Government investigate the possibility of improving access to risk capital for environment-driven product development. We also support the proposal of the Commission on Environmental Technology to encourage exports of Swedish environmental technology and products and services that meet high environmental standards, as well as the proposals in the report Government Measures to Promote Design (SOU 2000:75) for further measures to encourage integration of environmental concerns into product development at an early stage.</p>
<p>In our opinion, dialogue and agreements can provide insights that are necessary to move change processes forward. We therefore consider that dialogue and agreements should be used as a worthwhile complement to other instruments. Our experience of the two dialogue projects so far is encouraging. However, a number of aspects must be taken into account in connection with dialogue and agreements with the business sector, including competition-neutrality, opportunities for small businesses, the risk of free riders and the need of transparency. We have proposed a number of guidelines to help raise awareness of these aspects. Several other countries have adopted legally binding frameworks for agreements between government and business. We have proposed that an inquiry be set up to review the need of such a legal framework. The inquiry should also investigate the status of agreements and obligations in relation to the requirements of the Environmental Code. We also see a need to evaluate the</p>
<p>agreements and undertakings that already exist in Sweden, as well as compliance with these agreements.</p>
<p>Sustainable development is a process that requires forwardlooking dialogue in all sectors and at all levels of society – local, regional and national. Such dialogue can be initiated by many parties, e.g. non-profit organizations, trade union organizations, trade bodies, municipalities and public authorities.</p>
<p>The Government has a responsibility for encouraging forwardlooking activities that can bridge the gap between the short time horizons that apply to most human activities and the long timeframes that apply to environmental changes. The Government should lead the way by setting up a coordinating body for crosssector dialogue with the business sector and inspiring other stakeholders to initiate dialogue about the future and supporting them in such efforts. In their role as catalysts the sectoral authorities have a special responsibility for initiating changes. We also propose that the Government take steps to engage in forwardlooking dialogues at the EU level.</p>
<p>Dialogue can help society to prepare for a transition to more sustainable products, services and systems that can meet citizens’ needs without consuming natural capital or jeopardizing the ecosystems on which we depend. In our view, the nations that take the lead in these endeavours will have a competitive edge in the future.</p>
