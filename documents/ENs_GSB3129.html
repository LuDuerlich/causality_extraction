<p>Our task</p>
<p>The Commission was assigned the task of analysing the need for improvements of the Swedish electricity and gas markets, and proposing such improvements. The assignment has also included certain questions relating to the function of the electricity market, such as analysing the formulation of specific requirements on the electricity supplier, investigating the need for a system of sanctions against network companies who do not comply with the provisions of the Swedish Electricity Act regarding switching suppliers, analysing possibilities for more effective supervision of connection fees, investigating the need for public procurement of an assigned supplier, judging the effects of eliminating a special provision regarding the small-scale electricity producers’ network tariff, and examining the question of tightening the requirement on distinguishing between electricity network operations and competitive operations. The Commission was also assigned the task of analysing questions related to a central plant register and an alternative electricity market model.</p>
<p>The electricity market</p>
<p>Electricity generation and the power market</p>
<p>Nord Pool</p>
<p>An analysis of the price trend on the Nord Pool exchange during 2002 and 2003 shows that there are natural explanations for the high price levels. The most significant factors have been low inflow to the reservoirs and low hydropower generation. The price increase during weeks 48 to 50 was, however, due rather to a change in the assessment of the water value on the part of the producers.</p>
<p>Electricity generation and the raw power market</p>
<p>In an aggregate assessment of electricity generation and the power markets, the Commission has found that these markets work relatively well. In the judgement of the Commission, price formation on Nord Pool is credible on the whole when it comes to both physical trading and financial trading. Liquidity on Nord Pool can be regarded as sufficient, even though a further strengthening would not be negative. Despite the increased loads of recent years, the market has functioned continuously and handled the situations that have arisen.</p>
<p>Confidence in Nord Pool as a common Nordic marketplace is important for the proper functioning of the market. Nord Pool’s operations embrace the Nordic market and thereby impact several countries with their own legislation and supervision. In order to strengthen supervision and thereby contribute towards preserving confidence in the function of Nord pool, the Commission proposes that a Nordic consultation group be formed. The purpose of the group is to harmonise the regulatory frameworks in the different Nordic countries and to provide a forum for the competent authorities to exchange experience.</p>
<p>Market structure</p>
<p>Swedish electricity production is concentrated to three players who have nearly 90 per cent of the market. The Commission has discussed the risks of such a market structure. The increased degree of concentration on the Swedish electricity market constitutes a barrier to the future development and function of the market. The Commission assumes that the relevant competition authorities will carefully review further concentration tendencies. Another prob– lem in this context is the limited ability of the companies to invest in new competitive electricity generation capacity.</p>
<p>Strengthening of the Nordic market</p>
<p>On the Nordic market, however, there are more major players with more evenly distributed market shares. This structure reduces the risks of the high level of concentration on the Swedish part of the market. In order to strengthen the Nordic market so that it works</p>
<p>like an integrated Nordic market during a greater portion of the time, the Commission believes that transmission capacity between the Nordic countries should be reinforced. In assessing which reinforcements of the network are most important, the costs resulting from shifting market boundaries should be taken into consideration in planning new connections. In order to further strengthen the Nordic market, Sweden should also work to bring about a harmonisation of the rules governing transmission links.</p>
<p>Role of the state as owner</p>
<p>The state owns Vattenfall, which is the biggest player on both the Swedish and Nordic markets. In its role as owner, the state should review the company’s alliances. In order to defend the credibility of the deregulated market, the state should refrain from controlling Vattenfall in a way that casts doubt on the company’s commercial considerations.</p>
<p>Network operations</p>
<p>The Commission has analysed the need for new sanctions against holders of network concessions. The inquiry conducted by the Commission suggests that the network companies’ handling of supplier switches has improved. Remaining problems mainly concern reading of electric meters. According to the inquiry, problems associated with switching of electricity supplier arose due to problems with information on customer and plant identity. Continued improvement of the compensation rules in the sector’s general delivery terms and conditions, introduction of a national standard for plant identities and personal and corporate identity numbers as customer identities, and a central plant register comprise, along with the expected increase in remote reading of electric meters, more suitable methods for improving how the network companies handle supplier switches and meter readings than a new system of sanctions.</p>
<p>The Commission finds that existing sanctions are effective instruments of supervision, but also that active supervision is important. In order to better enable the Swedish Energy Agency to exercise effective supervision, the Commission proposes that a re–</p>
<p>quest from the Swedish Energy Agency for information or do– cuments needed to exercise supervision should be heeded immediately. The Commission also proposes an extension of the deadline for the Swedish Energy Agency to issue orders if a network company has furnished incorrect or misleading information. The Commission makes no proposals regarding supervision of the terms of connection.</p>
<p>Electricity trading</p>
<p>The end customer market for electricity is largely national. The structural changes have been great. In 1996 there were 221 elect– ricity trading companies in Sweden, now there are 97. Above all, the number of municipally owned companies has declined, from 143 in 1996 to 56 in 2004.</p>
<p>Foreign ownership of electricity suppliers has increased. In 1996, approximately 10 per cent of the companies were foreign-owned, whereas about 40 per cent are today. The two big foreign-owned electricity suppliers are Sydkraft and Fortum.</p>
<p>In 1996, the three biggest companies had a market share of just over 30 per cent. Today the three biggest companies have about 50 per cent of the customers. If the customers of associated companies and companies with partnership agreements are included, their total market share is about 66 per cent.</p>
<p>Shorter time for switching supplier</p>
<p>According to Swedenergy’s latest survey in the autumn of 2004, a majority of the interview subjects had for the first time either switched supplier or renegotiated their contract (54 per cent).</p>
<p>A switch of electricity supplier usually takes place when the electricity user himself takes the initiative and decides to switch. An electricity user who changes address can keep his former supplier or switch to a new one. If the electricity user has not contacted an electricity supplier, which is the usual practice when changing address, the network owner must assign a supplier to the user.</p>
<p>Switching supplier should be a faster process. In the opinion of the Commission, the total application time should be able to be reduced from over two months today to about one month. This</p>
<p>should be achieved by e.g. reducing the application time to the network company. Furthermore, it is proposed that those who have been assigned a supplier should be given an opportunity to switch supplier at mid-month. This would reduce the switching time significantly for this group.</p>
<p>The Commission makes several other proposals regarding mandatory disclosure of information and meter reading times. The proposals are aimed at making it easier for the customers to switch electricity supplier.</p>
<p>Special permit for electricity supplier</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that a special permit should be required to operate as an electricity supplier. To get the permit, an applicant must comply with certain fundamental requirements regarding balance responsibility, access to the necessary IT systems, registration for energy taxation and registration for corporate taxation. Permits shall be granted by the Swedish Energy Agency and may be revoked if the permit holder fails significantly to comply with the requirements to obtain the permit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the holder of a permit to operate as an electricity supplier shall regularly furnish information to the Authority on the prices (for different types of deliveries, temporary price, variable price, fixed price for one year, etc.) and other terms applied by the supplier for his electricity deliveries.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the current provision in the Swedish Electricity Act regarding the obligation of Svenska Kraftnät to designate a balance provider for an electricity supplier who does not have one be revoked. The Commission proposes that the electricity supplier himself be obligated to secure a balance provider in order to retain his permit.</p>
<p>Separation between network operations and competitive operations</p>
<p>In its interim report, the Commission submitted a proposal for a stricter separation between network operations and electricity generation or trading. According to the proposal, a board member, managing director or company signatory in a network company</p>
<p>may not simultaneously serve in an equivalent management function in an electricity generation or trading company. A proposal referred to the Council on Legislation by the Government has the same content, but makes an exception for companies with fewer than 100,000 connected network customers.</p>
<p>An inquiry conducted on behalf of the Commission indicates close collaboration at the corporate management level between network and electricity trading operations. This is in conflict with the fundamental purpose of the Electricity Act’s requirement that these operations be kept separate. The Commission stresses that the reasons previously offered for a strict separation between network operations and electricity generation or trading are still just as urgent and relevant.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the network companies disclose figures in their annual reports on the costs for the board of directors and the managing director, and whether these individuals also have management functions in companies active within electricity generation or trading.</p>
<p>Effects for consumers</p>
<p>Most consumers were affected relatively little by the electricity market reform up until 1 November 1999. One expected result of the implementation of the electricity market reform was lower prices for those consumers who exercise their option to renegotiate agreements with their suppliers or switch supplier. The Commission observes that the price level has risen for all consumers regardless of form of agreement.</p>
<p>Several surveys have shown that electricity consumers have low confidence in the electricity industry. As a result, five electricity companies have appointed customer ombudsmen.</p>
<p>Several problems with the electricity market have been identified by competent authorities and organisations. One such problem is the lack of an annual settlement procedure. It appears that the causes of this problem are to be found in the lack of an annual meter reading, non-communication of the read-off values, or deficiencies in the companies’ invoicing systems. Typical problems when switching electricity supplier have been for example that the switch is made later than expected but the consumer is not informed that it has taken place and has not received any bills from the</p>
<p>new supplier. Another problem is that it takes too long to get a final bill from the previous electricity supplier after switching supplier. Information on power outages or related compensation matters appears to be a less serious problem.</p>
<p>The Tax Reduction Committee has proposed that liability for electricity tax be transferred from the electricity suppliers to the network companies. An important reason for such a change is that this would give the customer a clear electricity bill. The Commission therefore proposes that the proposal be given priority treatment.</p>
<p>Central plant register</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that a central plant register be established. Such a register has been proposed by various parties and the Commission has held extensive discussions on the benefits of such a register and how it could be designed. The proposed register is expected to benefit the consumers by streamlining the supplier switching process and bring about cost reductions for the concerned companies by reducing problems in conjunction with supplier switches.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the register should cover all exit points for electricity. The following data shall be registered for each exit point: unique plant identity, network company, electricity supplier, balance provider and customer identity. The plant identity shall consist of an EAN code and the customer identity shall consist of a personal or corporate identity number. Furnishing data to the register is compulsory for all network and electricity trading companies. The register will thereby cover all plants and all companies must update the data in the register as soon as they are changed for the individual plant. All data entry shall be handled by the network companies.</p>
<p>Certain conditions have to be fulfilled in order to obtain optimal benefit from a central plant register. For example, the same customer should have both a network agreement and an electricity supply agreement for a given plant. This makes it possible to match the customer data to each other and to the plant identity, which will reduce problems with incorrect information in conjunction with supplier switches.</p>
<p>The register contains data on network company, electricity trading company and balance provider. A prerequisite for the re– gister is that each player should only have access to information necessary for the company’s operations. In order to ensure market confidence in the register, it should be owned by the state and managed by Svenska Kraftnät. A customer is entitled to have access to the information associated with his personal or corporate identity number in the register.</p>
<p>Market supervision</p>
<p>The electricity market is under the supervision of a several regula– tory authorities, each with its own sphere of responsibility. These authorities include the Swedish Energy Agency, the Swedish Competition Authority, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, Svenska Kraftnät and the Swedish Consumer Agency. The number of competent authorities entails a risk of a fragmented supervision structure. The Commission therefore proposes that a more formalised collaboration be established via a consultation group between the Swedish Energy Agency, the Swedish Competition Authority and the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority. Such collaboration would contribute to streamlining the work of the authorities by permitting better utilisation of existing expertise in each organisation and by facilitating experience exchange and knowledge transfer between the competent authorities. The Nordic market perspective is important, so the Commission also proposes a Nordic consultation group.</p>
<p>The proposed consultation groups will contribute to the accumulation of expertise that is important for effective supervision. It is also important to ensure that the competent authorities are able to accumulate and maintain expertise, e.g. in the form of sectoral knowledge, that permits effective oversight of the electricity market.</p>
<p>The Nordic countries and Europe</p>
<p>The Commission has discussed the scope of the electricity market and arrived at the conclusion that there is no simple delimitation of the power market. The evidence shows that the electricity market is to be regarded as Nordic for a relatively large portion of the</p>
<p>time, but also that the electricity market is of smaller scope during other periods. In other words, the Nordic market already exists, but there is room for improvement. The Commission makes proposals in this respect, and also notes that extensive efforts are under way to strengthen integration of the Nordic market. This is taking place in cooperation between public authorities and trade organisations. Nordel, which is the Nordic transmission system operators’ joint organisation, is playing an important role in the development process.</p>
<p>With regard to the internal market for electricity, the exchange between the Nordic electricity market and the rest of Europe is currently being developed. However, a great deal remains to be done before the different national and regional markets have evolved into a common internal market for electricity. As far as the Nordic market is concerned, this evolution can primarily be expected to take place in contacts with nearby markets with existing transmission links, where Nordic players are already active. Within the EU, the Nordic market constitutes a relatively wellfunctioning regional market today.</p>
<p>Network charges for small-scale electricity producers</p>
<p>The owner of a small-scale electricity generating plant, i.e. a plant with a generating capacity of no more than 1,500 kW, is exempted from certain network charges. According to its terms of reference, the Commission was supposed to examine the consequences of abolishing this rule. In the light of evaluations of the energy certificate system, the Commission’s proposal is that the rule be abolished. Similarly, it is proposed that the Chapter 3 Section 14 of the Swedish Electricity Act be revoked, entailing that the cost of metering at the entry point from a small-scale power producer should not be charged to this producer.</p>
<p>The concerned generation plants are primarily wind power, hydropower and biofuel plants. It is the Commission’s judgement that the price level of energy certificates will in the future lie at a level that permits investments in new plants, even without exemption from the charge. The analysis also shows that special subsidies are not required for certain types of power, such as wind power. The system can largely be expected to function as intended. A prerequisite for this conclusion is that the energy certificate system be</p>
<p>extended after 2010 and that the system’s level of ambition and quotas be established with a long-term perspective.</p>
<p>An alternative electricity market model</p>
<p>The Commission has particularly analysed a radical re-organisation of the electricity market, as proposed in the public debate. The basic idea behind this alternative electricity market model is that the spot market prices should be fully absorbed by the consumers. Today’s network owners should assume responsibility for the physical deliveries of electricity to end customers, and the deliveries should always be made at the variable spot price.</p>
<p>The Commission notes that the model would conflict with the current Electricity Market Directive in a number of points, as well as with the EU’s general rules for the internal market and competition on this market. The Commission has nevertheless taken a closer look at the model. In summary, most factors indicate that the alternative model, if it were to be introduced in Sweden, would substantially harm competition on the electricity market. Further regulation and supervision would be required in order for the reorganised electricity market to function. Furthermore, the consumer would, at least initially, have to be much more active on the market and learn more about how the market works than is the case today.</p>
<p>The overall conclusion is that there is no reason to recommend a changeover to the proposed alternative electricity market, not even if this were possible without formal obstacles.</p>
<p>The natural gas market</p>
<p>Since 2000, the natural gas market has evolved from local monopolies to being partially open to competition. The big companies have had a tradition of dictating terms on the market, which to some extent lives on. In a number of cases the Commission has found that the small suppliers are reluctant to speak out for fear of damaging their relations with the company that sells natural gas to them. The competitive situation on the natural gas market can therefore be described as immature. There are a number of contributing reasons for this.</p>
<p>Infrastructure</p>
<p>Today nearly all gas for the Swedish market is produced in Denmark, but some gas is also imported from Germany. Since the introduction of natural gas in southern Sweden, the consumers have pointed out the disadvantages of having only one line of supply and large, dominant suppliers. The Government recently granted permission to build a supply pipeline from Germany to Sweden. Competition on the market will probably increase, since the option of buying natural gas from several sources will exert pressure on prices. This would promote the development of a functioning natural gas market.</p>
<p>Price formation</p>
<p>Pricing against the consumer’s alternative cost is not as strong as when natural gas was introduced in Sweden in 1985. Despite this it is a reasonable assumption that oil will continue to be of importance for pricing during the coming ten-year period.</p>
<p>Several natural gas companies with which the Commission has been in contact testify that another important factor for natural gas prices is negotiation options. The companies say that competition does not exist on the market and that there are therefore no alternative suppliers of natural gas. They refer e.g. to the design of the supply agreements, where the wholesalers have partitioned the market to obtain exclusive rights. The Commission assumes that the natural gas companies are aware of the new rules in the competition legislation and that the competition-restricting parts of the agreements will be renegotiated. Since new supply agreements have been signed and will be signed shortly, it is assumed that the Swedish Competition Authority will closely follow these developments.</p>
<p>Market structure</p>
<p>In 2004, Nova Naturgas sold its trading operation (Nova Supply) to the Danish company DONG. The acquisition was approved by the Swedish Competition Authority after an in-depth review in October of the same year. The Danish-Swedish wholesale market is highly concentrated and the Swedish Energy Agency has expressed</p>
<p>concern for the effects of further concentration of the market as a result of the acquisition. The Commission shares the Agency’s concern and assumes that the Swedish Competition Authority will follow the effects of the market concentration.</p>
<p>Since 2000 when the Swedish market was deregulated, only one final consumer has switched supplier so far. The natural gas market is characterised by long-term supply agreements, which means that entitled customers are preventing from switching supplier until their agreement has expired. Furthermore, the agreements expire at different times, which means that large volumes are not normally exposed to competition at once. This makes it more difficult for potential suppliers to become established and take market shares quickly. As regards the agreements that were recently signed for natural gas sales from 2005, it can be concluded that DONG has signed all contracts with the retailers.</p>
<p>Area concession</p>
<p>An area concession enables the companies to plan an expansion of the natural gas networks in an efficient manner. At the same time, the concession-granting authority can, by stipulating conditions in connection with the granting of a concession and determining what a suitable area for distribution of natural gas is, ensure that the interests of the public and the consumers are also taken into consideration in connection with an expansion. The Commission proposes that the exemption from the obligation to obtain a concession for natural gas pipelines situated along a metering and regulating station be abolished and that an area concession be introduced for natural gas networks. It should be possible to subject the area concession to conditions and revoke it if the concessionaire violates the Natural Gas Act or regulations or conditions issued pursuant to the Act. The area concession should apply for 25 years.</p>
<p>Market supervision</p>
<p>Supervision of compliance with the Natural Gas Act (2000:599) and of regulations or conditions issued pursuant to the Act is exer– cised by the Swedish Energy Agency. The description of the scope of supervision in the legislative history of the Natural Gas Act differs</p>
<p>from the description in the Swedish Energy Agency’s appropriations letter. This creates uncertainty as to what is covered by the authority’s supervision. Further, this makes it more difficult to assess the effectiveness of the supervision and consequently the need for additional resources. Since the opening of the market, the Swedish Energy Agency’s supervision has been of limited scope. The supervisory activity will increase during the coming year, however, and the Commission therefore proposes that the Go– vernment’s reporting requirement for the activity area “Super– vision according to the Natural Gas Act” should reflect the law– maker’s intentions for supervision of the natural gas market. If other activities are to be reported within the same activity area, this should be clearly stated. Further, the Commission proposes that goals established for the Swedish Energy Agency’s supervision should be developed and concretised by the Agency, including what is covered and how supervision should be exercised by the Agency. The supervision methods should be continuously evalu– ated by the supervisory authority.</p>
<p>Outlook for the future</p>
<p>A well-functioning competitive natural gas market has a dampening effect on the price level for natural gas. This does not exist today. The Commission has pointed out several factors that prevent the creation of an effective natural gas market. Limitations in capacity, agreements that bind customers for long periods of time, and vertical integration with insight into competitors’ pricing are examples of such factors. When a new regulatory framework enters into force and the market is opened further, however, the prospects of obtaining a functioning competitive market in Sweden should improve. In future legislation, more customers will become entitled to choose their supplier, at the same time as trading and trans– mission will be separated. Moreover, the advantages of transmis– sion for own account will disappear. The outlook for the future on the natural gas market is therefore brighter than it has been. A matter of concern for the future is, however, the fact that all new agreements have been signed with one and the same supplier.</p>
