<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Committee’s remit</h2>
<p>This part of the remit given to the Police Organisation Committee requires it to investigate the need for an independent body to scrutinise the activities of the police, including the activities of the Swedish Security Service (supplementary terms of reference 2012:13). If the Committee finds convincing reasons to establish such a body, it is to deliver a complete proposal for its organisation and activities.</p>
<p>The remit should be seen in the context of the proposals the Committee presented in its report SOU 2012:13, which called for the reorganisation of the National Police Board and the 21 police authorities into a single unified authority and the reorganisation of the Swedish Security Service into a separate authority, independent of the rest of the police service (see also SOU 2012:77 and SOU 2012:78).</p>
<h2>The Government’s definition of supervision</h2>
<p>The supplementary terms of reference state that when examining whether an independent body should be established with the task of conducting expert scrutiny of police activities, the Committee can draw on the Government communication ‘Clear, fair and effective supervision’ (2009/10:79; the ‘communication on supervision’) for guidance. This also applies when the Committee considers how such a body and its activities, if established, should be organised. The assessment made in the communication on supervision is that the term ‘supervision’ should primarily be used to refer to activities aimed at independent scrutiny to check that the object of supervision meets requirements that follow from laws and other binding regulations and that, when necessary, can lead to decisions on measures designed to ensure that the person or persons responsible for the object of supervision correct shortcomings. However, in the Government’s opinion, there is reason, in certain areas, to depart from assessments of how the term ‘supervision’ should be defined and used. Such departures can be made if they lead to more effective supervision in that specific area.</p>
<h2>Supervision is a concept with many meanings</h2>
<p>Over a long period, supervision has developed in different ways in the areas in which it is exercised. Presumably this is due to the varying legislation, approaches, practices and attitudes that have grown up in each area of activity. The tasks, function, organisation and mandate of different supervisory bodies also differ. In each case, supervision has been designed based on the need for scrutiny perceived by the Riksdag and the Government in a given area. In its report, the Committee describes how diverse the concept of supervision is (Chapter 3).</p>
<h2>Current scrutiny of police activities</h2>
<p>In its report, the Committee describes the current state scrutiny of police activities and gives a special account of the supervision of the police currently exercised (Chapter 6).</p>
<p>The Parliamentary Ombudsmen (JO) and the Office of the Chancellor of Justice (JK) exercise extraordinary supervision of the police. The Swedish National Audit Office is an important component of the Riksdag’s parliamentary control which, in recent years, has conducted efficiency audits of the judicial system in a number of areas. The Data Inspection Board exercises supervision of the way personal data is processed by the police. By means of inspections and other forms of examination, the Swedish Commission on Security and Integrity Protection exercises supervision of law enforcement agencies’ use of secret coercive measures and qualified assumed identities and of activities associated to such use, and of the way personal data is processed by the police. The Swedish Work Environment Authority is tasked with exercising supervision of the police regarding work environment and working hours.</p>
<p>The National Police Board is currently the central administrative authority of the police services and, under Section 7 of the Police Act (1984:387), has supervisory powers over them. The scope of supervision by the National Police Board is specified in Section 2 a of the Ordinance with instructions for the National Police Board (1989:773). In the above-mentioned provision, the Government assigns the Board duties that extend beyond the term ‘supervision’ as defined in the communication on supervision. For the police, the term ‘supervision’ has come to include inspection, follow-up (financial follow-up and operational follow-up), evaluation and internal auditing. In addition, the local police boards and the county police authorities also have supervisory duties.</p>
<h2>Need for supervision of police activities</h2>
<p>The assessment of the Committee is that there is a need to exercise supervision of the police. For the police to be able to do its job efficiently, it must have the confidence of the people. This is important not least so that the police can fulfil its task of creating a sense of security. Supervision of police services strengthens the public’s confidence that police activities are conducted in a correct manner. It is important that, in addition to the extraordinary supervision of the police exercised by the Parliamentary Ombudsmen and the Office of the Chancellor of Justice, it is also possible to exercise more regular and ongoing scrutiny of police services.</p>
<p>The distinctive nature of police activities justifies exercising thorough supervision of police services. These activities include far-reaching powers to intervene in people’s lives and it is therefore important that measures taken by the police can later be examined. The lack of a right to review certain police decisions can, to a certain extent, be offset by the opportunity for ex post control and scrutiny of police activities. Furthermore, exercising supervision of police services provides an additional opportunity for the Riksdag and the Government to check that police activities are conducted in a correct manner.</p>
<h2>An independent authority to exercise supervision of the new police organisation</h2>
<p>The Committee’s proposal on a new police organisation means that the National Police Board will no longer be the central administrative body for the police (SOU 2012:13). It also means that – in addition to the supervision conducted by the extraordinary supervision bodies and the Data Inspection Board, the Swedish Commission on Security and Integrity Protection and the Swedish Work Environment Authority – regular supervision of police activities of a more independent nature will no longer be conducted. There are alternative ways of guaranteeing that compliance with regulations for police activities can continue to be scrutinised in a manner that at least corresponds to the way the National Police Board currently inspects police activities. One alternative is to allow the new authorities the Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Security Service to conduct their own supervision of their individual activities. Another alternative is that an independent body exercises regular supervision of police activities.</p>
<p>The assessment of the Committee is that supervision of the new police organisation is best exercised by an authority that is independent of the police. In the communication on supervision, the Government states that the term ‘supervision’ should primarily be used to refer to activities aimed at independent scrutiny. In general, the further away a supervisory body is in organisational terms from the object under supervision, the greater the public’s confidence in the supervision. Organisational separation between the handling of supervisory issues and regular police activities creates the basis for credible police activities and credible supervisory activities.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Committee proposes that the scrutiny body be an authority independent of the police.</p>
<h2>Scrutiny of compliance with regulations</h2>
<p>Supervision that checks that police action is supported by law or other binding regulations will cover those areas of police activities that are most important to scrutinise. In its report, the Committee takes stock – based on the provisions in Sections 2 and 2 a of the</p>
<p>Police Act – of the areas of police activities in which supervision can be exercised. There is great scope to exercise supervision of activities such as those that will be conducted by the new Swedish Police Authority and Swedish Security Service.</p>
<p>The supervisory authority should primarily scrutinise compliance with regulations in activities and matters that can be presumed to reflect general conditions, which means that supervision normally should not result in statements concerning individual cases.</p>
<p>At present, there is no reason to depart from the Government’s definition of supervision – scrutiny of compliance with regulations – and bring up other supervisory duties related to police activities.</p>
<h2>The task, responsibilities and powers of the supervisory authority</h2>
<p>The supervisory authority should regularly analyse the areas of police activities that, based on the duties of the police specified in Sections 2 and 2 a of the Police Act, should be scrutinised from the perspective of regulatory compliance. The Committee proposes that the supervisory authority itself plan and initiate scrutiny of police activities. The supervisory authority will be required to draw up a supervision plan for its activities. As regards police activities, it may be of particular interest to use risk assessments as the basis for planning supervision.</p>
<p>The supervisory authority’s duties are to be based on ex post checks of activities. Decisions by the Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Security Service are not to be scrutinised if the decisions can be examined in substance by a court of law.</p>
<p>Supervision is to refer to the new authorities the Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Security Service, and not individual officials. There are insufficient grounds for placing special investigations within the Swedish Police Authority under supervision by the supervisory authority. The question of whether the supervisory authority is to scrutinise activities at the National Laboratory of Forensic Science will be deferred until the Government Offices has completed its preparation of the issue concerning the Laboratory’s role in the future police organisation.</p>
<p>The supervisory authority is not to have the right to issue regulations.</p>
<p>Nor is it to have the power to impose sanctions for any errors that are discovered when conducting supervision of regulatory compliance in police activities. On the other hand, the supervisory authority is to have the opportunity to direct criticism towards the scrutinised activity by issuing statements.</p>
<p>The scrutinised authority is to be informed of the results of the supervisory authority’s scrutiny and be provided with its statements.</p>
<h2>Combine supervisory duties in the police area</h2>
<p>So as not to further increase the number of examining authorities in the central government sector which, in its work, the Committee has considered to be surprisingly many, it is proposed that the new duties of supervising the police be placed in the same authority structure as the activity currently carried out by the existing supervisory body, the Swedish Commission on Security and Integrity Protection. Even if the proposed supervision of the police services will focus clearly on scrutiny of day-to-day police activities, it may be possible to bring the current duties of the Swedish Commission on Security and Integrity Protection into the ambit of one and the same authority. If the new duties of supervising the police and the Commission’s current duties are placed in the same organisation, a form of board-based decision-making procedure should continue to be used for at least some of the</p>
<p>Commission’s supervisory business.</p>
<h2>Organisational considerations</h2>
<p>The supervisory authority will be governed by a head of authority directly answerable to the Government, and will include special decision-making bodies. The actual commission within the Swedish Commission on Security and Integrity Protection will continue to exist as a special decision-making body within the supervisory authority. The Commission’s duties will, in addition, be extended to include certain duties relating to the regular supervision of the police organisation for which the new supervisory authority will be responsible. The Records Checks Delegation and the Protective Security Registration Delegation will be special decision-making bodies within the new supervisory authority, just as they are now special decision-making bodies under the Commission.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that apart from matters relating to the special decision-making bodies, the supervisory authority itself will be empowered to decide on its internal organisation. The authority will be called the Police Supervisory Authority and will be based in the Stockholm area.</p>
<h2>Consequences for the prosecution authorities</h2>
<p>The Committee’s terms of reference include instructions to analyse the consequences for the prosecution authorities of establishing an independent body for scrutinising the police. In a broader perspective, this is a matter of establishing the place of the supervisory authority’s duties with respect to the legal community. The new supervision of the police will introduce a new actor that may operate vis-à-vis the arena of the judicial chain: an authority that is independent of the police and whose role is to exercise ex post scrutiny of police activities, but not to express any opinion on the conduct of prosecution activities.</p>
<p>The activities of the Police Supervisory Authority will have consequences for the prosecution authorities. It cannot be ruled out that increased independent scrutiny of criminal investigations conducted by the police may to some extent mean that the supervisory authority will expose the independent role of prosecutors in investigating crime. However, the consequences are not of a nature that should preclude establishing a body for scrutinising the extensive activities of the police or that would necessitate exempting criminal investigations from the scope of the proposed supervisory authority’s scrutiny.</p>
<p>Regulations should be put in place directing that the authority is to cooperate with the prosecution authorities in supervisory matters.</p>
<p>The new supervision of criminal investigations conducted by the police must be clearly defined, with reference to the limits of the legal supervision exercised by the prosecution authorities.</p>
<h2>Demarcation lines with respect to other authorities</h2>
<p>In its report, the Committee analyses the demarcation issues that may arise between the supervisory authority and the other scrutiny bodies that supervise the police.</p>
<p>Little risk is seen that problems of demarcation might arise between the Office of the Chancellor of Justice or Parliamentary Ombudsmen and an independent supervisory authority for the police. In the event of matters that might call for supervisory action by either the Office of the Chancellor of Justice or the Parliamentary Ombudsmen, and the Police Supervisory Authority, it should be possible to resolve the issue of responsibility by means of regular contacts between the different bodies.</p>
<p>The focus of the supervisory authority will differ from that of the scrutiny exercised by the Swedish National Audit Office. Some minor overlap between the activities may arise if a particular area of the police services becomes the object of scrutiny – though focusing on different aspects – of both the Swedish National Audit Office and the supervisory authority. However, coordination between the two authorities should be able to deal with any such overlap.</p>
<p>It is too early to assess whether the current overlapping supervision of personal data processing by the police – which is conducted by both the Swedish Commission on Security and Integrity Protection and the Data Inspection Board – should in future be conducted differently than today.</p>
<p>Collaboration is essential to clarify and make it possible to specify the various purposes, questions, duties and responsibilities of the different supervisory bodies in scrutinising police activities. It should therefore be clearly laid down that the supervisory authority is to cooperate and collaborate with other supervisory authorities that conduct supervision or scrutiny in the police area.</p>
<h2>Secrecy and the access of the supervisory authority to information</h2>
<p>Fully adequate secrecy protection for data can be achieved in the activities of the supervisory authority by applying existing regulations in the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400). Protecting the secrecy of information not covered by secrecy regulations in the activities being scrutinised is unlikely to be necessary.</p>
<p>A secrecy-override provision will be introduced, explicitly requiring the Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Security Service to make information available to the Police Supervisory Authority. At the request of the supervisory authority, these authorities must provide information and make documents and other material available. Other authorities that are in a position to provide information or in possession of documents and other material relating to the activities being scrutinised will also be obliged to make information, documents and other material available at the request of the supervisory authority.</p>
<h2>Regulation of the activities of the supervisory authority</h2>
<p>The Committee proposes a new act – the act on supervision of police activities and certain other law enforcement activities (xxxx:xx). The act will contain regulations on the conditions governing the new supervision of the police. In addition, the Committee delivers a proposal on instructions for the activities of the supervisory authority.</p>
<h2>Skills base, size, costs and funding</h2>
<p>The supervisory authority needs well-qualified staff with a background in and experience of police activities, but also staff with good knowledge of supervision and skills in law, statistics, political science and other areas. The authority also needs to keep the skills base now possessed by the Swedish Commission on Security and Integrity Protection. The assessment of the Committee is that activities at the supervisory authority should be built up gradually. As a rough guide, after two years it should have at least thirty fullyear equivalent positions, including the staff currently employed by the Swedish Commission on Security and Integrity Protection. In operational terms, there are grounds for building up a larger organisation over time. The Police Supervisory Authority will be financed by tax revenues.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the Committee’s proposals</h2>
<p>The supervision of compliance with regulations that the Police Supervisory Authority is to exercise will put the Government, and ultimately citizens, in a better position to check that police activities comply with regulations and laws. The scrutiny exercised by the authority can also contribute to greater consistency in the application of the law throughout the police services’ broad and geographically diffuse activities. The proposed scrutiny will provide feedback to politicians and legislators on how the regulations affecting the police are working and whether they are being applied in practice as intended. Furthermore, it will provide data for the regional police councils and the Swedish Police Authority and Swedish Security Service advisory councils. The proposed new duties of the special decision-making body the Swedish Commission on Security and Integrity Protection will create democratic influence over the supervisory authority’s activities.</p>
<p>The Government Offices need to analyse the new opportunities for management, governance and follow-up of police activities offered by the supervisory authority. For example, the question arises of how the Government Offices should treat the results of scrutiny presented by the authority.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>The supervisory authority should begin its activities on 1 January 2015. An organising committee will be set up promptly to take necessary measures to prepare the establishment of the authority.</p>
