<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>Background</p>
<p>District heating has expanded greatly in recent years and is the dominant form of heating for multi-family apartment buildings and commercial premises in our urban areas. The number of detached houses heated by district heating is also increasing steadily. This is a positive trend, since district heating is an efficient, reliable, economical and flexible solution offering options for utilising available biofuels, waste fuels and industrial waste heat. District heating also has an important role to play in Sweden’s energy and climate policy by allowing the possibility of simultaneous production of electricity and heat in highly efficient cogeneration units (combined heat and power, CHP) and thereby a much more efficient utilisation of fuels.</p>
<p>The assignment</p>
<p>Part of my assignment has been to determine what technical and other barriers exist to third-party access to the district heating networks. Here included is to analyse whether it is appropriate to introduce third party access on the district heating market and, if it is deemed appropriate, to propose rules for this, as well as to analyse the consequences for society, business enterprises and the environment of third party access. Furthermore my assignment includes, evaluating the need for a concession obligation for building and using pipes utilised for the transport of district heating, based on the regulatory framework that exists today in the Pipeline Act. Finally, my assignment has involved submitting proposals for how the Directive 2004/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the promotion of cogeneration based on a useful heat demand in the internal energy market should</p>
<p>be implemented in Sweden. This entails analysing the potential for district heating in Sweden, taking into account the effects of the change in the taxation of cogeneration of 1 January 2004, the introduction of the energy certificate system on 1 May 2003, the system for emission rights trading, and the economic potential for further expansion of the district heating networks. I have furthermore been instructed to evaluate current legislation and regulations concerning authorisation procedures and propose how the Directive’s article concerning guarantees of origin for electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration is to be implemented.</p>
<p>Goals of the proposals</p>
<p>The goals of the proposals made in this final report are to improve the customers’ situation so that they can feel more secure in their contractual relationship with the district heating companies. Another goal of the proposals is to promote efficient energy management in various ways.</p>
<p>A limited exemption from the municipal siting principle</p>
<p>In chapter 3 I propose a limited exemption from the municipal siting principle in the Local Government Act. Much district heating is provided today through municipal companies. District heating is very important in meeting the goals of Sweden’s energy policy. The municipal siting principle basically entails that a municipal activity must be linked to the municipality’s own territory or its inhabitants in order to be regarded as legal. Even considering the exemptions that exist from this principle and the possibility of different existing forms of cooperation between municipalities, the principle can in my opinion make it more difficult to integrate district heating networks between nearby localities, impeding the expansion of municipal district heating. I therefore consider it advisable to propose in the District Heating Act an exemption from the siting principle. The exemption entails that the district heating operation can be conducted beyond the municipal boundaries. However, an exemption will only be considered if the municipality’s purpose is to achieve efficiency in the district heating operation. The district heating operation may</p>
<p>furthermore only be conducted in the geographic vicinity of the company’s district heating operation in its own municipality.</p>
<p>Negotiation for access to district heating system</p>
<p>One task I have been assigned is to judge whether it is possible to increase competition on the district heating market by, for example, introducing access for a third party to deliver heating or cooling to an end customer in another party’s network. The question of third-party access is dealt with in chapter 4. I do not believe that a statutory right to third-party access (TPA) to district heating networks should be introduced. In my opinion, neither promotion of competition, consumer benefit or environmental considerations can be cited as valid reasons for introducing third-party access.</p>
<p>There are, however, situations when it may be justified to open up the network to a new actor. One such situation is when it is possible and therefore advantageous for the district heating network to accept industrial waste heat, heat from refuse incineration, or heat from large customers connected to the network.</p>
<p>In order to encourage the utilization of such surplus heat, rules should be introduced requiring the owner of the district heating network to negotiate with a potential supplier of heat. Such an obligation entails that the owner of the district heating network must, prior to a negotiation, carry out a thorough analysis of the advisability of allowing another producer access to the network. I furthermore propose that if both parties consider that they need help to come to an agreement, a newly-established District Heating Board will, for a fee, assist in mediating.</p>
<p>Interim national reference values for high-efficiency cogeneration</p>
<p>According to the Directive 2004/8/EC, in order to be regarded as high-efficiency cogeneration, the combined generation scheme must be more energy-efficient than the separate production of heat and electricity. The rule given in the directive is that energy savings of more than ten per cent are required for cogeneration to qualify as high-efficiency cogeneration. In order to calculate the efficiency of coneneration in individual units, something is needed to</p>
<p>compare with, i.e. reference values for efficiency in the separate production of heat and electricity. These values have not yet been established by the Commission. Pending the issuance of harmonised efficiency reference values by the Commission, I propose Swedish national interim values (chapter 5).</p>
<p>Guarantees of origin of electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration</p>
<p>In this respect my assignment has been to submit proposals for how article 5 of the Directive 2004/8/EC regarding guarantees of origin of electricity produced by high-efficiency cogeneration is to be implemented in Swedish legislation. In accordance with the aforementioned article, I propose in chapter 6 that a law be passed concerning guarantees of origin of electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration. Producers of such electricity are entitled on request to obtain a guarantee of origin in the form of a document from the guarantee authority, which I propose should be Svenska Kraftnät, which is the company that administers and runs the national electrical grid. The document states that a given quantity of electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration has been produced in the producer’s plant. The Swedish Energy Agency shall be responsible for supervision of the enforcement of the law.</p>
<p>The Swedish potential for high-efficiency cogeneration</p>
<p>My assignment includes analysing the Swedish potential for highefficiency cogeneration according to what is set forth in article 6 of the Directive 2004/8/EC. I have therefore commissioned Öhrlings PricewaterhouseCoopers (ÖPwC) to conduct a study of the economic potential for cogeneration in Sweden. I present as comparison the results of other studies and reports on Sweden’s cogeneration potential.</p>
<p>The results show that the Swedish energy tax system and other policy instruments have a great influence on the country’s district heating systems. Energy taxation, as it appeared prior to 1 January 2004, restricted the utilization of existing fossil-fired cogeneration and blocked the expansion of natural gas-fired cogeneration. Following changes in Sweden’s district heating taxation on 1 January</p>
<p>2004, more electricity and heat are now produced than before in existing cogeneration units, and this has also influenced the willingness to invest. Another policy instrument that promotes electricity production but only in biofuel-fired cogeneration units is the energy certificates that were introduced on 1 May 2003.</p>
<p>The results of the ÖPwC report showed a cogeneration potential that is lower than has been calculated in other relevant studies. An overview of the various assessments is presented in the table below.</p>
<p>Table 1 Different assessments of Cogeneration Potential</p>
<p>Note: ÖPwC figures shows net electricity production.</p>
<p>Part of the explanation for the differing figures may be differences in the definition of “potential” and what it entails, but also differences in the fundamental conditions and policy instruments assumed in future scenarios. The results show that the uncertainty in the assumptions that are associated with investments in cogeneration units is a fundamental obstacle in achieving the technical potential. These uncertainties pertain to possible changes in energy taxation, environmental requirements and charges, regulations, costs, the trend on the electricity market, etc., which can affect the profitability of an investment.</p>
<p>Energy taxes and other policy instruments are thus of great importance in calculating the Swedish potential for high-efficiency cogeneration, since they influence the economic assumptions and</p>
<p>how much of the technical potential can be regarded as economically feasible.</p>
<p>Evaluation of current legislative and regulatory framework regarding authorisation procedures etc. of importance for promotion of cogeneration</p>
<p>According to article 9 of the Directive 2004/8/EC, I am supposed to evaluate the existing legislative and regulatory framework with regard to authorisation procedures etc. with a view towards encouraging the design of cogeneration units to optimise heat output, reducing legislative barriers and streamlining and expediting the authorisation procedures. Such an evaluation is made in chapter 8. I conclude that the Environmental Code, and in particular the general rules of consideration, is the legislation that has a bearing on the optimal design of cogeneration units as far as authorisation procedures are concerned. Although exemplary practice etc. is as yet lacking, the rules are a good tool for influencing and steering the design of cogeneration units in the direction intended in the Directive 2004/8/EC. If the future should show that these rules counteract such optimal design, they will have to be reconsidered. However, such reconsideration should also include other types of activities than cogeneration units and lies beyond the scope of my assignment.</p>
<p>Both the Environmental Code’s rules regarding permits and the Planning and Building Act’s rules regarding building permits are justified and entail an objective examination of an application. The Planning and Building Act’s rules concerning planning are also justified. The rules fill an important function, and are aimed at encouraging good sitings and limiting disturbances. The rules make it possible to obtain an integrated assessment and to strike a good balance between conflicting interests. Examining permit applications for cogeneration units separately under special legislation is not appropriate.</p>
<p>The authorisation procedure does have certain shortcomings, however, and is therefore currently being studied by the Environmental Code Committee and the Planning and Building Act Committee. A number of proposals for improvements have been presented. Some of the proposals have been presented in a Government Bill and the rest are currently being considered by the</p>
<p>Ministry of Sustainable Development. I find no reason to make any additional proposals.</p>
<p>Concession obligation for district heating pipes</p>
<p>The Pipeline Act was passed to enable society to make an integrated assessment of various interests with regard to e.g. conservation and environmental protection as well as with regard to planning rules when someone wants to lay or use important or long pipes for the transport of district heating, for example. Despite the extent of district heating, however, only two pipes have been subjected to Government examination.</p>
<p>District heating is already a relatively extensive form of heating today. It is still expanding but is nevertheless, owing to its capitalintensive nature, concentrated in areas with large heating needs where the economies of scale enable the district heating operation to bear the large costs of production units and district heating pipes. District heating operations and their associated distribution networks therefore tend to be located in conurbations. There are few extensive piping systems that connect two or more non-concessionary distribution networks. It also seems likely that the prospects of such piping systems being built in the future will be limited to the country’s three major metropolitan areas, considering for example the relationship between costs and heating needs. I therefore find it unlikely that any district heating pipes that will be laid in the future will encroach on other interests to any substantial extent. This will at least not occur to such a degree that these pipes will require special regulatory examination. A concession should therefore not be required for building and using a district heating pipe. I therefore propose that district heating pipes be exempted from the purview of the Pipeline Act.</p>
<p>A new District Heating Act</p>
<p>The different measures for improved customer protection which I proposed in my previous report and the measure which I now propose to promote better energy management should for the most part be regulated by law. In view of the scope of the legislation and</p>
<p>the fact that it pertains to a particular phenomenon, the provisions are gathered in a special District Heating Act.</p>
<p>The Act contains certain provisions concerning requirements on the operators to keep separate (unbundled) accounts for district heating and cooling operations, to keep such business operations legally and functionally separated from electricity market operations, and to negotiate with customers regarding e.g. prices and with other heat suppliers regarding access to the operator’s distribution networks.</p>
<p>The District Heating Act also contains fundamental requirements on provision of information to customers and others. In a contractual relationship, this information should be furnished as far as possible by the contract signed between the parties. In addition, the party that conducts district heating or cooling operations shall publish the normal prices that they charge at any given time, as well as the criteria for how they classify their customers in categories.</p>
<p>Furthermore, certain matters pertaining to customer protection against interruption of supply are regulated in view of the fact that heating is a very important utility. A number of rules governing compensation for loss by reason of the distribution contract are linked to these provisions.</p>
<p>Supervision</p>
<p>The proposals in the two interim reports “More secure district heating customers – Increased transparency and separation of electricity and district heating operations,” SOU 2003:115, and “Reasonable price for district heating,” SOU 2004:136, are aimed at guaranteeing district heating and cooling customers’ security and confidence in their heating and cooling services. The new proposals in this report are aimed at promoting better energy management through increased production in high-efficiency cogeneration units.</p>
<p>In order for the purposes of the new laws I propose to be achieved, it is necessary to have effective supervision with means to verify compliance with the rules stemming from the proposals and sanctions that can be imposed in the event of non-compliance. I therefore propose that rules of supervision be introduced that are</p>
<p>to be included in the District Heating Act and the Act on guarantees of origin of electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration.</p>
<p>I further propose that an authority be designated to exercise the supervision that is required to verify compliance with the proposed laws or regulations issued pursuant to them. I do not propose requiring that the supervisory functions for the two laws be exercised by one and the same authority. It should be up to the Government to determine which authority or authorities are to exercise this supervision. However, I recommend that the supervisory tasks under both the District Heating Act and the Act on guarantees of origin of electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration be assigned to the Swedish Energy Agency.</p>
<p>Consequences</p>
<p>The measures that follow from my proposals will entail costs for the state. I propose that the cost for the state supervision entailed by the proposals for a District Heating Act and an Act on guarantees of origin of electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration be financed by imposition of a supervisory charge. For supervision of the District Heating Act, this charge should be levied on parties conducting district heating or cooling operations. With regard to the Act on guarantees of origin of electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration, the supervision charge should be levied on parties who obtain guarantees of origin. Svenska Kraftnät’s costs for the administration associated with the issuance of guarantees should also be covered by charges.</p>
<p>The mediating and dispute settlement service which I propose should be provided under the auspices of the Swedish Energy Agency should be financed from the resources allocated to the Swedish Energy Agency in the latest budget bill for its activities in e.g. the district heating field.</p>
<p>The proposals I am submitting will also give rise to costs for the district heating and cooling companies and for the companies that wish to come into possession of guarantees of origin of electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration. As I stated in the previous report, where a fuller account was given of the proposals in the District Heating Act, the requirements on the operators and the dispute settlement mechanism will entail a relatively modest burden for them. The requirement on legal and functional separation and</p>
<p>on the right of negotiation for customers and those who wish to deliver heat to the owner of the district heating network or others may, however, entail certain costs. However, the costs are not of such a nature that, considering the number of affected companies and their structure, they would in themselves lead to the elimination or consolidation of small enterprises, nor to other adverse consequences. I have therefore not found reason to recommend any exemptions for small enterprises.</p>
