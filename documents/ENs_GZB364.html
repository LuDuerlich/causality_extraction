<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The current provisions on the reception of unaccompanied minors seeking asylum, contained in the Reception of Asylum Seekers and Others Act (1994:137), entered into force on 1 July 2006. Under these provisions the state, via the Swedish Migration Board, has primary responsibility for the reception of asylum seekers, i.e. both adults and children. Under Section 3, second paragraph, of the Act, special provisions apply to the reception of unaccompanied minors, for whom the Swedish Migration Board is required to assign a municipality to arrange accommodation. After a minor has arrived in Sweden and made themselves known to the Swedish authorities, accommodation is to be arranged and the actual reception to take place in a municipality. When the Swedish Migration Board assigns a minor to a municipality, it must be a municipality that has entered into an agreement with the Board on the reception of unaccompanied minors. If there are special grounds, the Board may assign the minor to a municipality with which no such agreement has been signed.</p>
<p>The report proposes that the Swedish Migration Board be given extended possibilities to assign unaccompanied minors seeking asylum to municipalities, even in the absence of a reception agreement. The Board would be able to assign minors both to municipalities that have not entered into an agreement and to those that, while having entered into an agreement, do not at present have any places available. Special grounds would not need to be cited by the Migration Board, which was previously the case.</p>
<p>The proposal involves no changes with regard to the division of responsibilities between central government and municipalities. Accordingly, the Swedish Migration Board would continue to have the primary responsibility and the reception of minors would still take place in the municipalities.</p>
<p>In the same way as current provisions, the reception of unaccompanied minors would primarily be based on voluntary agreements between central government and the municipalities. In other words, the Swedish Migration Board would continue to enter into agreements with municipalities on the reception of minors.</p>
<p>The background to the review of the provisions in the Reception of Asylum Seekers and Others Act is that the conditions for the reception of unaccompanied minors have changed since the current regulations were introduced in 2006. In the same year that the new provisions entered into force, the number of unaccompanied minors seeking asylum doubled. Since then, the numbers have increased substantially each year. The number of reception agreements reached between the Swedish Migration Board and the municipalities is insufficient to meet the increasing need. This has led to a large proportion of minors seeking asylum being accommodated in temporary accommodation in the arrival municipalities. This has had negative consequences for those minors who have spent too long in this type of accommodation. It has also involved higher costs for the state, since the municipalities have been forced to arrange accommodation that is more expensive than accommodation in the assigned municipalities that have reception agreements. Against this background, according to the Inquiryâ€™s terms of reference, there is reason to review the extent to which the current system needs to be changed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the new provisions come into force on 1 January 2013.</p>
