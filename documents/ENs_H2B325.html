<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit has been to propose the supplementary provisions required by Regulation (EU) No 650/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and acceptance and enforcement of authentic instruments in matters of succession and on the creation of a European Certificate of Succession (the ‘Succession Regulation’). The remit entails analysing the Succession Regulation and shedding light on similarities and differences in relation, in particular, to the Brussels I Regulation and the Maintenance Regulation. The analysis is to include an assessment of the impact of the Succession Regulation’s requirement concerning the submission of estate inventories, which authorities and legal professionals in Sweden are to be deemed ‘courts’ for the purposes of the Succession Regulation and which authority in Sweden is to be responsible for issuing the European Certificate of Succession. Particular attention is to be given to the fact that the Succession Regulation, unlike current Swedish private international law in the area, does not contain rules on distribution of property upon the death of a spouse. The remit also includes proposing provisions on recognition and enforcement with respect to States that are not bound by the Succession Regulation.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit includes considering whether Sweden should accede to the agreement of 1 June 2012 on amendment of the Convention of 19 November 1934 between Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway on succession, wills and distribution of property (the Nordic Convention on Succession) and analysing the consequences of the Succession Regulation for the Nordic regulations. In this connection, the Inquiry is to analyse the implications of the special derogation from the scope of the Succession</p>
<p>Regulation in favour of the Nordic regulations. The Inquiry is to present proposals on legislative amendments required to incorporate the agreement in Swedish law.</p>
<h2>General principles</h2>
<p>With the exception of matters concerning Nordic countries, matters of international succession are regulated in the Act on Conflict of Laws in Regard to Succession (1937:81). For matters of international succession that only concern Nordic countries, this act does not apply. Instead, three other acts apply: the Act concerning estates left by Danish, Finnish, Icelandic or Norwegian citizens habitually resident in Sweden (1935:44), the Act concerning property left by deceased persons habitually resident in Denmark, Finland, Iceland or Norway (1935:45) and the Act concerning supervision in certain cases of undistributed estates left by citizens of Denmark, Finland, Iceland or Norway (1934:46). These three acts incorporate the Nordic Convention on Succession in Swedish law.</p>
<p>The Succession Regulation replaces large parts of the regulations in the area contained in the four acts mentioned above. The Inquiry therefore proposes that these four acts be repealed and that the supplementary provisions required by the Succession Regulation be adopted in a new special act, together with the rules that Sweden can continue to apply. The Act on Conflict of Laws in Regard to Succession also contains certain provisions on the distribution of property upon the death of a spouse. Matters concerning matrimonial property do not come under the scope of the Succession Regulation. The Inquiry proposes that matters concerning distribution of property upon the death of a spouse be regulated in the Act on Certain International Issues relating to Matrimonial Property Relations (1990:272).</p>
<p>Not all EU Member States are taking part in the adoption of the Succession Regulation. The Succession Regulation is directly applicable in all Member States except Denmark, the UK and Ireland.</p>
<h2>The Succession Regulation</h2>
<h2>Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>The Succession Regulation regulates when courts in Member States have jurisdiction to rule on matters of succession. Jurisdiction lies with the courts in the country in which the deceased person was habitually resident at the time of death. The Succession Regulation introduces an option for individuals to choose, by a choice of law declaration, that the law of their country of nationality shall apply to their succession. In the event of a choice of law declaration in favour of the law of a Member State, provided certain conditions are fulfilled, jurisdiction lies with the courts of the Member State whose law has been chosen. In addition, there are provisions on subsidiary jurisdiction and on jurisdiction in exceptional cases (e.g. if it is impossible to obtain a ruling in a third State to which the case is closely connected).</p>
<p>In principle, jurisdiction under the Succession Regulation is universal and covers property both in and outside the country. In the event of subsidiary jurisdiction, jurisdiction may be limited in certain cases to ruling on property in Sweden. The Succession Regulation also contains a rule that allows the court that otherwise has jurisdiction to limit the proceedings in certain cases so as not to include property located in a third State.</p>
<p>The rules of the Succession Regulation on jurisdiction are comprehensive and do not allow for generally applicable, autonomous rules on jurisdiction.</p>
<h2>Applicable law</h2>
<p>The general rule under the Succession Regulation is that the law of the State in which the deceased had their habitual residence at the time of death shall apply to the succession as a whole. If, by way of exception, it is clear from all the circumstances of the case that, at the time of death, the deceased was manifestly more closely connected with a State other than the State of habitual residence, the law of that other State shall apply instead.</p>
<p>The Succession Regulation introduces an option for individuals to choose which law shall apply to their succession. An individual can indicate by a special choice of law declaration that the law of the State of which the individual is a national at the time of choice or of death shall apply to the succession. When an individual is a national of more than one country, the rules mean that they can choose the law of one of the States of which they are a national at the time of choice or of death. A choice of law must be made explicitly. This shall be done in a declaration in the form of a disposition of property upon death (usually a will) or shall be demonstrated by the terms of such a disposition.</p>
<p>Under the Succession Regulation, the principle of universality applies and the law that is applicable under the terms of the disposition applies irrespective of whether it is the law of a Member State or the law of a third State.</p>
<p>The rules of the Succession Regulation on applicable law replace, to begin with, the general rule on applicable law in the Act on Conflict of Laws in Regard to Succession. In this act, the deceased’s nationality governs which country’s law applies to the succession (the ‘principle of nationality’). The Succession Regulation entails that, in the absence of a choice of law declaration, the principle of habitual residence will instead apply to the issue of applicable law on succession.</p>
<p>The Succession Regulation allows the Member States (including Sweden) that are parties to the Hague Convention of 5 October 1961 on the Conflict of Laws Relating to the Form of Testamentary Dispositions to continue to apply the Convention instead of the rule in the Succession Regulation with regard to the formal validity of wills and joint wills. The Inquiry therefore proposes that a provision incorporating the Hague Convention be retained in the new act.</p>
<p>Under the Succession Regulation, in principle the law applicable to the succession (the ‘succession statute’) shall regulate the succession in its entirety, i.e. including procedural matters. The provisions in the Succession Regulation concerning the scope of the succession statute entail a change compared with the rules that have previously applied in Sweden. In cases where Sweden has international jurisdiction and foreign law is to apply to the succession, the Succession Regulation entails that foreign rules apply to the estate administration and succession. The Inquiry proposes certain supplementary rules concerning estate administration and related issues and rules requiring independent administrators in certain cases.</p>
<p>For inter-Nordic relations, the Succession Regulation allows exceptions, given certain conditions, for special Nordic rules concerning the administration of the estate and the involvement of authorities in the States parties. The Inquiry proposes that the new act contain rules on which law shall apply to procedural issues in inter-Nordic relations. The law that is to apply to succession in other respects will in future be governed by the provisions of the Succession Regulation, in Nordic as in other situations. In this connection, it should be noted that as a result of the intergovernmental agreement on amendments to the Nordic Convention on Succession, the special Nordic rules that Sweden is unable to apply because of the Succession Regulation will, in many respects, be in line with the rules in the Succession Regulation.</p>
<h2>Recognition and enforcement</h2>
<p>Under the Succession Regulation, decisions on succession from Member States shall be recognised without any special procedure being required. For enforcement, the decision must have been declared enforceable in the Member State where enforcement is requested.</p>
<p>According to the Succession Regulation, the procedure for applying for enforcement is to be regulated by law in the enforcing Member State, unless otherwise provided by the Regulation. The Inquiry proposes that, in general, the procedure for an application for enforceability (exequatur proceedings) should be in line with equivalent procedures under other international instruments. In light of legislative proposals on new rules for recognition and enforcement of judgments of foreign courts in the area of civil law, the Inquiry proposes that applications for enforcement should be made to the district courts prescribed by the Government.</p>
<h2>A European Certificate of Succession</h2>
<p>The Succession Regulation establishes a European Certificate of Succession. The rules on the European Certificate of Succession are intended to facilitate the management of succession cases with cross-border implications in the EU. A European Certificate of Succession is intended for use by heirs, legatees, executors of the will or administrators of the estate to demonstrate their status, rights and powers in another Member State, for instance in a Member State in which succession property is located. The European Certificate of Succession does not replace national documents used for similar purposes in the Member States and use of the Certificate is not obligatory. However, a European Certificate of Succession has legal effects in all Member States, without any special procedure being required. No authority or person that has received a Certificate of Succession issued in another Member State should have the right to demand that a person produce a decision, an official document or a settlement before a court instead of a Certificate of Succession.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Tax Agency be entrusted with the task of issuing Certificates of Succession in Sweden.</p>
<h2>Agreement on amendment of the Nordic Convention on Succession</h2>
<h2>Accession to the Nordic agreement</h2>
<p>A prerequisite for Sweden (and Finland) to be able to apply certain provisions in the Nordic Convention on Succession is that the Convention is amended in the manner agreed by the Nordic countries in an intergovernmental agreement. Sweden has signed the agreement, subject to ratification.</p>
<p>One of the effects of the agreement is to bring the choice of law rules in the Nordic Convention on Succession into line with the rules in the Succession Regulation. This is to enable the outcome of applying the choice of law rules in the Nordic countries to be essentially the same, even though Sweden and Finland are obliged to apply the choice of law rules in the Succession Convention, while Denmark, Iceland and Norway will apply the choice of law rules in the Nordic Convention.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that Sweden accede to the Nordic agreement on amendment of the Nordic Convention on Succession.</p>
<h2>The Nordic derogation</h2>
<p>The Nordic derogation means that Sweden, notwithstanding the Succession Regulation, is allowed to apply a revised Nordic Convention on Succession with regard to rules on the administration of the estate and involvement of authorities in the States parties, and simpler and faster procedures for recognition and enforcement of decisions.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the rules in the revised Nordic Convention on Succession that Sweden is allowed to continue to apply be incorporated in Swedish law through provisions in the new act.</p>
<h2>Matrimonial property relations in the event of a spouse’s death</h2>
<p>The Act on Conflict of Laws in Regard to Succession regulates not only matters of succession but also matters concerning matrimonial property relations in the event of a spouse’s death. These matters relate to jurisdiction in the event of a dispute regarding the surviving spouse’s rights in the estate, when distribution of property upon the death of a spouse is to take place in Sweden, recognition of a foreign distribution of property upon the death of a spouse or of a foreign decision regarding such distribution of property, and enforcement of a foreign decision that rules on a dispute on distribution of property upon the death of a spouse. In the case of partners who are not married, these issues are now regulated in the Act on Certain International Questions relating to Married People’s Property.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the issues mentioned here concerning matrimonial property relations in the case of a spouse’s death should be regulated by the Act on Certain International Questions relating to Married People’s Property.</p>
<h2>Autonomous rules on recognition and enforcement</h2>
<p>The rules in the Succession Regulation on recognition and enforcement are only applicable in relation to decisions from other Member States that take part in the adoption of the Succession Regulation and are not parties to the Nordic Convention on Succession (i.e. all Member States except Denmark, Finland, the UK and Ireland). For decisions from Nordic countries, the rules incorporating the provisions of the Nordic Convention on Succession regarding recognition and enforcement apply. There is a need for rules on recognition and enforcement of decisions from States that are not bound by the Succession Regulation or the Nordic Convention on Succession.</p>
<p>The current rules in the Act on Conflict of Laws in Regard to Succession involve a very restrictive approach to recognition and enforcement of foreign decisions. The Inquiry proposes new rules on recognition and enforcement of decisions from States that are not bound by the Succession Regulation or the Nordic agreement.</p>
<p>The rules contain basic requirements for recognition and enforcement, together with certain special circumstances that constitute impediments to recognition and enforcement. Even if the foreign decision satisfies the basic requirements, the decision shall not be recognised or enforced in Sweden if impediments to recognition exist. Impediments to recognition exist if the foreign decision does not satisfy reasonable requirements for due process, such as the right not to be judged without a hearing. Nor is a foreign decision applicable in Sweden if the foreign decision is manifestly incompatible with the principles of the Swedish legal order (public policy). The existence of a competing Swedish or foreign decision, or ongoing proceedings in Sweden that may lead to a contrary decision, can also lead to the foreign decision not being recognised in Sweden.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposal on supplementary provisions in the Succession Regulation and provisions on incorporating the (revised) Nordic Convention on Succession should enter into force at the same time as the Succession Regulation begins to apply, i.e. on 17 August 2015.</p>
<p>Transitional provisions are proposed to the effect that older provisions, unless otherwise provided by the Succession Regulation, shall apply to succession to persons deceased before 17 August 2015. The transitional provisions also propose that older provisions should apply to exequatur proceedings initiated before the entry into force.</p>
