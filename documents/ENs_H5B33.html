<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>For several years now, discussions have been under way about whether a special system is needed for ministers’ and state secretaries’ transitions to other assignments, employment or establishment of a business after finishing their duties as minister or their employment as state secretary. A number of motions have been submitted to the Riksdag on this issue, and several external bodies – both Swedish and foreign – have expressed the view that Sweden should introduce a regulation. There are also examples of transitions made by ministers and state secretaries to employment in the business sector that have attracted attention and criticism. However, Sweden still lacks regulation in this area.</p>
<p>Mobility between the public and private sector has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it helps to develop skills on both sides. On the other hand, there can be an increased risk of conflicts of interest. Two kinds of risks tend to be mentioned. The one kind arises when the employee still works for the state – this is the risk of undue influence as a result of a promise of new employment. The other kind, which is discussed more often, concerns situations in which a person has left the public sector. There is then a risk of abuse of information, knowledge or contact with former colleagues, which can in turn result in preferential treatment for the new employer. The very suspicion of this kind of abuse can affect confidence in the state and cause damage to it – which means that there does not have to have been a tangible case. The damage could be either financial damage or damage to public confidence.</p>
<p>Whereas a number of other countries have chosen to regulate in this area – some through legislation and others through guidelines and similar documents – neither the Riksdag nor the Government have so far considered it necessary to introduce any special regulation. Instead, reference has been made to the protection provided through rules on secondary occupations and secrecy, for example. However, we have now been tasked with looking into whether changes need to be made to the conditions for ministers and state secretaries to enter into agreements on, or take on, certain types of employment and assignments within a certain period of time after leaving their duties or employment. Under our terms of reference, we must – when carrying out the remit – gather views from a parliamentary reference group, i.e. a group made up of one representative of each of the eight parties in the Riksdag.</p>
<p>A regulation should be introduced through a special act</p>
<p>We propose the introduction of a regulation of ministers’ and state secretaries’ transitions from their ministerial duties or employment as a state secretary to assignments or employment in non-state activities or establishment of a business. This regulation should be put in place through a special act – the Act concerning restrictions in the event of ministers and state secretaries transitioning to nonstate activities. For examinations under the Act, there should be a special examination body – the Board for the Examination of</p>
<p>Ministers’ and State Secretaries’ Transitions. We do not consider that the ‘state secretary agreement’ needs to be amended as a result of the proposed regulation.</p>
<p>A regulation could reduce the risk of conflicts of interest and thus also the risk of damage to the state or unfair advantage for any private party. It may also make it easier for the ministers and state secretaries who wish to move to other activities as they would not have to assess entirely on their own whether the transition is acceptable or not. In view of the fact that ministers and state secretaries are in similar positions of trust, we consider that the regulation should be the same for both groups and irrespective of whether they leave their duties or employment of their own accord or for another reason.</p>
<p>The regulation should apply to transitions to non-state activities</p>
<p>The regulation should apply to ministers and state secretaries who intend to begin a new assignment or new employment in non-state activities or set up a business. Transitions to non-state activities mean all activities where the state is not the responsible authority. The regulation also applies to companies that are completely or partially state-owned. For all of the abovementioned activities, the state itself has no – or limited – opportunities to prevent inappropriate transitions. To make it impossible to circumvent the regulation, we consider that it should cover transitions to both assignments and employment in non-state activities and the setting up of a business. However, the types of assignments described in Chapter 4, Section 1 of the Local Government Act, e.g. municipal commissioner, and party political assignments are not covered by the Act.</p>
<p>There must be an obligation to report</p>
<p>Under our proposal, ministers and state secretaries are obliged to report in advance any new assignments and any new employment in non-state activities or the setting up of a business that they plan to begin within twelve months of having left their duties as minister or their employment as state secretary. This kind of general obligation to report to the examination body means that it is not for ministers or state secretaries to decide for themselves whether the transition has to be reported or not. They must provide the examination body with the information it needs for its assessment. However, the examination body must have the right under certain circumstances to gather information from persons other than the minister or the state secretary.</p>
<p>If, within twelve months of a minister or state secretary leaving their duties as a minister or their employment as a state secretary, there is a significant change in the content of an assignment, a job or a business that has been examined by the body, the minister or state secretary is obliged to submit a new report to the examination body.</p>
<p>A transitional restriction in the form of a waiting period and/or subject restrictions should be issued for a maximum of twelve months</p>
<p>Under our proposal, a transitional restriction should be issued if certain criteria are met. One kind of transitional restriction is a waiting period.  This means that the minister or state secretary is not permitted to begin a certain assignment or employment or to set up a certain kind of business, or to have any contact other than about practicalities with the future client or employer. As there can be situations in which it is not the new assignment, employment or business activity as a whole that may give rise to conflicts of interest and associated risk of damage or unfair advantage but just some parts of it, we consider that there should also be a transitional restriction in the form of a subject restriction.  This means that the minister or state secretary is not permitted to be involved in certain specified issues or areas within the framework of the new assignment, employment or business activity during a certain period. It should be possible to combine both kinds of restriction.</p>
<p>The criteria for issuing a transitional restriction should be that a minister or state secretary, within the context of their duties as minister or their employment as state secretary, has acquired such information or knowledge meaning that there is a risk, as a result of a certain transition, of financial damage to the state, of unfair advantage for a private party or of damage to public confidence in the state. Therefore, the examination body does not need to observe that actual damage or unfair advantage has arisen. A clearly identifiable risk is sufficient for introducing a restriction.</p>
<p>We propose that it be possible to issue a transitional restriction for a maximum of twelve months after the minister or state secretary has finished their duties as minister or their employment as state secretary. The length of the restriction in each individual case should be determined following an assessment of how long the information or knowledge the minister or state secretary has will entail a risk of financial damage to the state, a risk of unfair advantage for a private party or a risk of damage to public confidence in the state.</p>
<p>There must be a special examination body</p>
<p>Under the Act, examinations must be carried out by a special examination body. In view of the fact that the body will deal with issues concerning people in or with close connections to the Government, we consider that it should be a body under the Riksdag. As a rule, it should apply the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
<p>The body should be made up of five members. There should be three deputy members. The members and deputy members should each be selected by the Riksdag. To assist the members of the body, there should be a secretary appointed by the examination body itself. The examination body should be led by a judge or a former judge. In other respects, the body should contain at least one additional person with a background as a judge who can function as deputy to the regular chair, at least one person who has been a minister and at least one person who has been a state secretary. There is nothing to stop one member from meeting more than one of these requirements. At least three of the body’s members – including one who is chair or deputy chair – must participate in a decision. However, the chair should be able to determine matters of a straightforward nature alone. Rules concerning the examination body should be placed in the Riksdag Act and in separate instructions.</p>
<p>The examination body should examine the notification within three weeks</p>
<p>The examination body must examine a notification from a minister or a state secretary no later than three weeks after the complete notification was received. A minister or a state secretary must not be permitted to take up their assignment or employment or set up a business until the examination body has announced a decision about any transitional restrictions. However, if such a decision has not been announced when the three-week deadline expires, the assignment or employment reported may be begun or the business set up.</p>
<p>Ministers and state secretaries must have the right to have decisions re-examined by the examination body. However, there must not be any right to appeal decisions by the examination body.</p>
<p>It should be possible to provide compensation for the duration of a transitional restriction</p>
<p>A minister or a state secretary who has been prevented through a transitional restriction from beginning an assignment or employment or setting up a business during a certain period may suffer loss of income. In our view, he or she should be compensated for this under certain conditions. We therefore propose that a minister or a state secretary for whom a waiting period has been issued should be entitled to compensation for the duration of the restriction. If a subject restriction is issued, no compensation should be paid as a rule. However, if the subject restriction means that the minister or state secretary cannot take up their assignment or employment, or set up their business for the duration of the restriction, the minister or state secretary should be entitled to compensation on the same conditions that apply for a waiting period.</p>
<p>In cases where the rules on compensation for ministers and state secretaries after leaving office are applicable, no new rules are needed to resolve the issue of compensation in current cases. Compensation for the duration of a transitional restriction must therefore be subsidiary in relation to the existing right to severance compensation for ministers and the right to severance payments for state secretaries. In cases where the minister or the state secretary is to receive compensation under the subsidiary rules, the size of the compensation for the transitional restriction issued corresponds to the amount that the minister or state secretary received as remuneration or salary at the time of their departure. Compensation should be reduced in accordance with what applies for a minister’s severance compensation or a state secretary’s severance payment.</p>
<p>Possibilities to introduce sanctions are not considered necessary, but secrecy should apply</p>
<p>We consider that the intended regulation has a sufficient preventive effect. Therefore, possibilities to introduce sanctions are not necessary. If, upon later application of the legislation, it should emerge that it is not being complied with, there is of course nothing to prevent the issue of sanctions from being raised again.</p>
<p>Matters concerning transitions can contain information that is sensitive primarily for the ministers and state secretaries if it comes to the attention of the general public. In our view, the interest in being able to classify such information as secret outweighs the interest of public access to information. Secrecy should apply to information in a matter concerning examination under the proposed Act, unless it is clear that the information can be disclosed without any individual suffering loss or harm. However, secrecy should cease to apply once a decision about transitional restrictions is announced.</p>
<p>A provision on due care and attention should apply to all transitions</p>
<p>To further stress the importance of avoiding conflicts of interest and thus the associated risks of damage or unfair advantage, we consider that the intended Act should contain a provision on due care and attention. Under this provision, ministers and state secretaries should, when moving to and conducting a new assignment or new employment or setting up a business, always endeavour to act in such a way that there is no risk of damage to the state, no risk of unfair advantage for a private party, and no risk of damage to public confidence in the state.</p>
