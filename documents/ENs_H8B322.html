<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry was instructed to present proposals on how to promote ‘car sharing services’, including the sharing of cars, motorcycles and mopeds. In the first instance, the remit included examining the conditions for a reduced rate of value added tax (VAT) on such services. If a system of reduced VAT rates on car sharing services is not deemed feasible, the Inquiry’s remit in the second instance included examining ways of promoting car sharing services other than within the framework of the tax system. The Inquiry was also instructed to demarcate and define the term ‘car sharing service’, based on the activities that should benefit and the services to be included to achieve more resource-efficient transportation. The remit also included considering the requirements to be imposed on vehicles used in such car sharing services.</p>
<h2>Motor vehicle sharing act introduced</h2>
<p>There is no legal definition of the term ‘car sharing service’, and the Inquiry was instructed to draw up such a definition. The committee terms of reference state that cars, motorcycles and mopeds should be included in the definition. The Inquiry therefore proposes that the term ‘motor vehicle sharing’ be used for these services.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes introducing a motor vehicle sharing act, the aim of which is to promote greater use of motor vehicle sharing and thus contribute to the transition to a transport-efficient society.</p>
<p>The proposed act contains a definition of the term ‘motor vehicle sharing’. Motor vehicle sharing refers to a service in which registered users share the use of one or more motor vehicles, with the exception of class II mopeds. The service must be publicly available. It must be possible to rent vehicles for a limited time, and the shortest rental period is to be one hour or less. Moreover, it must not be required to enter into a rental agreement for each individual use of the vehicle. The service must be provided by a legal person and the legal person must be registered as the owner of the vehicle in the road traffic registry. This means that peer-to-peer sharing – schemes in which private individuals rent out motor vehicles to each other via a brokering service, often in the form of a digital platform – are excluded from the definition’s scope of application.</p>
<p>The proposed criterial mean that traditional car rentals are also excluded, which is in line with the committee terms of reference.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the term ‘shared vehicle’ be used for vehicles used in a motor vehicle sharing service, and that this term be introduced into the Road Traffic Definitions Ordinance (2001:651).</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Government, or the authority designated by the Government, should be allowed to issue regulations on environmental and road safety requirements for shared vehicles.</p>
<h2>No reduction of VAT on motor vehicle sharing services</h2>
<p>Under current regulations, providing services that comprise motor vehicle sharing are subject to 25 per cent VAT. For it to be possible to reduce the VAT on these services, they would need to be included under ‘transport of passengers and their accompanying luggage’ in the VAT Directive. The Inquiry considers that it is not compatible with EU law to reduce the VAT on the provision of services comprising motor vehicle sharing. Motor vehicle sharing means that a legal person places a means of transport at customers’ disposal so that customers themselves can carry out the transport and operate the vehicle. Consequently, it is a matter of renting a means of transport, which cannot be included under ‘transport of passengers and their accompanying luggage’.</p>
<h2>Parking spaces for shared vehicles</h2>
<p>Access to parking spaces is vital in promoting car sharing. As the market for motor vehicle sharing is currently almost entirely comprised of car sharing, the Inquiry has not been able to determine the parking-space needs of motorcycle and moped sharing schemes.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that, through local traffic regulations, municipalities be given the opportunity to reserve parking spaces for shared vehicles on public space land. The proposal will be implemented through amendments to the Road Traffic Ordinance (1998:1276).</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s view, the possibility for municipalities to reserve parking spaces for specific shared vehicles should not be introduced. This is in part because such space reservations would mean that the public no longer had access to the space.</p>
<p>These proposals mean that it will be the municipalities that examine matters concerning parking permits for shared vehicles.</p>
<h2>Assignment on information campaigns</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Government instruct the Swedish Transport Administration, in partnership with the Swedish Consumer Agency and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, to conduct an information campaign to increase consumer awareness about motor vehicle sharing and how it can contribute to more sustainable travel. Such an information campaign is expected to reinforce the impact of the Inquiry’s proposed measures to reserve parking spaces for shared vehicles and lead to greater use of motor vehicle sharing services.</p>
<h2>Effects of the Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>In the Inquiry’s assessment, the proposed measures will lead to more households sharing the use of motor vehicles. This is expected to reduce overall car use and reduce vehicle kilometres travelled. This will also result in reduced carbon dioxide emissions and pollution. The proposed measures will have a positive impact on several of the Government’s environmental objectives and transport policy objectives. This includes the environmental quality objectives Reduced</p>
<p>Climate Impact, Clean Air and A Good Built Environment. Several households sharing the use of motor vehicles will also increase the transport system’s accessibility, flexibility, sustainability and costeffectiveness.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the motor vehicle sharing act enter into force on 1 January 2021. It is proposed that amendments to the Road Traffic Ordinance and the Road Traffic Definitions Ordinance enter into force on the same date.</p>
