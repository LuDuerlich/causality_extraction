<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The United Nations (UN) adopted a Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2006. There is also an optional (voluntary) protocol under which individuals have the right to complain to the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities if they consider their rights to have been violated. Sweden ratified the Convention and the Optional Protocol on 15 December 2008. Both came into effect for Sweden on 14 January 2009.</p>
<h2>The Convention</h2>
<p>The Convention, which is one of the central conventions on human rights, does not in itself create any new rights. Its purpose is instead to eliminate obstacles to persons with disabilities enjoying their human rights. The fundamental principles enshrined in the Convention are non-discrimination, equality of opportunity, individual autonomy and participation and inclusion.</p>
<p>The Convention comprises a preamble and 50 articles. Article 33, which is the focus of this inquiry, is headed National Implementation and Monitoring. Under paragraph 2 of this article there have to be public bodies in each State Party with the task of promoting, protecting and monitoring implementation of the Convention.</p>
<p>The Delegation for Human Rights in Sweden was tasked in July 2008 with considering whether Handisam (the Swedish Agency for</p>
<p>Disability Policy Coordination), the Equality Ombudsman or some other body should be entrusted with this task (ToR 2008:92). The remit also includes considering what the requirement to promote, protect and monitor implementation of the Convention signifies in practice.</p>
<h2>Basis of the inquiry</h2>
<p>Under the Convention and the terms of reference of the inquiry, this work is based on: - the State Party’s own legal and administrative systems, - the ’Paris Principles’ relating to national institutions for human rights (among other things a broad mandate set forth in law, independence and broad composition), - monitoring of implementation of the Convention in all areas of both private and public activity, including measures taken by the Government and the Riksdag, - the participation of the disability movement.</p>
<p>In assessing which public body or bodies can be regarded as best suited to the various tasks mentioned in paragraph 2 of Article 33 of the Convention, the Delegation has faced the dilemma of having to present its findings under this remit one year earlier than its final report. The final report will be concerned, among other things, with the issue of supervision of all the conventions on human rights. The proposals in the final report may therefore at a later stage have an impact on and alter the tasks of the government agencies discussed in this report.</p>
<h2>The Paris Principles</h2>
<p>When the States Parties appoint the public body or bodies to be responsible for promoting, protecting and monitoring implementation of the Convention, under the second paragraph of Article 33, they have to take into account the principles relating to the status and functioning of national institutions for protection and promotion of human rights. This refers to what are known as the Paris Principles. In the Government Bill Human rights for persons with disabilities  (Govt Bill 2008/09:28), the Government states that there is no institution in Sweden at present which can be said to fulfil all the requirements that can be derived from the Paris Principles and which at the same time can take responsibility for monitoring the Convention. In addition, the requirement to establish a national mechanism for monitoring of implementation of a convention on human rights has never existed in any previous convention. It only exists in an optional protocol to the Convention against Torture.</p>
<p>The Paris Principles were formulated on 7-9 October 1991 in Paris during the first International Workshop on National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. These principles establish what should apply in relation to the work of national institutions to promote respect of human rights. They are concerned with the competence, mandate, tasks, composition and funding of the institutions.</p>
<p>A detailed examination of the principles underpinning the work of this inquiry is made in Chapter 2.2.</p>
<h2>The concepts of promoting, protecting and monitoring</h2>
<p>Under its terms of reference, the Delegation has to consider what the requirement to promote, protect and monitor may signify in practice. The Delegation has therefore considered it necessary to examine the three concepts. The Delegation has additionally chosen to develop the concept of independence, as this is interpreted in differing ways in the discussions on which public body or bodies should be given responsibility for the tasks of promoting, protecting and monitoring implementation of the Convention.</p>
<p>Promoting</p>
<p>It is stated in the United Nations Handbook on the Establishment and Strengthening of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights that promotion is a very general term covering a broad range of possible activities.</p>
<p>According to the Handbook, a national institution can be considered responsible for the promotion of human rights if its aims and tasks include: - to inform and to educate abour human rights, - to foster the development of values and attitudes that uphold human rights, - to encourage activities with the purpose of defending human rights against violations.</p>
<p>Protecting</p>
<p>The concept of protecting includes both the task of receiving and considering individual complaints and the task of conducting general investigations of suspected violations of human rights in society.</p>
<p>Monitoring</p>
<p>The concept of monitoring can be said to be close in meaning to the concept of protecting, which is given a monitoring significance in the Paris Principles. One of the tasks for a national institution for human rights, according to the Paris Principles, should be to report to the Government, the Riksdag and other bodies the results of: - reviews of legislation and administration, as well as government bills and other proposals and - violations of human rights the institution decides to consider.</p>
<p>Independence</p>
<p>Under the Paris Principles, the mandate of national institutions for human rights should be set forth in a constitutional or legislative text. They should be freely able to choose which issues they intend to take up. They should not be subject to financial control which might affect their independence. It is not, however, stated who is or are to be a responsible authority.</p>
<h2>European Community directives</h2>
<p>The same requirement, that states should establish national institutions for promoting and monitoring, as set forth in Article 33 of the United Nations Convention, is also contained in the European Community directives on equal treatment (2006/54/EC, 2004/113/EC, 2000/43/EC). The Equality Ombudsman is responsible for this task in Sweden. However, the task is limited to equal treatment from the point of view of discrimination.</p>
<h2>Previous experience The United Nations standard rules and the work of the Disability Ombudsman on these rules</h2>
<p>The United Nations Standard Rules on the Equalisation of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities were adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1993. These rules are not legally binding but morally obliging on the governments.</p>
<p>Under Rule 17 on coordination of work, states are responsible for the establishment of national coordinating committees to serve as a national focal point on disability matters. Under Rule 20, states are responsible for the continuous monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of national programmes and services concerning the equalisation of opportunities for persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>One of the tasks of the Disability Ombudsman, which was established in 1994 and ceased to exist as an independent government agency on 31 December 2008, was to play a follow-up and evaluating role in matters relating to the rights and interests of persons with disabilities. The Ombudsman was also to endeavour to remedy deficiencies in legislation, raise issues concerning statutory amendments and in various ways gather information on activities relating to the circumstances of persons with disabilities. In its Bill The Disability Ombudsman  (Govt Bill 1993/94:219), the Government considered that the Ombudsman closely matched the description of national coordinating committees presented in the Standard Rules.</p>
<h2>Article 18 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture</h2>
<p>A requirement for a national preventive mechanism is also enshrined in the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture which was adopted by UN General Assembly in December 2002 and came into effect in June 2006.</p>
<p>The Parliamentary Ombudsman and the Chancellor of Justice are designated to serve as this body. This has been the object of criticism by the UN Committee against Torture in its concluding observations/comments on Sweden's fifth report to the Committee (CAT/SWE/CO/5). The Committee states that the two government agencies do not have any preventive tasks and lack staff with broad skills and adequate resources to accomplish the task.</p>
<h2>What alternatives exist?</h2>
<p>Under its terms of reference, the Delegation is to consider what the requirement to promote, protect and monitor means in practice and whether Handisam, the Equality Ombudsman or some other public body should be entrusted with this task.</p>
<p>As a number of other government agencies have featured in discussions on a suitable public body, the Delegation has also chosen to address these: the Parliamentary Ombudsman, the Chancellor of Justice, the National Audit Office and the National Board of Health and Welfare.</p>
<h2>International perspectives</h2>
<p>A survey of 14 countries in Europe and the rest of the world shows that very few have so far found a solution for the commitments made under paragraph 2 of Article 33. This survey has taken place through contacts at meetings, e-mail exchanges and replies to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights ahead of its report on legal measures for the ratification and implementation of the Convention.</p>
<p>The replies can be broadly divided into three groups of countries: 1. two which have appointed their commissioners for human rights or equivalent to be responsible, 3. eight which have not yet appointed anyone to be responsible.</p>
<h2>The meaning of the concepts of promoting, protecting and monitoring in relation to the proposals</h2>
<p>An analysis is made in the report of the concepts of promoting, protecting and monitoring in relation to the Convention and an initial assessment is made of which public body is best suited to each task, principally with respect to promotion. A more detailed analysis then follows of which public body can be regarded as best suited to the various tasks and to what extent the various government agencies described meet the requirements which can be derived from the Paris Principles.</p>
<p>Promoting</p>
<p>The Delegation does not consider it possible to give the complete responsibility for promoting implementation of the Convention to a single agency and considers that it should be divided into several constituent parts. Some of these parts are closer to the direct remit of implementing the Convention than the remit of protecting and monitoring its implementation.</p>
<p>The various constituent parts can be briefly summarised as: 1. information for individuals on the existence of the Convention and their rights under it, 2. information for and training of personnel and  decision-makers on the Convention, and on their responsibilities for its implementation, 3. information and training on the contents of the Convention on the basis of the Government's priorities in national disability policy, 4. in-depth information and training on the meaning of the various rights enshrined in the Convention.</p>
<p>While the first two parts relate to general information and training on the Convention and the principles underpinning it, the Delegation means by the third part the implementation of national policy, in this case disability policy.</p>
<p>Responsibility for promoting implementation of those parts of the Convention which the Government chooses to prioritise may and should, in the view of the Delegation, rest with a corporate support agency which to a great extent is controlled by Government remits. This task should be kept separate from the remit of monitoring implementation of the Convention. The Delegation therefore proposes that responsibility for promoting in the first two parts mentioned should rest with the Equality Ombudsman, while it is natural for Handisam to continue to be responsible for those parts which the Government prioritises and which are primarily directed at government agencies, municipalities and county councils.</p>
<p>Responsibility for the fourth part, promoting implementation of the Convention through in-depth information and training on the significance of the various rights, should, in the view of the Delegation, rest primarily with the government agencies responsible for activities in the areas concerned. Responsibility for implementation of the national action plan for disability policy has already been allocated in this way.</p>
<p>Protecting</p>
<p>All parts of the State, that is to say the Riksdag, the Government and government agencies, as well as municipalities and county councils, have a joint duty to prevent violations of the human rights of third parties. The Delegation considers the task of protecting implementation of the Convention to be closely related both to the task of promoting and to the task of monitoring. In the view of the Delegation, responsibility for this task should therefore be shared between several public bodies.</p>
<p>Monitoring</p>
<p>The Delegation interprets the monitoring task as meaning regularly analysing what progress has been made in implementation of the Convention, what remains to be done and what difficulties/shortcomings have been encountered. Responsibility for this task must be separated from responsibility for promoting and protecting implementation to prevent those who are responsible for these tasks examining themselves. Responsibility should rest with a body which, as far as possible, is not dependent on the Government and which can independently choose the areas to be examined.</p>
<h2>Principal responsibility for promoting, protecting and monitoring implementation of the Convention</h2>
<p>The Delegation shares the Government’s view that Sweden does not yet have a body whose principal task is to promote, protect and monitor the various conventions on human rights. Of the government agencies concerned, the Delegation considers the Equality Ombudsman to be the one that comes closest to complying with the Paris Principles.</p>
<p>The Delegation therefore proposes allocating the following tasks to the Equality Ombudsman on the basis of the conclusions reached in Chapter 3.2.</p>
<p>• Promoting - informing individuals on the existence of the Convention and their rights under it, - informing and training personnel and  decision-makers on the Convention and their responsibilities for its implementation.</p>
<p>• Protecting -  conducting general investigations to identify any violations of the Convention and structural shortcomings in the judicial system at national level.</p>
<p>• Monitoring - examining proposals for new laws, ordinances and other proposals from the Government, as well as existing legislation, - examining central and local government and other publicsector activity and companies and other  private-sector organisations, - drawing the attention of the Government to situations in the country where rights under the Convention are violated.</p>
<p>The Delegation considers that responsibility for information and training concerning national disability policy and its implementation, as today, should rest with Handisam and the Government Offices. The government agencies designated as sectoral agencies for the implementation of disability policy and the supervisory agencies have special responsibility for disseminating information on the parts of the Convention that relate to their particular activities.</p>
<p>The remit for the Equality Ombudsman is not intended to replace the responsibility for information, supervision and application of the law held by other public bodies.</p>
<h2>The new remits of Handisam and the Equality</h2>
<h2>Ombudsman</h2>
<p>In its report, the Delegation explains why a new government agency should not be established for promotion, protection and monitoring of the Convention. Arguments then follow against any of the other agencies that have been relevant to the discussion or the Government's Delegation on Disability being given the remit of promoting, protecting or monitoring the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Finally, the Delegation presents its view of the role of Handisam and reasons why the Equality Ombudsman should be given the remit and how this remit should be formulated.</p>
<h2>Handisam – corporate support agency for the implementation of disability policy</h2>
<p>Handisam receives its remit from the Government through the Ordinance (2007:1134) containing the duties of the Swedish Agency for Disability Policy Coordination and through government appropriation directions. The remit is dictated by the orientation of disability policy decided upon by the Government and is thus largely dictated by the Government's priorities, and principally agrees with the tasks described in paragraph 1 of Article 33 concerned with the implementation of the Convention.</p>
<p>The Delegation therefore considers that, under its remit to be responsible for coordinating the implementation of disability policy, Handisam can very well take responsibility, together with other entities, for the task of promoting implementation of the Convention. The Delegation proposes that this task should be stipulated in the Government ' s ordinance containing Handisam’s duties.</p>
<h2>Why the Equality Ombudsman?</h2>
<p>The government agency's compliance with the Paris Principles</p>
<p>The Delegation notes that the new Equality Ombudsman does not yet fully comply with the requirements that can be derived from the Paris Principles, inasmuch as the agency's remit is limited to matters concerning equal rights and equality of opportunity with reference to certain defined grounds of discrimination, and thus does not cover the protection of human rights in general terms. The remit does not include violations of human rights when the violations do not entail discrimination, for example if society makes inadequate provision for basic health and medical care for all citizens. In this case the right of everyone to such health and medical care is violated, but no one is treated less well than anyone else.</p>
<p>The Delegation considers that the Equality Ombudsman is nevertheless the government agency which, with least impact on existing activities, can be given the remit of being responsible for promoting, protecting and monitoring implementation of the Convention.</p>
<p>The Equality Ombudsman is already the government agency responsible for the promotion, analysis and checking of, and support for, equal treatment under the European Community directives on equal treatment.</p>
<p>Remit</p>
<p>The Delegation proposes an addition to the Act (2008:568) concerning the Equality Ombudsman to clarify that the remit to promote, protect and monitor implementation of the Convention will concern all parts of the Convention, and not just cases where rights are violated in the form of discrimination, as for example in the example of health and medical care above. Such a supplement to the Act also means that it is the Riksdag that decides on any amendments to the remit.</p>
<p>The Delegation proposes the following supplement to Section 1:</p>
<p>The Equality Ombudsman shall also promote, protect and monitor implementation of the United Nations’ international Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.</p>
<p>Competence</p>
<p>The Delegation judges that the Equality Ombudsman to a satisfactory extent has the knowledge of both human rights and disabilities required of the institution which is to be responsible for promoting, protecting and monitoring implementation of the Convention. The Delegation wishes, however, to emphasise the importance of the Ombudsman further strengthening its competence with regard to the human rights perspective, as this differs in part from the established perspective of equal treatment.</p>
<p>Independence</p>
<p>The Paris Principles emphasise the broad mandate, as well as the institution being able to present opinions and reports in areas it considers needing to be highlighted. According to the principles, this mandate should be set forth in a constitutional or legislative text.</p>
<p>The Delegation considers that the independence of the Equality Ombudsman is already evident from the Act concerning the Equality Ombudsman and is further reinforced by the legislative proposal presented in earlier sections.</p>
<p>Individual complaints</p>
<p>The Delegation considers that both investigations of individual complaints and general investigations represent important elements of the monitoring of implementation of the Convention. In the view of the Delegation it is, however, not necessary in the present situation for the individual complaints to be investigated and dealt with by the same body as is responsible for general monitoring. Nor is this a requirement under the Convention. The question of what the possibility of submitting individual complaints with reference to the rights enshrined in the Convention would mean is also too wide-ranging to be answered in the context of this report.</p>
<p>The Council of the Equality Ombudsman</p>
<p>The Delegation proposes that the members of the Council of the Equality Ombudsman should continue to be appointed by the Ombudsman but wishes to reiterate the importance of there being people who themselves have disabilities on the Council.</p>
<p>It is also important that the Ombudsman develops cooperation with the disability movement in other ways.</p>
<p>Personnel and financial resources</p>
<p>The Delegation considers that the Equality Ombudsman should be provided with funds to fulfil the new remit signified by the promotion, protection and monitoring of implementation of the Convention.</p>
<p>There is also a need for a reinforcement of resources with regard to both promotion and monitoring.</p>
<p>Promotion and monitoring of implementation of the Convention must not be limited to a perspective of equal treatment and must instead be based on a human rights perspective based on the entire Convention, In the judgement of the Delegation, some professional development will probably be required in the government agency for this purpose, to reinforce the expertise of the Ombudsman concerning human rights.</p>
<p>Resources are additionally required, particularly in an initial stage, to develop methods to examine how the Convention is implemented and to develop cooperation in various ways with civil society, and in particular with the disability movement which is to participate in monitoring activity.</p>
<p>The Delegation estimates that the Equality Ombudsman will need to be provided with resources equivalent to around three person-years to accomplish its new remit to promote, protect and monitor implementation of the Convention. The cost of these is estimated at around SEK 2 million annually. In addition to this there are costs of information, training and method development, estimated at SEK 3 million annually during the initial stage. The Delegation judges, however, that the costs of method development can be expected to decrease as the agencies find forms of supervision from a rights perspective.</p>
<p>The Delegation notes that the requirement to establish a national mechanism to promote, protect and monitor implementation of a convention on human rights has never occurred in any previous convention other than the optional protocol to the Convention against Torture. The Delegation therefore does not see any opportunities to finance the new resources for the Equality Ombudsman through funds from other sources.</p>
<p>Organisation</p>
<p>The Delegation considers that the experience contributed by supervision and review of implementation of the Convention provides a valuable foundation for information and training initiatives. It is important, however, that a clear distinction is made between reviewing and promoting activities in the organisation. The Delegation notes that the Equality Ombudsman has divided its activities into three sections, where promotion and supervision are separated.</p>
<h2>Cooperation with/demarcation against other agencies</h2>
<p>Disability policy – a responsibility for all authorities</p>
<p>Central government, the county councils and the municipalities should also endeavour to ensure that the fundamental principles of the Convention pervade their various activities. The Government has to date appointed a total of 14 central agencies, known as sectoral agencies, which have special responsibility for the implementation of disability policy. These are to press for the policy to become reality in their particular areas of society. Handisam has an active role as a partner in cooperation and discussion and as a coordinator of the remits of the sectoral agencies, without taking over the responsibilities of any of these agencies.</p>
<p>The Delegation similarly wishes to emphasise that the task of the Equality Ombudsman to promote, protect and monitor the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities does not in any way diminish the responsibilities of other agencies for the Convention to pervade work in their areas. All government agencies have an important role to play in efforts to implement the Convention in their particular areas of responsibility. The principles underpinning the Convention and the articles which relate in particular to their own activities must provide a clear basis for both information and development efforts and standardisation and supervision.</p>
<p>Everyone can contribute to the review</p>
<p>A key task in the remit to monitor implementation of the Convention is to gather and coordinate material from other initiatives and analyse this in relation to human rights. The Delegation considers that any government agency which has a remit to evaluate, follow up and exercise supervision within its sector in a valuable way can contribute to the Equality Ombudsman’s review of how the Convention is implemented in Sweden. The remit should be apparent from the agency’s duties. Specific assignments with requirements to submit progress reports will probably also be required initially in the agencies' appropriation directions.</p>
<p>To clarify the responsibilities of the government agencies and the municipalities and county councils to contribute to the review of how the Convention is implemented, the Delegation proposes that a new Section 2 a be added to the Act concerning the Equality Ombudsman:</p>
<p>Administrative agencies, municipalities and county councils shall at the request of the Equality Ombudsman supply such information to the Ombudsman as the latter needs to fulfil its remit under the first paragraph of Section 1.</p>
<p>Indicators with a rights perspective</p>
<p>The Delegation considers it important that the accumulation of knowledge, among other things in the context of supervision, in a dialogue between the government agencies and the Equality Ombudsman, is developed so that it is based to a greater degree than at present on human rights.</p>
<h2>Participation of the disability movement in monitoring</h2>
<p>Under paragraph 3 of Article 33 of the Convention, civil society, in particular persons with disabilities and their representative organisations, are to be involved and participate fully in the monitoring process.</p>
<p>In an agreement between the Government, non-profit organisations in the social area and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions, it is stated that the relationship between the Government and the non-profit organisations is to be characterised by responsibility and mutuality and be based on the circumstances of both and utilise the perspectives and expertise of both. The agreement contains a good description of the principles which should apply to cooperation between the disability movement and the Equality Ombudsman.</p>
<p>The Delegation wishes to reiterate here the importance of persons with disabilities being members of the Equality Ombudsman's Council and of the disability organisations in various ways being involved in monitoring implementation of the Convention.</p>
<h2>The link to accessibility and active measures</h2>
<p>Accessibility</p>
<p>An investigator in the Government Offices has been tasked with submitting proposals on how failure to take measures against inadequate accessibility could be treated as a form of discrimination. The Delegation notes that there is no direct link between the remit to review how inadequate accessibility could be treated as discrimination and the remit to investigate which public body could be entrusted with the task of promoting, protecting and monitoring implementation of the Convention.</p>
<p>Active measures</p>
<p>An inquiry chair is to study the effects of the provisions on active measures contained in the previous laws against discrimination (ToR 2008:130). On this basis, the inquiry chair is to consider, among other things, how requirements for active measures can be made clear and distinct and be linked to effective sanctions. The findings are to be reported to the Government by 31 December 2009. The Delegation notes that it is difficult in the current situation to see how this might affect the Delegation's proposals.</p>
<h2>Children’s perspective and gender equality</h2>
<p>There are several articles in the Convention that highlight the importance of the States Parties taking account of both a children’s and a gender equality perspective in work on the Convention. The Delegation emphasises that the content of these articles must be reflected to the greatest degree in work both to promote and protect and to monitor implementation of the Convention.</p>
<h2>Promotion, protection and monitoring of all conventions on human rights</h2>
<p>The task of the Delegation in this report has only related to one of the conventions on human rights. The Delegation is tasked with drawing up proposals in its final report on how continued support for efforts to ensure full respect of human rights in Sweden at large could be provided after the Delegation has completed its work (ToR 2006:27). The proposals concerning the latter more overarching issue may therefore have an impact on and alter the tasks for the government agencies discussed in this report.</p>
<p>In the 2009 Budget Bill (Govt Bill 2008/09:1), the Delegation was also tasked with examining how the issue of supervision in accordance with the Paris Principles on national institutions with the task of monitoring human rights issues should be resolved. There is also a dilemma in this part of the remit in relation to the proposals presented in this report.</p>
<p>The issue of a body for promoting, protecting and monitoring implementation of the Convention in question belongs together with the issue of the establishment of similar national monitoring functions for other UN conventions on human rights. It would be unfortunate for such a body to be established for one of the conventions while there is no body with principal responsibility for the promotion, protection and monitoring of other central conventions. If similar tasks are to be developed for all the human rights conventions, the issue should be taken up again. This may thus have an impact on and alter the conditions for the government agencies discussed here.</p>

<h2>Principles)</h2>
<h2>Adopted by General Assembly resolution 48/134 of 20 December 1993</h2>
<h2>Competence and responsibilities</h2>
<p>a) To submit to the Government, Parliament and any other competent body, on an advisory basis either at the request of the authorities concerned or through the exercise of its power to hear a matter without higher referral, opinions, recommendations, proposals and reports on any matters concerning the promotion and protection of human rights; the national institution may decide to publicize them; these opinions, recommendations, proposals and reports, as well as any prerogative of the national institution, shall relate to the following areas: i) Any legislative or administrative provisions, as well as provisions relating to judicial organizations, intended to preserve and extend the protection of human rights; in that connection, the national institution shall examine the legislation and administrative provisions in force, as well as bills and proposals, and shall make such recommendations as it deems appropriate in order to ensure that these provisions conform to the fundamental principles of human rights; it shall, if necessary, recommend the adoption of new legislation, the amendment of legislation in force and the adoption or amendment of administrative measures; ii) Any situation of violation of human rights which it decides to take up; iii) The preparation of reports on the national situation with regard to human rights in general, and on more specific matters; iv) Drawing the attention of the Government to situations in any part of the country where human rights are violated and making proposals to it for initiatives to put an end to such situations and, where necessary, expressing an opinion on the positions and reactions of the Government; b) To promote and ensure the harmonization of national legislation, regulations and practices with the international human rights instruments to which the State is a party, and their effective implementation; c) To encourage ratification of the  above-mentioned instruments or accession to those instruments, and to ensure their implementation; d) To contribute to the reports which States are required to submit to United Nations bodies and committees, and to regional institutions, pursuant to their treaty obligations and, where necessary, to express an opinion on the subject, with due respect for their independence; e) To cooperate with the United Nations and any other orgnization in the United Nations system, the regional institutions and the national institutions of other countries that are competent in the areas of the protection and promotion of human rights; f) To assist in the formulation of programmes for the teaching of, and research into, human rights and to take part in their execution in schools, universities and professional circles; g) To publicize human rights and efforts to combat all forms of discrimination, in particular racial discrimination, by increasing public awareness, especially through information and education and by making use of all press organs.</p>
<h2>Composition and guarantees of independence and pluralism</h2>
<p>1. The composition of the national institution and the appointment of its members, whether by means of an election or otherwise, shall be established in accordance with a procedure which affords all necessary guarantees to ensure the pluralist representation of the social forces (of civilian society) involved in the protection and promotion of human rights, particularly by powers which will enable effective cooperation to be established with, or through the presence of, representatives of: a) Non-governmental organizations responsible for human rights and efforts to combat racial discrimination, trade unions, concerned social and professional organizations, for example, associations of lawyers, doctors, journalists and eminent scientists; b) Trends in philosophical or religious thought; c) Universities and qualified experts; d) Parliament; e) Government departments (if these are included, their representa– tives should participate in the deliberations only in an advisory capacity). 2. The national institution shall have an infrastructure which is suited to the smooth conduct of its activities, in particular adequate funding. The purpose of this funding should be to enable it to have its own staff and premises, in order to be independent of the Government and not be subject to financial control which might affect its independence. 3. In order to ensure a stable mandate for the members of the national institution, without which there can be no real independence, their appointment shall be effected by an official act which shall establish the specific duration of the mandate. This mandate may be renewable, provided that the pluralism of the institution's membership is ensured.</p>
<h2>Methods of operation</h2>
<p>Within the framework of its operation, the national institution shall: a) Freely consider any questions falling within its competence, whether they are submitted by the Government or taken up by it without referral to a higher authority, on the proposal of its members or of any petitioner, b) Hear any person and obtain any information and any documents necessary for assessing situations falling within its competence; c) Address public opinion directly or through any press organ, particularly in order to publicize its opinions and recommendations; d) Meet on a regular basis and whenever necessary in the presence of all its members after they have been duly concerned; e) Establish working groups from among its members as necessary, and set up local or regional sections to assist it in discharging its functions; f) Maintain consultation with the other bodies, whether jurisdictional or otherwise, responsible for the promotion and protection of human rights (in particular, ombudsmen, mediators and similar institutions); g) In view of the fundamental role played by the nongovernmental organizations in expanding the work of the national institutions, develop relations with the nongovernmental organizations devoted to promoting and protecting human rights, to economic and social development, to combating racism, to protecting particularly vulnerable groups (especially children, migrant workers, refugees, physically and mentally disabled persons) or to specialized areas.</p>
<h2>Additional principles concerning the status of commissions with quasi-jurisdictional competence</h2>
<p>A national institution may be authorized to hear and consider complaints and petitions concerning individual situations. Cases may be brought before it by individuals, their representatives, third parties, non-governmental organizations, associations of trade unions or any other representative organizations. In such circumstances, and without prejudice to the principles stated above concerning the other powers of the commissions, the functions entrusted to them may be based on the following principles: a) Seeking an amicable settlement through conciliation or, within the limits prescribed by the law, through binding decisions or, where necessary, on the basis of confidentiality; b) Informing the party who filed the petition of his rights, in particular the remedies available to him, and promoting his access to them; c) Hearing any complaints or petitions or transmitting them to any other competent authority within the limits prescribed by the law; d) Making recommendations to the competent authorities, especially by proposing amendments or reforms of the laws, regulations and administrative practices, especially if they have created the difficulties encountered by the persons filing the petitions in order to assert their rights.</p>
