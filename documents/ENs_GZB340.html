<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In its terms of reference  Electronic income statements per individual per month (ToR 2009:91), the Inquiry was instructed to produce proposals requiring employers and others to submit data every month on wages paid and taxes deducted at employee level (a monthly statement) to the government agency that the Inquiry finds appropriate. The terms of reference instruct the Inquiry to take account of the proposals in the report of the Delegation against Benefit Fraud and Errors (SOU 2008:74), the proposals of the Swedish Tax Agency in its report  Månadsuppgift och skattedeklaration (Monthly statement and tax return) and the report of the Swedish Companies Registration Office  Förslag till minskat uppgiftslämnande för företag (Proposal on reduced reporting by businesses) .</p>
<p>Mandatory systems for monthly wage statements at individual level have been introduced in recent years in Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Hungary and Estonia. Norway is in the process of introducing such a system.</p>
<p>The information on income circumstances currently available to agencies in the welfare area is inadequate. The information is often out of date, which leads to time-consuming processing and sometimes to incorrect payments from the welfare system.</p>
<p>The purpose of the proposal on monthly statements is to make the reporting of information by employers to various agencies more efficient by coordinating the reporting process, enhancing services to individuals, improving opportunities for agencies to check information and ensuring that the income-related benefits paid by the welfare systems are correct.</p>
<p>The account below summarises the Inquiry’s reasoning, proposals and impact assessments.</p>
<h2>Monthly statement</h2>
<p>Under current regulations, a statement of income from employment is submitted once a year. As a general rule, wages, fees, pensions, benefits, sickness benefit, parental benefit and other income received on the basis of employment is to be recorded as income. With certain limited exceptions, a statement is to be submitted for natural persons by the party that has paid the remuneration or benefit. This means that employers registered as having activities in Sweden, the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, the unemployment insurance funds, insurance companies and others disbursing compensation classified as income from employment must submit statements on compensation disbursed.</p>
<p>New regulations on monthly statements are proposed. The provisions require information on remuneration and benefits paid in the income from employment category to be reported every month. The annual statement for income from employment will be eliminated. A statement on income from business activities and capital will continue to be required once a year.</p>
<h2>Electronic reporting</h2>
<p>The monthly statement is to be submitted electronically. The Swedish Tax Agency can grant an exemption from the obligation to submit statements electronically for two years at a time, if there are special grounds for doing so. Special grounds include cases in which the reporting party has no Internet connection.</p>
<p>Monthly statements are to be submitted via an eService using eID. Reporting parties that have wage systems can submit monthly statements as part of their wage payment routines. Reporting parties that lack wage systems or have wage systems that do not allow automatic transfer of monthly statements can register monthly statements via an online form on the Swedish Tax Agency website. Reporting parties will be able to choose when they want to submit the monthly statement up to the day on which the tax return is filed. Employers who pay out wages several times a month can submit statements to the Swedish Tax Agency in connection with each wage payment. The statements they submit will then be added up by the Swedish Tax Agency for each employee in each calendar month.</p>
<h2>New information to be provided in monthly statement</h2>
<p>Under current regulations, the contents of the annual statement of income from employment are designed, with minor exceptions, to meet the needs of the Swedish Tax Agency.</p>
<p>The monthly statement will contain the same information that is submitted in the annual statement of income from employment under current regulations. In addition, the monthly statement will contain information as to whether compensation paid includes sick pay or supplementary benefits in connection with sickness or parental leave. If the compensation is attributable to a period other than the current month, the reporting party is to specify the period concerned.</p>
<p>The reason why new information is to be submitted is that the Swedish Social Insurance Agency needs this information in processing its business.</p>
<h2>Link between monthly statement and tax return</h2>
<p>Under current regulations, a tax return is to be submitted by a party who is required to deduct taxes or pay employer’s social security contributions (in accordance with a proposal on tax procedures referred to the Council on Legislation for consideration on 13 January 2011, this is termed the ‘employer’s return’). A tax return is to be submitted every accounting period, which will normally mean every calendar month. The tax return is to report total compensation from which the payer is required to deduct taxes and the total amount deducted.</p>
<p>The tax return will be based on the information submitted by a reporting party in the course of a month. When the electronic return procedure is used, the Swedish Tax Agency’s eService will add up the data submitted by a given employer/reporting party. The total will be stated in the electronic tax return. The Swedish Tax Agency will then transfer the data for the tax return to the reporting party who will sign the return. This will eliminate some of the work it entails for the reporting party to fill in the tax returns. This applies to those who choose to file returns electronically. The risk of declaring incorrect amounts because of adding and calculating errors will also be reduced. This will lead to lower costs for both employers and the Swedish Tax Agency.</p>
<h2>Correction of information reported</h2>
<p>The introduction of a system of monthly statements makes it possible to correct information reported. It will be possible to amend or correct information reported at any time until the tax return for that month has been received by the Swedish Tax Agency. It is the latest information submitted that will be used as the data in the tax return.</p>
<h2>Possibility for employees to review information reported</h2>
<p>Employees and others who have received taxable remuneration will be able to check the information reported by employers and other reporting parties by means of an eService on the Swedish Tax Agency website, using eID. The month after wages have been paid, it will be possible to check the information reported to the Swedish Tax Agency. Being able to check the information will allow employees and other income earners to be confident that tax deductions have been reported.</p>
<h2>Period-related data</h2>
<p>The information submitted in monthly statements will normally relate to wages or other compensation for the preceding month. If the compensation does not relate to that period, the reporting party is to state this and specify the period that the compensation concerns. This issue will arise if the compensation reported in the monthly statement is affected by a one-off payment, such as a bonus, retroactive wages, severance pay or similar payment that results in the report deviating from the normal situation. The purpose of marking the data in this way is to allow the agencies that subsequently use the monthly statement in their business processing to see deviations from the normal situation.</p>
<h2>Voluntarily higher tax deductions</h2>
<p>Under current regulations, employers are required to make extra tax deductions if an employee asks them to. A higher tax deduction can be a means of avoiding a residual tax liability that the employee would otherwise incur as a result of extra income.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the obligation of the main employer to make a higher tax deduction be eliminated. However, it will still be possible to do so. The alternative will be that the individual receiving remuneration makes their own payments into their tax account during the income year.</p>
<h2>Information about absence and hours worked</h2>
<p>The Inquiry refrains from presenting proposals on including information about absence in the monthly statement. The Inquiry’s assessment is that although the information would be of some use, this would not outweigh the costs to employers of submitting the information.</p>
<p>With regard to information on hours worked, the Inquiry notes that this information could be of some use in processing and controls in the present unemployment and social security systems.</p>
<p>Information about hours worked in the monthly statement would be of considerable use in statistics production. It would make it possible, for example, to move from sample surveys to register-based data. It would also make it possible to improve the quality of productivity measures in the national accounts.</p>
<p>However, for smaller enterprises without wage systems, the requirement to report hours worked could involve considerable costs.</p>
<p>The current cross-party parliamentary inquiry on social security (the Committee on sustainable insurance in the event of sickness and unemployment, S2010:04) will present proposals on future social security schemes. The need for information on hours worked is likely to be considered in this connection.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore finds there is no reason at present to propose including information on hours worked in the monthly statement.</p>
<p>If it should be found that hours worked should be included in the monthly statement, a simple definition should be chosen that can be used broadly. One definition could be information on contract period combined with information on percentage of fulltime hours worked.</p>
<h2>Receiving agency</h2>
<p>The remit of the Inquiry has included taking a position on which agency monthly statements should be sent to. The Inquiry has concluded that the Swedish Tax Agency should have this task. The reasoning behind this is that it is the Swedish Tax Agency that receives the annual statements, which involves processing data at individual level. The Swedish Tax Agency is also the agency that now receives tax returns and takes decisions in these matters. The Swedish Tax Agency therefore has the expertise and to some extent the systems that are needed to be able to receive and process monthly statements.</p>
<h2>Users of the monthly statement</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s terms of reference require it to consider whether an exchange of information is needed between the receiving agency and other agencies, and whether such information exchanges can be reconciled with requirements concerning protection against unacceptable intrusions into personal privacy.</p>
<p>Several agencies will benefit from the monthly statements in their activities. For all the agencies that the Inquiry has considered should have access to the monthly statements, it would be far more valuable to receive detailed information in the month after the month to which the income relates than to receive a summary of information relating to a whole year at a much later date. The monthly statements can be used in quite different ways than the information that is now available. Agencies will be able to process business more efficiently and services to citizens will be improved. Fewer demands for repayment of benefits will need to be issued.</p>
<p>Moreover, the reporting burden on companies will lessen as in most cases receiving agencies will not need to ask employers and other payers about individual people’s incomes. It will also be possible to improve post-payment checks. All these factors will enhance the legitimacy of the welfare systems.</p>
<h2>Försäkringskassan (the Swedish Social Insurance Agency)</h2>
<p>Försäkringskassan needs information about the income of a person covered by the social insurance system when determining the income on which their sickness benefit will be based and when assessing applications for housing allowance. If the income on which sickness benefit is to be based has not been determined previously, the individual requesting benefits must personally provide income information in the application. If the individual provides new income information that differs from information previously submitted, Försäkringskassan has to investigate the differences. In certain cases, the person insured and their employer are contacted to check the information. With regard to compensation for sick pay costs under the Ordinance on compensation for sick pay costs (2010:425), Försäkringskassan must request information from the employer applying for compensation about the amount of sick pay disbursed.</p>
<p>For Försäkringskassan, monthly statements will be of substantial use in processing business concerning income on which sickness benefit is to be based, housing allowances and compensation for sick pay costs. This business will be processed more efficiently and the service provided to individuals will be improved. Receiving up-to-date and reliable information about wages before a decision on benefits will make it possible to reduce the number of demands for repayment owing to incorrectly paid benefits. Försäkringskassan will not need to ask employers about employees’ incomes except in very special cases. The availability of monthly statements will also make it possible to improve postpayment checks.</p>
<h2>Swedish Enforcement Authority</h2>
<p>In the event of attachment of earnings, the Swedish Enforcement Authority has to investigate the debtor’s employment and income situation and so needs information about employer and remuneration paid out. Some debtors change employer to avoid enforcement of an order for attachment of earnings. It is very difficult for the Swedish Enforcement Authority to obtain notice of which employer the debtor works for without the debtor’s cooperation.</p>
<p>Having access to the monthly statement will make the inquiries of the Swedish Enforcement Authority more reliable and cases involving attachment of earnings can be processed considerably more efficiently. It will be possible for the Swedish Enforcement Authority to considerably reduce the number of enquiries it currently sends out to employers. In addition, up-to-date income information will enable the Swedish Enforcement Authority to act far more quickly than at present so as to bring about an attachment of earnings.</p>
<h2>Social welfare committees</h2>
<p>When processing applications for financial assistance, social welfare committees need information about applicants’ incomes. When someone applies for financial assistance, an investigation is made to assess whether the applicant is entitled to assistance. The information provided by applicants is checked with certain public agencies after applicants have given their consent.</p>
<p>The monthly statement will be of considerably greater use to the social welfare committees than the information about assessed income to which they now have access. In most cases, information about assessed income is too old and is therefore unusable. Access to monthly information will make for more efficient processing of financial assistance applications. The number of cases and number of repayment demands will probably also be reduced as the checking of information submitted will be more reliable. This would also enhance the legitimacy of the system of financial assistance.</p>
<h2>Swedish Migration Board</h2>
<p>In certain cases, an asylum seeker is entitled to financial assistance in the form of a daily allowance. Before deciding on a daily allowance, the Swedish Migration Board needs information about the applicant’s income. A person applying for a daily allowance has to apply in writing, providing information about any income. The Swedish Migration Board bases its decision on this information.</p>
<p>Access to the monthly statement will give the Swedish Migration Board up-to-date information about whether the applicant has any income from employment. The information now available to the Swedish Migration Board is information about assessed income. The monthly statement will help to make processing by the Board more efficient and provide a better service to the individual. The legitimacy of the daily allowance system will increase.</p>
<h2>Unemployment insurance funds</h2>
<p>The unemployment insurance funds administer the unemployment insurance system and for this purpose need income information. An application for benefits has to be accompanied by a certificate from the employer, which is to include information about the applicant’s income. If someone who has received benefits from an unemployment insurance fund has later received wages or financial damages equivalent to wages, the benefits disbursed by the unemployment insurance fund must be repaid.</p>
<p>For the unemployment insurance funds, access to a monthly statement will mean that they have access to up-to-date information about applicants’ earned income. This will give the funds increased possibilities of checking information and enable them to discover incorrect payments. The number of cases in which benefits that have been paid out have to be repaid will also be reduced.</p>
<h2>Swedish Public Employment Service</h2>
<p>The rules on introduction activities for certain newly arrived immigrants entered into force on 1 December 2010. The rules aim to facilitate and speed up the introduction of newly arrived immigrants into working and community life. In certain cases a newly arrived immigrant is entitled to introduction benefits. To process applications for introduction benefits, the Swedish Public Employment Service needs information about the applicant’s income. If the applicant has income from gainful employment above a certain amount, the introduction benefit has to be reduced.</p>
<p>Access to monthly statements will make for more efficient processing of introduction benefits and the service provided to applicants will improve. The number of repayment demands will also be reduced as checks will become more reliable. The legitimacy of the system of introduction benefits will increase.</p>
<h2>Swedish Prosecution Authority</h2>
<p>The Swedish Prosecution Authority needs income information in conjunction with decisions relating to day-fines. Day-fines are set on the basis of the individual’s estimated annual income at the time when the fine is imposed. Generally speaking, the individual’s own information is accepted. It has come to light, for example in a report from the Swedish Prosecution Authority , that the income information on which the size of the day-fine is based is often incorrect.</p>
<p>Access to monthly statements will give the Swedish Prosecution Authority up-to-date and reliable information on the suspect’s earned income. Errors concerning the size of day-fines will thus be reduced and public confidence in the system will increase.</p>
<h2>Issues of confidentiality and privacy</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has given careful consideration to the issue of whether increased information exchange can be reconciled with requirements concerning protection against unacceptable intrusions into the personal privacy of the individual. Monthly statements contain rather sensitive data. Where the Swedish Tax Agency is concerned, income statements are subject to absolute confidentiality. The Inquiry has attempted to strike a well-considered balance between the usefulness of passing information on and the risk of intrusion into the personal privacy of the individual.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has concluded that information should be exchanged between the Swedish Tax Agency and other public agencies. Under the Inquiry’s proposals, Försäkringskassan, the Swedish Enforcement Authority, the Swedish Migration Board, the Swedish Public Employment Service and the Swedish Prosecution Authority will have direct access to the monthly statements. ‘Direct access’ means that a user can access the information so as to search in it independently and obtain answers to questions without being able to influence the contents.</p>
<p>The unemployment insurance funds, which are associations rather than public agencies, will be able to access monthly statements by transfer via automatic data processing media. The social welfare committees will be able to access the statements if the individual applying for financial assistance consents to it. The reason why the unemployment insurance funds are not to have direct access and the social welfare committees are only to have access if the individual has consented to the monthly statement being obtained from the Swedish Tax Agency is that the Inquiry has concluded that the risk of unacceptable intrusion into the individual’s personal privacy is greater in these cases than in the case of other agencies.</p>
<p>Confidentiality rules at the agencies that are to have access to monthly statements is generally weaker than the confidentiality to which information is subject at the Swedish Tax Agency. In the case of direct access, however, the same level of confidentiality will apply as at the Swedish Tax Agency, as long as the information remains in the database. When information is retrieved from the database and used by the receiving agency, the receiving agency’s confidentiality regulations will apply to the information.</p>
<p>In all cases, the Inquiry has proposed that the confidentiality of the information be strengthened so that absolute confidentiality applies even when the information is retrieved from the database.</p>
<h2>Collection and production of statistics</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals change the conditions for the collection and production of statistics by Statistics Sweden and other agencies. The conditions will change in three respects.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Inquiry’s proposals open the way to alternative and, in some cases, less expensive ways of collecting statistical data.</p>
<p>Secondly, the quality of the statistics can be improved.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the Inquiry’s proposals make it possible to create new short-period statistics with breakdowns at local level with little delay.</p>
<h2>Economic impact</h2>
<p>Several types of economic impact estimates have been made, for different purposes. Estimates have been made of the impact on various actors, e.g. employers and public agencies. Estimates have been made of the impact on the economy as a whole. Assessments have been made of the extent to which errors in the tax and transfer systems may be reduced. Budget estimates have been produced for the central and local government sectors. The estimates cover the period 2012–2021.</p>
<p>Lower administrative costs for employers</p>
<p>An estimate has been made based on an actor perspective. Reporting parties, e.g. employers, will have lower administrative costs if the Inquiry’s proposals are put into practice.</p>
<p>The monthly statement itself will lead to increased costs because of the higher periodicity compared with the abolished annual statement.</p>
<p>The costs to employers of submitting tax returns will be substantially reduced, as the monthly statements and the Swedish Tax Agency’s eServices will greatly facilitate administration.</p>
<p>The administrative burden of questions from public agencies such as Försäkringskassan, the Swedish Enforcement Authority and the local government social welfare committees will be reduced. These agencies will have access to monthly statements and will therefore have considerably less need than at present to turn to employers for up-to-date information about wages and incomes.</p>
<p>The conditions for collecting statistical data on incomes will change if monthly statements are introduced in accordance with the Inquiry’s proposal. Parts of the special collection of such data that now affect employers can be eliminated. This will reduce the administrative burden on employers.</p>
<p>Overall, administrative costs for employers will be lower if monthly statements are introduced as proposed.</p>
<p>Benefits for the economy as a whole</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals will profit the economy as a whole in both the scenarios analysed.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has made estimates for a situation with a changeover to historical incomes as a basis for calculating incomes on which sickness benefit is based from the mid-2010s onwards. These estimates lead to a slightly higher benefit for the public economy than a scenario with unchanged social insurance rules.</p>
<p>The economic estimates in the first scenario lead to an expected profit for the economy as a whole of 10.2 per cent. Estimates for the second scenario lead to an expected profit for the economy of 8.9 per cent.</p>
<p>Fewer errors</p>
<p>The Inquiry has made some estimates of the potential impact of its proposals on the incidence of errors in the tax and transfer systems.</p>
<p>For daily allowances in the social security system and social assistance paid by municipalities, estimates of the scale of errors have been available that have made it meaningful to estimate the extent to which errors can be reduced.</p>
<p>In a first stage, with current regulations, errors in the social security system can be reduced by over SEK 200 million per year. In a second stage, errors in the social security system can be reduced by SEK 2.6 billion per year.</p>
<p>We estimate that errors in social assistance can be reduced by SEK 300 million.</p>
<p>A reduction of errors in other areas is also very likely.</p>
<p>Budgetary effects</p>
<p>The initial years of the decade will bring a weakening of the budget, primarily for central government. The central government budget will lose over SEK 30 million in the first few years. Depending on the scenario, at the end of the decade central government will have an annual nominal budget gain in the area of administrative costs of over SEK 200 million or around SEK 150 million. If the estimated reduction in errors is included, the gain for the budget will be even greater.</p>
<p>The budgetary effect in the local government sector is unclear, depending on the scenario and wich part of the time period is concerned.</p>
<p>In the scenario without changes in the social security regulations and also in the initial years of the ten-year period, municipalities will realise a budgetary gain of some SEK 275 million. The county councils will experience a marginal budgetary loss.</p>
<p>In the scenario with changes in the social security regulations and in the later part of the ten-year period, the municipalities will experience a budgetary loss in excess of SEK 100 million. The county councils will experience a budgetary loss of over SEK 200 million.</p>
<p>Particularly in the scenario with changes in the regulations in the latter part of the ten-year period, the budgetary losses will be due to reduced tax revenues that are expected to follow from reduced errors in the social security system. This calculation does not include estimates of the way in which those who lose benefits will adapt. In some cases their income from work may increase. The final budgetary effect is extremely difficult to assess.</p>
<h2>Other implications of the Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals on mandatory electronic submission of monthly statements may have an impact on small enterprises. If so, it will be a matter of enterprises that do not now have access to suitable information technology. In that case, investments in such technology, which is not expensive, may be necessary. For a small number of enterprises the possibility will exist of obtaining an exemption from electronic submissions in certain cases.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals will also make it easier for society to combat crime in the form of undeclared work.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and implementation</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the legislative amendments concerning monthly statements (the Inquiry’s proposals regarding the proposal on the Tax Procedures Act) enter into force on 1 January 2013. Older provisions will continue to apply with regard to calendar years that have ended before entry into force. It is proposed that the other proposed provisions enter into force on 1 July 2013.</p>
