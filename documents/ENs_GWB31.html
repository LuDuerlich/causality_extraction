<p>The assignment</p>
<p>The assignment to the Ballast Water Management Inquiry was to account for the prerequisites for Sweden to accede to the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments, the Ballast Water Convention. The Convention was adopted on February 13, 2004 at a diplomatic conference on Ballast Water Management for Ships, arranged by IMO, the International Maritime Organization of the UN.</p>
<p>The assignment also included proposing appropriate statutory texts.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The discharge of ballast water constitutes a potential threat to the aquatic ecological systems and drinking water catchments. Ballast water may transport aquatic plants and animals as well as bacteria, virus and fungi to areas to which these would not spread in a natural way. Alien organisms discharged with ballast water may cause huge ecological and economic damage to their new environment.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Ballast Water Convention is to prevent, minimize and ultimately eliminate the transfer of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens by control and management of ships’ ballast water and sediments. The Convention will come into force 12 months after the day on which a minimum of 30 states, the merchant fleets of which correspond to at least 35 per cent of the gross tonnage of the world merchant fleet, have become parties to it. As per 30 November 2007 eleven states, the merchant fleets of which correspond to 3,46 per cent of the gross tonnage of the world merchant fleet, have acceded to the Convention.</p>
<p>An efficient implementation of the Ballast Water Convention would considerably reduce the risks of transferring harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens. The societal gains from this are probably great. Acceding to the Ballast Water Convention would also contribute to a fulfilment of the international commitments of Sweden. Within the framework of the Convention on the Protection of the Marine Environment in the Baltic Area (the Helsinki Convention) and the Convention for the Protection of the Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR) work is in progress to promote the accession of the member states to the Ballast Water Convention. A Directive on a marine strategy, aiming at a good environmental status in the seas of the EU in 2020, at the latest, has been adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers in December, 2007.</p>
<p>Taking the above into consideration, it is the opinion of the Ballast Water Management Inquiry that Sweden should accede to the Ballast Water Convention as soon as the adequate prerequisites exist.</p>
<p>The prerequisites of Sweden for accession</p>
<p>The Ballast Water Convention comprises all ships in international traffic. On board these ships the ballast water shall be managed in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. This is a requirement for ballast water discharge. The provisions state that ships shall either exchange their ballast water in areas where the depth is at least 200 metres at a minimum distance of 50 nautical miles from the nearest land or treat the ballast water by approved systems in order to ensure that the concentration of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens does not exceed the stipulated limits. In marine areas which do not comply with the requirements of the Convention for depth and distance from land special zones may be established where ships are allowed to exchange their ballast water.</p>
<p>Between the years 2009 and 2016, depending on the year of construction and the ballast water capacity of the ships, a transition from ballast water exchange shall be made to managing ballast water on board only. As from 2016 ballast water exchange will no longer be allowed for ships.</p>
<p>The requirements for exchange and for managing ballast water in approved systems do not apply if the ballast water is delivered to reception facilities or if another approved method for managing ballast water is used.</p>
<p>The Baltic Sea, Skagerrak and great parts of the North Sea are not deep enough for ballast water exchange at the stipulated distance from land. This means that most ships entering Swedish ports, as well as many Swedish ships entering ports in Baltic Sea and North Sea countries cannot exchange ballast water and thus also comply with the criteria of the Convention as regards depth and distance from land. Further, investigations made by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) show that establishment of special zones for ballast water exchange within the Exclusive Economic Zone of Sweden (EEZ) is not advisable. Neither have such zones not yet been established by any other states. Thus, Sweden cannot require that the provisions of the Convention on ballast water exchange shall apply to all ships entering Swedish ports nor to all Swedish ships entering ports in other countries.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of the Ballast Water Management Inquiry that a general exemption from the requirement for ballast water management cannot be granted to ships which cannot comply with the exchange requirement. Furthermore, it is the opinion of the Inquiry that reception facilities for ballast water should not be installed. No other approved methods for managing ballast water are known to exist for the time being.</p>
<p>The requirement to manage ballast water on board by treatment in approved systems in all ships will not be in force until 2016. The Ballast Water Management Inquiry does not consider it appropriate to introduce such requirements ahead of the stipulations of the Convention. Thus Sweden cannot fully comply with the requirements of the Ballast Water Convention on ballast water management until 2016.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore suggests that Sweden should accede to the Ballast Water Convention and, in this connection, register a reservation that Sweden, for geographical, hydrographical and</p>
<p>hydrological reasons, will not be able fully to comply with the stipulations of the Convention as regards ballast water exchange in all ships concerned by the Convention. However, this reservation will be in force for a limited period of time. As from the year 2016 Sweden will be in a position to comply fully with the stipulations of the Convention as regards ballast water management.</p>
<p>A special issue concerns the availability of approved ballast water management systems. A preliminary estimate made by IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee, MEPC, indicates that a satisfactory range of such systems will not be available until 2010 or even 2011. According to the Ballast Water Convention ships built in 2009 and later with a ballast water capacity of less than 5 000 cubic metres shall be able to conduct ballast water management that complies with requirements of approved systems. This has made the supreme decision-making body of IMO, the Assembly, adopt a resolution stating that acceding parties are recommended, for a limited period of time, not to require treatment of ballast water by approved systems on board ships built in 2009 and which have a ballast water capacity less than 5 000 cubic metres. The Inquiry proposes that Sweden follows this recommendation and communicates its intention to do so when depositing its instrument of accession with the IMO..</p>
<p>Rules and regulations</p>
<p>The Ballast Water Management Inquiry suggests the regulations of the Ballast Water Convention to be introduced in a new Act, named The Act on Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments (the Ballast Water Management Act). This Act should be supplemented by a new Ordinance. These regulations also need to be supplemented by a number of Authority Regulations.</p>
<p>The Swedish Maritime Administration (SMA) is a central administrative authority with responsibility for the shipping sector and also for reducing the environmental impact of shipping to a minimum. SMA is today, via the Swedish Maritime Safety Inspectorate, responsible for the incorporation of a number of international regulations regarding technical, operational and environmental safety in Swedish law. The Inquiry therefore proposes the SMA to be assigned the task to implement great parts</p>
<p>of the Ballast Water Convention regulations and to supervise the ships’ observance of the regulations.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes the Act to comprise regulations for example on ballast water management, sediment reception facilities, ballast water management plans, and ballast water record books, surveys and sanctions in case of violation.</p>
<p>The proposals deal with the following matters, inter alia. Before ballast water is discharged from ships in the Swedish territorial sea or the Swedish Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and from Swedish ships outside these areas, ballast water management shall have been conducted as stipulated. Up till the time when ships are obliged to have approved management systems on board, ballast water exchange shall be conducted where this can be performed pursuant to the regulations of the Convention. Sediment reception facilities shall be established in places where cleaning or repair of ballast tanks occur, as decided by the SMA. Ships shall implement a ballast water management plan and keep records in a ballast water record book. Furthermore, inspections, certifications and surveys shall be performed pursuant to the provisions of the Ballast Water Convention. A special fee shall be charged the company in case of unlawful ballast water discharge. This fee is to be decided by the SMA; it should be possible to appeal against it at a Maritime Court. Penal law sanctions shall be possible in addition to the ballast water fee. The sanction in case of other violations should be penal. Under certain conditions the SMA shall have the right to issue such prohibitions and orders that are needed to ascertain that ships do not discharge ballast water until this can be done without imposing a hazard to environment, health, property or resources.</p>
<p>The Ballast Water Management Inquiry further proposes that the SMHI should be commissioned to issue warnings against ballast water intake in certain areas. The Ballast Water Management Inquiry is further of the opinion that the possibility should be given to decide upon further measures in addition to the provisions of the Convention, in the form of prohibitions against discharge of ballast water in certain areas of Swedish inland waters. For example, discharge of untreated ballast water from international ship traffic in Lake Mälaren and Lake Vänern, which are sources of drinking water, would constitute particularly great hazards to the environment. Thus the Ballast Water Management Inquiry proposes the SMA to be authorized, after consulting the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, to issue such prohibitions if needed in order to</p>
<p>prevent and minimize the transfer of harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens.</p>
<p>The incorporation of the stipulations of the Ballast Water Convention will result in minor changes in rules and regulations in force.</p>
<p>The coming into force</p>
<p>The coming into force of the Ballast Water Management Act and the connected Ordinance is proposed to take place only in connection with the coming into force of the Ballast Water Convention. However, the SMA should be authorized to approve of management systems for ballast water 1 January 2009. The additional measures to be taken should also come into force before the Convention enters into force, since they concern decisions which would apply only to Swedish inland waters.</p>
