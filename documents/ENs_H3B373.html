<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this report, the Inquiry gives an account of its remit to draw up a proposal for an act on the processing of personal data in activities under the aliens and citizenship legislation (Terms of Reference 2014:76). In connection with this, we also present a survey of the processing of personal data in these activities and an analysis of whether the processing that is done is necessary and whether additional personal data processing is needed to promote effectiveness and efficiency.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also reports on several other issues that it has been specifically instructed to analyse.</p>
<h2>A new act on the processing of personal data in activities under the aliens and citizenship legislation The purpose and design of the act</h2>
<p>Under the Inquiry’s proposals, the processing of personal data in activities under the aliens and citizenship legislation will be regulated by an act designed to take account of the protection of personal privacy provided by Chapter 2, Article 6, second paragraph of the Instrument of Government, the Personal Data Act (1998:204) and Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (the ‘Data Protection Directive’). However, it has not been possible to adapt the proposals to the ongoing reform of the EU regulations on protection of personal data, as the work on this reform has not yet been concluded (June 2015).</p>
<p>The act – which it is proposed will be called the ‘Aliens Data Act’ – and a proposed associated ordinance will replace the current Ordinance on the Processing of Personal Data in Activities under the Legislation on Aliens and Citizenship (2001:720).</p>
<p>The proposed overall purpose of the act is to enable relevant authorities to process personal data effectively in their activities under the aliens and citizenship legislation and to protect people from violations of their personal privacy in connection with such processing. The act has been drawn up as a framework law. The basic provisions for the purpose of protecting the data subject against infringements of personal privacy are given in the act. Supplementary provisions are given in subordinate statutes.</p>
<p>The proposed act, which has been made technology-neutral, aims to make it possible for the authorities concerned to use modern and appropriate IT systems to enable the activities to be conducted as effectively as possible.</p>
<h2>Scope of the act</h2>
<p>Under the proposal, the Aliens Data Act will be applicable to the processing of personal data in activities under the aliens and citizenship legislation conducted by the Swedish Migration Agency, the Swedish Police Authority, the Swedish Security Service and Swedish missions abroad.</p>
<p>The act specifies more exactly and exhaustively what these activities consist of. With regard to the activities of the Swedish Migration Agency and Swedish missions abroad, the proposed application of the act will concern personal data processing relating to: 1. the entry of aliens into Sweden or some other state that belongs to the European Union or the European Economic Area, residence or work in Sweden, and exit from Sweden; 2. status declarations; 3. the reception of asylum seekers and other aliens; 4. financial assistance and allowances paid to aliens; 5. Swedish citizenship; 6. compensation from central government for costs relating to aliens; and 7. the settlement of aliens.</p>
<p>With regard to the activities of the Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Security Service, the proposed application of the act will concern personal data processing relating to aliens’ entry into, exit from, residence in or removal from Sweden.</p>
<p>However, under the proposal, certain personal data processing by the authorities concerned will fall outside the scope of the act even though, in and of itself, the act could have applied. This concerns, for example, the processing of personal data under the Schengen Information System Act (2000:344) and the EU regulations generally referred to as the VIS Regulation, the Visa Code and the Eurodac Regulation. Moreover, the act will not be applicable when personal data is processed pursuant to the Police Data Act (2010:361).</p>
<p>Like the Personal Data Act, it is proposed that the act apply when the processing of personal data is wholly or partly automated, and when the personal data is included in, or is intended to form part of, a structured compilation of searchable personal data or a compilation according to particular criteria. The proposed scope has therefore been widened somewhat compared with what applies under the current Aliens Data Ordinance, which primarily concerns the processing of personal data in various records of activities.</p>
<h2>Relationship to the Personal Data Act</h2>
<p>Under the proposal, the provisions in the new act will generally take precedence over the provisions of the Personal Data Act. However, certain provisions in the Personal Data Act will be applicable to activities under the aliens and citizenship legislation. These provisions are specifically indicated in the new act. They include the provisions of the Personal Data Act on the relationship to the principle of public access to official documents (Section 8), fundamental requirements concerning the processing of personal data (Section 9), the processing of data concerning personal identity numbers (Section 22), the transfer of personal data to third countries (Sections 33–35) and damages (Section 48).</p>
<h2>Control of personal data</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the authority undertaking processing or responsible for doing so should be the controller of personal data in the process. As an exception to this general rule, it is proposed that the Swedish Migration Agency should be the controller of personal data for automated processing of personal data by Swedish missions abroad.</p>
<p>In addition, it is proposed that the Swedish Migration Agency, the Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Security Service should be obliged to appoint one or more personal data representatives for the processing of personal data that they undertake or are responsible for undertaking.</p>
<h2>Purposes etc.</h2>
<p>Under the proposal, the processing of personal data pursuant to the Aliens Data Act will only be permitted if necessary for certain specifically stated purposes.</p>
<p>The purposes, which may be primary or secondary, will be clarified by the act.</p>
<p>The proposed primary purposes  of personal data processing by the Swedish Migration Agency, the Swedish Police Authority, the Swedish Security Service and Swedish missions abroad are as follows: 1. processing of matters or assistance by an authority in such matters in activities within the scope of the act (see above); 2. controls of aliens in connection with entry and exit and controls during residence in Sweden; 3. performance of working duties relating to the reception and settlement of asylum seekers and other aliens; 4. supervision, control, monitoring, planning of activities, production of statistics and pilot activities; or 5. fulfilment of a legal obligation to register or otherwise document personal data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is proposed that the Swedish Migration Agency be permitted to process personal data if this is necessary to retrieve decisions, judicial investigations and other legal information or information relating to conditions in other countries.</p>
<p>In addition, it is proposed that personal data processed in accordance with the above-listed primary purposes should also be permitted to be processed in accordance with the secondary purposes  listed below if this is necessary to make information available: 1. to another public authority or individual, if the data is disclosed pursuant to an act or ordinance; or 2. to a foreign authority, an EU body or an international organisation, if the disclosure of data follows from Sweden’s membership of the European Union or Sweden’s obligation to supply information under an international convention to which Sweden has acceded or an agreement with a foreign state or international organisation that has been approved by the Riksdag.</p>
<p>In an individual case, personal data processing will also be permitted to make information available for a purpose other than those now mentioned, provided that the purpose is not incompatible with the purpose for which the data was obtained (the ‘principle of finality’).</p>
<p>Separate regulations with more limited provisions on purposes are proposed for the records of fingerprints and photographs kept by the Swedish Migration Agency.</p>
<h2>Sensitive personal data</h2>
<p>The term ‘sensitive personal data’ refers to data that reveals a person’s race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership and data relating to health and sex life. Such data has to be processed extensively in the aliens and citizenship area. The Inquiry proposes that sensitive personal data should be permitted to be processed, in principle, for all the purposes for which processing is permitted. However, one condition, if the data subject has not given explicit consent to processing or made the data public in some obvious way, is that the data is absolutely essential for the purpose of the processing. The condition that the data must be absolutely essential underlines that it should be processed with caution, never as a matter of routine.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, large collections of information stored in a manner that makes them easily searchable by electronic means entail an increased risk of violations of individuals’ privacy. As a step in strengthening the protection of privacy, a provision is proposed in the act to the effect that access to personal data will be limited to what each official needs in order to carry out their duties. In addition, it is proposed that the Swedish Migration Agency, the Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Security Service be able to issue more detailed regulations on access to personal data for persons working in that authority. Under the Inquiry’s proposals, the Swedish Migration Agency should also be able to issue relevant regulations regarding data processed by automated means at Swedish missions abroad.</p>
<h2>Restrictions on searches</h2>
<p>As an additional measure to strengthen the protection of privacy, restrictions are proposed on the search terms that may be used when searching personal data for certain purposes in certain cases.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the use of sensitive personal data as search terms will be restricted to processing for the purpose of supervision, control, monitoring, planning of activities, production of statistics or pilot activities, and for data retrieval in certain cases. The Swedish Migration Agency needs to be able to use sensitive personal data as search terms for the production of certain statistics, for example, and in preparing activities in response to expected refugee flows.</p>
<p>With certain exceptions, it is proposed that personal data on violations of the law should not be permitted to be used as search terms.</p>
<h2>Electronic disclosure of personal data</h2>
<p>Even if electronic disclosure of personal data involves certain risks to privacy, the Inquiry considers that, with the exception of disclosure via direct access, there is no need to introduce special regulations on when electronic disclosure may occur. Consequently, no such provisions are proposed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that for certain special purposes, the Swedish Police Authority, the Swedish Security Service, Swedish missions abroad, the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, the Swedish Pensions Agency and the Swedish Tax Agency be allowed direct access to certain personal data processed by automated means by the Swedish Migration Agency. Exhaustive regulation of direct access is proposed.</p>
<p>The regulations on direct access have been designed bearing in mind the special risks that direct access entails for individuals’ privacy. Among other things, the receiving authorities must have a real need for the data and the data that may be made available is specified by statute as precisely as possible. In addition, before direct access is permitted, the Swedish Migration Agency must make sure that the receiving authority meets the authorisation and security requirements. Further requirements proposed are that access to the data at the receiving authorities be restricted to what the individual official needs to be able to fulfil his or her duties.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes some provisions overriding secrecy in consequence of direct access.</p>
<h2>Transfer of personal data to third countries</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has found that in certain cases personal data needs to be transferred to third countries irrespective of whether the individual has consented to this. A provision on further exceptions to the prohibition against transferring personal data to third countries enacted in Section 33 of the Personal Data Act is therefore proposed for these cases.</p>
<p>The proposed exception will mean that personal data may be transferred to a third country if this is absolutely essential for (1) the processing of a matter or assistance in such a matter; (2) controls of an alien in connection with entry or exit or controls during the alien’s stay in Sweden; or (3) processing undertaken for the purpose of retrieving decisions, judicial investigations and other legal information.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s opinion, personal data processed by automated means in public documents in the activities concerned should in general be retained or deleted as directed by the provisions of the Archives Act (1990:782), as is currently the case. As the Inquiry sees it, the argument in favour of retention is the public interest in the transparency of the activities. This interest is particularly manifested by researchers and journalists. Furthermore, the Inquiry considers it far from obvious that the interests of privacy are best served by destroying personal data. Moreover, in these activities it is often necessary to retrieve data from previous matters.</p>
<p>However, the Inquiry considers that exceptions should be made to this general rule in certain cases. Accordingly, exceptions to the provisions of the Archives Act are proposed for (1) the Swedish Migration Agency’s fingerprint and photograph records, where it is proposed that data be deleted in accordance with the current arrangements; (2) sensitive personal data processed for the purposes of supervision, control, monitoring, planning of activities, production of statistics or pilot activities, where it is proposed that this data be deleted immediately the processing is no longer necessary for any of the purposes stated; and (3) personal data processed by automated means by the Swedish Migration Agency because a public counsel, an interpreter, a translator or a language analyst may be unsuitable for future commissions, where it is proposed that this data be deleted after a short time.</p>
<p>To strengthen individual privacy, the Inquiry proposes that access to data that is no longer needed for the purposes stated in the act be limited by means of a provision on the detachment  of such data. The proposed provision will direct that personal data in automated data compilations that are used in the authorities’ day-today activities shall be detached when it is no longer needed for these activities. It is proposed that access to detached data be limited to persons who are in absolute need of the data in order to carry out their duties.</p>
<h2>Additional regulations</h2>
<p>Under the proposal, the new act will be a framework law containing only the basic provisions on protection of individuals’ personal privacy. The proposed act allows the possibility of regulations at a lower level. Such regulations may be issued with regard to the Swedish Migration Agency’s fingerprint and photograph records, access to personal data, direct access, transfer of personal data to third countries, detachment of data, deletion and security measures.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions</h2>
<p>The proposed date for entry into force of the new Aliens Data Act and Aliens Data Ordinance is 1 January 2016.</p>
<h2>Specific issues Registration of quality assessments</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposal means that the Swedish Migration Agency will be able to register data on the identity, special expertise and defects relating to public counsels other than members of the Swedish Bar Association and legal associates, interpreters, translators and language analysts. The term ‘defects’ refers chiefly to data on negligence, inadequacy and incompetence, but also data showing that a contractor has committed an offence or been declared bankrupt. Such defects can mean that a contractor is unsuitable for commissions. The registration of these types of data is intended to enhance the legal security of individuals in the asylum process. However, for reasons of integrity, it is proposed that data on defects be deleted after a short time.</p>
<h2>More efficient information exchange in the processing of residence permits for purposes of employment and work permits</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Migration Agency should be allowed direct access to certain personal data in the Swedish Tax Agency’s taxation database, the Swedish Enforcement Authority’s enforcement and collection database and the Swedish Social Insurance Agency’s and Swedish Pensions Agency’s social insurance database. The Swedish Migration Agency already has access to most of this data. What is new is the proposal that the Agency should now be given direct access to the data. The Inquiry has made a special analysis of the Swedish Migration Agency’s need for direct access to the data and the need for rules that give the individual good privacy protection in the event of direct access. These rules entail a responsibility for both the disclosing authority and the receiving authority.</p>
<h2>The right of the Swedish Migration Agency to access data in the Swedish Police Authority’s fingerprint records</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Migration Agency should have the right to access data from the Swedish Police Authority’s fingerprint records (the A file in the automated fingerprint identification system, AFIS) when checking fingerprints taken pursuant to Chapter 9, Section 8 of the Aliens Act (2005:716). This section of the Act allows the Swedish Migration Agency to take an alien’s fingerprints in certain cases. This is allowed, for example, if the alien is unable to provide proof of identity. The thinking behind the Inquiry’s proposal is that checking against the Swedish Police Authority’s fingerprint records improves the prospects of establishing the correct identity of the alien. On balance, the Inquiry considers that this interest outweighs the possible integrity risks that may be associated with this possibility.</p>
<h2>Liability for damages after controls of Schengen visas</h2>
<p>Under the provisions of Chapter 9, Section 8c of the Aliens Act, an alien is obliged to allow a policeman, a specially appointed passport official or an official at the Swedish Customs, the Swedish Coast Guard or the Swedish Migration Agency to take his or her fingerprints in order to check the alien’s identity and the genuineness of the Schengen visa by searching in the Visa Information System (VIS). A corresponding obligation also applies to an alien who is unable to prove his or her identity during entry or exit controls and who may</p>
<p>be checked against the VIS for identification purposes. After a control has been carried out, the fingerprints taken for control purposes must be destroyed immediately. This also applies to biometric data taken in connection with the control.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a regulation clarifying that it is the authority that has carried out the control that is responsible for the data being destroyed and that damages may be payable if the obligation to destroy the data is neglected.</p>
