<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>On 28 August 2014 the Government decided to appoint an inquiry chair to review the offence of rape. The inquiry was later reconstituted – through a decision on 13 November 2014 – as a cross-party committee of inquiry and has been given a further set of supplementary terms of reference. The committee has adopted the name of the 2014 Sexual Offences Committee.</p>
<p>Our remit has had three main parts. The first and most extensive part of our remit has been to make a review of the offence of rape . This part has specifically included:  carrying out  a review of case law in order to chart how the offence of rape has been interpreted and applied;  considering  whether a model of consent-based regulation should be introduced for rape;  considering  whether the penalty for the most serious cases of rape and rape of a child should be made more severe;  analysing  whether present legislation offers sufficiently strong protection against certain sexual abuse that takes place with the aid of modern technology via the internet; and  presenting proposals  for the drafting of special criminal liability for crimes of negligence regarding rape.</p>
<p>The second part of the remit has been to examine and analyse  how the law enforcement authorities investigate cases of rape and how the other parts of the judicial system deal with  such cases so as to then consider measures  to enable the judicial system to further improve its work in this area.</p>
<p>The third part of our remit has been to consider  whether measures can be taken to improve procedures  concerning the appointment of injured party counsel.</p>
<p>Our remit has also included presenting proposals for the legislative amendments or other measures required on the basis of the survey and analysis work we have done in these areas. A further part of our remit is to consider the potential impacts of our proposals.</p>
<h2>New sexual offences legislation Need for new sexual offences legislation</h2>
<p>The legislation on sexual offences has been the subject of two recent reviews, resulting in an extensive reform in 2005 and legislative amendments in 2013. On both occasions consideration was given to amending the legislation to base criminal liability on the absence of consent. In connection with the 2005 reform the main reason given against consent-based legislation was the risk that the focus on the injured party would increase if the law was drafted in that way. On that occasion there was no specific legislative proposal to consider and the Government took its decision against the background of an idea of “pure consent-based legislation”. Such legislation means that criminal liability is based solely on the absence of consent without giving any further instructions in the law as to what requirements are to be set for consent to be accepted (or, in other words, to be deemed to be valid).</p>
<p>In the legislative matter in 2013 it was emphasised that there must be very strong reasons for making fundamental changes to the legislation a short time after the 2005 reform had entered into force. At that time the Government took the view that the deficiencies in sexual offences legislation identified by the 2008 Sexual Offences Inquiry could be remedied by amending the existing legislation. Its fundamental design would therefore not be altered.</p>
<p>The review we have carried out has led us to draw the conclusion that the protection of sexual integrity, in the sense that acts that ought to be punishable are also punishable, appears to be comprehensive. In some situations, however, it is questionable whether the existing legislation ensures sufficiently strong protection under criminal law from certain acts. The cases we have identified as problematic are those where a sexual act has been performed with a person who does not want to take part in the act, but there has not been any coercion and the perpetrator has not exploited the person’s particularly vulnerable situation or position of dependency either. The same problem was pointed to as a deficiency in the legislation by the 2008 Sexual Offences Inquiry. In addition, the handling of what are called “virtual rapes” has, at any rate until relatively recently, been difficult to accommodate in the existing regulatory framework.</p>
<p>So, even though several amendments have been made to sexual offences legislation in the past decade, there are still situations where sexual integrity and self-determination are violated and where it is doubtful whether there is sufficiently strong protection from the violation under criminal law. Against this background we take the view that there is once again reason to consider whether to amend the legislation on sexual offences.</p>
<p>The need for change can be addressed in two ways. Either the present legislation can again be supplemented or clarified. Or, alternatively, the legislation can be amended so that it instead assumes that it is an offence to perform a sexual act with someone who is not participating voluntarily. In the choice between supplementing the present legislation and changing it completely, we have concluded that the law has to be changed. The reasons for this are, first , that in our view the fears that have been advanced as arguments against consent-based legislation in previous legislative matters can be handled by solid drafting work and, second , that there are several advantages to be gained by amending the law so as to draw the dividing line between punishable and non-punishable acts at whether a sexual act was performed involuntarily rather than coerced by some means or through the exploitation of a person's vulnerable situation (see section 5.2 for a more detailed review of this aspect).</p>
<p>Our proposal is thus that the framing of sexual offences should be altered by drafting the main provision of that chapter in such a way that criminal responsibility is borne by a person who performs sexual intercourse or another sexual act that, with regard to the seriousness of the violation, is comparable to sexual intercourse, with a person who is not participating voluntarily . A corresponding amendment is proposed for the provision on sexual coercion.</p>
<p>To avoid our proposal leading to unreasonable expectations that this change will result in more convictions, it should be stressed that there is no reason to assume that consent legislation will lead to any substantial difference in the number of convictions. The fact is that the evidential difficulties in the present legislation will remain the same with the regulation we propose. Just as before, the prosecutor will have the full burden of proof for their statement of the act. It may even be the case that, in purely statistical terms, the proportion of convictions may decrease in relation to the number of offences reported when these proposals are implemented. This is because there is reason to believe that the number of incidents reported will rise if our proposals are implemented. If that happens at the same time as the number of offences cleared up and prosecuted remains at the same level as today, the result will be that, in statistical terms, it will appear as if the number of convictions is falling. However, our proposal to introduce liability for negligence for some sexual offences may lead to a slight increase in the number of convictions (for more information about this proposal see below).</p>
<h2>Offence of rape to be replaced by offence of sexual abuse</h2>
<p>As we are now proposing sexual offences legislation that is not based on violence and coercion as prerequisites for crimes, the importance of changing the naming of the offences at the same time should not be underestimated. Our proposal is therefore that the terms rape, sexual coercion and rape of a child are removed and replaced by other names.</p>
<p>From a purely linguistic perspective it is questionable whether rape as the name of the offence ought not to already have been changed when the exploitation cases were added to the provision as part of the 2005 reform. In practice, the requirement for violence or threats on the part of the perpetrator was already removed at that point. Now that we are taking further steps away from requirements of violence and coercion, a continued use of rape as the name of the offence could give a misleading appearance that there is still a requirement that the act must have been carried out using violence or coercion. If the intention of the change is to express a clearly normative message there is much to be said for introducing new names for the most serious sexual offences at the same time. In the case of the offence of sexual coercion the linguistic reasons for changing the name of the offence are just as strong.</p>
<p>It could be argued that the offence of rape should be retained quite irrespective of whether or not there is any requirement stipulating the use of violence since the word has a clear meaning and import for the general public. However, our view is – given that there are so many opinions and prejudices surrounding what a “real rape” is – that there are much stronger reasons for changing the name of the offence. We therefore propose changing the names of the offences of rape and sexual coercion to sexual abuse  and sexual violation . The names of the acts formerly called rape of a child and sexual abuse of a child should also be changed to sexual abuse of a child  and sexual violation of a child . As a consequence of these proposals other crimes will also be given new names, for example the corresponding gross crimes. In this report the new names are used to describe the crimes.</p>
<h2>Participation in a sexual act must be voluntary</h2>
<p>With our proposal the means that used to be given as requirements for the offence in the provisions on rape and sexual coercion are removed. Instead the dividing line between a punishable and a nonpunishable act is drawn according to whether or not participation was voluntary.</p>
<p>The legislation we propose is usually referred to in the public debate as consent-based legislation. However, the term consent is already used in the Penal Code, and has, in that context, been given a definition that is not in line with the meaning that we think the term ought to have if used in connection with sexual offences. We have therefore used the term voluntariness  in the new provisions concerning sexual offences. This term is normative and can be given the meaning deemed appropriate by the legislator. Our proposal also differs from proposals made in the past since the text of the proposed law clearly sets out the cases in which participation is not considered to have been voluntary.</p>
<p>The proposed law states that the choice to participate must be expressed for participation to be considered voluntary. This means that to be accepted voluntariness must be communicated by word or deed. In practice this means that only a “yes” or active participation in the act can be interpreted as voluntariness on the part of the other person or persons participating. So, implicit (inner or tacit) consent will not be accepted. One important point is that there is no requirement that a person says “no” or actively shows their opposition to taking part in a sexual act. Nor can passivity be interpreted as voluntary participation.</p>
<p>An expression of voluntary participation is always limited in some sense to a particular occasion and to the sexual act for which the voluntariness has been expressed. If someone expresses their will to take part in a particular sexual act, it cannot be taken for granted that the person concerned also wants to take part in other sexual acts.</p>
<p>It is self-evident that a person can withdraw from their decision to take part in a sexual act at any time at all. But that change of mind must then be expressed by word or deed so that the other person or persons participating are able to perceive this change of attitude and stop the sexual act. In the light of what is now known about, for instance, frozen fright reactions, it may seem unreasonable to require that the person who no longer wants to take part in a sexual act must express this by word or deed. But for reasons of legal security this must be required of a person who has initially expressed a will to participate but has then changed their mind. However, this requirement only applies if the person previously expressed a will to take part in the sexual act at the time when the sexual act was commenced.</p>
<p>One consequence of the requirement that voluntariness must be expressed is that it will not be possible to express voluntariness in advance, for example in cases of sleep, unconsciousness or in another, similar situation. The reason for this is that it is, quite simply, not possible for a person who is asleep or is unconscious to express a change of mind in that situation.</p>
<p>The law should not say in detail how  voluntariness is to be expressed. It may certainly seem reasonable that everyone involved in sexual relations express orally that they want to take part. But sexual relations specifically are seldom preceded by a detailed discussion between the parties of what is going to take place. It may instead be the case that the relations develop gradually through the actions of the parties, for example by exchanging kisses, cuddles and caresses with one another. So this communication can be both direct and indirect. This means that legislation prescribing forms for how the parties have to express themselves would be regarded as unrealistic by many people and hard for the courts to apply. It is therefore left to the application of the law to determine how to assess this in each specific case.</p>
<h2>Circumstances meaning that no importance shall be attached to an explicit choice to participate</h2>
<p>It would be unreasonable for all expressions of voluntary participation to be accepted as expressions of a person’s right to self-determination. For the content of the new legislation to be clear and distinct, the law must specifically set out what circumstances mean that an explicit choice to participate will nevertheless not be accepted as voluntary participation by the legal system. Whether or not an expression of voluntariness is accepted should depend on whether some means has been used to “get a yes” from the other participants.</p>
<p>There are many advantages to having new legislation that does not differ too much from previous legislation, one being that then older case law can still also be applied to some extent to the new legislation. In our proposal the means that can under the current law result in criminal liability for rape, sexual coercion and sexual exploitation of a person in a position of dependency have therefore been given as circumstances that mean that no importance shall be attached to an expression of voluntariness. The same applies to the circumstances that result in an offence under the present legislation because the perpetrator has exploited a person's particularly vulnerable situation.</p>
<p>However, one starting point is that for it to be of any interest at all to make an assessment of whether or not an expression of voluntariness is valid, there must always be a requirement that  there is an expression of voluntariness. If there is no expression of voluntariness at all, for example because the injured party has been gripped by frozen fright or is so intoxicated that they have, in practice, been unable to express a choice to take part voluntarily, it is of no interest to make an assessment of whether or not to accept the voluntariness.</p>
<p>Our proposal means that the second paragraph of the provisions on sexual abuse and sexual violation should state that an expressed choice to participate in a sexual act is not voluntary if: 1. it is a result of assault, other violence or a threat of a criminal act or a result of a threat to prosecute or report another person for an offence or to provide detrimental information about another person; 2. the perpetrator improperly exploited another person being in a particularly vulnerable situation on account of grave fear, intoxication or other drug influence, illness, physical injury or mental disturbance or, in view of the circumstances, for some other reason; 3. the perpetrator induced the person to participate by grossly abusing that person being in a position of dependency on the perpetrator; or 4. the perpetrator deceived the person into participating by making themselves out to be someone known personally to that person or by exploiting that person’s error in that respect.</p>
<p>As just stated, the circumstances that mean that no importance is to be attached to an expressed choice to take part are virtually identical to the means and circumstances stated in the present provisions. There are, however, some differences.</p>
<p>In the first point there is a difference in that, for an expressed choice to participate voluntarily not to be accepted, there is no requirement that the person who performs the sexual act is the same as the person who exercised the violence or the threat against the injured party. So even a person who has not themselves exercised violence or a threat against the injured party can be punished as a perpetrator to the extent that they are aware that the injured party’s expression of voluntariness is a result of the violence or threat. This proposal means, for example, that a person who purchases a sexual service from a person who has been forced by violence or a threat to take part in sexual acts can be convicted of sexual abuse instead of purchase of a sexual service. A further change is that this point now includes both the means previously given in the provision on rape and those given in the provision on sexual coercion.</p>
<p>In the second point, sleep and unconsciousness have been removed from the previous list of situations that mean that the injured party may be in a particularly vulnerable situation. The reason for this is that it appears to be contradictory to retain sleep and unconsciousness while introducing a requirement that voluntary participation must be expressed by word or deed. This is, not least, because it will not be possible to express in advance a choice to participate voluntarily in a sexual act.</p>
<p>The third point means that criminal liability for exploiting a person in a position of dependency has been moved from being a separate penal provision to instead being a circumstance that means that no importance is to be attached to an expressed choice to participate. The requirements in the circumstance correspond to those previously given in the separate provision.</p>
<p>Finally, a fourth and completely new circumstance has been added. That circumstance will make it clear that particularly reprehensible sexual frauds are punishable as sexual abuse. The deceptions that the circumstance are intended to cover are those that mean that a person who has been deceived has not been able to understand which physical person, i.e. which body, the sexual act is being performed with. The deceptions referred to here are of the kind where the perpetrator makes out that they are a particular person, for example a partner, and then takes the place of that person. A punishable deception could also arise if a perpetrator performs a sexual act with a person who has, for some reason, limited possibilities of determining which person they are carrying out the sexual act with.</p>
<p>The detailed deliberations about the content of the different points and how they are intended to be applied are set out in section 5.5.3 and the explanatory notes to the proposed statutes.</p>
<h2>Sexual abuse that takes place on the internet, for example</h2>
<p>Case law has recently established that sexual offences shall not be deemed to be offences where the perpetrator has actually carried out the act and that sexual offences can be performed at a distance (see NJA [Supreme Court case reports]  2015 p. 501). To nevertheless ensure that there is no doubt that the protection of sexual integrity and self-determination is guaranteed even in cases where the perpetrator and victim are not in the same physical place, we propose that the provisions on sexual abuse and sexual violation clearly state that criminal responsibility is also imposed if the performance consists of a person who is not participating voluntarily carrying out the act on themselves or with another person. For the provisions about offences committed against children under fifteen years of age, who do not have competence to participate voluntarily in sexual acts, no reference is needed to whether or not their participation was voluntary. So all that has to be added to these provisions is that what was previously stated in the provision also applies if the performance consists of the child carrying out the act on itself or with someone else.</p>
<h2>An exceptionally gross offence is introduced for sexual abuse of adults and children</h2>
<p>It used to be unusual for offences to be divided into more than three degrees. However, in recent times this has become more and more common. The chief purpose of such a change is to influence the penalties imposed for serious offences so that they are more severe.</p>
<p>The present scale of penalties for gross rape extends from imprisonment for at least four years to imprisonment for at most ten years. But the statistics show that hardly any use is made of the upper part of the scale of penalties. At the same time, sexual abuse is an offence with a very strong protective interest. The offence causes severe harm to the victim but also to society. By introducing a further degree for the most serious sexual offences it could be possible both to achieve greater differentiation regarding the gross offences and more severe penalties for the most serious offences of all. Our proposal is therefore to introduce an offence of exceptionally gross sexual abuse of adults and children. The scale of penalties for the new offence should start at imprisonment for six years.</p>
<p>In assessing whether sexual abuse is to be assessed as exceptionally gross, special consideration should be given to whether the act caused exceptional suffering or an exceptionally great violation or whether the perpetrator displayed exceptionally great ruthlessness or brutality.</p>
<p>Acts that could typically result in an offence being assessed as exceptionally gross are acts where such a high level of violence was used that the victim’s life was in danger or when the act was carried out in a particularly painful or humiliating way. Offences in which the violence used means that permanent severe bodily injuries were inflicted on the victim should also be classed as exceptionally gross. An assessment of acts committed on a child should give special consideration to the young age of the child in addition to abovementioned circumstances. For very small children it can be assumed that penetration results in particularly great physical injuries, and this means that it ought often to be possible to class these cases as exceptionally gross.</p>
<h2>More severe view of sexual offences against children who have turned fifteen but not eighteen years</h2>
<p>Since the reform in 2005 children under fifteen years have stronger protection from sexual offences. Since these children are not competent to consent to participating in sexual acts, the starting point is that these acts are criminal. As stated, children who have turned fifteen but not eighteen years are not covered by this special protection. However, a child is in the custody of its parents or some other specially appointed custodian until the child turns eighteen years. A person is also a child up to eighteen years of age under the definition given in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It also follows from this Convention that children must be protected from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. It may therefore seem problematic that the protection from sexual abuse is poorer for children who have turned fifteen but not eighteen years than for younger children. In addition, the statistics show that young women aged 16–24 years run much greater risk than the rest of the population of being victims of sexual offences.</p>
<p>Before the 2005 reform the provision on rape stated that consideration was to be given to the young age of the victim when classifying the offence. But, as part of that reform, the special mention of the age of the victim as a criterion for assessing the seriousness of the offence was removed. The reason given was that this was a natural consequence of sexual offences against children being moved so that they were instead covered by the special provision on rape of a child. However, the preparatory works to the amendment stated that despite the change there could be reason for also assessing abuse of older children as gross. In the application of the law the interpretation of this point has turned out to be fairly restrictive. Against this background our proposal is that a circumstance should be added to the law to the effect that, when classifying an offence, special consideration shall be given to whether the offence has been aimed at a child. The term child thus means anyone who has not turned eighteen years.</p>
<p>This addition is intended to ensure that that the circumstance that a sexual offence has been committed against a child will have a clearer impact on the assessment of the particular case. But, in classifying an offence, an overall assessment must always be made of all the circumstances in the particular case. So the addition we are now proposing does not automatically mean that offences committed against a child under eighteen years of age must always be assessed as gross offences. For an offence to be assessed as gross, the seriousness of the act as a whole must, in an overall assessment, justify a more serious classification than an offence of the ordinary degree. So, low age in combination with other aggravating circumstances can contribute to the classification of an offence as gross.</p>
<p>However, it is also the case that an aggravating circumstance can contribute to the offence being assessed as more serious within a particular level of the offence. If an overall assessment does not result in the offence being classed as gross, it can still be assessed as having a higher penal value than otherwise within the scale of penalties for the degree of the offence that it is assessed as belonging to. For this reason, too, the introduction of the new criterion of seriousness can contribute to a more severe view of offences committed against young victims.</p>
<h2>Liability for negligence to be introduced for sexual offences</h2>
<p>There is justification for expanding the punishable area for sexual offences by introducing a liability for negligence for certain sexual offences. However, criminal responsibility should be restricted to the most serious violations, which are those covered by the provisions on sexual abuse of the ordinary degree, gross sexual abuse and exceptionally gross sexual abuse and on gross sexual violation.</p>
<p>An assessment about whether to consider liability for negligence requires, first , that the sexual act was not voluntary and, second , that the perpetrator did not have intent for the circumstance that there was no valid expression of voluntariness. So it is only when these two prerequisites have been met that an assessment can be made that the perpetrator was negligent.</p>
<p>The level of negligence proposed as punishable is actions deemed to be grossly negligent . In the first place the term gross negligence covers “conscious negligence”, i.e. cases where the perpetrator actually realised  that it may be the case that participation in a sexual act is not voluntary, but  still chose to perform the sexual act. If the perpetrator saw the risk that the other person was not participating voluntarily, then continuing the sexual acts is clearly punishable in our view. The term gross negligence also includes more reprehensible cases of unconscious negligence. The conduct that should, in our view, be covered by liability for negligence are the cases where the perpetrator could have done something to come to a realisation and it is also considered that they really  ought to have done what they could to come to a realisation.</p>
<p>We propose introducing liability for negligence as a separate provision in Chapter 6 of the Penal Code. The provision should state that a person who on account of gross negligence commits sexual abuse (of the ordinary degree or a gross or exceptionally gross offence) or a gross sexual violation is guilty of negligent sexual abuse  or negligent sexual violation  and shall be sentenced to imprisonment for at most four years.</p>
<p>As a result of the scope defined, both regarding which acts are covered and the degree of negligence, this criminal liability will apply to cases that are clearly punishable.</p>
<h2>Better support for the injured party in the legal process</h2>
<p>For a long time the legislator has given priority to strengthening the rights and access of crime victims to support, protection and financial compensation. One example is the injured party counsel, a lawyer appointed and paid by for the state to safeguard the rights of the crime victim (injured party) in investigations and legal proceedings after crimes.</p>
<p>To further ensure that the injured party is given good support during the legal process we now propose three amendments to the Injured Party Counsel Act.  The examination of whether to appoint an injured party counsel must take place  immediately  after a preliminary investigation has been opened or resumed in cases concerning sexual offences.  Stricter requirements  should be introduced concerning the expertise and suitability  of a person appointed as an injured party counsel.  The provision on  substitution , i.e. the right of a representative to appoint someone else to replace them when they have a temporary impediment, should be amended to state that an injured party counsel may not appoint someone else to replace them without having the permission of the court.</p>
<p>There is already a strong presumption in favour of appointing an injured party counsel at an early stage of a criminal investigation to provide support and assistance for the person who has been a victim of a sexual offence. Moreover, in several examinations an early appointment of an injured party counsel has proved to be a success factor in investigations of sexual offences. Despite this, investigations have repeatedly shown that injured party counsel are not appointed at an early state often enough during criminal investigations.</p>
<p>In order be able to improve the quality of criminal investigations, it should be made clear that it is virtually compulsory to already appoint an injured party counsel in the initial stage of a criminal investigation. To ensure this, we propose amending the Injured Party Counsel Act to state that the examination of the appointment of an injured party counsel must take place immediately after a preliminary investigation has been opened or resumed. So we are proposing a directive aimed at the point in time when consideration is to be given to appointing an injured party counsel. The requirement of an immediate examination means that the matter ought to come under consideration by the court at most a day or a couple of days after a decision has been taken to open or resume a preliminary investigation into sexual offences.</p>
<p>But there should still be some scope for the leader of the preliminary investigation not to submit a request for an injured party counsel to the court for examination at this early stage. The exception should, however, be applied restrictively, and in doubtful cases the prosecutor should submit a request for an injured party counsel to the court along with the possible reasons to the contrary so that the court is able to examine the matter.</p>
<p>We also think that stricter requirements should be set regarding the expertise and suitability of injured party counsel. The law should therefore state that only a person who is particularly suitable for the assignment in question on account of their knowledge and experience and of their personal qualities may be appointed. This proposal is made against the background that assignments as injured party counsel are often given to relatively inexperienced lawyers at law firms with or without members of the Swedish Bar Association. For the injured party counsel to be able to provide support for the injured party, and also for the counsel to have an equal standing with the prosecutor and the defence counsel, there is, in our view, reason to set stricter requirements concerning the experience and suitability of the injured party counsel in particularly sensitive cases such as in investigations of sexual offences and offences in close relationship, for instance. It should be specifically pointed out that it is the court appointing the injured party counsel that has a special responsibility to see that the counsel appointed not only meets the general qualifications for the appointment but is also suitable in the particular case.</p>
<p>Finally, we propose restricting the right for an injured party counsel to appoint another counsel to replace them through “substitution”. An appointment as an injured party counsel is – in the same way as an appointment as the public defence counsel of a suspect – a personal appointment. In order for the injured party counsel to be able to provide support for the injured party as intended, that person must have confidence in their counsel.</p>
<p>Under the present legislation an injured party counsel may appoint another representative to replace them as long as this does not result in a noteworthy increase in the costs in the case. But if the substitution would result in such an increase in costs, the permission of the court is required. For public defence counsel, in contrast, the permission of the court is always required for substitution. During the course of the investigation we have become aware that it is common for appointed injured party counsel to appoint another lawyer to replace them, and this has been experienced as very negative by the injured parties affected. The possibility of substitution should be retained, but should be restricted to bring it into line with what applies to public defence counsel.</p>
<h2>Examination of the handling of sexual offences by the judicial system</h2>
<p>The prospects of bringing legal proceedings vary between different kinds of offences. Sexual offences belong to the type of offences that can be particularly difficult to investigate. In many cases the offences are committed out of the public view. This means that the evidence is often restricted to the information given by the crime victim and the suspect. At the same time, the same requirements concerning legal security and evidence that apply to other types of offence are obviously applicable. For a prosecutor to be able to bring a prosecution they must be able, on good grounds, to expect a conviction. As a rule, to obtain a conviction the information given by the injured party must be supported by other evidence. This is the reason why it is of great importance to investigate sexual offences promptly and with high quality. It is, of course also of great importance from the perspective of the suspect that the investigation is conducted professionally and with high quality.</p>
<p>All the crimes reported cannot be cleared up. This applies irrespective of whether they are sexual offences or other offences. There are a number of reasons for this. Some reports are hard to investigate, for example because the report is made some time after the actual incident or because the perpetrator is not known. A preliminary investigation does not need to be opened if it is apparent that the crime cannot be investigated. In addition, some cases taken up by the police as, for example, reports of rape can later turn out to be another offence, for example sexual coercion or sexual molestation. It can, of course, also be the case that what has been reported is not an offence. So expectations that all reports of sexual offences will lead to convictions are not realistic.</p>
<p>But what everyone can expect is that the judicial system will always do its utmost to clear up reported offences. It is therefore important that the parties in the judicial system act with a high degree of professionalism; that they are offered access to and take part in training necessary to perform their tasks; and that there are enough resources and methodological support. A further crucial factor in achieving a satisfactory clear-up rate is that the legislator makes sure that the officials have the legal regulations needed.</p>
<p>The main authorities in the judicial system that handle matters of sexual offences are the general courts, the Swedish Prosecution Authority, the Swedish Police Authority and, to some extent, the National Board of Forensic Medicine. We have therefore limited our examination to these authorities. Health care services have an important function regarding the preservation of evidence in sexual offences. We have therefore chosen to examine that particular part of their role.</p>
<p>Our examination has been carried out by representatives of the Committee meeting or consulting in some other way with representatives of these various authorities and discussing, in that setting, how they work on sexual offences and what problems the authority itself has identified (where any have been identified). In addition, a large number of reports and analyses, training programmes and other material have been reviewed and analysed. This examination has resulted in the conclusions and proposals for action presented in this report.</p>
<h2>Health care services General account of our examination</h2>
<p>In the main, the work of the health care services in assisting the law enforcement authorities to preserve evidence in matters concerning sexual offences functions satisfactorily.</p>
<p>There are a number of health care facilities in the country that are aimed solely and directly at victims of sexual offences. These facilities are particularly well-equipped to provide good care of crime victims in combination with the careful execution of preservation of evidence for use in criminal investigations. There are also good possibilities of positive cooperation with the local police, which is probably of benefit to criminal investigations. However, it is not possible – and, in our view, not necessary either – to have special clinics for victims of sexual offences in the whole of the country. For natural reasons this would involve a relatively small number of such clinics, which would mean that many crime victims would have to travel great distances to be examined. Arrangements of that kind seem to be less suitable considering that the victim is often in a phase of acute shock. Instead, it is important to make sure that good care and preservation of evidence can be provided at existing emergency hospitals and health care facilities around the country.</p>
<p>In our examination we have also found that the reception of victims of sexual offences by health care services generally maintains a satisfactory level across the country. If the victim seeks emergency care, there are specialist gynaecologists at hospital emergency departments even in out-of-hours care. The evidence preservation kit produced by the National Centre for Knowledge on Men’s Violence against Women ensures that reliable and complete preservation of evidence can be carried out at the victim’s first contact with heath care, irrespective of where in the country, on what day or at what time that takes place. Since the guide that accompanies the evidence preservation kit also contains support about how to look after and treat the crime victim, we are also of the view that there are good possibilities of maintaining an even and satisfactory standard in the treatment of these victims across the country.</p>
<h2>Handling of samples</h2>
<p>There are certain problems regarding the handling of samples taken in evidence preservation. Some of these deficiencies are attributable to the work of the Swedish Police Authority, for example when the release of samples taken in health care is not requested. It has also emerged that for space reasons some clinics do not save samples for two years as recommended by the National Centre for Knowledge on Men’s Violence against Women. The reason why the recommended period is so long is that many crime victims choose not to make a report to the police right after the incident. If the samples have been thrown out by the time when the report is made, the possibilities of carrying out a crime investigation are much poorer. We therefore propose commissioning the National Board of Health and Welfare to review whether it is suitable to issue regulations requiring health care services to save samples from the evidence preservation kits for two years.</p>
<h2>Legal certificates</h2>
<p>An extensive reform of the handling of legal certificates [i.e. medical certificates in criminal matters] was carried out in 2006. The background to the reform, which gave the National Board of Forensic Medicine the main responsibility for issuing legal certificates, was the fact that these certificates had been of varying quality. During our examination quite a number of comments have been made about the present system for drawing up and obtaining legal certificates. Some of these comments relate to who is in an appropriate position to issue legal certificates, especially in matters concerning sexual offences. Other comments concern the question of whether enough legal certificates are obtained and whether this may, in that case, be related to the fact that a charge has to be paid for the certificates, at least when they are obtained from the National Board of Forensic Medicine.</p>
<p>The reform implemented in 2006 has not been evaluated. We have been unable to carry out a deeper review of the legal certificate reform within the framework of our remit. We also take the view that it would be inappropriate to carry out such a review without the authority responsible for the certificates, i.e. the National Board of Forensic Medicine, being represented. We therefore propose commissioning the National Board of Forensic Medicine to conduct a review of the legal certificate reform in consultation with other authorities that have knowledge and experience of legal certificates.</p>
<h2>Swedish Police Authority</h2>
<h2>General account of our examination</h2>
<p>The examination we have carried out shows that there are problems in the handling of matters concerning sexual offences by the Swedish Police Authority. Several of the problems have already been identified by the Authority, which has also adopted certain measures to rectify the problems.</p>
<p>In the Swedish Police Authority it is essential to set priorities between different matters to ensure that existing resources are used in the best possible way. But in the case of investigations into sexual offences such priorities often result in these investigations having to stand aside for investigations of other offences. At present just under 15 per cent of rapes reported to the police lead to a prosecutor bringing a prosecution for an offence. The handling of these matters in the Swedish Police Authority accounts for the great bulk of this dropout. At the same time, relevant knowledge and methods are available regarding how to work on investigations of sexual offences in the Authority to make them succeed. But there are great differences in terms of how well these methods have been implemented in the organisation. There are good examples of units that do successful work, but also quite a number of examples of the opposite.</p>
<p>As stated initially, measures have been taken in the Swedish Police Authority to rectify the deficiencies in the handling of sexual offences identified by the Authority itself. One such measure is the decision to set up a development centre whose tasks include working on developing methods for investigating sexual offences. However, it is currently too early to say anything about what results may follow from the decisions made or measures taken in the Swedish Police Authority.</p>
<p>So the Swedish Police Authority needs to continue working on the problems identified. It is also important that the Authority ensures that enough resources are allocated to investigations of sexual offences and that these offences are given a clearly defined place in its organisation. If this is not done, there is a clear risk that investigations of sexual offences will be given lower priority than investigations of other offences. Finally, it is also important that the Swedish Police Authority continues to work actively to improve the attitudes still found regarding sexual crime.</p>
<p>To ensure that the work in the Authority in these areas moves forward, the Swedish Police Authority should be instructed to provide regular reports on the measures taken. It is also important to ensure continuously that the working methods adopted reach out to the whole of the organisation. The results of these measures should also be monitored and followed up in an appropriate way.</p>
<h2>Preliminary investigation leaders in investigations of sexual offences</h2>
<p>When a sexual offence is reported, it is, as a rule, important to take certain investigative measures promptly. This applies, for example, to the examination of the crime scene and the preservation of evidence on the injured party. It is also important to appoint an injured party counsel at an early stage. Despite this, it has turned out that relevant investigative measures are not always taken at an early stage. It has, for example, emerged that preliminary investigation leaders in the police often make their own early appraisals of evidence in investigations of sexual offences. If they then make the assessment that the matter will not lead to a prosecution or a conviction, it is often the case that no further investigative measures are taken in the matter.</p>
<p>In our view, the quality of preliminary investigations in general would improve if, as a general rule, a prosecutor was the preliminary investigation leader of all investigations of sexual offences. Against this background we propose commissioning the Swedish Police Authority to consider, in consultation with the Swedish Prosecution</p>
<p>Authority, whether the Authority’s regulations and general advice on the leadership of preliminary investigations in criminal matters should be amended so that, as a general rule, a prosecutor takes over the leadership of the preliminary investigation when it concerns sexual offences.</p>
<h2>The internal organisation of the Swedish Police Authority</h2>
<p>Recently it has become increasingly common for sexual offences to take place on the internet. There have not been that many cases that have been investigated and led to a prosecution, but several of them have been very extensive and therefore very resourceconsuming. It is also highly likely that the number of offences of this type will increase in the future.</p>
<p>It has been decided in the new police organisation that all sexual offences, apart from child pornography offences and procuring, will be investigated as local police matters. So, this also applies to abuse that takes place on the internet. The arrangements put in place appear to be less than well-considered. A better arrangement would be to handle these matters at regional level in the Authority.</p>
<p>The reason for doing so is that special problems are associated with offences that take place on the internet. One such problem is the constant changes in conditions on the internet. If these investigations were centralised, this would, for instance, have the advantage that officers working with this type of offences would be better able to keep up to date with the constant developments concerning, for example, new applications and chat sites. Offences that take place on the internet do not have any geographical base in Sweden either and the injured parties are often to be found at very different places in, and probably also outside, the country.</p>
<p>The Swedish Police Authority is currently considering working on the basis of the kind of organisational change we would like to see by introducing both one national and several regional centres for IT offences, which would then handle sexual offences that take place on the internet. A final decision on such a change had not been taken when this report went to press. We therefore propose commissioning the Swedish Police Authority to make regular reports on the progress of work to ensure that the Authority has the best organisational arrangements in place to handle investigations of sexual offences in which the internet is the crime scene.</p>
<h2>Other problems identified</h2>
<p>During our examination we have been informed that investigators at the Swedish Police Authority often run into problems during crime investigations regarding crimes taking place on the internet. Some of these problems have to do with the fact that the legislation has still to be updated in the light of modern technology. This applies, for example, to the search provisions and the provisions that permit the seizure of information. There are also a number of problems linked to the possibility of tracing a suspected perpetrator by means of their “IP number”.</p>
<p>We have had neither the remit nor the time to take on these issues as part of the remit the Committee has had. However, in spring 2016 the Government appointed two new inquiries in this area. Some of the tools we consider that the law enforcement authorities currently lack may be proposed by the inquiries appointed. However, the problems linked to the possibility of tracing a suspected perpetrator by means of an IP number have still to be addressed.</p>
<h2>Swedish Prosecution Authority</h2>
<p>The Swedish Prosecution Authority has a sufficiently well-functioning organisation for handling matters regarding sexual offences.</p>
<p>For instance, through its special development centres the Swedish Prosecution Authority has a well-developed organisation for producing methodological support and conducting legal development.</p>
<p>The Authority’s Development Centre in Gothenburg is responsible for the legal monitoring and follow-up of questions regarding sexual offences. It also supervises the Authority’s operational activities.</p>
<p>These operational activities function well since individual prosecutors handling sexual offences work in specialised teams. The prosecutors in the teams are given special training and older and more experienced colleagues provide support for younger prosecutors on the team.</p>
<h2>Special deliberations on the investigation of sexual offences where the internet is the crime scene</h2>
<p>The Swedish Police Authority is already considering an organisational change regarding the handling of sexual offences that take place on the internet. Similarly, the Swedish Prosecution Authority should analyse how its organisation functions when it comes to handling these offences. There may be reason to consider whether these investigations should also be handled in a more concerted way in the Swedish Prosecution Authority. One reason is that criminal investigations of sexual offences that take place on the internet are a relatively new case type and that it is therefore essential that the prosecutor responsible not only has special knowledge of sexual offences but is also familiar with IT law and the problems caused by the internet being the crime scene. Moreover, this type of matter tends to grow into very extensive investigations, many parts of which require fast decisions about investigative measures. At present the prosecutor responsible tends to retain their duties at their public prosecution office while the extensive investigation of sexual offences on the internet is in progress.</p>
<p>We therefore propose commissioning the Swedish Prosecution Authority to consider whether there is a need of a better organisation for investigations of sexual offences that take place with the internet as the crime scene.</p>
<h2>Courts of Sweden</h2>
<h2>General account of our examination</h2>
<p>The Courts of Sweden has a sufficiently well-functioning organisation for handling matters regarding sexual offences.</p>
<p>The long-term work done on treatment issues in the Courts of Sweden has led to several improvements for people who have to appear as a party or witness in, for example, cases regarding sexual offences. The climate for hearings in these trials has improved, and this means that people being examined are better able to provide their information. This then leads to the courts having a better basis for their decisions.</p>
<p>There is no specific specialisation for judges, which means that, as a rule, all judges in general courts handle all types of cases and matters heard there. But individual judges are offered a training programme at the Judicial Training Academy (part of the National Courts Administration) and are also able to take part in training offered by external companies as well. The training programmes of the Judicial Training Academy contain both training dealing explicitly with sexual offences and training of importance for strengthening the individual judge in their role as the presiding judge.</p>
<h2>Work on treatment issues should continue</h2>
<p>Most people who visit a court as a defendant, injured party or witness have never been in contact with a court before, or may only have had such contact on a few occasions. Irrespective of what role a particular person has in the proceedings, many find the visit unpleasant. Feelings of uncertainty, stress and nervousness are common before an appearance in court.</p>
<p>In many respects, the way in which the treatment of parties and witnesses functions in a case concerning sexual offences is even more important than in other cases. The people involved have to talk about private matters in front of strangers, the injured party considers that they have been the victim of a very serious violation and the defendant often risks a long term of imprisonment. It is therefore particularly important in that situation that the proceedings in the court can be conducted in line with professional standards. In these circumstances the presiding judge is a very important person. It is the presiding judge who is responsible for ensuring that the proceedings can be conducted in a way that causes as little discomfort as possible to the people involved.</p>
<p>The work carried out on treatment matters in the Courts of Sweden has been successful and has led to many improvements for people who have to appear at a trial. Despite this, information has emerged in our examination about deficiencies in various quarters. Work on treatment matters is a constant process and it is also important for this work to continue. The National Courts Administration should therefore continue to have the commission of supporting, monitoring and following up treatment work at the individual courts. This monitoring and follow-up work should also establish whether there are particular courts that are in more need than others of support in their work.</p>
<h2>The handling of irrelevant questions to the injured party – the judge should be strengthened in their role as the presiding judge</h2>
<p>One question that merits additional attention in this context is how to handle questions to the injured party about previous sexual experience and other matters. In Canada and Scotland, for instance, putting questions to the injured party about their previous sexual experience is, as a main rule, not permitted. In Swedish law there is an obligation for the presiding judge to dismiss questions to parties or witnesses that are deemed to be irrelevant or that are confusing or improper in some other way. Questions regarding the injured party’s previous sexual experience are to be regarded as irrelevant in many cases. But we have learned through our examination that such questions are nonetheless relatively common in Swedish courts. Despite this, we have chosen not to present any proposals restricting the right to put questions to the injured party.</p>
<p>The main argument against such an arrangement is the importance of the defendant being given a fair trial. Questions that the injured party experiences as tough must often be put and it is not always easy to decide in advance which questions are important and which are irrelevant. It is also the case that questions perceived by the injured party as violating and therefore irrelevant need not always be that.</p>
<p>We consider instead that this question should be addressed by strengthening the individual judges in their role as the presiding judge and by them placing greater focus on questions that are of such a kind that they should be dismissed. It is important that the courts and individual judges have a good knowledge of the applicable regulations and that they fulfil the role they have when it comes to preventing questions to the injured party that obviously have nothing to do with the matter or are confusing or improper in some other way.</p>
<p>In this area we consider that the Judicial Training Academy has an important role to play by providing relevant training for judges.</p>
<p>Recently there has been greater focus among judges on the standing and role of the presiding judge. Many judges are interested in professional development in their role as a judge and that means that the Judicial Training Academy should work actively to meet the existing interest and needs by, for instance, giving as many judges as possible the chance to participate in the courses offered in this area. Against this background we take the view that the National Courts Administration should be commissioned, through the Judicial Training Academy, to review and develop the training offered to more experienced judges in particular regarding the role of the judge, for instance.</p>
<h2>General deliberations about the need for education and training in society</h2>
<p>When the media cover judgments regarding sexual offences, demands are often made for better training of judges. In our examination of the courts we have pointed to certain training needs. But, in our view, the need for education and training in matters specifically concerning attitudes and prejudices about sexual offences, violence in close relationships, the reactions of crime victims and special problems that, for example, LGBT people run into in these respects should not be limited to judges. Education and training in these (and other closely related) issues should be offered at a much earlier stage than when a lawyer has just been given a permanent appointment as a judge. In addition, training should be reinforced as early as in university law training. There should also be more discussion of these questions with children and young people at school. This is, not least, against the background of the development we are seeing of abuse taking place with the internet as the crime scene. Unlike training aimed solely at judges, more education in school and on university law programmes would mean that all lawyers, including those who later work as, for example, prosecutors or attorneys, would know more about questions concerning for example sexual violence and violence in close relationships.</p>
<p>Presenting concrete proposals about changes in compulsory and upper secondary school syllabuses or in the degree regulations for university law programmes is outside the remit given to the Committee. Nor has there been sufficient time, in the period available to the Committee, to present carefully considered proposals in this area As a result, we cannot present any such proposals and the matter must instead be prepared in some other way.</p>
<h2>Impacts of the proposals</h2>
<p>Our proposals will mainly affect people who are suspected of or being prosecuted for sexual offences, people who are victims of sexual offences, the authorities in the judicial system and people who are engaged as defence counsel and injured party counsel. Certain other authorities, such as the National Council for Crime Prevention, the National Board of Health and Welfare, the National Board of Forensic Medicine and the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority are also affected by our proposals.</p>
<h2>Financial impacts</h2>
<p>The proposed amendments to the legislation on sexual offences will result in increased costs for the authorities in the judicial system, in particular. In the short term these costs can be accommodated in the current appropriations of these authorities. After the legislation has been in force for some time, the impacts will need to be evaluated and analysed in detail.</p>
<p>The proposals we have presented as a result of our examination of the handling of reports of sexual offences by the judicial system will result in greater costs for the authorities affected. But these costs are no higher than can be accommodated in the existing appropriation of each authority.</p>
<p>The proposed amendments to the Injured Party Counsel Act will probably result in increased costs for counsel.</p>
<h2>Other impacts</h2>
<p>Our proposals can also be expected to have positive effects on crime-prevention work. In the long term the proposals ought to be capable of leading to a slight decrease in crime.</p>
<p>The proposals in our report can also be expected to have a positive effect on achieving gender equality. The statistics show that about 96 per cent of people who report that they have been the victims of a rape are women and 98 per cent of those suspected of the offence are men. We assess our proposal to amend the legislation on sexual offences as an important step towards a more gender-equal society. If our proposals are implemented and followed up with education, training and information in schools and the rest of society, we assess it as likely that the proposals can – at least in the long term – result in norms and attitudes to sexuality and sexual contacts changing so that sexual violence in society decreases.</p>
<p>We make the assessment that the proposals presented in this report will not adversely affect the working conditions of small businesses, their competitiveness or other conditions affecting them in relation to larger businesses.</p>
<h2>There are needs of special information, education and training in connection with entry into force</h2>
<p>We have been clear that more convictions should not be expected solely as a result of the proposal to amend the legislation on sexual offences. For these proposals to have an effect they should be followed up by special information, education and training of various kinds. Staff at the law enforcement agencies affected by the proposals will have a need for certain information support. There is also a need to aim special information, education and training at the rest of society, and young people in particular, when the proposals enter into force.</p>
<p>Various authorities, including the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority and the National Centre for Knowledge on</p>
<p>Men’s Violence against Women, should be commissioned to produce such information, education and training programmes.</p>
