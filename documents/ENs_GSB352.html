<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The assignment</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s assignment in relation to basic cashier services has primarily involved: – analysing and assessing the needs of society as regards basic cashier services and, on the basis of the assessment, taking a position on whether the State should continue to be responsible for the services, – taking a position on whether Posten should be the provider of cashier services and, if this is not the case, suggesting other forms of ensuring the provision of cashier services and indicating the legislation that is needed for this purpose, and – estimating the cost of a future solution that is acceptable from a  socio-economic and competition perspective, and that meets reasonable demands for accessibility.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The background to the financial services provided by Posten AB and previously Postverket is the evolution from its Postal Savings Bank, the establishment of PK Bank when the Postal Savings Bank was separated from Postverket, to the corporatisation of Postverket and the introduction of the Postal Services Act (1993:1684), and the subsequent sale of Postgirot to Nordbanken. In 2001 the Basic Counter Service Act (2001:1276) was passed. The postal and cashier service networks were separated and since 2002 cashier services have been operated by Svensk Kassaservice AB (Swedish Cashier Service), which is part of the Posten Group.</p>
<h2>Basic cashier service</h2>
<p>Swedish Cashier Service currently provides a range of cashier services through its own standalone outlets, partner outlets, rural letter carriers and post bags. The 644 outlets run by Swedish Cashier Service are located in former post offices that have been converted into cashier service offices or in other locations; in some cases, Swedish Cashier Service and Posten are still jointly located.</p>
<p>Swedish Cashier Service currently has agreements with a total of 343 business operators who provide the services of Swedish Cashier Service on its behalf (partners).</p>
<p>In light of declining revenues and a shrinking customer base, Swedish Cashier Service decided in April 2003 to cut the number of outlets by 199 as a step towards breaking even in 2005. According to Swedish Cashier Service, these cuts are to be implemented by 30 June 2004. Of the outlets to be closed, 168 are Swedish Cashier Service outlets and 31 are partner outlets.</p>
<p>Swedish Cashier Service provides the following services: – Bank deposits and withdrawals – Payment via postal giro and bank giro – Payment orders via postal giro and bank giro – Overseas payments – Daily business receipt management – Domestic money orders – Payment of foreign money orders</p>
<p>Swedish Cashier Service and previously Posten have long experienced that the volume of transactions for all services they provide has declined. Over the last five-year period, the number of transactions in total has dropped, on average, by 16 per cent per year.</p>
<p>Basic cashier service reported varying results for the period 1999–2003. The analysis shows that income including public funding amounted to SEK -235 and -590 million, while the annual costs to the State have varied between SEK 700 million and SEK 1 050 million including restructuring costs. This represents an accumulative total cost for the State of approximately SEK 4.2 billion for the entire period. State financial support to Posten in 1999 and 2000 amounted to SEK 200 million per year, and has since then risen to SEK 400 million.</p>
<p>An analysis of Swedish Cashier Service’s results in relation to the number of transactions shows that the costs to the State have risen continuously during the period regardless of which key indicator is used. In 1999 the cost to the State per transaction was SEK 9, and by 2003 it had risen to SEK 20.</p>
<h2>Market development for financial services</h2>
<p>Niche banks and other providers of banking-type services have created greater diversity in the market. This greater diversity, coupled with technological advances, has reduced the need for customers to go to the bank. Rather, consumers are offered ever better access via electronic channels through which they have round-the-clock access to simple and customised services. The increased use of computers and the Internet has sped up the development of Internet banking services.</p>
<p>The banks have used pricing strategies to try to encourage their customers to use telephone banking, bank giro, the Internet and other more cost-effective solutions. The trend in recent decades has been to reduce the number of branches and to transform existing branches offering manual cashier service into advisory branches with limited over-the-counter cashier services. Despite the major banks reducing their network of branches in recent years, there is much to indicate that the pace of reductions has been halted. Compared with other channels, over-the-counter errands are the most costly transactions for the bank and the customer. For example, a frequent customer at Swedish Cashier Service who pays two bills and cashes one postal cheque per month pays about SEK 1 200 per year for this service. Swedish Cashier Services’ prices for cashier services are in line with those of the major banks.</p>
<p>To withdraw cash from their bank accounts, customers can choose to use their bank cards in automatic teller machines or point-of-sales terminals. It is also possible for customers to go to the bank or to a Swedish Cashier Service outlet to withdraw cash over the counter. However, this has declined dramatically in recent years as customers have chosen other options. In 2002 cash management accounted for approximately 3 % of the total number of withdrawal and payment transactions.</p>
<p>As regards payment services, giro payments are the dominant form of payment in terms of transaction value and transaction volume, and in 2002 accounted for 50 % of the total transaction volume. Electronic giro represents the largest share of giro payments and has grown rapidly in recent years. This has occurred at the expense of paper giro, which over the same period has decreased.</p>
<p>The number of credit or debit card transactions has increased markedly since the mid-1990s. Bank card transactions account for the largest increase during the period with a growth of 145 %. Developments on the bank card market are closely associated with the cash market, as they are substitutes for each other.</p>
<p>According to statistics from Statistics Sweden, 40 % of the population aged between 16 and 74 used the Internet to do their banking in 2003 .  In mid-2003 the banks had a total of 5.1 million Internet customers, representing an increase of 50 % since 2001 .  Of these, 91 % were private individuals.</p>
<p>Cash payments, however, still account for a large number of transactions, despite a decline in recent years due to the increased use of bank cards and electronic transfers.</p>
<p>Compared with other countries, Sweden has come a long way as regards the transition from manual cashier service to new alternatives.</p>
<h2>Cashier services in several other countries</h2>
<p>Our international survey has focused on European countries. We have studied France, the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as the Nordic countries.</p>
<p>It is still most often the Post Office that, in addition to its core postal services, provides financial services. Often, the Post Office also operates banking activities within its group of companies.</p>
<p>The natural link between the Post Office and financial services originates from customers being able to send money through the Post Office in the form of money orders, and later, from money transmission services through the postal giro system. In recent years, however, many Post Offices have stopped offering financial services, often in conjunction with the sale of postal giro operations. Essentially, technological advances and Internet banks are the reason the natural link with the Post Office no longer exists. In other cases, cooperation with banks has developed once the postal giro arm has been sold, in order to make the best possible use of the counters’ network.</p>
<p>Of the countries mentioned above, only Norway was found to have legislation concerning cashier services. We can also note that no state financial support for financial services provided by Post Offices was available in any of the countries we have studied.</p>
<h2>Society’s need for basic cashier services</h2>
<p>From a geographical perspective, only people living in areas without commercial alternatives have a direct need for services guaranteed by the State, today in the form of Swedish Cashier Service. Half a million people currently use Swedish Cashier Service in these areas, and an estimated 75 000 use Swedish Cashier Service as their main alternative. These 75 000 people are an approximation of the group that has no practical manual alternative for their cashier service errands. Other customers mainly use other channels for payment, deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<p>The inquiry has also studied the needs of certain groups that use Swedish Cashier Service more often than others. These groups are young people/students, pensioners, asylum seekers, immigrants, small enterprises, voluntary associations/organisations, people who are denied relations with banks and people with disabilities. These groups represent a relatively large share of the total population even if consideration is given to the fact that an individual may belong to more than one of the groups, for example, a pensioner and immigrant. Many people in these groups use cashier services today but the analysis shows that this is the main alternative for only a small number of them and even fewer do not have access to another physical alternative. The number of customers in the special needs groups who cannot solve their cashier errands in any other way than through Swedish Cashier Service is currently estimated at about 100 000.</p>
<p>An understanding of society’s total need for manual cashier services emerges if the geographical need is considered along with the identified needs of the special groups. This estimate shows that in 2004 some 175 000 people lack a manual alternative to the services offered by Swedish Cashier Service.</p>
<p>According to the report, the most realistic assessment is that the number of transactions will continue to decline at the same historical rate, i.e. by at least 15 % per year. This means that in 2008 the number of transactions at Swedish Cashier Service will be approximately 19 million, all else being equal, and in the market as a whole 32 million manual bank and payment transactions will be carried out.</p>
<p>The report has developed cost estimates based on five scenarios. The estimate are based on, among other things, the assumptions we have made about volume trends. The five scenarios are:</p>
<p>The results of our estimates show that the only scenario that represents a stable cost trend is Scenario 3, the procurement alternative.</p>
<h2>Deliberations and proposals The extent of the State’s responsibility</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s initial assessment is that basic payment services should be the responsibility of the State. This should include money transmission services, cash withdrawals and daily business receipt management for business operators and voluntary organisations.</p>
<p>The way in which the services are provided should be able to be adapted over time to the needs of the various groups. The trend in society to reduce cash management should therefore not be hindered.</p>
<p>We are also of the view that everyone in society should have access to basic payment services. We consider that it is up to the market to bring this about. The State’s task is to see to it that the market takes its responsibility.</p>
<p>The State’s responsibility is to ensure access to basic payment services at reasonable prices throughout the country.</p>
<p>In areas where the market meets the demands for basic payment services, we consider that the State should not take any measures to increase accessibility. The State’s responsibility for payment services should therefore be restricted geographically to places and urban areas where it is not commercially viable to provide these services and where no other comparable alternative exists. In rural areas, we consider that basic payment services should be available through rural mail carriers, if they are not provided in any other way.</p>
<h2>Political objective of basic payment services</h2>
<p>On the basis of the standpoints that we have taken as regards the extent of the State’s responsibility, we propose one policy objective for basic payment services. The following wording is suggested:</p>
<p>All citizens shall have access to basic payment services at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>We propose that the policy objective be established by the Riksdag.</p>
<h2>Task of reaching an industry agreement on access to payment services as an additional account service</h2>
<p>To ensure that the market takes its responsibility to enable all citizens access to payment services, we propose that an inquiry be given the task of trying to bring about an industry agreement so that institutes that undertake to accept deposits included in the guarantee for deposits covered by the Act (1995:1571) on deposit guarantee shall provide certain payment services as additional services, e.g. cards or cheques, linked to the account on reasonable terms to depositors who request these services, if there are no specific reasons for not doing so.</p>
<p>If the inquiry does not succeed in reaching an industry agreement on access to such payment services, the reasons for this should be presented. The inquiry in this case should also propose the measures that it considers necessary for ensuring that payment services are available to everyone as additional services to accounts covered by the deposit guarantee. If the inquiry considers that legislation is necessary, the proposal should include draft legislation.</p>
<h2>Who should provide the basic payment services?</h2>
<p>In the legal analysis, the inquiry considers that basic payment services are public interest services. Compensation from the State for providing these services shall be offered on the condition that it either does not constitute State aid under article 87 (1)of the EC Treaty or, if it does, that it is compatible with the common market under article 86 (2) of the Treaty.</p>
<p>The inquiry’s legal analysis shows that the present solution of a state-owned company as the principal actor and provider of basic cashier service implies certain legal complications since in addition to the Basic Counter Service Act consideration must be given to the Public Procurement Act, the Elections Act and Community law in the areas that affect the State’s ability to commit itself to a state-owned public service and to provide financial support for the service.</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the Basic Counter Service Act (2001:1276) be abolished and cease to have effect on 1 July 2006. Before this, it should be possible to begin phasing out cashier services as of 1 January 2006.</p>
<p>To ensure that basic payment services are provided in rural areas, we also propose that the statement of activities in the Articles of Association of Posten AB specify that the company shall offer the intended provider of basic payment services through rural mail carriers the task of providing the services. The operations shall not be conducted for profit-making purposes. In addition, Posten AB itself or via a subsidiary shall be permitted to provide payment services for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>The inquiry considers, following talks with banks and retailers, that it should be possible to find actors that in exchange for payment are prepared to offer basic payment services in areas where no commercial alternatives exist.</p>
<p>Against this background, we propose a new regime by which the National Post and Telecom Agency be commissioned by the Government to procure basic payment services. Procurement should be for places and urban areas where it is not commercially viable to provide these services and where no other comparable alternative exists. The National Post and Telecom Agency should be able to prepare for the agreement as of 1 July 2005. The procurement process should be completed and the agreement come into force by 1 January 2006 at the earliest and 1 July 2006 at the latest.</p>
<h2>Special measures for the groups that need protection</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes a range of measures to safeguard the interests of the groups that need protection: – The Swedish Consumer Agency should be assigned to conduct an information and education campaign to help the groups that need protection access new, easy and  cost-effective payment services. – The National Social Insurance Board should be assigned to find a new payment solution for  old-age pensioners without a bank account in cooperation with the Swedish National Debt Office. – The Swedish National Debt Office should be given the task of analysing if the existing framework agreement for State transfers can be used by the Swedish Migration Board, or alternatively assist the Swedish Migration Board in negotiating a new agreement with a credit institution. – The National Post and Telecom Agency’s task to procure extended cashier services for elderly people and people with disabilities should be changed to cover basic payment services.</p>
<h2>Need for and design of an appropriate system for monitoring society’s need for basic payment services</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the Swedish Consumer Agency be commissioned by the Government to monitor that the basic payment services match the needs of society.</p>
<h2>Impact of the proposals</h2>
<p>Our impact assessment estimates, based on Scenario 3 (procurement scenario), our calculations and talks with different actors, that the cost of the inquiry’s proposals will amount to between SEK 200 million and SEK 300 million per year. In addition, there is the cost of the proposed tasks for the National Post and Telecom Agency and the Swedish Consumer Agency. This will result in a reduction in the state appropriation as of 2007. Further, we propose that the appropriation be transferred from current expenditure area 22 Communications  in the Ministry of Industry, Employment and Communications, to expenditure area 2 Economy and Financial Administration  in the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Regarding the regional impacts, we consider that the inquiry’s proposals ensure that the need for basic payment services is met from a regional perspective, as the services will be procured in areas where no commercial alternatives exist.</p>
<h2>Closing comments</h2>
<p>The restructuring as proposed by the inquiry presupposes that Posten, Swedish Cashier Service and the banks currently using Swedish Cashier Service cooperate to ensure that customers receive information and support in connection with the changes.</p>
<p>In our overall assessment we consider that Sweden, through the inquiry’s proposed solution, will be in a very good position to join the leading countries offering all its citizens and enterprises safe, convenient and cost-effective solutions for payment and cash management. In addition to appropriate regulations, it is essential that the State and market actors work together to ensure that the objectives scenario can be realised in the not too distant future.</p>
