<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Starting points</h2>
<p>The remit of the Inquiry has been to analyse and propose an appropriate regulation of alcoholic products intended for consumption, and to propose legislative measures. The work has been carried out taking into account the Swedish alcohol policy and the obligations that follow from the EU membership. Special emphasis has been placed on the need to protect children and youths from the damaging effects of alcohol.</p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>Looking at the alcoholic products present on the Swedish market today, and those present internationally, the Inquiry takes the position that there are four different types of products that can generally be addressed when discussing the term ”alcoholic product”: 1. Alcoholic products that are not intended for consumption. 2. Alcoholic products intended for consumption, which essentially can be equated with alcoholic beverages and which are included in the definition of alcoholic products in the Act on Alcohol. For these products, a risk can be identified that certain problems will arise, primarily from the point of view of public health, unless further regulation is adopted. 3. Alcoholic products intended for consumption that are regulated adequately today and which have in common that the sale, as far as known, has not caused either public health concerns or other problems and where there is no reason to expect such a development. 4. Alcoholic products which carry distinct health hazards.</p>
<p>With the view to designing an appropriate regulation, especially as regards products type 2 above, the Inquiry proposes that a new definition is included in Chapter 1 Section 10 second paragraph of the Act on Alcohol; alcoholic products which from a consumption perspective essentially can be equated with alcoholic beverages or otherwise can be expected to be used as intoxicants .</p>
<p>As regards products type 4, alcoholic products which carry distinct health hazards, presently foremost powdered alcohol, the Inquiry has considered the possibility of including the products in a prohibition system. The conclusion has however been that this is not possible. Instead, the Inquiry suggests that the wording ”prepared for final use”  is excluded from the present legal definition of alcoholic products. As a consequence, there will no longer be any uncertainty as to whether powdered alcohol is included in the definition of alcoholic products. These products will be encompassed by the new definition; alcoholic products which from a consumption perspective essentially can be equated with alcoholic beverages or otherwise can be expected to be used as intoxicants. This means that the regulation proposed by the Inquiry will cover both products type 2 and 4 above.</p>
<h2>How shall trade and catering measures (services for providing food and drinks in cafeterias, restaurants etc.) be regulated?</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that alcoholic products which from a consumption perspective essentially can be equated with alcoholic beverages or otherwise can be expected to be used as intoxicants shall be regulated in the same way as alcoholic beverages. Retail sales to consumers are proposed to be made through Systembolaget, within the framework of the alcohol retail monopoly. Services for the provision of food and drinks are to be allowed only for holders of catering permits. As regards wholesale, entry and import, the Inquiry proposes that the alcoholic products in question shall be regulated in the same way as alcoholic beverages. In addition, the Public Health Agency of Sweden is competent to adopt secondary legislation, including prohibitions on trade in alcoholic products, provided that there are extraordinary reasons for the protection of life and health.</p>
<h2>Marketing practices</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposal is to align, as far as possible, marketing of alcoholic products which from a consumption perspective essentially can be equated with alcoholic beverages or otherwise can be expected to be used as intoxicants, with the present rules on marketing of alcoholic beverages. This means that the proposed new definition shall be included in the provision in Chapter 7 Section 1 of the Act on Alcohol requiring particular moderation in marketing, and that marketing practices shall not target children or portray children or youths. It is furthermore suggested that the products in question shall be encompassed by the prohibition against commercial advertising in TV and radio in Chapter 7 Section 3 of the Act on Alcohol.</p>
<p>As regards sponsoring, the Inquiry has made an inventory of the law as it stands, but refrains from proposing any actual changes apart from a prohibition against sponsoring of radioand TV broadcasts, as is the case presently as regards alcoholic beverages.</p>
<h2>Organisation for supervision</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that supervision of retail sale and catering will to the greatest possible extent be administered within the existing framework and through the bodies that are carrying out these tasks today for alcoholic beverages; local municipalities, police authorities, county administrative boards and the Public Health Agency of Sweden.</p>
<p>Similarly for wholesale, the idea is to regulate the products in the same way as alcoholic beverages when it comes to supervision. The Public Health Agency of Sweden is in charge of supervision of the Act on Alcohol, but the Swedish Tax Agency shall control that the wholesaler actually sells the goods to a party which it is allowed to sell to.</p>
<p>Supervision over marketing practices for the alcoholic products in question is also proposed to be made within the current system where the Swedish Consumer Agency and, on occasion, the local municipality, are exercising supervision. When it comes to the rules on sponsoring in the Act on Radio and Television, the Swedish Broadcasting Commission is entrusted with supervision.</p>
<h2>Criminal liability and related issues</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the rules on criminal liability pertaining to alcoholic beverages in the Act on Alcohol shall apply to equivalent actions with alcoholic products which from a consumption perspective essentially can be equated with alcoholic beverages or otherwise can be expected to be used as intoxicants. Similarly and as a consequence of the proposed definition, amended legislation on criminal liability is proposed for driving vehicles, ships and aircrafts under the influence of alcohol. Amendments are also proposed for certain provisions on forfeiture of goods and for provisions in the Public Order Act.</p>
<h2>Taxation issues</h2>
<p>According to the Inquiry, alcoholic products are encompassed by the present legislation on alcohol tax. Looking at value added tax, the Inquiry takes the position that it appears both sensible and suitable to, as far as possible, levy value added tax in the same way on alcoholic products which from a consumption perspective essentially can be equated with alcoholic beverages or which otherwise can be expected to be used as intoxicants as on alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p>In conformity with the terms set in the remit, the Inquiry proposes no amended legislation here.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitionary rules</h2>
<p>The new rules are proposed to enter into force on 1 January 2019. The entry into force should be coordinated with possible amendments of the tax legislation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Inquiry proposes that catering permits for liquor that are valid when the legislation enters into force shall encompass alcoholic products which from a consumption perspective essentially can be equated with alcoholic beverages or otherwise can be expected to be used as intoxicants.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>In the Inquiry’s view, the proposals presented will have a beneficial socio-economic effect insofar as they contribute to a decrease of the total consumption of alcohol, or at least to preventing that it in- creases. The proposals can be expected to result in certain expendi- tures for the government agencies concerned, and to some extent expenditures for local municipalities. Apart from the Public Health Agency of Sweden’s expenses, expenditures are assumed to remain within the present budgets of the agencies in question. The Public</p>
<p>Health Agency of Sweden’s costs for information drives can be estimated to be financed through the present resources available in this area of expenditure. The expenses incurred by local munici- palities are estimated to be fully financed within the framework of charges levied for permits and supervision of catering permits.</p>
<p>For Systembolaget, the proposals can be expected to result in additional administration during a start-up phase. The proposals should, however, net and long-term, not lead to increased costs.</p>
<p>Companies will also be affected by the Inquiry’s proposals.</p>
<p>Actors with catering permits for liquor will not have to make new applications in order to be able to sell the alcoholic products in question. Other actors who wish to sell the products will however have to make new applications for catering permits, and this entails some administration. Applications for catering permits and super- vision of alcoholic products can in addition be expected to generate certain additional costs for these companies in terms of charges levied by the local municipalities. Since the Public Health Agency of Sweden maintains the right to issue secondary legislation, in- cluding prohibitions, the alcoholic products can be subject to stricter rules than alcoholic beverages, and this can affect companies that produce or sell alcoholic products. Companies selling alcoholic ice cream or other alcoholic products encompassed by the regulation can experience a loss of sale. This would result from entrusting retail sale to Systembolaget and from requiring catering permits, but also from the application of age limits; 18 years for catering and 20 years for retail sale. It should however be beneficial for companies that an existing system for regulating trade and catering is used so as to avoid unnecessary complications, given that the system is already known. As regards wholesale, the primary difference as compared to</p>
<p>today is expected to be the time spent on applications procedures for being authorised as warehousekeeper or registered as consignee.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals should be favourable for children and youths; among other things the opportunities for them to avail themselves of the alcoholic products in question should be reduced through the rules on retail sale to consumers that are being pro- posed. One can also expect that children and youths will be better protected against advertising of these products. There will further- more be an organised system for permits and supervision, augment- ing the capacity to exercise control.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s view, notification must be made pursuant to</p>
<p>Directive (EU 2015/1535) and Directive (2006/123/EC).</p>
