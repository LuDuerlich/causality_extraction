<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Assessment and Grading Inquiry submitted its proposals to the Government in August 2020 – Building, assessing, grading – grades that better reflect student knowledge . Its remit was to investigate and propose a model for the introduction of subject grades in Swedish upper secondary schools and upper secondary schools for students with learning disabilities. The remit also included investigating and submitting proposed modifications to the grading system used across all types of schools in Sweden.</p>
<p>The purpose of the inquiry was to foster students’ knowledge development and for grades to better reflect their knowledge. In our work we have focused on students and teachers and in our proposals we have striven to create systems that better facilitate students’ learning and teachers’ teaching, assessment and grading.</p>
<p>The proposals are a package in which the individual proposals are mutually reinforcing, resulting in the whole having a greater impact than its individual parts. For this reason, the proposals should be introduced as cohesively as possible.</p>
<h2>Subject grades in upper secondary school, upper secondary school for students with learning disabilities and municipal adult education</h2>
<p>The proposals in brief</p>
<p>• Subject grades are to replace course grades and be introduced in upper secondary schools and upper secondary schools for students with learning disabilities, where education will be  subject-based.</p>
<p>• The subjects are to be divided into levels to ensure equality of teaching content while retaining the opportunity for a subject with a subject syllabus to be studied to different extents on different programmes and in adult education.</p>
<p>• There is one set of grading criteria for each subject in the model for subject grades. The student receives a grade in the subject on attaining a certain level, which is then replaced once the student receives a new grade in the subject on attaining the next level.</p>
<p>• Grades in the subject are to be awarded after each level to give students a continuous and more formal check on their progress and to clearly show the knowledge the students have attained when changing programme, school, type of school or teacher.</p>
<p>• The diploma, certificate from upper secondary school for students with learning disabilities, study certificate or certificate of upper secondary education will list the student’s final grades in the subject, unlike the current  course-based system where grades are listed for each course in a subject.</p>
<p>• An equivalent model for subject grades is also to be introduced in adult education.</p>
<p>• Current subjects and subject syllabuses need to be reviewed and adapted to work with subject grades.</p>
<p>Background to the proposals</p>
<p>Sweden’s course-based upper secondary education has for many years been criticised for being fragmented, which has partly led to students feeling that the point of education is to “tick off” courses rather than learning. A constant focus on assessment and grading due to the fact that every grade given for a course has an impact on the student’s merit rating (credit score) has led to stress for students and teachers alike. Moreover, the design of courses and course grades has led to many students not having yet settled into their studies at upper secondary school before receiving their first course grades. Nor do the individual course grades that the student has received in courses early on show the knowledge the student has at the end of their studies in a subject.</p>
<p>Starting points behind the proposals</p>
<p>One starting point in drawing up the model for subject grades model was to retain as far as possible what works well in today’s system while simultaneously enabling better conditions for students’ learning. Protecting the working situation of teachers and the opportunities of organisers to plan and dimension upper secondary education were also factors in not proposing an entirely new system that would lead to major changes. The fundamental structure of education at upper secondary level will at large remain the same as today, with upper secondary schools providing higher education preparatory programmes and vocational programmes. The same subject syllabuses are to apply in upper secondary education across different forms of education, and there are to be opportunities for students to choose options within their path of study and opportunities for transitions and collaboration between different forms of education.</p>
<p>Subject grades will reflect the student’s knowledge of the entire subject</p>
<p>The problems inherent in the course structure will remain as long as we have course-based upper secondary education with final grades awarded at the end of each course.</p>
<p>According to the Inquiry, subject grades in subject-based education in upper secondary schools and upper secondary schools for students with learning disabilities will facilitate deeper learning and provide greater motivation for students to complete their education, offering better opportunities to for students to complete upper secondary education compared to today. Subject grades are also more likely to reflect students’ knowledge in the subject as a whole than separate course grades. They also give teachers better opportunities to plan teaching based on the subject as a whole.</p>
<p>Today, the same subject syllabuses and course grading systems are used in upper secondary schools, upper secondary schools for students with learning disabilities and in municipal adult education at upper secondary level. Subject grades in upper secondary schools and upper secondary schools for students with learning disabilities should therefore not prevent or make it more difficult for students to transition to municipal adult education and special needs education for adults, neither for individuals with subject grades nor with older course grades. For this reason, the Inquiry proposes that subject grades should also be introduced in municipal adult education at upper secondary level.</p>
<p>The subjects are to be divided into levels, and grades in the subject are to be set for each level</p>
<p>The subjects are to consist of one or more levels and after each level, the student is to be awarded a new grade that replaces the grade from the previous level, on the way towards the student’s final grade in the subject. Each grade is set based on a set of grading criteria that apply to the whole subject. Such a grade states how far a student has reached in terms of knowledge of the subject and provides the student with information regarding their remaining studies in the subject. It also provides useful information when a student switches between introductory programmes, national programmes and adult education. The final grade in the subject is to reflect the student’s knowledge in the subject at the end of his or her studies in the subject.</p>
<p>A fail grade at the final level will not mean a fail grade for the whole subject if the student received a pass grade in the subject at a lower level/lower levels. The students will be able to count the levels for which they have already received a pass grade, even if they receive a fail grade at the final level in the subject.</p>
<h2>Compensatory grading</h2>
<p>The proposals in brief</p>
<p>• Compensatory grading is to be introduced in compulsory education, upper secondary education and municipal adult education at upper secondary level.</p>
<p>• The term ‘grading criteria’ will replace the term ‘knowledge requirement’.</p>
<p>• Grades  A–D are to be covered by a compensatory principle. When grading, the teacher is to make an overall assessment and award the grade that best matches the student’s knowledge.</p>
<p>• The grading criteria for an E grade must be fully met.</p>
<p>Background to the proposals</p>
<p>According to the current regulations, all parts of the knowledge requirement for grades A, C and E must be met for the student to be awarded the grade in question. This creates thresholds in the grading scale that mean that minor areas of knowledge in which the student is judged to be at a lower level on the grading scale can lower their grade. This has led to students feeling that they are graded based on their poorest performance. Moreover, both students and teachers find the knowledge requirements to be extensive, detailed and unclear, which has led to some teachers interpreting the knowledge requirements in different ways. In some cases this has led to a grade that cannot be considered fair of the student’s knowledge.</p>
<p>Compensatory grading produces fairer grades</p>
<p>According to the Inquiry, compensatory grading is a fairer way of grading knowledge than the present system. The fact that all parts of a knowledge requirement must be met has rewarded working methods and forms of examination where much of the teacher’s work is taken up by ticking off different elements of the knowledge requirements. This has partly led to students losing motivation early in the academic year or early on in a course because of a sense that poor performance at the start of the year or the course will stay with them for ever. A grading system where the overall picture is more important than the parts will enable less fragmented learning. This can in turn lead to increasing students’ motivation and reducing the experienced stress and sense of unfairness. Instead, teachers can award grades based on a professional, overall assessment of the grade that best corresponds to the student’s knowledge.</p>
<p>Grades A–D must be compensatory</p>
<p>Grades A–D are to be covered by a compensatory principle. This means that in awarding grades, the teacher can allow a student’s knowledge at a lower level of the scale to be compensated for by knowledge at a higher level. The teacher can then make an overall assessment of the grade that best corresponds to the student’s knowledge as a whole.</p>
<p>The grading scale is continuous and the qualitative differences between the grade levels are expressed by means of specific grading criteria for grades A, C and E. The grades of B and D are to be awarded if the teacher’s overall assessment is that the student’s knowledge is judged to sit between the grading criteria for an A and a C or a C and an E respectively. For a student to receive the grade of E, it remains the case that all the grading criteria for the grade of E must be met. The grade of E is thus not to be covered by a compensatory principle.</p>
<p>The term ‘knowledge requirements’ will be replaced by the term ‘grading criteria’, because the term ‘grading criteria’ signals a more general description of a typical knowledge level and is therefore more appropriate in a system with compensatory assessment and grading.</p>
<p>The proposals in brief</p>
<p>• An additional fail grade, Fx, is to be introduced at compulsory education, secondary introductory programmes, in upper secondary schools, and municipal adult education at upper secondary level.</p>
<p>• The grade Fx is to be equivalent to 5 credits in compulsory education and for comprehensive school subjects in the introductory programmes in upper secondary education. The grade of Fx will not give credits in upper secondary education or adult education.</p>
<p>Background to the proposals</p>
<p>Today, a relatively large proportion of students have a fail grade in more than one subject. Having several fail grades can have a major impact on the student’s likelihood of being admitted to a national programme in upper secondary education or to receive an upper secondary diploma. The knowledge requirements, together with the pass grades, will provide a relatively clear picture of the student’s level of knowledge and will also provide information on what is required for the student to be awarded a higher grade. There is no knowledge requirement for the grade of F; instead, the information the grade provides is merely that the student’s knowledge is insufficient to be awarded the pass grade of E. This means that the grade of F can correspond to everything from very poor knowledge to the student almost fulfilling the knowledge requirements for an E grade. Consequently, it is difficult for these students to know where they stand in relation to a pass grade, and also makes it difficult for them to monitor their knowledge development below a pass level.</p>
<p>Clearer feedback below pass level</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that a more differentiated scale of fail grades could distinguish between knowledge that is close to the pass grade boundary from knowledge that is far below it. This could help the student to better understand the development of their knowledge and feel motivated and committed to complete their studies. Furthermore, the teacher gains a more nuanced picture of the knowledge situation and can thus better adapt teaching, both to the individual student and to the class as a whole.</p>
<p>Introducing credits for the grade of Fx which can affect the students merit rating (credits) for admission to upper secondary school is a way of further encouraging students who receive a fail grade, even if the credits for the grade of Fx only acquire a real value once the student applies to upper secondary education. Studies have shown that older students are able to cope with grading better than younger students, because they have learned the system and have developed strategies for dealing with it. It is therefore likely that the encouraging effect of credits would be less for students at upper secondary school and in municipal adult education at upper secondary level. However, the reasons that weigh the heaviest in terms of not introducing merit rating credits for the grade of Fx in these types of school is that it would have excessive consequences in the selection process for higher education.</p>
<h2>An overall assessment must be made of the student’s knowledge</h2>
<p>The proposal in brief</p>
<p>• The guideline in the curricula whereby when grading, the teacher is to take into account ‘all available information’ on the student’s knowledge is to be deleted and replaced with a guideline stating that when grading, the teacher is to make an overall assessment of the student’s knowledge in relation to the national grading criteria.</p>
<p>• The change will be introduced in the curricula for the compulsory education, upper secondary education, and adult education at upper secondary level.</p>
<p>Background to the proposal</p>
<p>Teachers are unsure how to interpret the guideline in the curricula stating that when grading, teachers are to make use of all available information about the student’s knowledge. One common interpretation is that the teacher should incorporate as much grading data on the students’ knowledge as possible, bringing about an unsustainable situation for teachers and a risk of teaching suffering in favour of collecting grading data. It has also led to students feeling that everything they do and say is assessed and graded. Another consequence of the guideline is that it seems to have led to practices involving a large number of retests and tasks to be handed in, which causes stress for students and teachers alike. Overall, the situation has led to an unclear legal situation for the students, as the teachers apply the guideline in different ways.</p>
<p>More focus on teaching and learning</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the general advice on grades and grading published by the Swedish National Agency for Education in autumn 2018 is good guidance for teachers on the intention of the guideline on ”all available information”. However, the guideline may continue to give rise to uncertainty in terms of its interpretation and thus to the problems that have been seen of too much focus on gathering data for grading and a constant focus on student assessment. The guideline should instead be more in line with that stated in the general advice, and therefore the wording ‘all available information’ should be deleted. Instead, the curricula should make clear that when grading, the teacher is to make an overall assessment of the students’ knowledge in relation to the national grading criteria. This change would shift the focus from gathering grading data (all available information) to the students being given an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge in several different ways and for the teacher to subsequently make an overall assessment of this knowledge.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also considers that headteachers should work to facilitate an equal assessment practice in the school, for example by drawing up procedures for what may be valid and reliable grading data for different subjects.</p>
<h2>Grade inflation</h2>
<p>In the chapter on grade inflation, the Inquiry provides an account of grade inflation and unequal grading, as the phenomena are related and difficult to distinguish. Grade inflation means that grades increase over time without students’ knowledge doing likewise. Unequal grading means that teachers are not applying the provisions on grading equally, whereby students who have demonstrated the same knowledge may therefore be awarded different grades. In this chapter the Inquiry discusses factors contributing towards grade inflation and unequal grading in the system as it stands today.</p>
<p>The Inquiry further provides an account of interventions capable of tackling the problems of grade inflation and unequal grading, addressing both interventions that already exist and those that can be introduced in the future. The Inquiry makes no proposals but advises further investigation of the following issues: anchoring students’ grades in the national tests in compulsory education, introducing examinations in upper secondary schools, statistical moderation of grades using national tests.</p>
