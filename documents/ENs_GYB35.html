<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The remit of the Inquiry has been to supplement some of the proposals submitted in the report Schooling for children who are to be refused entry or expelled  (SOU 2007:34).</p>
<p>The remit has involved analysing the conditions for how the right to schooling and access to pre-school and school-age childcare can be extended to apply to more groups of children residing in the country without a permit. In this part of the remit, the Inquiry will submit proposals for how to define the target group. According to the terms of reference, the premise is to be that the children included in the proposal are to have a right to schooling, etc. on the same terms as children seeking asylum, in accordance with the Ordinance on education, pre-school services and schoolage childcare for children seeking asylum, etc. (2001:976)</p>
<p>In addition, the Inquiry has had the task of submitting proposals concerning the right to schooling in independent schools and access to privately run pre-school activities and school-age childcare for both children residing in the country without a permit and children and young people seeking asylum, etc., as well as how the current and proposed regulations on state compensation can be designed so that all service providers are eligible for compensation.</p>
<p>The remit has also included analysing the conditions for, and submitting proposals on, how the obligation on the part of the educational board and the social welfare committee to notify the Swedish Police Service (in accordance with Chapter 7, Section 1 of the Aliens Ordinance (2006:97)) may be restricted or removed, and whether and, if so, how the social welfare committee’s obligation to provide information (in accordance with Chapter 17, Section 1 of the Aliens Act (2005:716)) may be amended in a way that is compatible with the ambition to ensure that these children are able to attend school, pre-school or school-age childcare.</p>
<h2>Delimitation in connection with proposals in the 2007 report</h2>
<p>The main remit of the Inquiry has been to submit supplementary proposals to the 2007 report. As the remit includes submitting proposals on an extended right to schooling, etc., a review of the consequences this will have for proposals already submitted by the previous Inquiry is also necessary. The aforementioned task has led the Inquiry to submit a different proposal concerning the issue of which model to choose for state compensation to municipalities and service providers. The Inquiry’s proposals concerning the issue of the right to schooling in independent schools and access to privately run pre-school activities and school-age childcare also differ from those submitted by the previous Inquiry.</p>
<p>Proposals and considerations in the 2007 report that are not deemed to be part of, or to influence, the remit of this Inquiry have gone essentially unmentioned. Only where it is deemed appropriate for better comprehension of the proposals submitted or for the sake of the overall picture has the Inquiry commented on and taken a position on the previous Inquiry’s considerations.</p>
<h2>The proposals</h2>
<p>The target group</p>
<p>It is expressly stated in the terms of reference (p. 9) that the remit involves broadening the target group ‘children’ compared to the group of children covered by the previous Inquiry. At the same time, it is noted that there are groups of children who should not be included, such as children residing in the country without a permit for a shorter period of time.</p>
<p>As regards the issue of how to define the target group, it should first be established that the basic premise according to the assessment of the Inquiry should be that all children residing in the country are to have a right to education, pre-school activities and school-age childcare. This also applies to children and young people</p>
<p>without a permit for their stay here, irrespective of why they are without a permit. However, an exception from this main rule can be considered justified for children and young people whose stay in the country (with or without a permit) may be expected to be entirely temporary, as it cannot be expected that these persons will be in need of having their educational requirements, etc. met here. An uninterrupted stay that is likely to be less than three to four months should be suitable as a guideline for when the exemption clause may be applicable.</p>
<p>The detailed implications of the proposed right to schooling</p>
<p>By regulating in law the right to education, etc. for the target group concerned, children and their parents, as well as staff and decisionmakers, will have clear and unambiguous rules to conform to. This will mean greater legal security for individuals, and it will also mean that the objectives of the Education Act – everyone’s right to equal access to education and the right to education of equal quality – can be achieved. Such a regulation should also mean that Swedish legislation is more in line with the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the intentions behind it.</p>
<p>Like the previous Inquiry, this Inquiry proposes that the children and young people covered by the Inquiry proposal are to have a right to education in all types of schools, i.e. pre-school class, compulsory school, upper secondary school, compulsory school for pupils with learning disabilities, upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities, special school for the deaf and hard of hearing, and Sami school. Teaching is to be conducted taking into account the needs and abilities of the individual. School attendance is not compulsory. The right to education for the target group concerned applies essentially on the same terms as for children and young people resident in Sweden. However, a requirement for attending upper secondary school and upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities is that the child began his or her education before the age of 18. The Inquiry agrees with the considerations of the previous Inquiry, as well as the proposals it submitted – also on other elements – concerning educational content.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Inquiry’s proposal means that the children included in the target group are to have a right to participate in pre-school</p>
<p>activities and school-age childcare on the same terms as those that apply to children resident in the country. However, there is no obligation to undertake any outreach activities to find out which children are entitled to a place at pre-school and out-of-school centres, to allocate places in pre-school classes or to inform parents about these activities and their purposes.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the right to schooling, etc. also apply to independent schools and privately run pre-school activities and school-age childcare. The same also applies for the children and young people covered by the Ordinance on education, pre-school services and school-age childcare for children seeking asylum, etc. (2001:976).</p>
<p>Upon application, education, pre-school activities and schoolage childcare are to be offered to the target group concerned by their home municipality. The home municipality is to be considered to have fulfilled its obligation when a pupil or a child has his or her educational needs met in an independent school or takes part in privately run pre-school activities or school-age ‘Home municipality’ refers to the municipality in which the child or pupil is permanently domiciled, or if he or she does not have a permanent place of residence, the municipality in which he or she is currently staying.</p>
<p>Obligation to notify, obligation to provide information and other secrecy issues</p>
<p>The provision in Chapter 7, Section 1 of the Aliens Ordinance (2006:97) states that the educational board and the social welfare committee, among others, have an obligation to, under certain circumstances, notify the police authority of an alien’s full name, date of birth, citizenship and home address. In the Inquiry’s view there are decisive arguments as to why neither the educational board nor the social welfare committee should be included in an obligation to notify an enforcing authority on their own initiative; it is therefore proposed that the provision in Chapter 7, Section 1 of the Aliens Ordinance be repealed.</p>
<p>As regards the issue of the social welfare committee’s obligation to provide information in accordance with Chapter 17, Section 1 of the Aliens Act (2005:716), it is expressly stated in the terms of reference that the Inquiry is to analyse the conditions for amending</p>
<p>the provision in a way that is compatible with the ambition to ensure that these children are able to attend school, pre-school and school-age childcare. Based on the main task of the Inquiry – to ensure that children staying in the country without a permit are to have a right to schooling, etc. – the Inquiry has sought, but not found, any reliable evidence to suggest a link between children staying in the country without a permit abstaining from attending school, etc. and the provision on the social welfare committee’s obligation to provide information. Having weighed up the interests, the Inquiry has come to the conclusion that there are not sufficient grounds to repeal or restrict the provision, which should, therefore, continue to apply unaltered.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Inquiry agrees with the assessment made by the previous Inquiry that, concerning provisions on secrecy in the area of schools regarding individuals’ personal circumstances, and the regulation of secrecy between agencies, no legislative amendments are necessary. The issue of whether secret information may be released by staff in schools, pre-schools or school-age childcare to, for instance, the police authority or the Swedish Migration Board may be determined following an examination in accordance with the general clause in Chapter 10, Section 27 of the Public Access and Secrecy Act (2009:400), as has previously been the case.</p>
<p>State compensation to municipalities and service providers</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals on the right to education, etc. for an expanded target group will mean a new undertaking for the municipalities and increased costs for education, pre-school activities and school-age childcare. It is proposed that the state provide compensation for these costs through an earmarked state grant. Economic compensation is to be paid to the municipalities in the form of fixed standard amounts per child or pupil for each type of school or for participation in pre-school activities and school-age childcare. This compensation is to be approved and paid by the National Agency for Education following application by the municipalities. In cases where a pupil or a child has had his or her educational needs met in an independent school or has participated in privately run pre-school activities or school-age childcare, the amount of compensation paid to the municipality is to equal the grant that the municipality is to pay to the service provider. It is thus proposed</p>
<p>that all service providers, both public and private, be entitled to compensation.</p>
<p>Statutory regulation</p>
<p>It is proposed that the right to schooling, pre-school and schoolage childcare for the children and young people included in the target group and the state grants for the costs incurred be regulated in the form of an ordinance. When a final version of the new Education Act has been drafted, the proposals that have been submitted which should not be regulated by an ordinance can instead be integrated into the new Act.</p>
