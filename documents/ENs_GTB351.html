<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In December 2004, I submitted my interim report “Sustainable burdens – consumption for a brighter future” (SOU 2004:119) to the Government. The basis of the assignment, criteria, facts, statistics and a series of preliminary proposals in the three key areas – transport, foodstuffs and housing – are presented in the report. My own and the inquiry website www.supersize.nu, which was created by public relations students at Södra Vätterbygden’s Folk High School in Jönköping, illustrates some of the discussion initiated by the inquiry.</p>
<p>Sustainable development – what is it?</p>
<p>Despite a number of positive global trends, there is still some cause for concern about the future of the world and of mankind.</p>
<p>Is the supply of oil about to run out? Will there be enough fresh water? Will there be enough food for everyone? Can we stop the spread of HIV/AIDS and malaria, as well as welfare diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity? How is current climate change affecting the world economy and peace? When will absolute poverty finally be eradicated?</p>
<p>Aggregate production and consumption today is estimated to exceed the earth’s long-term ecological sustainability by about 25 per cent. The richest 14 per cent consume 56 per cent. Using today’s technology, another three or four planets would be needed to provide the whole world with an average material standard of living at European or American level.</p>
<p>Current development is, in other words, totally absurd in some respects. This must change and development must be made sustainable, globally, nationally and locally. The World Commission on Environment and Development (the Brundtland Commission) convened by the United Nations summarises thus:</p>
<p>Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.</p>
<p>Sustainable development – also a strategy for healthy growth</p>
<p>At the UN conference in Johannesburg in 2002, Sweden promised to work in three dimensions – ecologically, socially and economically – for a transition to more sustainable production and consumption. This is the basis of the inquiry and it is essentially a question of solidarity and justice, now and for future generations.</p>
<p>By making changes in our daily lives, we can help reduce injustice and environmental damage and at the same time strengthen both our health and our household economy. But this presupposes that the industry and producers of cars, food and other goods and services act very responsibly and provide us with a sustainable market supply. Society should encourage more rapid, environmentallydriven technological development by means of best performance targets and other strategies.</p>
<p>In other words, politicians and citizens must row the boat of the future with two oars:</p>
<p>• the oar of technology which provides us with resource efficiency,</p>
<p>• the oar of ethics which deals with change in our daily behaviour.</p>
<p>If we use only one of the oars, we will go round in circles and make no progress.</p>
<p>Some debaters seem to think that sustainable development and consumption entails a general risk of reduced growth and material prosperity. In this final report, I show quite clearly that the very opposite is true. Systematic investment in sustainable consumption is also, indirectly, a strategy for technological development, new business concepts and new companies, and healthy growth in both the economy and the labour market.</p>
<p>I have chosen to examine how consumption could become more sustainable in the areas of transport, foodstuffs and housing. Swedish households spend a total of around 90 per cent of their disposable income after tax in these three sectors of daily life. This also demonstrates the material and social qualities of welfare. At the same time, these sectors are responsible for an estimated half of all negative impact, on climate, health, and thus also on both public and private finances.</p>
<p>Measures along two main paths 1. We become “greener” consumers, i.e. we choose food, new cars, holiday travel, etc. in ways that are based on solidarity and that are as  resource-efficient and environmentally friendly as possible. We should make our choices with the help of consumer information and preferably also direct labelling of products. Examples of such choices: Swedish-grown potatoes, KRAV-certified milk, fair trade-labelled bananas, a new car that consumes 0.3 litres less fuel for every 10 kilometres driven than the old one, and homes without heating systems.</p>
<p>Along this path, I propose a series of measures to influence producers to provide the market with this type of product in the short and long term, measures that will stimulate the industry to expose, provide information about and advertise these products more effectively than at present, measures that will provide us as consumers with a better basis for making sound decisions on our purchasing and consumption behaviour. 2. We gradually reduce the proportion of goods in our household budget in favour of consumption of services that limit the use of resources – cultural experiences (music, theatre, books, cinema), education, or health care for prevention or rehabilitation, etc. This is essential if we want to avoid the rebound effect, which I will explain briefly in the following example.</p>
<p>People who change to a car that consumes 0.3 litres less fuel for every 10 kilometres they drive not only reduce their impact on the environment by producing fewer climate-affecting emissions such as carbon dioxide; they also save several thousand kronor a year in reduced fuel costs. The question is, what will happen to this new scope for consumption? If the money is invested in another family car, the whole thing will probably result in a zero-sum game from a resource and environmental point of view, or perhaps even in increased impact on natural ecosystems. If the money is invested in the consumption of immaterial services of the kind mentioned above, there could be a net gain for the environment and for our health.</p>
<p>Principal paths 1 and 2 must therefore be combined to create genuinely sustainable development. This in turn requires significant political will. The technological developments that have taken place over recent decades have led to productivity growth which has reduced the relative price of goods such as shoes, clothes and food, unlike major areas of the immaterial services sector, such as health care.</p>
<p>If the Government and Parliament seriously want to attract a growing share of consumption to immaterial, more resource and environmentally-friendly services, then the cost of such services must be reduced in relation to material consumption.</p>
<p>One method of achieving this is to lower VAT on services and hope this will have an effect on consumer prices. This route is being tested in certain cultural services but cannot be implemented fully because of the rules in the EU’s 6th VAT Directive (77/388/EC).</p>
<p>Another way is to reduce employers’ contributions in service sectors where it is desirable to lower general price levels and encourage increased consumption. I submit such a proposal in Chapter 6 of this report.</p>
<p>A selection of my general proposals 1. Public procurement in the best quartile (2.1)</p>
<p>Central government, municipalities and county councils must carry out their award procedures in the best quartile of the product assortment, taking balanced sustainability perspectives into account. Within the framework of the best quartile strategy, the Swedish Environmental Management Council will be given increased resources to act as a national body for knowledge management, analysis and the training of public procurement officers. 2. Consumer science in schools (2.5)</p>
<p>Domestic and consumer science should be a core subject at upper secondary school. Sustainable development will be taught primarily in domestic and consumer science courses at compulsory school.</p>
<p>This will require greater clarity in the curriculum, a review of syllabuses, a doubling of teaching hours and extra financial resources to teacher training, premises and technical equipment. 3. The role of the Swedish Consumer Agency in stimulating sustainable development (2.9)</p>
<p>The Swedish Consumer Agency will complement its broad general information on market supply with a sharper green profile which identifies the most desirable consumer from a sustainability point of view. On websites, in the Buying Guide and in other information and advice arenas, the Agency should actively help consumers to choose the goods and services that are currently the most resource efficient and environmentally sound on the market.</p>
<p>Eat, live and travel more sustainably – a selection of proposals 1. Eat sustainably – six main strategies (Chapter 3)</p>
<p>• Strengthen the market for staple foods produced in Sweden.</p>
<p>• Invest in extensive Swedish meat production.</p>
<p>• Increase the proportion of organic foodstuffs.</p>
<p>• Increase the proportion of fair trade products.</p>
<p>• Strengthen retailer responsibility through “green driving licences” for shop employees.</p>
<p>• Switch to Smart food.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the six main strategies, I am proposing more than twenty measures. A selection of the most important:</p>
<p>The removal of unnecessary cost increases for Sweden’s production of staple foods; a law on general origin labelling; a target of 25 per cent organic food in the public sector; the halving of VAT on fair trade products; “green driving licences” for shop employees; Smart food in schools etc; financial support to a major investment in Swedish cattle ranches. 2.
