<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The 1957 Treaty of Rome foresaw from the very outset a coordination of the European economy through the establishment of a common market in which obstacles to and restrictions on the exchange of goods and services and the free movement of persons and capital would have been abolished and a system established to prevent distortions of competition. It was no coincidence that this project began in the 1950s.</p>
<p>The ongoing process of industrialisation, with its associated standardisation and mass production, had run into trade barriers at national borders. In many industries, increased competition in the world market had led to demands for protective tariffs. Nation states attempted to support their own industrialisation rather than embrace structural transformation and regional specialisation so as to benefit from the common advantages offered by the course of developments. Their failed attempts to keep business on an even keel in too small national markets contributed to deep crises and unemployment, which in turn led to increased protectionism and spawned nationalistic, anti-democratic currents. The two world wars divided and weakened western European states and worsened the economic situation by causing further disintegration of the European market.</p>
<p>The provisions on free movement in the 1957 Treaty of Rome laid the legal foundation for a successful integration of the European market for goods, services, labour and capital. Over a period of years, the implications of the Treaty were elaborated and made more precise, laying the groundwork for current Community law. One milestone along the way was the ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in the Cassis de Dijon case , which established the principle of mutual recognition and provided guidance for future harmonisation. When progress showed signs of stagnating and new tendencies towards fragmentation of the market emerged, this was met by forceful measures starting in the early 1980s by further development of the Treaty and adoption of an ambitious programme for achieving the internal market, particularly through regulatory harmonisation. It was during this dynamic period that Sweden drew closer to cooperation on the internal market, first by participating in the development of the European Economic Area (EEA) and then by joining the European Union.</p>
<p>The importance of a functioning internal market has not diminished. After times of economic and financial instability, a well-functioning internal market is necessary to help the European economy to recover. This is particularly important for creating jobs and growth and promoting economic stability.</p>
<p>In its 2007 Communication “A single market for 21st century Europe” the Commission observes that the internal market is a pillar of the European Union. It is through the internal market provisions that the free movement of people, goods, services and capital has been turned into reality, delivering great, tangible benefits for European citizens and businesses. The internal market provisions have created new jobs and stimulated growth. Citizens have been given better opportunities to live, work, study and retire in another Member State. As consumers they have gained access to a wider selection of goods and services at competitive prices, together with better quality and improved safety. The regulations have created a common set of rules for business and opened up a market of more than 500 million consumers. This has made Europe a more open society with many new opportunities, a more competitive business sector and a strong respect for the social rights of the individual, while raising standards in the areas of health, safety and environmental protection.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the internal market still has great untapped potential. The provisions must be regularly adapted to changes in society and new challenges. This applies to globalisation, the environment, the increasing pace of innovation and changing conditions in society.</p>
<p>The internal market is especially important to a relatively small, export-dependent country like Sweden. Even if our trade with countries outside Western Europe, notably the rapidly growing Asian economies, is steadily growing in significance, the internal market still dominates Swedish foreign trade. An internal market with common rules and without discrimination is a domestic market for Sweden.</p>
<p>Work is now underway at EU level to improve the functioning of the internal market and make better use of the advantages it offers. In February 2007, the Commission presented its vision for the internal market in the 21st century. This vision foresees a market characterised by vitality, innovation and competitiveness, in which the potential of the service sector is used to the full, consumers and businesses alike benefit directly from the improved functioning of the market and Europe is in a stronger position to meet the challenges of globalisation. This is the spirit in which the Services Directive and Goods Package have been adopted.</p>
<p>The Goods Package comprises two Regulations and one Decision. Regulation (EC) No 764/2008 aims to make the principle of mutual recognition work in practice and contains procedural provisions on the rules and procedures an authority is to observe if it acts to hinder or restrict the free movement of goods. The provisions follow the line taken in the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in the Cassis de Dijon  case referred to above. To start with, the Member States are to recognise each other’s rules and specific requirements as equally valid, even in the absence of common Community rules. The second part of the Goods Package concerns the ‘harmonised area’ in which the EU has common rules. Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 introduces common rules on accreditation, conformity assessment, CE marking and market surveillance. Accreditation is a means of checking that a company offering testing and inspection services, for example, is competent to perform its duties. The new provisions strengthen and clarify the role of accreditation in the EU. New common provisions on market surveillance are also being introduced. Market surveillance by the Member States has become increasingly important to ensure confidence in the goods that move freely in the growing internal market. Decision No 768/2008/EC is mainly addressed to the Community legislature and establishes the procedures for harmonisation in future ‘New Approach’ directives. It also contains more detailed provisions on accreditation and conformity assessment.</p>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit has been to survey and describe the Swedish provisions and administrative processes and procedures that, at horizontal level, have a bearing on the free movement of goods and services in the internal market. It has been instructed to pay particular attention to the various functions, mutual relationship and coherence of these provisions and procedures. Any overlapping functions and regulatory inadequacies were to be identified. Next, the Inquiry was to review the regulatory framework and propose simplifications, improvements and additions that are necessary to safeguard the free movement of goods and services. It was also to present proposals on how to increase knowledge – above all, the knowledge possessed by government agencies and authorities – about the way the internal market works and about the regulatory framework. A further intention was that the Inquiry should contribute to the implementation of the new legal instruments in the Goods Package and adaptation to them.</p>
<p>In its review of Swedish provisions concerning the area of goods and services at a horizontal level, the Inquiry has found that the body of regulations as a whole makes a divided and inconsistent impression. It is obvious that the legislation dates from different periods, some of it before and some after EU membership. Older legislation has been amended many times, and the continuous insertion of provisions to implement new Community legal instruments has added to the fragmentation. This is particularly true of the legislation concerning the free movement of goods. The Inquiry has therefore found that there is a need to bring together scattered provisions into a smaller number of legislative instruments in the area. It would be appropriate if this were done now as for several reasons there is a risk that the lack of transparency will otherwise be exacerbated.</p>
<h2>A Swedish ‘Goods Package’</h2>
<p>The Goods Package brings far-reaching changes in the EU regulations concerning the free movement of goods. It also necessitates fundamental and extensive changes in horizontal regulations in Sweden connected with the free movement of goods in the EU internal market. We therefore have before us a highly favourable opportunity to modernise the Swedish regulations particularly in relation to goods and to build up a structure that can link the Community law system and conceptual apparatus with their Swedish counterparts more adequately than previously. As the Services Directive is being implemented at the same time, we have an opportunity to join up the Swedish rules in the areas of goods and services better than in the past. The Inquiry’s proposals therefore tie in with the implementation of the Services Directive.</p>
<p>In its survey of provisions relating to goods, the Inquiry has found that this area can be divided up systematically as follows:</p>
<p>• provisions on the formulation of new rules affecting trade in goods</p>
<p>• provisions on accreditation and conformity assessment</p>
<p>• provisions on the application of rules affecting trade in goods</p>
<p>• provisions on market surveillance</p>
<p>• provisions on the obligation to remove actual barriers affecting trade in goods.</p>
<p>This systematic scheme should be borne in mind if the aim is to achieve a clearer and simpler structure for rules relating to goods.</p>
<p>While the Inquiry is not of the opinion that every part of the regulations can be brought together into a single piece of legislation, it does believe that with the adaptations required by the Goods Package, it is possible to group the provisions into two main divisions. The Inquiry proposes the introduction of a new ordinance on goods in the internal market and a new act on accreditation and technical control, with a subordinate ordinance. If horizontal provisions concerning goods are brought together and clarified in this way, government agencies and businesses will obtain the overview that is lacking today. It will also create a clear link with the services sector, where a new act on internal market services has been proposed.</p>
<p>The proposed new ordinance on goods in the internal market includes horizontal provisions on market surveillance. In addition to this, certain other changes of an organisational nature should be implemented. The Inquiry considers that supervision of services should be coordinated by the Swedish Consumer Agency and that cooperation between the agencies responsible for market surveillance and supervision on the one hand, and customs authorities on the other hand, should be regulated and facilitated.</p>
<p>Further, the Inquiry considers that the Ordinance on Technical Standards and Regulations (1994:2029), which is of key importance to both Community and Government control of the regulations and standards set by public authorities and agencies, should be brought up to date and adapted to the new regulatory structure proposed by the Inquiry. Its scope should also be broadened and adapted to additional notification procedures, in the services sector and elsewhere. The Inquiry therefore proposes a new ordinance on information procedures and control of regulations in the internal market.</p>
<h2>New method of implementing Community regulations</h2>
<p>At the time of the first far-reaching adaptation of Swedish law to Community law, the instruments used in the internal market area were, almost without exception, directives. A directive leaves some, albeit varying, scope for nationally tailored solutions and, in principle, to have legal effect it requires implementation by means of national regulations. It can be stated today that in the area of free movement, directly effective regulations have been employed in a way that was hardly foreseeable. Moreover, with regard to new legal instruments – directives and regulations – a clear tendency is emerging to formulate explicit and detailed rules for matters that essentially only follow from the provisions of the EC Treaty and the interpretation of these provisions by the Court of Justice of the European Communities. The Services Directive is a case in point. The Goods Package can be said to reveal the same tendency, above all in the regulation on mutual recognition. The legal instruments in the Package are not to be transposed in the true sense of the word, as the Package does not contain directives. Nonetheless, the Inquiry considers that Swedish law should be carefully adapted so as to work in harmony with the directly effective Community regulations included in the Package and that account should also be taken of the Decision in the Package. Otherwise there is a risk of failing to fulfil the purpose of the reform intended by the implementation of the Goods Package at European level. This requires a different regulatory technique than has previously been used when supplementing Community regulations in Sweden.</p>
<h2>A more effective organisation for internal market issues</h2>
<p>The Inquiry can also see changes in the European administrative organisation. These days, alongside the European Commission administration, a considerable number of Community law agencies and bodies work with national administrations on a daily basis. In addition, an increasingly complicated system of European networks and cooperation bodies has emerged in different areas of the market, with national officials increasingly interacting with one another and with representatives of the Community, in particular the Commission. Quite simply, it is clear that direct contacts with the Commission and other Community bodies have become a relatively normal element of central national administration.</p>
<p>Representatives of individual companies, groups of companies and other organisations that are formally independent of the state are also involved in various and often obscure ways in European integration, particularly in the internal market area. This is often a central factor in Community policies, as is evident in the case of the new approach to harmonisation. In the area of standardisation, not least, it becomes difficult to grasp the full range of this involvement and to distinguish and effectively satisfy the interests of national coordination.</p>
<p>With respect to the Swedish model, the Inquiry finds no reason to dissent from the assessment usually made, namely, that on the whole it has proved to function well in the European environment. A relatively distinct and independent administrative organisation gives reasonably good conditions for flexible adaptation to Community expectations. For the same reasons, Sweden is well suited to the complex negotiating machinery intrinsic to EU cooperation. However, having said that, it is impossible to ignore the fact that this system involves an inherent risk that developments of the kind just outlined could lead to a lack of transparency and poorer conditions for the necessary political control. In the longer term there are potential risks concerning the effective protection of essential national interests.</p>
<p>One important difference in relation to other countries is that the Swedish Government Offices, which are responsible for central coordination and constitute the link to the political leadership, are relatively lacking in resources compared with the operational bodies, the government agencies. Under the present organisation of the Government Offices into ministries, the agencies are answerable to different ministries. The decisions and positions taken by individual agencies in matters of Community law may need coordination at political level.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, the Inquiry considers that it is not enough to simplify and modernise the structure of Swedish regulations relating at a horizontal level to the free movement of goods and services. In addition, considerations of an organisational nature are required to create better conditions for free movement. The Inquiry presents several proposals based on the view that a stronger element of overall governance and control is desirable with regard to the free movement of goods and services in the internal market. This has affected the formulation of the abovementioned proposal for a new ordinance on goods in the internal market and on information procedures and supervision of internal market regulations. The National Board of Trade should be made responsible for notifying the Government of cases in which this type of overall governance and control is needed.</p>
<h2>A more visible internal market agency</h2>
<p>One point emphasised by the European Commission is that the Member States should have special agencies responsible for internal market issues. In Sweden the National Board of Trade has a key role in disseminating knowledge about internal market rules, particularly concerning the Services Directive and the Goods Package. It is of great importance for the impact of internal market rules in Sweden that the responsible agency become more visible and better known in society at large.</p>
<p>Close cooperation between the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the National Board of Trade is also very important. As the agency responsible in this area, the National Board of Trade should serve as a channel for government control in internal market issues. The Government must be made aware of cases in which a general political assessment is needed, e.g. when there is a conflict between a particular regulatory interest and the general internal market interest of free movement. Assessments of this kind must be the responsibility of the national authorities, more particularly the Government. It should also be observed that the Swedish position in such cases can ultimately be subject to the judicial assessment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities. This being so, the Swedish position must be based on well-considered political priorities and solid legal arguments.</p>
<h2>Clearer role and responsibility for regional and municipal authorities</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has also concluded that municipal authorities need to shoulder more responsibility in EU matters in general and internal market issues in particular. From the Community law perspective, the public bodies of the Member States at local and regional level, just as at central level, are fully subject both to the general Treaty obligations and to other rules that apply to them. The application of the internal market rules at municipal and county level is therefore important. From the Inquiry’s perspective, the municipalities are particularly important in view of the supervisory duties entrusted to them, for example, in the area of market surveillance. The Inquiry considers that the county administrative boards should be able to assist the municipalities in their application of Community law more effectively than has previously been the case, and should also have a certain supervisory role. Building up expertise at county administrative boards is considerably more economical than letting every municipality, regardless of size, secure sufficient expertise of its own. Resources should therefore be set aside to establish one or more positions for internal market specialists at each county administrative board.</p>
<h2>Common web portal</h2>
<p>Steps must also be taken to improve and simplify the process of obtaining information about internal market rules in general. The Inquiry considers that the National Board of Trade should host a web portal providing information on all the government authorities and agencies responsible for some part of the internal market in Sweden. This should include explanations of overarching aspects of the internal market and links to the websites of authorities and agencies that businesses may need to contact. There should also be a link to the web portal that is being built up in response to the Services Directive and, finally, links to relevant organisations, etc. so as to allow users to obtain as comprehensive a picture as possible.</p>
<h2>Skills enhancement measures</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has also noted that after nearly 15 years of EU membership, there is still a widespread lack of awareness and knowledge about the EU internal market in Sweden. This is unsatisfactory, all the more so as Sweden is a small country with a limited domestic market and is highly dependent on the world around it. The problem is accentuated, particularly when such major changes are on the way as those that follow from the Services Directive and the Goods Package. Raising the level of knowledge and awareness of the significance of the internal market also seems highly desirable in view of the rapidly growing administrative organisation in Europe. Against this backdrop, relevant officials in public administration should know about the EU’s organisation, institutions and regulations and have a knowledge of foreign languages and insight into other countries’ negotiating traditions.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that a strategy be put forward for skills provision and skills enhancement measures for officials affected by the internal market. What the Inquiry has in mind here is not primarily a matter of providing additional human or financial resources, even if this may be needed for other reasons, but rather of appropriating and using already existing resources in a different way. There is a limited supply of well-educated expertise and specialist experience. Fundamentally, what is concerned is a different and – in the Inquiry’s opinion – more realistic view of the conditions for Sweden’s participation in the integration of the European market, on the basis of past experience. One of the necessary steps is to make deliberate and systematic use of personal experience of working in the EU context.</p>
<h2>Better conditions for business</h2>
<p>Welfare effects are created in economic life. In this sense, individual economic actors – companies – are the primary actors on the internal market. If companies are unable to make use of their</p>
<p>opportunities based on the rights and rules given them by the internal market, the expected cross-border business will largely fail to develop and the internal market will not be achieved as intended by the EC Treaty. It is therefore of the utmost importance to ensure that companies are aware of their opportunities and rights in the internal market, so as to be able on this basis to formulate and fulfil their own objectives and thereby at the same time contribute to society at large sharing in the welfare benefits that the internal market is intended to achieve.</p>
<p>In this context, it is disturbing that Swedish companies do not feel sufficiently involved in the development of the internal market.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore finds reason to put forward proposals aimed at improving conditions for businesses. Several of the proposals presented above can also be seen in this light. A clearer and simpler regulatory structure will lead to fewer provisions serving a clearer function and to greater comprehensibility, which will make things easier for businesses. Businesses should preferably only need to turn to one government agency and only visit one website and they will benefit from there being a single agency with clear responsibility for internal market issues.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the Inquiry advocates increased and better cooperation on the internal market across the board, between government agencies and authorities and business sector organisations. Earlier and more extensive involvement of business representatives and their organisations could help expand the knowledge base available to officials drafting new rules or amendments both when working on these issues at EU level and when drawing up national regulations for Sweden.</p>
