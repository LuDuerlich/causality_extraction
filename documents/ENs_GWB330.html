<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>The Inquiry makes the assessment that the agency structure launched in 2001 has not been fully able to realise the intentions and ambitions that formed the basis for the reform. This does not mean that the inquiry is denying the many merits and successful work of the new agencies. The organisation for preparing proposals has become more efficient, innovation support has been given a more professional setting and concerted action has been taken in certain strategic areas. All in all, however, the new agency organisation has not fully achieved the desired effects, either in its individual parts or concerning the full range of measures taken. This view applies to the support for basic research, which is far too fragmented and small-scale at present. Even though the preparation of applications received has become more efficient, this work appears to completely dominate activities with the result that larger and more extensive analyses and work have been overshadowed. This also applies to support for the application of research, which, while full of initiative, is far too unstructured. However the criticism delivered by the Inquiry applies first and foremost to the lack of links between these two action areas, and the limited interfaces between the National Research Council, the Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research (FAS) and the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas), on the one hand, and the Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems, on the other. Nor are the few initiatives that do exist designed so that different funders play complementary roles on the basis of their mandates to achieve common objectives.</p>
<p>In accordance with its terms of reference, the Inquiry has assessed developments in various areas so as to judge whether the present division of tasks can be modified. In doing so, the Inquiry has considered the question of whether the division of</p>
<p>responsibilities between the agencies is appropriate. The inquiry sees many opportunities for improvements, which, when taken together, would enhance quality in a number of research areas and increase the possibilities of applying the research. This applies to education science, where the present structure with a Committee for Education Science at the National Research Council is assessed as not being sustainable in the long term. The Inquiry is of the opinion that the funding of education science can draw inspiration from the working forms used by FAS, where a varied set of funding instruments has helped to increase quality but has also developed the interaction between research and practice.</p>
<p>At present research on working life is handled by both FAS and the Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems. The division of roles and working areas that formed the basis of this dual responsibility has not turned out to be fruitful. A unified organisational form is therefore called for.</p>
<p>The social science parts of transport research, which mainly concern communications and accessibility, as well as the planning of public transport have had difficulty in finding a natural place in the focus of Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems on the development of innovation systems. This research should also be able to develop better in another context.</p>
<p>Other areas that are in need fresh organisational solutions are building research and research on spatial planning, which have not been given adequate conditions for their development in Formas.</p>
<p>The Inquiry was also faced with the question of whether the Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems should incorporate further areas in its activities. Here the Inquiry proposes enabling the agency to work on needs-driven action and action to enhance innovation systems in all the areas. This also includes needs related to clinical research.</p>
<p>This final observation leads on to the Inquiry’s main proposals. The present system can be made more efficient and better suited to its purpose by making a new body responsible for certain tasks and by every agency reinforcing its strategic planning and being more active in the selection of funding instruments. At the same time, there is still a need for better coordination. Generally speaking, the Inquiry has sought but not found explicit ambitions among research funders to create a more unified structure of calls for proposals to meet the needs in the whole of the value chain, from basic research to applications in various sectors. Nor does the</p>
<p>Inquiry see any signs of profound changes in this respect among the research funders.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore proposes the establishment of a new coordinated research funding agency, the Research and Innovation Agency that accommodates four subject-oriented councils. In organisational terms the Inquiry proposes that four councils be set up focussing on nature, engineering and innovation; medicine and health; climate, environment and agricultural sciences; and society and culture. These councils will be held together by a central agency organisation that also includes central research policy, strategic, analytical and international activities, a department for research infrastructures and departments for legal affairs and communication.</p>
<p>Bringing together all the funding instruments in each council, instead of distinguishing, as is the case today, between support for research and funding to promote innovation, increases the potential of attaining both high scientific quality and the application of research. At the same time, the prevailing polarisation of tasks in the current agency structure can be avoided. The new councils accommodate support for path-breaking basic research, action to strengthen research environments, cross-disciplinary programmes, industry development, and support for technical development and research applications. Organising the councils in a unified structure enables combined action between scientific domains and between different organisations. This increases the possibilities of linking up strong basic research environments with groups and researchers working on needs-driven issues. In this way, scientific renewal can be simulated at the same time as substantial effects are attained on the innovation system.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes dividing the research currently funded by Formas, the National Research Council’s Scientific Council for Natural and Engineering Sciences and the Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems between three councils, where responsibility for funding both basic research and applied research and for technical verification and innovation in chemistry, physics and engineering is gathered together in one council, while environmental research, meteorology, agriculture and climate research with the fundamental sciences of “green biology”, ecology, geology, etc. are integrated in one council. This council should also cover activities in both basic research and applied research, along with various forms of applications of research.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a unified council for health with a broader focus than medical research. There is a need for a council that can take responsibility for the whole of the health area, from basic research in “modern biology” (that is funded by the National Research Council’s Scientific Council for Natural and Engineering Sciences) and biomedicine to the link between research and clinical activities or to innovations and new treatment methods. The council should also handle questions concerning global health, clinical trials and much of the needs-driven healthcare research.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that FAS, the National Research Council’s Scientific Committee for Humanities and Social Sciences and the research that is supported by the Committee for Educational Science be brought together in a unified council for social sciences, research driven by social and education policy, and humanities. Doing so can guarantee both continuity and renewal, so that basic research of the highest quality that also sheds light on important problems is supported along with applied approaches. Parts of the Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems’ social science research should also be transferred to the new council for society and culture.</p>
<p>The competence available in the Innovation Actors Division of the Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems concerning different kinds of cooperation programmes must also be transferred to the council for nature, engineering and innovation but also to the other councils. However, the new agency should not work on the business parts of commercialisation work. It is important to have a clear division of responsibilities between the agency, the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth (Nutek), Innovationsbron AB and other relevant actors.</p>
<p>As a result of its unified structure, the new agency will be better able to supply the Government with information in research policy matters. This will increase the possibilities to coordinate international contacts and cooperation. The inquiry has hopes that the effect will be measurably larger than with the present form of funding, both in a scientific and in a social perspective.</p>
<p>The Inquiry assumes that basic funding for the universities will be increased and that this will be handled somewhere else, or in some other way, so that the new funding system can focus on strategic action for the concentration of resources, renewal, quality and applications. The new agency needs to concentrate on this</p>
<p>work and cannot have as its primary task the handling of a large number of project applications in various preparation groups.</p>
<p>The other questions that the Inquiry has dealt with are research funding in the Swedish National Space Board and the logistics for polar research.</p>
<p>As regards the logistics for polar research, the inquiry supports the proposal submitted by the international panel of the Committee for Research Infrastructures. The Inquiry proposes an alteration concerning the placement of the Polar Research Secretariat to integrate it with overall infrastructure planning within the framework of the Committee for Research Infrastructures and also research funding concerning environment and the climate.</p>
<p>All of the research-funding activities of the Swedish National Space Board should be included in the new agency in the council for nature, engineering and innovation and the council for climate, environment and agricultural sciences. The activities directed at research instruments and apparatus should be handled as part of infrastructure planning.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has not been able to fulfil all parts of its terms of reference. Legislative amendments have not been proposed. The Inquiry’s assessment is that a completely new agency entails such great volume of legislative amendments that the matter should be handled by an organising committee. The Inquiry proposes that this organising committee should be set up so as to be able to handle all parts of the coming process for the implementation of the new research and innovation agency.</p>
