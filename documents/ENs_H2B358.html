<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In 2008, it became legal for private individuals to import alcoholic beverages into Sweden acting through a designated independent intermediary or professional carrier. Since then actors have appeared on the Swedish market who, for commercial purposes, convey the sale of alcoholic beverages from abroad or otherwise contribute to such sales. Several Swedish companies in various industries have also launched various types of cooperation with such mediators or brokers of alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p>The object of this inquiry has been to assess which types of measures in e-commerce and home delivery of alcoholic beverages that are allowed or disallowed in Sweden today. And also which such measures should be allowed or disallowed, taking into account the Swedish alcohol policy and the obligations arising from the Swedish EU membership.</p>
<p>The inquiry considers that the provision on private importation introduced in 2008 aimed to allow entry of alcohol beverages by transport provided by a carrier which is independent of the vendor. It is clear from the case law from the EU Court of Justice that the independent intermediary means a carrier that can either be professional or not. The purpose was not to open up to other commercial activities such as different forms of intermediation services between the buyer and the seller. Such an interpretation is also the basis for the present legislation in Finland and Norway, where there is a ban on commercial mediation of alcoholic beverages. Many of the activities that currently occur on the Swedish market may therefore be regarded as illegal or highly questionable. However, the boundaries of what activities are to be considered as legal seem unclear, since public prosecutors have only to a very limited extent chosen to take action against questionable e-commerce-related procedures under the Swedish Alcohol Act.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the Swedish alcohol policy a development that allows private profit motives to influence the Swedish retail market for alcoholic beverages is worrying. It is a development that is inconsistent with the alcohol policy that has persisted in Sweden for a long time.</p>
<p>Against this background, the work of this inquiry has been concentrated on elaborating more precise boundaries regarding what kind of actions should be permitted for e-commerce and home delivery of alcoholic beverages to Swedish consumers. The purpose of all the changes proposed by this inquiry is to ensure that the rules for private importation of alcoholic beverages shall be consistent with the Swedish alcohol policy and not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that purpose with regard to EU law.</p>
<p>This inquiry proposes an exception for private importation which specifies that a private individual, aged 20 and over, who has acquired spirits, wine, beer or other fermented alcoholic beverages from abroad, can import these products, either by himself or through the vendor, if the products come from a country within the European Economic Area. The transport must however be organized by a professional or private carrier which is independent of the vendor. This shall apply on conditions that that the alcohol beverages are intended for the personal use by the private individual and/or his family. This change means that no other intermediation service than the actual transportation service is authorized. Therefore, the exemption for private importation can no longer be interpreted to permit business arrangements on the Swedish retail market, for alcoholic beverages, that are incompatible with the Swedish retail monopoly or alcohol policy in general.</p>
<p>This inquiry further suggests that the exemption for private importation is complemented with a ban on commercial promotion of private imports of alcoholic beverages. It should be prohibited to promote this activity, with the exception for the transport referred to in the provision on private importation of alcoholic beverages. The ban on promotion clarifies that, inter alia, it is prohibited to facilitate, for commercial purposes, the sale of alcoholic beverages from abroad or otherwise contribute to such sales. It is therefore also prohibited for companies which conduct other types of businesses to initiate different types of relationships with companies that intermediate between the buyer and the seller in order to promote the possibility to privately import alcoholic beverages from abroad.</p>
<p>A foreign seller of alcoholic beverages may, however, notwithstanding the prohibition on promotion, conduct marketing activities. This inquiry considers that it would not be possible, under EU law, to prevent the vendors from promoting their own sales. However, this does not mean that the seller can engage in similar forms of mediation of alcohol beverages on the Swedish market that are prohibited by the ban on promotion. If a foreign seller of alcoholic beverages, by a Swedish branch, by virtue of own infrastructure for sale or by an intermediary in Sweden, engage in the sale of alcoholic beverages to Swedish consumers, it would be contrary to the Swedish retail monopoly. Foreign sellers of alcoholic beverages are only permitted to market the possibility to import their alcoholic beverages on the same conditions that apply regarding the marketing of alcoholic beverages provided by the Swedish retail monopoly. This means that particular moderation should be exercised and advertising or other marketing measures that are intrusive, outreaching, or calling for the use of alcohol, may not be undertaken.</p>
<p>In addition, this inquiry proposes specific delivery requirements. The reason for this is that certain transport methods that have been used in relation to the exemption for private importation, are highly questionable from the perspective of the Swedish alcohol policy. This includes delivery from warehouses, parking lots, the outside area of shop premises, via special terminals, from busses, and other business premises. These methods may undermine the position of the Swedish retail monopoly and make the control of the purchaserâ€™s legal age more difficult. This inquiry therefore suggests that alcoholic beverages brought into the country through private importation shall only be delivered to the individual's private address during the times when the corresponding beverages offered by Systembolaget are accessible, i.e. when alcoholic beverages are available in stores run by the retail monopoly or through its home delivery service.</p>
<p>Finally, by clarifying what is permissible and impermissible in terms of private importation, the opportunities to conduct effective supervision of the permitted activities are increased. Even the proposals from this inquiry as regards to delivery requirements in relation to private importation are likely to improve these conditions. Consequently, the proposal from this inquiry are well suited to work in conjunction with the proposals already submitted by the Inquiry on the supervision of marketing and e-commerce as regards alcoholic beverages, etc. (SOU 2013:50).</p>
