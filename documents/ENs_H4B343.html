<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>The main remit of the Inquiry has been to consider whether Sweden should accede to the Luxembourg Rail Protocol. Following an analysis of the Protocol, the Inquiry proposes in its report that Sweden should accede to it. The primary reason for the Inquiry’s proposal is the economic advantages to be gained by Swedish undertakings operating railways, light railways and subways (hereafter ‘railway undertakings’) when financing railway rolling stock. The Protocol will also benefit state rail operators by making more investment capital for new railway rolling stock available. This would reduce the need for both direct state aid and indirect support or guarantees.</p>
<p>In the aviation industry, leasing and other mainly private financing solutions have led to substantially increased investments in the last 20 years. Among other things, this is because creditors are safeguarded through the registration of their interest or mortgage. This can be compared with the railway sector, in which investments have stagnated, and there are no national public registries in which creditors can register their interests in financed assets.</p>
<p>The possibility to register international interests in a joint international registry is crucial to the application of the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (the Cape Town Convention) and its various protocols. In the same way as applies to property covered by the Aircraft Equipment Protocol, there will be an international registry for interests in property covered by the Rail Protocol in which creditors can register their interests in railway rolling stock.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that the Protocol be given the status of Swedish law via amendments to the Act on international interests in movable property (2015:860), and that certain amendments be made to the Rights of Priority Act (1970:979) and the Act on the purchase of movable property that the purchaser allows to remain in the vendor’s custody (1845:50, p.1).</p>
<h2>Financing of railway rolling stock – opportunities and challenges</h2>
<p>The Rail Protocol of the Cape Town Convention regulates how interests in certain types of mobile assets are to be dealt with in terms of asset-based financing .  Railway rolling stock is a special type of movable asset, as it represents high financial values and moves across national borders.</p>
<p>The operations of railway undertakings require substantial capital, and the need for investment is considerable. The need for substantial financial resources before start-up and the limited financing solutions available have been a barrier to effective competition in the rail sector.</p>
<p>Railway rolling stock is mainly financed through leasing and loans from banks and other credit institutions. With certain types of loans and credits, favourable terms can be obtained through state-supported guarantees, known as export credits.</p>
<p>One feature shared by the majority of types of financing of railway rolling stock is that the financier acquires an interest in the rolling stock. Because of its high financial value and long life, railway rolling stock is well suited to this kind of asset-based financing. The fact that railway rolling stock moves across national borders makes things more difficult for financiers with interests in rolling stock, because such interests are regulated differently in different legal systems. Nor are there any national or international public registries in which creditors can register their interests in railway rolling stock. When assets are financed through leasing, the provisions applied are often those of the Act on the purchase of movable property that the purchaser allows to remain in the vendor’s custody (1845:50, p.1). For the creditor to attain a right of reclamation of property, the Act requires an official announcement in the local press and registration with the Swedish Enforcement Authority. This arrangement is elaborate and is also strongly national in tone, which may deter foreign financiers in particular.</p>
<p>This is primarily an issue of what measures the holder of an interest, such as a lessor, can take if the party providing the security or the lessee does not fulfil their commitments. Another important matter is the protection to which the holder of the interest is entitled in the event of insolvency proceedings against the party providing the security. Issues of the creditor’s rights in relation to other creditors are regulated through provisions of property law that differ between countries. Moreover, the lack of a public register for interests in railway rolling stock generates uncertainty among financiers, which may lead to fewer and weaker financing options.</p>
<h2>Need for joint regulations for interests in railway rolling stock</h2>
<p>Within the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT) work has been under way since the end of the 1980s to draw up common material rules for interests in certain types of mobile assets that will simplify international financing and reduce the risks. This work resulted in 2001 in the Cape Town Convention, which entered into force on 1 March 2006, together with the Aircraft Equipment Protocol. Various types of movable property such as aircraft equipment, railway rolling stock and space assets are regulated in the three associated protocols. On 1 April 2016, Sweden acceded to the Cape Town Convention and the Aircraft Equipment Protocol. However, the Rail Protocol has not yet entered into force. This will only happen once four countries have approved or ratified the Protocol.</p>
<p>The Rail Protocol outlines what is to apply to interests in railway rolling stock. The main purpose of the Cape Town Convention and the Rail Protocol is to provide clear and uniform regulations on interests connected with the financing of railway rolling stock. This increases predictability for financiers, which in turn benefits operators as they can enjoy better conditions for financing.</p>
<h2>The Rail Protocol and international register</h2>
<p>Both the Cape Town Convention and the Rail Protocol are what is known as mixed agreements, which means that they regulate certain legal areas in which the EU Member States have transferred their competence to the EU, such as issues of applicable law and the recognition of court decisions. The EU acceded to the Convention and Protocol in 2009 and 2014 respectively, providing a declaration concerning the areas in which the EU has competence. The EU’s accession does not in itself bind EU Member States to the agreements, but it was a prerequisite for Member States to be able to accede.</p>
<p>The Cape Town Convention and Rail Protocol are unique in that they create a completely new system based on the establishment of ‘international interests’ that must be recognised in all contracting States. Under the Convention, three different types of agreement can give rise to an international interest: 1. leasing agreements, in which the lessor as owner has an interest in the asset leased; 2. title reservation agreements, in which the seller has an interest in the asset prior to full payment, or until some other condition has been fulfilled; and 3. security agreements, in which the provider of a security grants a chargee an interest in a certain asset as security for the performance of existing or future obligations.</p>
<p>International interests can be – but do not have to be – registered with an international registry in which their internal order of priority can be established. The International Registry for property covered by the Rail Protocol is located in Luxembourg. It will be possible to register in and search the registry 24 hours a day, every day of the year. The registry is currently being established, and it will be put into operation as soon as the Rail Protocol enters into force.</p>
<p>In addition to questions of priority among various international interests, the Protocol, along with the Convention, regulates what should happen if the debtor (i.e. a lessee, buyer under a title reservation agreement, or security chargor) does not fulfil their obligations or if insolvency proceedings are initiated against the debtor.</p>
<p>The measures offered to the creditor (i.e. a lessor, seller under a title reservation, or security chargee) by the Convention are intended to be powerful and effective and must, as far as possible, be available without the involvement of a national court or authority.</p>
<h2>The system of declarations</h2>
<p>The Rail Protocol is not a protocol that a State can simply choose to accede to or not. Moreover, upon accession the State must decide which declarations to make, and in certain cases, how to word the declaration. The Rail Protocol is designed to be applicable in different legal systems. The aim of the declaration system is for as many countries as possible to accede, regardless of the design of their national legal system. To achieve this, the Protocol is based on a system using declarations that affect the applicability of the provisions in different countries.</p>
<p>Certain declarations are ‘opt-in’ declarations, which means that by making a declaration, the relevant provision becomes applicable. This often applies to provisions that increase creditors’ protection and make the proceedings in the event of a debtor’s insolvency or breach of agreement quicker and more efficient. Other provisions in the Protocol are so fundamental that they require a declaration from a country for them not to apply (an ‘opt-out’ declaration).</p>
<p>In view of EU law, EU Member States are not permitted to make declarations concerning provisions in areas in which the EU has exclusive competence.</p>
<p>The accession document and the declarations are to be submitted to UNIDROIT, which in its capacity as depositary keeps a list of which declarations each country has made. This list is continuously updated and is available at the UNIDROIT website, where there is also a list of the States that have acceded.</p>
<h2>Consequences of accession</h2>
<p>The primary group that will be affected by Swedish accession is Swedish train operators, banks and other undertakings involved in financing rolling stock. The Rail Protocol creates conditions for increased private financing by making it easier for creditors to look after their investments. The international registry will make this possible. The registry will be for both national and international transactions, and will thus constitute a universal system for the identification of railway rolling stock.</p>
<p>Undertakings that wish to make registrations and searches in the international registry can register as users and thus obtain access to the registry. Accession to the Protocol does not entail any obligations for Swedish undertakings.</p>
<p>Accession to the Protocol will not entail any direct costs to Sweden. There is currently no register of railway rolling stock in Sweden that could be used for the purposes that the Rail Protocol offers. The international registry will be funded through fees, and is thus self-financing. Registration of an international interest will also be voluntary. Accession to the Protocol thus does not entail any indirect costs or reduced revenues in the form of fees etc.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s assessment, accession to the Protocol will mean financial savings for large and small undertakings operating in Sweden – some owned by the Swedish State/county councils. In the view of the Inquiry it is, however, not possible to predict the exact nature and scale of these effects.</p>
<p>Swedish credit securities law could do to be modernised. As things stand, both Swedish and foreign creditors find it difficult to understand legislation concerning interests in movable property, including railway rolling stock. Swedish accession to, and implementation of, the Rail Protocol to the Cape Town Convention would clearly improve credit securities law in the areas covered by the Protocol. The position of creditors with registered international interests will become considerably more predictable and reliable in insolvency proceedings with respect to a Swedish debtor as compared with if Sweden does not accede to the Rail Protocol. In turn, this will lead to better and cheaper financing for Swedish railway undertakings.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>The Rail Protocol will enter into force on the later of (Ar- ticle XXIII.1):</p>
<p>a) the first day of the month following the expiration of three months after the date of the deposit of the fourth instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession; and</p>
<p>b) the date of the deposit by the Secretariat with the Depositary of a certificate confirming that the International Registry is fully operational.</p>
<p>Swedish accession will not require the establishment or amendment of any new Swedish systems.</p>
