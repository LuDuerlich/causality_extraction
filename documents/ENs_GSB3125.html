<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The basic premise for financing arrangements for the disposal of nuclear waste is that the nuclear industry – not the taxpayer – must bear the costs. Present regulations, however, are imperfect in this regard. The Inquiry therefore proposes extending the financial liability of the nuclear industry and introducing new fee-setting arrangements. It is proposed that a new law be enacted to regulate these changes.</p>
<p>The disposal of spent nuclear fuel, long-lived nuclear waste and waste from dismantling of nuclear power plants is a long-term and, in monetary respects, large-scale project. The central components of the project are the dismantling of plants and the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel. Present plans assume that the final disposal site will be sealed some time in the 2050s.</p>
<p>The present financing system is regulated in the “Financing Act” Under this Act, the licensed owner and operator of a nuclear reactor (“reactor owner”) is required to pay an annual fee and provide guarantees to the State.</p>
<p>Four companies are reactor owners, namely, Forsmark Kraftgrupp AB, OKG AB, Ringhals AB and Barsebäck Kraft AB. These companies are wholly or partly owned by other companies according to various arrangements. In all essential respects, Vattenfall AB, E.ON AG, Statkraft A/S and Fortum Oyj are the ultimate parent companies in this ownership structure.</p>
<p>Each reactor owner is responsible for its own dismantling costs and for its share of allocated common costs of disposal and related measures. There are therefore four funds, each of which has a guarantee attached to it worth a certain amount that can be drawn on if there are insufficient resources in that particular fund. The four funds are managed together. On 31 December 2003, the balance in the four funds and the additional guarantees were as follows:</p>
<p>In the nuclear waste project, as in other industrial and construction projects, there is a risk that costs and income may take a different and more unfavourable course than in the reference scenarios presented. The Inquiry therefore concludes that the financing of the nuclear waste project should be planned on the assumption that costs are uncertain.</p>
<p>Liability of the nuclear industry and financial risk to the State</p>
<p>The idea is that, in the first place, the fees deposited in the funds will cover the costs. If there is insufficient money in the funds, the nuclear industry will still be liable. The liability of the nuclear industry is expressed in the Nuclear Activities Act in a provision concerning those who are licensed to conduct nuclear activities. These licence-holders (reactor owners) are responsible for ensuring that the necessary measures are taken to manage and dispose of nuclear waste in a safe manner and to decommission and dismantle installations safely.</p>
<p>This responsibility under the Nuclear Activities Act, however, is limited to the companies that own reactors, i.e. Forsmark Kraftgrupp AB, OKG AB, Ringhals AB and Barsebäck Kraft AB. Yet these companies have extremely limited assets other than their nuclear reactors and can therefore not be expected to have the capacity to cover the costs when the reactors shut down.</p>
<p>The guarantees provided for use in the event that there is insufficient money in the funds amounts to a relatively small sum in the context. At present, no liability over and above the limited amounts of guarantees lies with companies in the groups other than the reactor owners.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it will be the State that will have to provide any extra money needed. The State bears a financial risk as it may be forced to cover for a reactor owner whose fund and guarantees have been used up. In such a situation, the State does not have the option of laying claim to other funds and guarantees. Payments by the State are required when the costs of the project exceed a company’s liability and when a company that is liable to pay lacks the capacity to complete its payments. Payments may also be required as a result of a dispute about the industry’s liability to pay.</p>
<p>The State’s responsibility has been expressed in the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, where the State has formally committed itself to ensuring that funds are available for waste management. Even in the absence of any such formal commitment, the State would have a financing responsibility since disposal in this case is a necessity that cannot be disregarded. If the industry does not pay, the State – or, in other words, the taxpayers – must.</p>
<p>This responsibility of last resort means that the State is a risktaker in the financing of the project. The basic premise of the Inquiry is that the financing system should be designed so as to minimise the risk that the State (and taxpayers) will need to step in and pay. The responsibility for payment must therefore rest as far as possible with the nuclear industry – more or less as is the case when a power company sets about building a new plant.</p>
<p>Extended liability is proposed for the nuclear industry</p>
<p>Although the nuclear industry is intended to have full liability for payment, in practice it does not. This is because the formal full liability for payment in the nuclear industry rests with the reactor companies and therefore not where the industry’s long-term ability to pay is to be found. Essentially, the present arrangements mean that:</p>
<p>• Companies that cannot be expected to have any  long-term ability to pay have unlimited liability, and</p>
<p>• Companies that can be expected to have an ability to pay have very limited liability.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore proposes that ability to pay and liability are brought into line by a formal assumption by owning companies of</p>
<p>the sort of liability for payment that now rests solely with the reactor companies.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposal means that the liability of the industry for costs will be formalised by extending the liability to pay fees until the time at which the final disposal sites are sealed and broadening this liability to include an owning company in each group, in addition to the reactor owner. The aim is for this secondary liability for payment to rest with the company in a group that has the best capacity to make the payments. This means that the owning company in each group that is best suited to bear the liability for payment – which in principle is likely to be the leading company in the group – will also assume liability through a payment guarantee. This commitment will mean that a group will extend itself as far as it can, given its assets, as regards assuming liability for payments. Consequently, this will mean a considerable reduction in the State’s risk, compared with the present situation. A reduction of the State’s risk along these lines agrees with the principle that the nuclear industry must pay the costs.</p>
<p>If a reactor owner proposes an owning company for secondary liability for payment whose ability to pay is not in parity with the potential ability to pay, the intended reduction of the State’s risk will not be attained. The Inquiry therefore proposes imposing a fee for the financial risk that the State then has to bear.</p>
<p>The proposal will entail a phasing out of present systems involving guarantees for basic and additional amounts.</p>
<p>New fee-setting arrangements</p>
<p>The extended requirement to pay fees for the period until the final disposal sites are sealed and the secondary liability for payment are central components of the proposed new design of the financing system.</p>
<p>Other important elements of the proposal are a focus on the expected cost for each reactor owner and the introduction of better auditing routines, new assumptions for cost estimates, etc. Under the proposal, the new system for fees will be based on three-year fee periods.</p>
<p>One reason to focus on the expected cost for each reactor owner is that, in the view of the Inquiry, cost assessments and bases for fees currently lack transparency. Until now, attention has been di-</p>
<p>rected towards the total future costs of the project despite the fact that the reactor owners do not have joint and several liability. Each reactor owner has independent liability for costs and each owner’s liability is tied to a separate fund. It can therefore happen that the State needs to pay for a reactor owner whose fund and guarantee have been used up while also having to make refunds to another reactor owner whose funds have not been fully used.</p>
<p>Expected incremental costs and allocated common costs for each reactor owner are the quantities that the cost assessments should be clearly focused on. It should be clearly shown what a reactor owner’s own estimates of its expected costs are and for what reason the assessments made by the examining authority differ from those made by a reactor owner (if this is the case).</p>
<p>Clear requirements must be set regarding the examining authority’s arguments for proposing a certain charge. Among other things, this means that there should be requirements regarding reporting of the comparative material that the authority has used in its assessment and that the measures that the authority has taken to safeguard the quality of its assessments must be clearly reported. At present there is a lack of regular, systematic and explicit consistency tests aimed at strengthening the quality of the information used in assessments. The report includes some examples of consistency tests that can be applied in analyses made by the State.</p>
<p>In a matter of judgement like this, moreover, a systematic referee procedure should be established in the auditing work conducted by the State. This procedure would strengthen the quality of the assessment results and increase the likelihood that estimates will be balanced. At present no such procedure exists.</p>
<p>The lack of transparency can be illustrated by the fact that it was not possible in the course of the Inquiry to establish how cost assessments for dismantling of Swedish nuclear power plants compare with experience and assessments in other countries. The Inquiry considers that this type of information should be a natural part of any auditing file.</p>
<p>An additional reason for change is that at present the state bodies concerned process the issue of fees under heavy time pressure. Currently fees are set on an annual basis. The Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate (SKI) receives cost estimates from reactor owners (via Svensk Kärnbränslehantering, SKB) on 30 June at the latest and has to deliver its proposal to the Government by 31 October. After that the Government Offices give relevant consultation bodies until the end of November/beginning of December to comment on the proposals and the government decision is taken by the end of the year. The Inquiry considers that the present oneyear cycle imposes a clear limitation on the possibility of analysis and thorough consideration by state actors. A further disadvantage of the present system, in the opinion of the Inquiry, is that an annual review as such may give the impression of more thorough consideration than in reality is possible to achieve.</p>
<p>In other cases where the State assumes risks, risk assessments are made. This applies, for example, when the State provides guarantees in the area of export credits. Another example is the financing of the Öresund link, where the State has provided guarantees and loans and manages its own financial risks. In the view of the Inquiry, however, the State has not followed an appropriate course of action in managing the financial risk involved in this case. Use must be made of descriptions of risks in other projects and experience of managing financial risks of other projects. The Inquiry considers that a different system and different management is required in order to put the liability of the nuclear industry for costs into place – and so limit the financial risk borne by the State.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers it essential that the use of funds is followed up and audited so as to maintain confidence in the financing system. This being so, the Inquiry finds that auditing activities need time and financial expertise and requirements must be set for time limits, comparability, explanations for deviations, and so on, so as to make the follow-up process easier. The auditing authority should apply target statements and priorities in its work and should endeavour to ensure that the process for withdrawals from the funds is transparent.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that a three-year fee period should create scope for auditing and control and proposes that the safety authority be instructed in an ordinance to draw up rules aimed at facilitating follow-up by requiring time limits, comparability, etc. It is proposed that auditing be made part of a new financially oriented line of activity at the authority. It is proposed further that the safety authority be instructed to deliver an account to the Government every three years regarding its assessment of the most important risk factors in the withdrawals process.</p>
<p>The assumptions used in cost forecasts are now out of date, partly because the energy policy decision in 1997 means that 2010 is no longer indicated as the final year for Swedish nuclear power.</p>
<p>One consequence of this decision has been that the reference scenario on which the cost estimates build no longer appears realistic. The Inquiry notes that the assumptions currently used include the premise that the six reactors that pass the 25-year mark in 2005 will be shut down at the end of 2005 and that it is assumed that all reactors will be shut by 2010 at the latest.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore proposes that new assumptions be used in the cost estimates. The proposals relate to the active life of the reactors and associated assumptions, concerning, for example, the time period over which it must be assumed that a certain estimated cost (a fund accumulation requirement) will be covered. The proposal is that a total active life of 40 years should be assumed for each reactor, though assuming a residual active life of not less than six years. It is proposed that this assumption apply unless it can be assumed at the time an estimate is made that the reactor in question will be shut down a certain year. It is proposed that the cost, or in other words the fund accumulation requirement, be covered in the fee estimates over the assumed residual active life or, where relevant, over a three-year fee period after the reactors have been decommissioned.</p>
<p>Financial consequences of the proposals</p>
<p>The proposals may mean lower annual charges than at present, even given the presumed increase in authority costs for supervision and other activities. A reactor owner that has to pay a fee for the financial risk borne by the State will have higher expenses than in the present situation. However, it may be possible for reactor owners to avoid such fees.</p>
<p>The effect of the proposals will be to increase the financial liability of the nuclear industry and to limit the financial risk to the State.</p>
<p>Clearer responsibilities and duties in the state sector</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate be given the task of assessing expected incremental costs and allocated common costs for each reactor owner and to deliver clearly argued proposals on fees to the Government. This task should be clearly</p>
<p>defined in the Inspectorate’s instructions as a separate financiallyoriented line of activity. The Inquiry proposes that the Government continue to decide on the fees, as has been the case until now. It is proposed that the Inspectorate, as previously, have the task of approving withdrawals from funds.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Board of the Swedish Nuclear Waste Fund will in future continue to have the task of managing the funds. However, a change of name is proposed to the Board of the Swedish Nuclear Waste Funds to underline the fact that what is involved is the joint management of a number of different funds.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the National Debt Office have responsibility for managing the State’s financial risk. Under the proposals, its duties will include assessing the relative capacity to pay of the owning companies, charging and administering any fees and generally managing the financial risk borne by the State.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the National Debt Office be instructed to review the issue of a fee for the State’s financial risk three years after a new financing system has entered into force.</p>
<p>A new law</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the proposed change in the financing system, with extended liability for the industry in a new fee-setting process, be regulated in a new law. It is proposed that this new law also cover other nuclear waste than that deriving from the four commercial nuclear power plants. It is therefore proposed that the new law replace both the previous Financing Act and the special Studsvik Act.</p>
<p>The proposal for a new single law has given rise to proposals for amendments to the Swedish Environmental Code and the Nuclear Activities Act.</p>
