<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Remit</h2>
<p>The inquiry has been commissioned to analyse and submit proposals on how the current Swedish scheme for short-time work allowance could be made more competitive in order to strengthen the competitiveness of Sweden and Swedish industry and to preserve employment throughout the country over business cycles.</p>
<p>Another part of the inquiry is to analyse how measures such as validation and training could be combined with a short-time work scheme. This part will be considered in the next phase of the inquiry.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>A short-time work allowance system was introduced in Sweden in 2014, some years after the financial crisis in 2008. Under current law, support to short-time work can only be activated in a particularly deep recession of the economy, or if such a recession is imminent. Another requirement is that the activation of the support scheme is not considered to impede structural change in the economy. The support scheme has not yet been implemented.</p>
<h2>The Current Situation</h2>
<p>In order to assess the competitiveness of the Swedish scheme, a comparison has been made with short-time work schemes in some other countries in Europe, e.g. Germany, France and Belgium. The comparison shows that the support schemes in these countries are permanent schemes that are more flexible and more accessible than the present scheme in Sweden. These differences are considered to be a disadvantage for firms operating in Sweden.</p>
<h2>The Proposals</h2>
<p>The overall objective of the inquiry has been to propose changes that will make the current Swedish scheme for short-time work allowance more competitive or comparable to those in other countries.</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes a new allowance within the current system to firms implementing short-time work due to economic reasons. To be eligible for the new support firms have to prove temporary but considerable economic difficulties due to unforeseen and unavoidable events. Firms also have to show that all other possibilities to adjust the work force have been exhausted. Another requirement for support is an agreement between the social partners on how to implement short-time work at the firm or site level.</p>
<p>The maximum duration for the new allowance will be a period of six months, that can be extended up to three months. The terms for working time reductions and contributions will be the same as in the present scheme.</p>
<p>The inquiry will present a final report in December 2018.</p>
