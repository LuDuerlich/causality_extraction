<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The remit etc.</h2>
<p>On 15 May 2014, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted Regulation (EU) No 655/2014 establishing a European Account Preservation Order procedure to facilitate cross-border debt recovery in civil and commercial matters (the European Account Preservation Order Regulation). The Regulation entered into force on 17 July 2014 and must be applied in full from 18 January 2017.</p>
<p>The European Account Preservation Order Regulation establishes an independent European procedure for the preservation of bank accounts that is applicable in cross-border civil and commercial matters. A matter is to be regarded as cross-border when the bank account or accounts to be preserved are held in a Member State other than the Member State of the court to which the application for a preservation order is submitted, or when the bank account is in a Member State other than the one in which the creditor is domiciled. The Regulation has effect independently of and as an alternative to the preservation measures available under national law in the Member States.</p>
<p>The Regulation is binding and directly applicable in Sweden. However, its application presupposes the introduction of certain supplementary procedural rules in the national legislation. Our remit is to examine which supplementary statutory provisions are needed as a result of the Regulation and to propose such provisions.</p>
<h2>Brief remarks on the need for supplementary provisions</h2>
<p>As underlined in the terms of reference, certain issues call for special attention. These include methods of obtaining information about bank accounts in Sweden, service of documents and the system for assessing legal remedies. Other issues that need to be analysed include the responsibility for translating documents, costs incurred and fees charged by authorities, and the processing of personal data. Consideration must also be given to which Swedish authority or authorities should be designated competent to receive, transmit or serve documents under the Regulation, and which authority should be the designated information authority.</p>
<h2>Our deliberations and proposals Introduction</h2>
<p>We present a number of proposals on issues where the Regulation foresees a need for measures in national law, but also proposals otherwise deemed necessary or appropriate to ensure effective application of the Regulation. As directed in the Regulation, our basic approach in making these proposals has been that they should fit in with existing systems in the Swedish legal order. We propose that the supplementary provisions should for the most part be introduced in a new act.</p>
<h2>Procedural deliberations</h2>
<p>Even if the European Account Preservation Order procedure has distinctive features and differs from the equivalent national procedure in certain respects, the main features and purpose of the procedures are the same. There are also direct links between the procedures, since the European Account Preservation Order Regulation contains direct references to national law in certain respects. In addition, the Regulation prescribes that procedural issues not specifically dealt with in the Regulation are to be governed by the law of the Member State in which the procedure takes place. This means that, unless otherwise prescribed by the Regulation, the procedure in Swedish courts will be governed by Swedish procedural law.</p>
<p>We propose that a technical legal connection be created between the European Account Preservation Order procedure and the Swedish rules on account preservation in the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure. This will clarify that the provisions of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure regarding civil and commercial matters are to apply to procedural issues not dealt with in the Regulation.</p>
<h2>Obtaining information</h2>
<p>The European Account Preservation Order Regulation provides a mechanism allowing the creditor to request that the information needed to identify the debtor’s account be made available by a designated information authority of the Member State in which the creditor believes that the debtor holds an account. We propose that the Swedish Enforcement Authority be the designated information authority in Sweden and that the Authority be given statutory powers to request relevant information from banks.</p>
<h2>Enforcement</h2>
<p>A European Account Preservation Order is to be automatically recognised and enforced in another Member State without any need for a prior exequatur procedure. Enforcement is to take place in accordance with the procedure that applies to enforcement of equivalent national orders in the Member State where enforcement is to take place. In cases where an account preservation order is issued in a Member State other than the one where the order is to be enforced, the Regulation assumes the existence in the Member State of enforcement of a designated competent authority that can take the measures required to enable enforcement.</p>
<p>We propose that the Swedish Enforcement Authority be designated the competent authority and that it be clarified that enforcement will take place in accordance with the procedural rules of the</p>
<p>Debt Enforcement Code. In order to create a consistent and predictable system for enforcement, we also propose that a supplementary national provision be introduced that allows banks to transfer the amount subject to preservation to the Swedish Enforcement Authority.</p>
<h2>Service of documents</h2>
<p>The European Account Preservation Order Regulation requires certain documents to be served on the debtor within a certain time. To enable the rules on service of documents to be fully applied, each Member State needs to designate an authority that is responsible for service when an account preservation order has been issued in a Member State other than the one in which the debtor is domiciled. We propose that the Swedish Enforcement Authority be responsible for the tasks associated with service that the competent authority has under the Regulation. This means that all the tasks of the competent authority indicated in the Regulation will be collected at the Swedish Enforcement Authority.</p>
<h2>Legal remedies</h2>
<p>The European Account Preservation Order Regulation contains special provisions on legal remedies that both the debtor and the creditor can avail themselves of to contest the issuing or enforcement of a European Account Preservation Order. The material conditions and procedure involved are given in the Regulation. One consequence of this is that national provisions on legal remedies are not applicable in the European Account Preservation Order procedure.</p>
<p>We propose that an application for remedies against an account preservation order be examined by the court at which the procedure against the debtor is in progress, with regard to proceedings on the substance of the matter, or, if no such procedure is in progress, by the court that has issued the order. An application for a legal remedy against enforcement of an account preservation order, on the other hand, should in general be examined in the first place by the Swedish Enforcement Authority. The courts that examine appeals in debt recovery cases shall be competent to review the Swedish Enforcement Authority’s decisions on legal remedies.</p>
<h2>Data protection</h2>
<p>The European Account Preservation Order Regulation contains certain requirements concerning the treatment of personal data which are obtained, processed or transmitted under the Regulation. To ensure that these requirements can be met, we propose that secrecy apply to personal data dealt with by the Swedish Enforcement Authority in its capacity as competent authority and information authority under the Regulation. We also propose certain restrictions on the freedom of other authorities to access such data. Furthermore, we propose supplementary rules on the removal and destruction of data.</p>
<h2>Languages, translations and fees</h2>
<p>We propose that documents to be submitted to a court or competent authority in Sweden in the European Account Preservation Order procedure must be written in or translated into Swedish. This will ensure that the time limits prescribed in the Regulation and the underlying objectives of efficiency and promptness can be satisfied.</p>
<p>For cases when a Swedish court is obliged under the European Account Preservation Order Regulation to translate documents, we propose that the court, if possible, engage an authorised translator for this task.</p>
<p>We propose that it be possible for courts and other authorities to charge fees in the same way as occurs in similar national procedures. Furthermore, we propose that the Swedish Enforcement Authority be allowed to charge a fee for the new procedure of obtaining bank account information.</p>
<h2>Financial impact</h2>
<p>We estimate that our proposals may entail a certain cost for the Swedish Enforcement Authority. This should be accommodated within the Authority’s current appropriation framework. No material increase in costs for general courts, other authorities or banks is foreseen, nor are the proposals expected to lead to increased costs for individuals or businesses.</p>
