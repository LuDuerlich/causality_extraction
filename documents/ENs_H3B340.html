<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>A large proportion of people in Sweden own their own home. In most cases, the purchase has been financed by a residential mortgage loan. Mortgages therefore play a very important role in many people’s private economy. Since mortgages make up the bulk of loans to households in Sweden, the functioning and stability of the mortgage market also affects the economy as a whole. For these reasons, it is important that the legislation applying to mortgages and the granting of credit is clear and that there is a good balance between consumers’ and creditors’ interests.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s remit</h2>
<p>The main task of the Inquiry has been to propose modes of implementing in Swedish law the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 February 2014 on credit agreements for consumers relating to residential immovable property (the Mortgage Credit Directive). In addition, the Inquiry has had various other associated issues to examine. This has included measures to increase transparency for consumers into how the mortgage rate is set and to promote a sound amortisation culture.</p>
<h2>The Mortgage Credit Directive</h2>
<p>The purpose of the Mortgage Credit Directive is to create better conditions in the internal market for mortgages while establishing a high level of consumer protection. The Mortgage Credit Directive contains provisions on: – information provided in marketing materials and information provided to the consumer before an agreement is entered into; – the design of offers of credits related to residential immovable property; – the consumer’s right to a period of reflection or a period of withdrawal; – the assessment of creditworthiness; – advice on credits related to residential immovable property; and – loans in foreign currency.</p>
<p>The Mortgage Credit Directive also contains requirements to the effect that creditors and credit intermediaries providing mortgages must be approved and supervised by national authorities. In addition, the Directive lays down requirements for knowledge and competence on the part of those dealing with mortgages. The Directive also prescribes that remuneration and commissions within enterprises and between creditors and credit intermediaries must not be determined in a manner that risks being detrimental to consumer interests. Further, the Directive contains provisions on property valuation.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>Implementation of the Mortgage Credit Directive</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a new commercial law act on creditors and credit intermediaries offering residential mortgage loans. The act should contain basic requirements for authorisation for these activities, which will also apply to those offering mortgage advice on a professional basis. It is also proposed that the act contain requirements concerning the activities of creditors and credit intermediaries with regard to the enterprises’ remuneration systems, the knowledge and competence of staff and management, and standards for valuation of residential immovable property offered as security for a loan. The enterprises covered by the act will be subject to supervision by Finansinspektionen (the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority), which will have the power to impose sanctions in the event of negligence.</p>
<p>Authorisation is already a requirement for banks and other credit institutions, and these enterprises are already subject to supervision by Finansinspektionen. However, in their mortgage credit activities the credit institutions will be obliged to apply the rules in the new act concerning remuneration systems, knowledge and competence, and valuation of residential immovable property.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes the introduction of a number of new provisions on credits related to residential immovable property in the Consumer Credit Act (2010:1846). These provisions will apply to all granting – and in some cases intermediation – of residential mortgage loans. They refer to requirements on marketing and general information about such loans and requirements on prior information to the consumer using a special standardised EU form. In addition there will be special requirements regarding prior information in connection with the intermediation of residential mortgage loans. The new rules will also give the consumer the right to a seven-day period of reflection before a mortgage offer has to be accepted. Limits will also be imposed on the possibility of a creditor making the offer of a residential mortgage loan conditional on the consumer buying other financial products. Several new provisions will be introduced on advice relating to mortgages. The consumer must always receive advance information on the advice that can be offered, and the conditions that apply, e.g. the product range that the advice refers to. The advice must be documented by the creditor or credit intermediary. The provisions will not require a business operator to give advice. If no advice is provided, the consumer must always be informed of this.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes new provisions on the assessment of creditworthiness in connection with granting a residential mortgage loan. The new regulations are largely a codification of the requirements that already follow from the general advice on creditworthiness assessment issued by Finansinspektionen and the Swedish Consumer Agency.</p>
<p>Further, the Inquiry proposes new provisions on mortgage loans in foreign currencies. What constitutes such a loan depends on the consumer’s circumstances. If, for example, the consumer has income or assets in a currency other than the one in which the loan is taken out, the consumer risks being adversely affected if the exchange rate changes. The consumer must therefore always be offered insurance or some other arrangement to limit the exchange rate risk to which the consumer is exposed.</p>
<p>With regard to supervision, the Inquiry’s proposals will mean that both Finansinspektionen and the Swedish Consumer Agency will exercise supervision and be able to impose sanctions on enterprises that violate the new provisions in the Consumer Credit Act.</p>
<p>Increased transparency about how the mortgage rate is set and requirement concerning individual amortisation plans</p>
<p>The proposals described build on the regulations in the Mortgage Credit Directive. The Inquiry has also presented proposals that go beyond the basic level of consumer protection provided in the Directive. In order to increase transparency about the way in which the mortgage rate is determined, the Inquiry proposes that when a consumer is offered a mortgage, the consumer should always receive information about various factors that have influenced the rate that is offered. The consumer must also always receive information about the creditor’s average mortgage rate over the preceding 12-month period and the creditor’s own costs for financing the loan. If the consumer has been offered a product package in addition to the mortgage, the creditor must provide information about how this has affected the mortgage rate and what each of the various parts of the package costs separately. The proposed regulations will supplement the regulations adopted by Finansinspektionen in February 2015 concerning publication of information about average mortgage rates on the creditors’ websites.</p>
<p>To encourage a healthier amortisation culture, the Inquiry proposes to require the creditor to discuss amortisation with the consumer and present an individually tailored amortisation plan that is in the consumer’s long-term interest. The discussion must be held and the plan presented no later than when the creditor presents a binding mortgage offer. During the term of validity of the mortgage agreement as well, the consumer will be entitled to demand that the creditor present an individually tailored amortisation plan for her or him. The proposal is intended to supplement the regulations on amortisation requirements that were proposed by Finansinspektionen in March 2015.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s deliberations</h2>
<p>Implementation of the Mortgage Credit Directive</p>
<p>An EU Directive is binding for the Member States as regards the results to be achieved, but leaves it up to the Member States to determine the form of implementation. The Inquiry has proceeded from the given assumption that the Mortgage Credit Directive must be implemented so as to achieve the purpose of the Directive and its intended results. In cases where the Inquiry has been able to choose between different alternatives for implementation, it has sought to ensure a high level of consumer protection, in line with Swedish conditions. The Inquiry has also taken account of the interest of Swedish creditors and credit intermediaries that equal conditions should apply to all business operators and that the regulations applying to different types of credit should be as similar as possible. In addition, the Inquiry has sought to minimise the additional costs the new rules will entail for the enterprises concerned. If the enterprises’ costs increase, there is a risk that it is ultimately consumers that will suffer, through the enterprises raising their prices.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has proceeded on the assumption that the system underlying the current statutory regulations on the granting of credit to consumers should be preserved. Consequently, the Inquiry has proposed that all provisions concerning the individual mortgage agreement and the obligations of the business operator towards the consumer be inserted into the Consumer Credit Act and formulated so as to fit the Act in its current form. In many cases the provisions of the Mortgage Credit Directive have agreed with Swedish law as it currently stands and no new statutory regulations have then been needed.</p>
<p>With regard to rules on authorisation, supervision and sanctions, and to provisions concerning the internal organisation of financial enterprises, these are currently found in various commercial law acts. As there is no commercial law regulation covering all creditors and credit intermediaries active in the mortgage market, a new act has been needed for these enterprises, with the exception of enterprises that are credit institutions, in order to implement these aspects of the Mortgage Credit Directive.</p>
<p>Increased transparency about how the mortgage rate is set and requirement concerning individual amortisation plans</p>
<p>The proposals on better information about the way in which mortgage rates and prices are set and an individually tailored amortisation plan have been based on two reports produced by</p>
<p>Finansinspektionen on the Government’s instructions. The Inquiry shares Finansinspektionen’s opinion that the current mortgage market is far too much affected by a lack of transparency. According to a common perception, the rates listed by the banks do not always correspond to the rate that is actually offered. As it can be difficult to understand which factors have influenced the rate that is offered, it is also difficult for the consumer to take well-founded decisions. If consumers know more about the factors that influence the pricing of residential mortgage loans and financial product packages, it may be easier for them to compare different offers and take more well-founded decisions. This will also put consumers in a better position to negotiate with different creditors. In the Inquiry’s view, the proposed individualised mandatory information and explanation fulfils a function that goes beyond the regulations adopted by Finansinspektionen concerning publication of information about average mortgage rates and on the factors gererally influencing the mortgage rate offered, as it gives the consumer a better knowledge base which is specially tailored to the individual circumstances.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also shares Finansinspektionen’s opinion that an individually tailored amortisation plan can promote a healthy amortisation culture and be a flexible instrument for consumers in assessing the effects of amortisation in the longer term. This applies regardless of whether or not amortisation requirements are introduced by regulations issued by Finansinspektionen.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposals</h2>
<p>In some respects, the new regulations applying to creditors and credit intermediaries, both in the new commercial law act and in the Consumer Credit Act, will demand more of business operators than is currently the case. Living up to the additional requirements will entail extra work – and hence extra costs – for business operators. This is the case, for example, with the new requirements for information for consumers, e.g. through the standardised EU information sheet, the new information requirements in connection with the binding mortgage offer and in connection with mortgage advice. However, in certain cases the new provisions will not entail any significant change from the current practices followed by creditors and credit intermediaries. This is true, for example, of requirements concerning the assessment of creditworthiness and the obtaining of information from credit databases.</p>
<p>The introduction of a new commercial law act will entail costs for enterprises that are not credit institutions and that will have to apply for authorisation to engage in mortgage activities. These enterprises will then have to pay various fees to Finansinspektionen.</p>
<p>As the Inquiry’s proposals are mainly a consequence of an EU Directive, there is no possibility of refraining from implementing a regulation designed to meet the demands of the Directive. This is true regardless of whether the new regulations lead to increased costs for businesses. Having said that, the proposals as a whole aim to ensure that more consumers are better informed and therefore able to make better and more active choices than at present. This in turn can lead to improved competition and better conditions for consumers in the mortgage market. Overall this should have positive consequences for the economy as a whole.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>The provisions implementing the requirements of the Mortgage Credit Directive must take effect by 21 March 2016, in accordance with the Directive. The Inquiry therefore proposes that in the main the proposed statutes enter into force on this date.</p>
