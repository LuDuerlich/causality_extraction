<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Basis</h2>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The Committee’s main task is to propose new regulations for labour migration from countries outside the EEA and Switzerland. The regulations should be designed to meet long term and short term labour market needs for manpower. Wages, insurance cover- age and other terms of employment must be equal to the condi- tions that apply to Swedish manpower.</p>
<p>The Committee’s proposal should be regarded in light of our extensive factual review of Swedish demographic trends and the labour market, as well the survey of international conditions we performed to find out how other countries are managing labour migration, which we presented in an interim report.</p>
<p>Labour shortages</p>
<p>There is no widespread labour shortage in Sweden today, but there may be shortages in specific occupations, labour market sectors and local labour markets and regions in Sweden.</p>
<p>Labour shortages and unemployment can co-exist in the labour market. Mobility among occupations and regions is not sufficient to equalise these differences. In many cases, an unemployed person’s skills do not match the requirements for vacancies.</p>
<p>The obvious manpower base is the working age population and the percentage who are employed. Available manpower in the EEA and Switzerland also affects the total supply of manpower in Sweden through the free movement of persons. The open Nordic labour market has made it possible to reduce labour market imbalances to a certain extent, but there has been relatively little</p>
<p>influx from other countries. Future enlargements of the EU will expand Community manpower, but all countries in the EEA have ageing populations and may experience labour shortage problems in the future.</p>
<p>It is difficult to make reliable forecasts of which parts of the labour market may experience future labour shortages. The further into the future the forecasts reach, the less reliable they become. In a trend expected to continue, the Swedish labour market is be- coming increasingly knowledge-intensive.</p>
<p>When demand for manpower exceeds supply, the first action should be to mobilise more of the people who are outside the labour market. This could be accomplished if groups such as the foreign-born, people with disabilities and people over 55 were more effectively utilised. Endeavours to reduce the number of people on long-term sick leave and in activity compensation programmes are also significant, along with facilitating labour market entry for youth.</p>
<p>More effectively utilising people who are seeking jobs and improving the employment rate are the most important aspects of preventing labour shortages. Beyond those measures, labour migration from third countries may be a beneficial supplement that prevents the negative consequences of a labour shortage.</p>
<p>Current law and its history</p>
<p>There was a system in the 1950s and 1960s under which citizens of a large number of countries were allowed to freely enter Sweden and apply for residence and work permits while in the country.</p>
<p>Problems arose in the 1960s and new regulations were intro- duced requiring employment and a work permit to be arranged prior to entry into Sweden and that immigration should take place through collective transfers of non-Nordic manpower. Decisions on work permits would, as before, be taken by the central aliens’ affairs agency, i.e., the Swedish Immigration Board. Before taking a decision, the Immigration Board was supposed to consult with the Swedish National Labour Market Board (AMS), which in turn referred the matter to the relevant trade union. The last collective recruitment took place in Yugoslavia in 1973. In other respects, the regulations from the 1968 guidelines laid down by the Riksdag are largely still in force.</p>
<p>Current regulations specify three main groups of labour immi- grants. Permanent residence permits may be granted to aliens who have been offered permanent employment, those who have special qualifications, and if the manpower requirement cannot be met by jobseekers inside the country or through recruitment from an EEA country or Switzerland. Temporary work permits may be granted to workers who are offered employment in an occupation for which there is a temporary labour shortage and to workers partici- pating in international exchange programmes.</p>
<p>Current AMS guidelines for assessing applications for permits on labour market grounds state that third country nationals may not be concentrated to workplaces where difficulties recruiting manpower may be connected to pay scales, the work environment, local conditions, or similar factors. Wages, insurance coverage and other terms of employment shall, at minimum, be equal to those required by Swedish collective agreements or the terms and condi- tions prevailing in the occupation or industry. Work hours must be adequate for employees to earn enough to support themselves while in Sweden and housing must be arranged before they enter the country. The relevant trade union must be afforded the opportunity to express an opinion.</p>
<p>Decisions on permanent residence permits on labour market grounds and work permits are taken by the Swedish Migration Board or another agency authorised by the Migration Board.</p>
<p>Labour migration – an international survey</p>
<p>There is both immigration to and emigration from all countries to one extent or another.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the migration policy that addresses the management of migration flows between countries has three main tasks: to grant asylum to people who are entitled to protection under international conventions and national law; to create rules that allow people in whose settlement in the country is in the national interest; and to exclude people whose settlement in the country is undesirable for various reasons.</p>
<p>With respect to labour migration, the aim is always to benefit the host country in one way or another.</p>
<p>A significant share of migration worldwide is temporary, in the sense that most migrants intend to return to their countries of</p>
<p>origin after a period abroad. A not insignificant share of migration takes place outside the rules. In certain countries, the number of migrants who are in the country and working in the illicit labour market can be significant. This group of migrants are in a foreign country illegally and are accordingly the most vulnerable and likely to be exploited by unscrupulous employers or criminal organisa- tions. This phenomenon also exists in Sweden.</p>
<p>Emigration has both positive and negative impact on emigrant countries. It appears that the positive factors outweigh the negative in many emigrant countries.</p>
<p>Cooperation within the EU</p>
<p>That the national population should have preferential access to vacancies is the prevailing view within the entire EU. In 1994, the Heads of State and Government adopted the principle of prefer- ence for vacancies for people already residing in the EU. The principle of Community preference is not legally binding, although certainly politically so, and does not constitute grounds for legal action.</p>
<p>The principle of Community preference was later confirmed in the transitional measures in the Treaties of Accession of 16 April 2003.</p>
<p>The work of the European Commission with the Green Paper on an EU approach to managing economic migration has direct significance to the issue of labour immigration to Sweden. The process resulted in an action plan for legal migration with emphasis on economic migration in late December 2005.</p>
<p>The action plan illustrates that the Commission does not believe the time is ripe to create comprehensive EU regulations on labour migration. The Commission does believe it has support for proceeding with certain framework legislation that would cover migrant rights and with the design of a Community residence and work permit.</p>
<p>Two areas are of special interest to the Committee because the Commission intends to present draft directives. These apply to rules pertaining to highly educated manpower and seasonal workers who are third country nationals. The fundamental premises of these drafts are that Member Countries will retain the power to decide the number of third country nationals allowed to</p>
<p>enter and stay in their countries and that the Community preference principle will remain intact.</p>
<p>The Committee’s points of departure</p>
<p>The Committee’s points of departure during the process were:</p>
<p>Migration is a quantitatively increasing social phenomenon that contributes to social development. Migration has always existed and will continue to exist, most likely to a higher extent. It is only natural for a society to attempt in various ways to influence migration and steer it in the direction most beneficial to the society.</p>
<p>The demographic trend towards an ageing population and the resulting heavier burden of support upon the working popula- tion may lead to negative structural consequences for the labour market and the national economy. These demographic changes are something we have in common with other high income countries. An ageing population may also cause a less dynamic labour market. Increased labour migration may help ameliorate these effects.</p>
<p>Labour immigration may help vitalise the Swedish labour market and the economy. Regulations must be relaxed to make this possible to a greater extent. At the same time, decisive action must be taken to prevent increased labour immigration from creating negative effects on the labour market. The needs upon which regulatory changes are based should be assessed not only from the quantitative angle, but also from a qualitative perspective with consideration given to the various types of positive effects that may ensue.</p>
<p>Labour immigrants are people who move to Sweden to work and have permits to settle in the country. Normally, a person must be registered in the population register to be considered a resident. For immigrants to be entered in the population register, they must intend to stay in Sweden for at least twelve months. Immigrants do not have full access to all parts of the Swedish welfare system until they are registered.</p>
<p>The Committee believes that labour immigration should continue to be regulated; that is, conditions for labour immigration should be established by law and statute and decisions in migration</p>
<p>cases should be taken by government agencies. The main rule is that residence and work permits must be granted prior to entry into Sweden.</p>
<p>The objective of labour immigration for the employee, the employer and society as a whole is that it should lead to a positive result. It cannot be ignored, however, that there are risks involved. The responsibility must accordingly be shared among those involved: employers, employees and society through the relevant agencies. The employer makes a particular effort and takes certain risks by recruiting outside national borders. For the third country national, the risks of moving to a new country with new cultural and social conditions and a new language are obvious. Society’s responsibility becomes to provide security for this individual and his or her family if something unexpected should happen. These three parties must for that reason be included in the decision process. Society has the ultimate responsibility for maintaining regulated immigration and for ensuring the legitimacy of the system.</p>
<p>The reasons Sweden needs to continue regulating labour immigration are:</p>
<p>1. Regulated labour immigration puts focus on the need for man- power expressed as a labour shortage. Labour immigration shall thus not be able to shut manpower already available in the country out of the labour market.</p>
<p>2. One purpose of regulation is to ensure that wages, insurance coverage and other terms of employment for people who immigrate to work will be equal to the conditions that apply to employees already in the country. In order to guarantee this principle of equal treatment, the relevant trade union must be consulted and the decision on whether a person should be allowed to immigrate to work in our country should rest ultimately with a government agency.</p>
<p>3. Generally speaking, government agencies should facilitate positive impact on the Swedish labour market and economy through regulated labour immigration.</p>
<p>4. Another reason in favour of  agency-based examination is that the Swedish welfare system is essentially open to anyone who lives in Sweden. Swedish society shoulders the responsibility for providing public service. This service naturally also applies to people who immigrate to work and their families. Once they</p>
<p>are in the population register and accepted as immigrants, they essentially have the same rights and obligations in society as everyone else who lives here.</p>
<p>The Committee finds that regulated immigration will minimise the risks for the most closely concerned parties in the migration process. The individual employee gains employment with an employer that offers terms equal to those that apply to others in the same occupation. The employer is assured that the employee has been granted a residence and work permit after consideration by a government agency and is welcome to work and settle in Sweden. The agencies have performed a conduct and security assessment of the person and have been given reasonable assur- ances that the employee will be given a job with pay and employ- ment terms on par with other employees without shutting other suitable applicants out. The Committee finds that such a decision and consultation process surrounding labour immigration has the most favourable conditions for creating public consensus on these issues, which is a prerequisite for a positive outcome to labour immigration for all concerned.</p>
<p>The magnitude of future labour immigration will depend on labour market trends. The need at any given time must determine the volume of immigration. If there is a large need for third coun- try manpower, the proposed regulations could allow immigration of manpower in demand and when demand is low, the regulations would result in low immigration. As future labour immigration of third country nationals will depend on Swedish economic and labour market trends, it is impossible to state future immigration of labour immigrants in absolute numbers.</p>
<p>People who immigrate to Sweden for labour market reasons are in a relatively good situation with regard to integration by reason of the connection to their workplaces. Labour immigrants may be victims of discrimination of a more general nature, but the Committee finds that labour immigration is more likely to have a positive impact on the public’s views on immigration and the status of immigrants in our country.</p>
<p>Rules for permits</p>
<p>The new regulations for labour immigration from countries outside the EEA and Switzerland that the Committee is proposing and the Committee’s deliberations fall within three categories: temporary work permits based on labour shortages, international exchange programmes and seasonal work permits; permanent residence permits on labour market grounds and contract operations.</p>
<p>Temporary work permits on labour shortage grounds</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that it should be possible to grant temporary work permits to third country nationals who are offered employment on the grounds that the manpower requirement cannot be met through recruitment within the EEA or Switzerland. Wages, insurance coverage and other terms of employment for people who immigrate to work should be on par with those that apply in the occupation or industry for employees already in the country. There should be an additional condition that income from the job must be adequate to support the employee.</p>
<p>One of the Committee’s fundamental premises in the process has been that longer periods of validity for permits benefit the Swedish labour market and that this should be the basis for designing residence and work permits. This may make Sweden more attractive to in-demand manpower because a longer period of validity gives the individual immigrant greater opportunity to plan for the stay in Sweden.</p>
<p>It should be possible for a temporary residence permit, or an extension of one, to be converted to a permanent residence permit. The Committee thus proposes extending the period of validity for temporary residence and work permits to 24 months with possible extension of the permit after reconsideration by a maximum of 24 additional months. After 48 months with a work permit, a permanent residence permit is normally granted. Reconsideration may also result in a permanent residence permit on labour market grounds being granted earlier than after 48 months. If the term of employment at initial application is shorter than 24 months, a residence and work permit would be granted only for that period.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s view, the basic condition for a third country national to be granted a work permit should be that he or she has</p>
<p>been offered employment because there is a labour shortage in the occupation to which the employment refers.</p>
<p>When employees want to extend their stay in Sweden after the initial permit period, the residence and work permit must be recon- sidered. Consideration of the application will include confirming that the basic conditions for the permit have been met. The applicant will also be checked to ensure there is no criminal record.</p>
<p>In cases where the applicant is still working at the first job, an extended work permit is granted. In these cases, no new labour market consideration will be performed to determine whether there is still a shortage of manpower in the occupation. In cases where the employee is no longer at the first job and has received an offer of new employment, however, the customary labour market consideration of the new offer of employment will be performed.</p>
<p>If the original employment has been terminated when a permit is reconsidered and there is no other offer of employment, a new residence or work permit would not be granted and the person would be required to leave the country. When third country nationals have a new offer of employment, they should be allowed to apply for a new work permit while still in Sweden if employment is terminated during the term of employment. If a new work permit is not granted within three months, the residence and work permit should be revoked and the third country national should leave the country.</p>
<p>In all cases involving applications for extended permits on the grounds of a labour shortage, it should be possible to apply within Sweden.</p>
<p>Work permits should be connected to a specific occupation and specific employer during the initial permit period. If the person is still in the same employment when the work permit is reconsidered, the extended permit will be connected only to the occupation.</p>
<p>The connection to a specific occupation and employer achieves the purpose of ensuring that the manpower requirement is actually met at the employer that has made the special effort required to recruit manpower from a third country. In cases where the primary issue is a regional shortage within an occupation, the connection to the employer ensures that regional requirements are actually met.</p>
<p>In common with the rules that apply to EU citizens, a third country national should be allowed to remain in Sweden for three</p>
<p>months to seek new employment if the initial employment is terminated.</p>
<p>Work permits for employment under international exchange programmes</p>
<p>The Committee finds there is no valid reason to recommend any significant changes to the current permit regulations within the framework of international exchange programmes.</p>
<p>Seasonal work permits</p>
<p>The Committee finds that current regulations on seasonal work permits should remain in force. Seasonal manpower should how- ever be regarded as a special category, as it differs materially from labour immigration.</p>
<p>Permanent residence permits on labour market grounds</p>
<p>The Committee finds that no changes should be made to current regulations on granting permanent residence permits on labour market grounds.</p>
<p>Permanent residence permits on labour market grounds should – in accordance with applicable law – be granted upon immigration only to people who possess special qualifications and who have been offered permanent employment in an occupation that requires special qualifications. In addition, there must be a shortage of such manpower in Sweden and within the EEA and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Conditions for family members</p>
<p>The Committee finds that family members of persons granted permits on labour market grounds should be granted residence and work permits to the same extent as presently.</p>
<p>A fundamental principle in Swedish migration policy is that the nuclear family should be kept together as far as possible. The Committee also finds that a generous policy for accompanying</p>
<p>family members entails a competitive advantage for Sweden in relation to countries that apply a more restrictive policy.</p>
<p>Job-seeker visas for certain groups</p>
<p>The Committee proposes new grounds for issuing visas. It should be possible to grant a visa to a third country national for a period of no more than three months for the purpose of seeking employ- ment in Sweden.</p>
<p>Job-seeker visas may facilitate recruitment of third country nationals by making it possible for them to make contact with potential employers looking for manpower while they are visiting Sweden. Special conditions, in addition to the general requirements that always apply to uniform Schengen visas, should be attached to these grounds for issuing visas so that they are connected to a labour shortage within an occupation or occupational category. The conditions for job-seeker visas should be specified in the visa guidelines for individual countries established by the Swedish Migration Board Directorate. The Migration Board Directorate’s visa guidelines in this respect should be established in consultation with the Labour Market Administration.</p>
<p>The requirements for job-seeker visas should be connected to the conditions for getting a work permit so that people who have good prospects of gaining employment in Sweden apply for and are granted job-seeker visas. This will permit advance consideration of the skills and qualifications of potential job-seekers in relation to confirmed shortages and manpower requirements in our country.</p>
<p>To be granted a job-seeker visa, the applicant should have an occupation for which there is explicit need in Sweden. The Labour Market Administration should compile a list of such occupations, or industries, in a manner similar to the current process for ‘general statements’. In these cases, the Labour Market Administration should take decisions in consultation with the social parties to the labour market.</p>
<p>People who have been granted a visa for the purpose of seeking employment should be allowed to apply for a residence and work permit after entering Sweden. The same should apply to people who are visa-exempt and who are applying for a work permit in an occupation that has been entered on the special list of occupations or industries that is a requirement for granting job-seeker visas.</p>
<p>The Committee recommends that regulations on job-seeker visas should be evaluated after a while to assess the consequences on the Swedish labour market of these new grounds for visas.</p>
<p>Agency-based labour market consideration</p>
<p>Labour market consideration is fundamental to the current system of permit consideration. Labour immigration is an issue that affects all of society, not only the individual and the employer. Accordingly, agency-based labour market consideration should be retained.</p>
<p>Labour market consideration fulfils two purposes: to ensure that there is no available manpower in Sweden or the rest of the EEA and Switzerland suitable for the vacancies, and to ensure that wages, insurance coverage and other terms of employment for labour immigrants are equal to those which apply to employees already in the country. This task should remain the purview of the Labour Market Administration. Statements from the relevant trade union should be obtained.</p>
<p>Agency-based labour market consideration minimises the risk of over-supply of foreign manpower causing job-seekers to be pushed out of the labour market. This will give credibility and legitimacy to the labour immigration system.</p>
<p>Independent consideration by the Migration Board is essentially limited to checking the applicant’s conduct, including by checking the criminal records registry. The Board must also assess whether the application is based on true information and determine that there has been no attempt to circumvent the Aliens Act for any reason. This consideration is performed in all residence permit cases. In this respect, the Committee does not believe there is any latitude for proposing changes to the process, either for the indi- vidual or for the agency.</p>
<p>The Committee’s proposal for streamlining processing is that the process should not be allowed to take longer than ten business days from the date the employer registers an offer of employment on the AMS website to the date the employer is notified as to whether a work permit has been granted or denied. The relevant trade union must have submitted its statement within five business days of having received the offer of employment for comment. The Labour Market Administration will no longer confirm that housing</p>
<p>has been arranged. That the person has adequate funds to cover housing costs will instead be presumed part of the check of wage conditions.</p>
<p>Work permits for visiting students</p>
<p>The Committee recommends that visiting students who have com- pleted studies equal to 20 college credits or have completed one term as a visiting student in a post-graduate programme should be allowed to apply for residence and work permits from inside Sweden. Visiting students who have basic eligibility for post- graduate programmes should be granted work permits without having to undergo labour market consideration.</p>
<p>Permits for self-employed persons</p>
<p>Swedish regulations on immigration by self-employed persons are comparatively open and generous. People who can prove that they can support themselves and their families by means other than employment may be granted a residence permit after a certain probationary period.</p>
<p>The Committee recommends that this generous system should remain in place, but we propose minor changes to the rules to make it more difficult to abuse the regulations.</p>
<p>Asylum-seekers and the labour market</p>
<p>Evaluation of the system that exempts certain asylum-seekers from the work permit requirement</p>
<p>Asylum-seekers are currently allowed to work while awaiting a decision in their case if processing time is expected to exceed four months. The work permit exemption applies until the decision in the asylum case has taken legal force. The Committee was given a special mandate to evaluate this system.</p>
<p>If it is judged that a decision on enforced return or deportation cannot be executed involuntarily due to conditions in the recipient country, the exemption applies until the alien leaves the country.</p>
<p>The Migration Board estimated the number of people with jobs in the open labour market in November 2005 at 715. There were 6,005 registered asylum-seekers with exemption at 31 December 2005. These figures indicate that slightly more than one-tenth of asylum- seekers with exemption were in work at the end of that year. This a very marginal addition to the Swedish labour market. We emphasise that these figures are very rough estimates.</p>
<p>The Committee recommends that asylum-seekers should continue to be allowed to work with an exemption from the work permit requirement if the waiting time in the asylum case is expected to exceed four months. Exemption should not be granted to asylum-seekers who do not have identification documents if the person has failed to do that which can reasonably be required to verify identity.</p>
<p>Applications for work permits after asylum is denied</p>
<p>The Committee finds that no change should be made to current regulations by which asylum-seekers who have been working under exemption from work permit and whose applications for asylum have been rejected cannot have their applications for a work permit considered before leaving the country. The Committee points out that in certain special cases where strong humanitarian grounds exist, there is an exemption provision that allows an application to be considered after entry into Sweden if “exceptional grounds otherwise exist”.</p>
<p>Consequences of the proposals</p>
<p>Consequences in Sweden</p>
<p>Regulations based mainly on the principle that labour immigration should be allowed when there is a shortage of suitable manpower preclude making any advance determinations of the volume of labour immigration. This naturally complicates analysis of the consequences of the proposed regulations.</p>
<p>The main purpose of expanded labour immigration is to relieve labour shortages that may arise in parts of the Swedish labour market. Our estimation of the conjectured economic consequences of labour immigration under the regulations we propose shows</p>
<p>immediate economic gains for society. Revenues from taxes and fees exceed the costs of income distribution and public consump- tion. Beyond this directly quantifiable economic gain, we expect labour immigration to help resolve situations in the labour market where there is a labour shortage and thus create positive impact on the labour market and the national economy.</p>
<p>The estimated economic gain to society is based on the assumption that labour immigrants will be young when they come to Sweden and that many will leave Sweden while they are still of working age. Many labour immigrants and their families are educated in the country of origin, where they also receive health care and social services in old age. However, the regulations we propose provide latitude for people to stay longer in Sweden than is possible under current regulations and also makes it possible for more labour immigrants to be granted permanent residence permits than is the case today.</p>
<p>Swedish language skills are essential to the integration of labour immigrants and their families into Swedish society. In addition to an effective Swedish language instruction programme, day-to-day life in the workplace is an important factor in integration, which is an advantage for these immigrants compared to others. However, there is probably less interest in integrating into Swedish society among labour immigrants who intend to stay only a limited time in Sweden.</p>
<p>We also expect the high employment rate for labour immigrants (and under our proposed regulations essentially all labour immi- grants will be employed) may have positive impact on integration for all immigrants in Sweden.</p>
<p>With respect to labour law, we believe there may be an indirect negative impact on application of the regulations if a large percent- age of workers in Sweden do not speak Swedish or have only poor Swedish language skills. We presume that employers and trade unions will act to provide labour immigrants with the prerequisites for learning Swedish and basic information about terms and conditions in the Swedish labour market. Our general assessment is that no changes need be made to current labour legislation based on our proposals for new labour immigration regulations. It is however of critical importance that labour immigration does not shut existing manpower out of the labour market and that conditions on equal treatment in relation to other manpower are met.</p>
<p>The interests of emigrant countries</p>
<p>The Committee shares the increasingly widespread belief that labour immigrants or visiting students who return to their countries of origin take home new skills that can contribute to development in the home country. Generally speaking, migration benefits emigrant countries in two ways: they get skills and experi- ence back when migrants return, and migrants send home large sums of money.</p>
<p>The special responsibility Sweden has with regard to develop- ment in poor countries should be managed within the framework of the policy for global development. This context may involve developing models for further stimulating return, whether permanently or for a more limited time, by migrants who can contribute to the development of their home countries. Another aspect is to facilitate secure and inexpensive systems migrants can use to send money home so that it can be put to optimal use in the home country. Sweden should also work on the international level to ensure that migration can take place under safe and organised forms and that the rights of labour immigrants are upheld.</p>
<p>Dissenting opinions</p>
<p>Some of the members dissented against parts of the Committee’s proposals or arguments.</p>
<p>A minority believe that the component of labour market con- sideration referring to labour shortages should be carried out by the employer, that temporary residence permits should not be connected to a specific occupation and that people should be allowed to apply for temporary residence permits for the purpose of work while in Sweden, even if they are asylum-seekers. How- ever, this would in the case of asylum-seekers require a method to prevent abuse of the right to seek asylum so that applications are not made solely to gain access to the labour market. A minority are also sceptical towards the worry that employers might prefer to employ foreign citizens rather than Swedish citizens, which they find the majority have expressed in the report.</p>
<p>One member disagrees with the proposal that temporary permits should be connected to an occupation when they are renewed. An opinion was also expressed that no additional labour market</p>
<p>consideration should be performed in the individual case if the applicant’s occupation or industry is found on the list compiled in connection with preparation of job-seeker visas. It was also proposed that asylum-seekers who are not immediately returned or whose applications are not obviously groundless should without exception be granted exemption from the work permit require- ment. In light of the Riksdag’s consideration of the issue of the possibility to apply for a residence permit after an application for asylum has been rejected, it was proposed that the Committee should refrain from dealing with the issue.</p>
<p>One member’s opinions include that requirements for getting a job-seeker visa should be lowered in relation to the requirements for a uniform Schengen visa or that otherwise national job-seeker visas should be issued, that permanent residence permits should as a rule be granted after two years with a temporary permit, that labour immigrants should be allowed to apply for Swedish citizen- ship after three years, that people who are currently living and working in Sweden illegally should be allowed to regularise their situations and that the Committee should have more thoroughly analysed problems related to ethnic discrimination.</p>
