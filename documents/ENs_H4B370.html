<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Inquiry’s remit</h2>
<p>The aim of our assignment, as outlined in this final report, was to investigate whether there is a need for measures to ensure strong criminal law protection against human trafficking, and to investigate whether there is a need to clarify, broaden or in some other way amend the criminal law protection against both  forced labour or exploitation for other activities in situations involving distress for the victims, and  improper financial exploitation of people in a vulnerable situation. In this context, our task has been to:</p>
<p>• review current practice to clarify the application of the human trafficking provision and analyse how it has developed since 2010;</p>
<p>• highlight and analyse whether there are any particular problems with interpretation or other difficulties in applying the penalty provision;</p>
<p>• consider whether there is a need to clarify or otherwise amend the provision on human trafficking offences;</p>
<p>• examine and analyse how police and prosecutors investigate and otherwise handle cases involving human trafficking;</p>
<p>• consider measures to strengthen the quality and effectiveness of criminal investigations and increase prosecutions of human trafficking offences;</p>
<p>• review the scales of penalties for human trafficking and procuring;</p>
<p>• analyse and decide whether there is a need to clarify, broaden or in some other way amend the criminal law protection against forced labour or exploitation for other activities in situations that involve distress for the victims; and</p>
<p>• analyse and decide whether there is a need to clarify, broaden or in some other way amend the criminal law protection against improper economic exploitation of people in a vulnerable situation.</p>
<p>Our remit also included proposing legislative amendments where necessary. For further information on our terms of reference, see annexes 1–5.</p>
<p>In June this year we presented our interim report, Strong criminal law protection against the purchase of sexual services and the exploitation of children via the purchase of sexual acts, etc . (SOU 2016:42). The report outlined various issues concerning the purchase of sexual services, the purchase of sexual acts from children, and the negligence requirement contained in Chapter 6, Section 13 of the Swedish Penal Code.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s assessments and proposals Human trafficking</h2>
<p>The human trafficking provision should be amended so that it is applied in a more appropriate way</p>
<p>Human trafficking is an offence that involves the ruthless and cynical exploitation of other human beings. Moreover, human trafficking is a serious violation of the individual’s human dignity and right to decide over their own life and body.</p>
<p>Work to combat human trafficking can be pursued with various targets and aims. It can, for example, target the driving forces behind human trafficking, including curbing the demand for people to exploit for various purposes and the possibility of financial gain. The work can also aim to ensure that there is strong criminal law protection against human trafficking. Our remit concerned the latter, and we have focused in particular on measures that can ensure that more cases of human trafficking result in prosecutions and convictions for this offence. In light of this, we have evaluated the application of the provision on human trafficking.</p>
<p>The human trafficking provision was last revised in 2010, when the amendments included removing the control requirement. We have investigated whether the aim of the reform has been achieved, but also generally considered how the human trafficking provision can be amended to ensure that it is applied more adequately. We have also examined how the law enforcement authorities investigate and otherwise work on human trafficking cases. Our conclusions can be summarised as follows.</p>
<p>The analysis of statistics on police reports, prosecutions and convictions concerning human trafficking that we presented in the report show that the number of convictions for human trafficking is not only small, it is also far too small to reflect the reality of this kind of offence in Sweden. Despite the Government and authorities concerned having taken various measures to increase the number of convictions, in our view, there are still far too few police reports that lead to prosecutions and convictions for human trafficking in Sweden. There are strong indications that a large number of cases go unreported.</p>
<p>Human trafficking is an offence that builds on international conventions, and it is complex in terms of its legal technicalities. To be convicted of human trafficking under Chapter 4, Section 1 (a) of the Swedish Penal Code, an offender must have brought about a trafficking measure  (e.g. recruiting, transporting, harbouring or receiving) through improper means  (e.g. unlawful coercion, deceit or exploitation of another person’s vulnerable situation). As such, a causal link is required between the improper means and the trafficking measure. Moreover, it is a requirement that the offender’s aim  (intent) with their actions was the future exploitation  of the victim for a specific purpose (sexual purposes, the removal of organs, military service, forced labour or other activities in a situation that involves distress for the victim). A large number of circumstances must thus be proved for a conviction to be secured. Furthermore, it appears that in practice, the courts often have a tendency to still require a relationship of power (roughly equivalent to the previous control requirement), in addition to the legal requirements outlined in the human trafficking provision, to secure a conviction for human trafficking. It is therefore our view that the aim of the legislative amendment in 2010, whereby the control requirement was removed, has not been achieved.</p>
<p>To ensure that the human trafficking provision is applied more appropriately and further strengthen the criminal law protection, we propose the following amendments to the human trafficking provision.</p>
<p>• Firstly, it should be clarified that the very use of one of the improper means listed in the provision is in itself sufficient for the trafficking measures enabled to be considered to have been improperly brought about. A relationship of power between the offender and the victim should therefore not be required when applying the provision.</p>
<p>• Secondly, criminal liability should arise even if the offender demonstrated indifferent intent to exploit (cf. wilful intent, which applies at present). This broadens the criminal area to include all forms of intent, i.e. including cases in which the offender realises that their actions entail a major risk of future exploitation of the victim and they are indifferent to this risk.</p>
<p>• Thirdly, the child protection perspective should be further strengthened in cases of human trafficking involving children. It is already the case that if the victim is under the age of eighteen, the offender does not have to have brought about the trafficking measure through improper means in order to be criminally liable. However, if this rule is to be applicable, the offender must have known the victim’s age. We propose that the rule should also be applicable if the offender did not know the victim’s age, but was negligent of whether the other person had reached the age of eighteen.</p>
<p>The law enforcement authorities should handle human trafficking cases in an effective and appropriate manner</p>
<p>If human trafficking cases are to lead to prosecutions – and subsequently to possible convictions – it is a prerequisite that the law enforcement authorities conduct their work in an effective and appropriate manner. Since the Swedish Police Authority, the Swedish Prosecution Authority and the courts do not use the same case management systems or comparable terms (cf. police reports, suspicions of offences, prosecution cases and court decisions), it has not been possible for us to follow individual cases throughout the judicial chain with any ease. Nor has it been possible to follow cases within the Swedish Police Authority or the Swedish Prosecution Authority in any satisfactory way. Nonetheless, we feel able to report the following reflections in this area.</p>
<p>Based on the statistics to which we have had access, we note that 522 reports concerning human trafficking were registered by the Swedish Police Authority in the period 2011–2015. Moreover, we note that 366 suspicions of offences concerning human trafficking were registered by the Swedish Prosecution Authority in the same period, but that just ten per cent of these led to prosecution proceedings and judgments (acquittals or convictions for human trafficking or other offences). We also note that during this time period, only twelve judgments were issued that had involved an examination of human trafficking. The courts found that human trafficking had been proved in any respect in just half of these cases.</p>
<p>It has not been possible within this inquiry to analyse reports referred to the Swedish Police Authority and suspicions of offences at the Swedish Prosecution Authority to follow up how the law enforcement authorities handled these, and why they were handled in a given way. However, such an analysis is needed if we are to draw any firm conclusions about the work of the law enforcement authorities. Nonetheless, through our contacts with the law enforcement authorities, we have the impression that the reason why the majority of preliminary investigations are discontinued is a lack of surveillance and investigation resources at the Police Authority, the fact that the injured party in the majority of human trafficking cases will not or cannot fully take part in the judicial process, a lack of evidence, or, in some cases, the fact that the offender is unknown. Moreover, experience of handling human trafficking cases and their complex issues has so far been limited in the judicial system.</p>
<p>Both the Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Prosecution Authority have themselves previously analysed and identified various measures that they should improve in order to achieve greater success in their law enforcement efforts against human trafficking. We largely share the conclusions drawn by the authorities in their analyses, but we would like to particularly highlight the following measures, which we consider of particular importance if more prosecutions are to be brought and more convictions issued.</p>
<p>• Ensuring that both the Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Prosecution Authority have sufficient resources for their work to combat human trafficking.</p>
<p>• Implementing regular method and skills improvement measures at the law enforcement authorities (including regular analyses of concluded cases at both the Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Prosecution Authority).</p>
<p>• Ensuring that special groups in the Swedish Police Authority in all regions are specialised in human trafficking and related offences.</p>
<p>• Ensuring that special prosecutors in the Swedish Prosecution Authority handle all forms of human trafficking and related offences.</p>
<p>• Pursuing continuous efforts to identify potential victims, including collaboration with other government agencies and actors.</p>
<p>• Ensuring that victims of human trafficking are given greater support and protection to promote their participation in legal proceedings and their  re-establishment in society.</p>
<p>• Ensuring that human trafficking investigations focus strongly on supporting evidence.</p>
<h2>Criminal law protection against exploitation of vulnerable people in cases other than human trafficking</h2>
<p>A penalty provision should be introduced on exploitation of the distress of others</p>
<p>The human trafficking provision affords a certain amount of protection against exploitation of vulnerable people. As outlined above, however, there are a number of cases that are not covered by the provision, e.g. if the offender has not taken any trafficking measures involving the victim. This applies to cases where someone uses improper means to exploit another person for sexual purposes, the removal of organs, military service, forced labour or other activities in a situation that involves distress for the victim (e.g. begging, criminal acts and labour exploitation). Criminal law protection against exploitation in these cases should therefore be strengthened.</p>
<p>The need is particularly conspicuous in the case of forced labour, labour exploitation and exploitation for begging and criminal acts. However, in our view criminalisation should not be limited to these forms of exploitation, because regulation of that kind would be too restrictive and risk rapidly becoming obsolete as new forms of exploitation emerge. We therefore propose the criminalisation of all forms of exploitation covered by the human trafficking provision.</p>
<p>Specific criminal liability should therefore be introduced for such exploitation, thus somewhat broadening the criminal area. Criminal liability should require the use of improper means in the exploitation.</p>
<p>The offence, which should be graded, should be designated exploitation of the distress of another  and gross exploitation of the distress of another .</p>
<p>The penalty for the offence should be imprisonment for a maximum of four years or, if the offence is gross, imprisonment for a minimum of two years and a maximum of eight years.</p>
<p>A penalty provision should be introduced on improper financial exploitation of others</p>
<p>In our view, criminal law protection against improper financial exploitation of people in vulnerable situations should also be strong. In such cases it is seldom possible to claim a lack of willingness, or that the victim was threatened. In our view, the established law, primarily in the form of the provisions on fraud and usury, offers criminal law protection in some situations of exploitation. In other cases, particularly where there is no contract or other legal document and where the victim’s lack of knowledge is exploited, there is, however, a lack of adequate, appropriate criminal law protection. This applies in cases where someone improperly exploits another person’s financial difficulties, lack of knowledge or dependence to get that person to act or to fail to act in certain cases, e.g. to pay for something that is free or for unreasonable costs.</p>
<p>Specific criminal liability should therefore be introduced for anyone who improperly exploits another person’s financial difficulties, lack of knowledge or dependence to get that person to act or to fail to act in a way that entails advantage for the offender and harm for the victim or for someone else for whom they are acting.</p>
<p>The offence, which should be graded, should be designated improper financial exploitation of another  and gross improper financial exploitation of another .</p>
<p>The penalty for the offence should be fines or imprisonment for a maximum of two years or, if the offence is gross, imprisonment for a minimum of six months and a maximum of four years.</p>
<h2>The scales of penalties for human trafficking and procuring</h2>
<p>The basic starting point for all scales of penalties is the seriousness of the offence. The penalty should reflect the seriousness and reprehensibility of the offence in question. More serious offences should be punished more severely than less serious offences (proportionality), and equally serious offences should be punished equally (equivalence).</p>
<p>The scale of penalties for human trafficking is imprisonment for a minimum of two years and a maximum of ten years, and for less serious cases imprisonment for a minimum of fourteen days and a maximum of four years. The scale of penalties for procuring is imprisonment for a maximum of four years or, if the offence is gross, imprisonment for a minimum of two years and a maximum of eight years.</p>
<p>The existing scales of penalties for human trafficking and procuring are, in our view, entirely compatible with the principles of proportionality and equivalence. In our review of court practice – albeit with a limited number of human trafficking cases – it also emerged that the courts take nuanced account of any aggravating and mitigating circumstances. In our view, the current scales of penalties for both human trafficking and procuring and gross procuring therefore appear well-considered. There is thus no need to amend the scales of penalties at either end of the scale.</p>
<h2>Entry into force, etc.</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the legislative amendments enter into force on 1 July 2018. No special transitional provisions are necessary.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>We propose that the human trafficking provision be amended to make the application of the provision more appropriate. These amendments should result in more police reports leading to prosecution proceedings and convictions, which should entail increased costs for the judicial system. However, in our assessment the increase in costs can be covered within the existing appropriations to the government authorities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we propose the introduction of two new penalty provisions on exploitation of vulnerable people. This means broadening the criminal area, which may imply additional costs for the judicial system. It is impossible to estimate with any certainty the scale of the additional costs to central government, particularly as the investigations from which the majority of these new offences will stem will be based on other offences (generally human trafficking). However, in our assessment the increase in costs can be covered within the existing appropriations to the government authorities.</p>
<p>The proposed amendments can also be assumed to entail certain costs for information, training and other similar measures, primarily at the Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Prosecution Authority. Nonetheless, these costs should also be covered within the existing appropriations for each government authority.</p>
<p>Otherwise, our proposals do not in themselves entail any cost increases. In the longer term, the legislative amendments that we propose can be expected to lead to reduced crime.</p>
