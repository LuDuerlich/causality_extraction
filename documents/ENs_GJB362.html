<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>One of the prerequisites for solving Sweden's economic problems is significantly higher, sustainable development. An active growth policy must be pursued. The 1995 Working Hours Commission was set up in this perspective. The Commission's terms of reference cover three principal tasks: analysis of the long-term consequences of alternative forms of shorter working time, investigation of ways in which flexible provisions for working time can be introduced in Swedish legislation, and investigation of the consequences of the EC Working Time Directive on the Swedish regulatory system in the working time sphere.</p>
<h2>Brief Overview</h2>
<p>This interim report considers the consequences of the EC Directive. Since the Commission has been under considerable time pressure, it was decided at an early stage that any proposals for amendments to the Swedish regulations should be restricted to an essential, minimum level. As a result, our proposals have been confined to amendments which are considered to be absolutely necessary from a legal point of view for incorporation of the EC Directive into the Swedish regulatory system. This approach offers the greatest possible scope for our future consideration of these questions.</p>
<p>Taking the EC Directive as our starting point, we have made comparisons with the Swedish statutory provisions and have assessed the protective value of these provisions. We note that there are certain significant differences. Thus, under Swedish legislation, all leave to which an employee may be entitled is regarded as equivalent to working time. Apart from periods of annual leave and sick leave could be mentioned parental leave, leave for purposes of study and leave for trade union duties. Under the EC Directive the only periods equivalent to working time are periods of annual paid leave and sick leave. Another major difference is that Swedish legislation assumes the prohibition of night work, while there is no such prohibition in the EC Directive which, instead, prescribes that the duration of night shifts is to be limited.</p>
<p>In our opinion, every provision in the EC Directive corresponds to Swedish statutory provisions which, on the whole, give employees a high degree of protection. Therefore, in principle, we do not propose any amendments in statutory working time. On the other hand, we note that the optional features of the Working Hours Act must be limited as a result of the EC Directive. If provisions of a lower protective value are applied under a certain collective agreement, such application should therefore be deemed invalid. It will probably be less common that the agreement in whole (or features thereof) is ruled invalid. In addition, it should be possible to award damages for breaches of the minimum acceptable protection levels under the EC Directive. In the future, dispensations granted by the National Board of Occupational Safety and Health will also have to be restricted to the framework of the Directive, and supervision as regards statutory working hours must ensure compliance with the minimum acceptable levels of protection under the EC Directive.</p>
<h2>EC Working Time Directive</h2>
<p>The legal basis for the Working Time Directive is Article 118a in the Treaty of Rome. The Directive aims to ensure the safety and health of employees in connection with the organization of working time. The Directive states minimum rules for rest periods and other provisions regarding the organization of working time (including restrictions on working hours per week), night work, shift work and patterns of work). The Directive defines the key concepts, for example working time and rest periods. In addition, there a number of general provisions, including methods of calculating average working time and rest periods, and also cases in which exceptions may be made from the principal rules contained in the Directive, and also the prerequisites for such exceptions. The Directive must be incorporated into the regulatory systems of members states not later than 23 November 1996.</p>
<h2>Swedish Statutory Provisions</h2>
<p>Swedish provisions concerning working time are primarily covered by the Working Hours Act, which stipulates restrictions on the extent of working time, rules for rest periods (e.g. night and weekly rest periods, break periods, meal breaks and pauses), certain provisions of an administrative nature, and provisions for dispensations, supervision, penalties, overtime fees and appeals. The rules contained in the Work Environment Act, the Annual Leave Act, legislation affecting leave of absence from work (e.g. rules for parental leave and leave for purposes of study) and the Act on Security of Employment are also of importance in this connection. Collective agreements also involve extensive regulation of working time issues.</p>
<h2>General Considerations</h2>
<p>In view of the assumption on which we have based our work, we confine our proposals to the bare essentials, that is to say arriving at a legal assessment of the protective value of the provisions contained in the EC Directive and in the Swedish regulatory system, respectively. This involves fully noting and taking into account the provisions contained in the Directive. We have endeavoured to identify the future frameworks which the EC Directive will establish as regards the regulation of working time in Sweden.</p>
<p>When we have completed this aspect of our assignment, we will be able to proceed to our other tasks, that is to say to study the prerequisites for and the consequences of various flexible rules for working time and alternative forms of shorter working time. In this context, we will be returning to virtually all the aspects covered in the EC Directive. Hence, a commitment at this stage to rules which are not the result of a strict legal assessment of the need for EC harmonization would hinder our future work. The amendments which we propose should be regarded as provisional.</p>
<p>The definition of the concept of working time is of crucial importance in most of the provisions of the EC Directive. One important difference between the Directive and the Swedish regulatory system is the method of calculating working time (i.e. what is to be counted as working time and what is to be considered as equivalent to working time). The Directive states that working time constitute all periods in which the employee is working, at the employer's disposal and carrying out his activity or duties. Under the Directive, when computing average working time per week, periods of annual leave or sickness leave for which the employee receives pay may either be counted as work time or excluded from the period on which calculation is based (thus reducing the period).</p>
<p>The concept of working time is not defined in the Working Hours Act, but in practice working time means that the employee is at the employer's disposal at the place of work, carrying out tasks or prepared to work if so required. Under the Swedish system, compensatory leave which the employee receives as compensation for overtime work is equated with working time, and this also applies to all leave to which the employee is entitled under statutes other than the Working Hours Act, Apart from holidays and sickness leave, this also includes parental leave, leave for purposes of study, leave for trade union duties, leave for immigrants to study the Swedish language, etc. In addition, the Working Hours Act also contains provisions regarding emergency and stand-by duty, which are taken into account separately and affect the provisions of the Act as regards rest periods. Moreover, there are restrictions regarding the number of hours allowed for emergency duty. The EC Directive contains no provisions relating to emergency and stand-by duty and, according to the Directive, such phenomena should not be regarded as working time. In the light of the basic assumption we have made we therefore propose that there should be no amendments to the Swedish concept of working time.</p>
<h2>Area of Application</h2>
<p>Work in connection with air, rail, road and waterborne transport, fishing and other work at sea, and work carried out by doctors undergoing training are excluded from the area of application covered by the EC Directive. This also applies to employees who work in their employer's home. Member states may themselves decide the extent to which the Directive's provisions are to apply in certain types of public sector activities such as the police, defence and certain civil defence services. In principle, work in the home and work at a distance are covered by the Directive, but member states are allowed to make exceptions to the rules regarding periods of rest and restrictions on weekly hours and the duration of night work for certain categories of employees (i.e. employees whose working time is not measured, is not determined in advance or is decided by employees themselves).</p>
<p>The Working Hours Act has identical areas of application for the most part, but it does not permit all the exemptions covered by the EC Directive. There is also other relevant legislation which covers virtually all employees, for example the Work Environment Act and the Annual Leave Act. The Working Hours Act, however, excludes employees who carry out work which cannot be monitored (e.g. employees who work in their own homes), employees in executive or comparable positions and employees who determine their working time themselves. As already mentioned, all these employee categories are covered by the EC Directive, but member states are allowed to make exceptions regarding many of the Directive's main provisions.</p>
<p>Work in the home and at a location remote from the workplace is on the increase. We want to study this area more closely before presenting proposals as regards working hours. This question is also being discussed and studied at the international level, for example in the EU. In view of the assumptions we have made regarding our task, we consider that the exception in the Working Hours Act, also for this reason, can be left intact, in view of the rules regarding derogations in the EC Directive. The prerequisites for an exception of this kind – that the employees concerned must be covered by general protective provisions – are fulfilled since they are covered by the Work Environment Act, which contains provisions of this nature. In addition, the Directive's provisions regarding holidays for such employees are covered by the Annual Leave Act. The provisions regarding night work (apart from the duration of night work), shift work and patterns of work largely correspond to provisions in the Work Environment Act which also covers such employees. We propose that reference be made in the Working Hours Act to the Work Environment Act in order to clarify the relationship between working time issues and the general protective provisions embodied in the Work Environment Act.</p>
<h2>Daily Rest</h2>
<p>The EC Directive states that all employees must have 11 consecutive hours of free time per 24 hour period. However, there is no indication of at what point this free time is to be arranged. In the case of a period covering two calendar days, for example, if the daily rest period occurred in the first 11 hours of the first day and in the final 11 hours of the second day, the employee would work for 26 hours without a rest period. Member states are allowed to make derogations from the daily rest period rule for several types of employees and situations.</p>
<p>There is no express provision regarding daily rest in the Working Hours Act. Instead, the Act prescribes that all employees must have free time for rest at night in the period 24.00 – 05.00 hours. In practice and in accordance with the preamble to the Act, these five hours should not be considered to constitute sufficient daily rest, even on a temporary basis. Employees are to have the period of rest they require. Under the Work Environment Act, assessment of the rest period needed must be based on the prerequisites of the individual employee. The Swedish working time concept differs from that embodied in the EC Directive and, under Swedish law, statutory provisions regarding working time, emergency duty and stand-by duty are relevant factors when assessing employee leave and free time.</p>
<p>We consider that an overall assessment of the protective value of the EC Directive's rules about daily rest periods and the relevant Swedish statutory provisions indicates that the Swedish rules have a rather high protective value. Hence the incorporation of the Directive's provisions for daily rest periods would not give the Working Hours Act greater protective value. In the light of the basic assumptions we have made, we therefore propose that there should be no amendment of the Swedish regulatory system.</p>
<h2>Breaks</h2>
<p>Under the EC Directive, all employees must be entitled to breaks if the working day is in excess of six hours. Derogations from this rule may be made in certain cases.</p>
<p>The Working Hours Act stipulates that employees must have a break after not more than five hours work. The duration, number and timing of breaks must be satisfactory, taking into account the work situation. In certain cases, work breaks may be replaced by meal breaks. The Act also contains a provision concerning pauses.</p>
<p>Comparison between the Directive and the Act indicates that the provisions of the Working Hours Act have a higher protective value. Therefore, we propose that there should be no amendment of the Swedish regulatory system.</p>
<h2>Maximum Weekly Rest Period</h2>
<p>The EC Directive stipulates that all employees must have at least 24 hours of consecutive free time per seven-day period, in addition to 11 hours of daily rest. In certain cases, this free-time period may be reduced to 24 hours. Weekly rest periods may be averaged out over a period of 14 days. Derogations from the provisions for daily rest may be made in certain cases.</p>
<p>The Working Hours Act states that employees must have at least 36 hours of consecutive free time in each seven day period. Exceptions may be made on a temporary basis in certain cases.</p>
<p>We consider that the Swedish regulatory system (the Working Hours Act, the general protective provisions of the Work Environment Act and legislation regulating rest periods and free time) have a higher protective value than the protective element in the Directive. Hence, no amendment of the Swedish regulatory system is proposed as regards provision for weekly rest periods.</p>
<h2>Weekly Working Time</h2>
<p>Under the EC Directive, weekly working time for employees should not exceed an average of 48 hours. The period on which such an average calculation is based may be four months. In certain cases, member states are allowed to employ a period of six months for purposes of calculation. In collective agreements, employer and employee organizations may agree on a period of 12 months. The average calculation periods are not defined as calendar periods. Under certain conditions, member states may choose not to apply the rule concerning restrictions on the working week, providing that each individual employee is entitled to refuse to work more than 48 hours per week per four month period.</p>
<p>The Working Hours Act stipulates that normal working time must not exceed 40 hours per calendar week. In certain cases, these 40 hours may be calculated as an average over a four week period. If there is a special need for an extension of working time, overtime work amounting to 48 hours per four week period is permitted, or 50 hours per calendar month, but not more than 200 hours per calendar year. The National Board of Occupational Safety and Health may grant dispensation for a further 150 hours per calendar year. Emergency overtime may be worked in special cases, and in this case there is no upper limit. However, if overtime is worked under the provisions of the Act, this is subject to supervision by a public authority.</p>
<p>The provisions of the Working Hours Act mean a greater degree of restrictiveness as regards potential working time in the case of a period in excess of four months. In the case of a period of one month, the Act also restricts maximum working time more than the Directive, since the Act also includes a monthly restriction.</p>
<p>In comparing working time over a four month period, it may be noted that the Working Hours Act allows for more hours to be worked. This conclusion calls for closer analysis, however. As we have already noted, the Swedish regulatory system equates all forms of leave to which the employee is entitled with working time (i.e. an employee is considered to have been working if, for example, he or she has been granted leave of absence in order to study). In addition, if an agreement results in a figure for normal working time which is lower than 40 hours per week, overtime is to be interpreted as working time in excess of this figure. If normal working time is less than the 40 hours per week stipulated by law, the result will be that the total number of working hours permissible will also be lower. Under the Working Hours Act, working time is calculated on the basis of calendar periods, which means that such periods are predetermined. Under the Directive, rolling calculation periods may be employed.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the Annual Leave Act entitles employees to greater free time than the EC Directive's provisions for holiday leave. In addition, under the Annual Leave Act, sickness in the course of a holiday period entitles the employee to postpone his or her holiday leave.</p>
<p>We consider that an overall assessment of the Swedish regulatory system (primarily the Working Hours Act, legislation concerning free time and leave, the Annual Leave Act and the Work Environment Act) indicates that it offers employees a greater measure of protection than the Directive. As a result, it is not proposed that the Swedish system should be amended.</p>
<h2>Annual Leave</h2>
<p>Under the EC Directive, all employees should receive an annual paid leave period of four weeks. Detailed provisions regarding holiday entitlement and the granting of holidays may be determined at the national level. The Swedish Annual Leave Act stipulates that all employees are entitled to 25 days of holiday per year and contains provisions concerning requirements regarding entitlement to holidays and holiday pay. We consider that there is no call to amend the Swedish system of rules in the light of the EC Directive.</p>
<h2>Length of Night Work</h2>
<p>The EC Directive contains two provisions regarding restrictions on night work. The first rule stipulates that night work must not, on average, exceed eight hours in each 24 hour period. Under the second rule, night work which involves special risks or considerable physical or mental strain must not exceed eight hours in the 24 hour period in which night work is carried out – in other words calculation of average working time is not permitted in this case.</p>
<p>Under the Directive, member states may determine an appropriate period for calculating average working time under the first rule. This period may not include the weekly rest period of 24 hours, which means that the average figure of eight hours may be calculated on the basis of 48 hours per week (six days of eight hours). In addition, in certain cases member states may make derogations as regards both rules (i.e. regarding both the duration of the shift and the prohibition of computation on an average basis).</p>
<p>The Working Hours Act is based on the assumption that night work is prohibited and that the period 24.00 – 05.00 hours is to form part of the nightly rest period. Exceptions to the prohibition on night work may occur in certain cases. Night work under the Working Hours Act is subject to supervision and monitoring by public authorities.</p>
<p>In making an overall assessment, the provisions under the Swedish regulatory system (primarily the prohibition of night work under the Working Hours Act, the Work Environment Act, the provisions regarding supervision and monitoring and legislation concerning free time) must be considered to offer a degree of protection which is at least as high as that provided by the two rules in the Directive regarding restrictions on night work. As a result, we do not propose any amendment of the Swedish regulatory system.</p>
<h2>Health Assessment and the Transfer of Night Workers to Daytime Work</h2>
<p>Under the EC Directive, personnel who work at night must be entitled to free health assessments prior to commencing employment, and are also subsequently entitled to regular assessments. If a person who works at night experiences health problems which might be considered to be the result of night work, he or she must have the option of transfer to daytime work.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 of the Work Environment Act contains provisions regarding the delegation of authority. One such provision covers the issuing of regulations by the Government or a public authority regarding the obligation to institute medical examinations in the case of certain types of hazardous occupations. In view of this provision we consider that the Government should assign the National Board of Occupational Safety and Health to issue regulations concerning medical examinations in connection with night work.</p>
<p>As regards the right to transfer to other work, we note that Chapter 3 of the Work Environment Act stipulates that, amongst other things, an employer must take all measures necessary to avoid ill-health in the work place. In the last resort, this involves a liability to transfer an employee to other work. In addition there is also the principle embodied in the Act on Security of Employment under which there are no objective grounds for dismissal if the employer can reasonably offer alternative employment. In combination, these provisions probably mean that rights corresponding to those embodied in the EC Directive already exist under Swedish law. We therefore propose that there should be no amendment of the Swedish regulatory system in the light of the Directive's provisions regarding transfer to alternative employment.</p>
<h2>Guarantees for Night-Time Work</h2>
<p>The EC Directive stipulates that member states may institute special rules to protect certain categories of employee. We consider that there are no grounds for proposing any amendment of the Swedish regulatory system.</p>
<h2>Notification of Regular Use of Night Workers</h2>
<p>An employer who employs personnel who work at night on a regular basis must notify this to the appropriate authorities if so required. This provision corresponds to the provision under the Swedish Working Hours Act regarding an employer's liability to supply information. Hence we propose that no amendment of the Swedish regulatory system is called for.</p>
<h2>Safety and Health Protection</h2>
<p>Under the EC Directive, employees who work shifts and at night must receive protection in keeping with the nature of their work. Protective facilities must be available at all times of the working day. These provisions correspond to Chapters 2 and 3 of the Swedish Work Environment Act and therefore we do not consider that there are grounds for proposing amendment of the Swedish regulatory system.</p>
<h2>Patterns of Work</h2>
<p>Under the EC Directive, employers are to observe the principle that work should be adapted to the employee. This provision corresponds to the general provisions regarding protection embodied in Chapters 2 and 3 of the Work Environment Act. Hence, there is no call for any proposal as regards amendment of the Swedish regulatory system.</p>
<h2>Employer and Employee Organizations</h2>
<p>We have noted that, in principle, the EC Directive does not call for any proposal for amendment as regards statutory working hours. Collective agreements, however, may take precedence over the provisions of the Working Hours Act. The optional nature of the</p>
<p>Working Hours Act means that this legislation does not establish limits which differ from those resulting from the general protective provisions of the Work Environment Act regarding what employer and employee organizations may determine in collective agreements. However, the EC Directive does mean that certain limits must be observed in the future. This must be made clear in the Working Hours Act and therefore reference should be made to the EC Directive in the Act.</p>
<p>Thus, employer and employee organizations should continue to be free to draw up agreements regarding working time issues, but they should do so on the basis of the framework of the EC Directive. In this connection, they must judge whether the terms on which they agree offer a protective value which at least corresponds with the provisions under the Directive.</p>
<h2>Supervision and Dispensation</h2>
<p>If a collective agreement cannot be concluded regarding deviation from the Working Hours Act, the National Board of Occupational Safety and Health may grant dispensation in certain cases. Exemption from a number of provisions under the Act can be granted in this way as regards rest periods and hours of work. In the future, the National Board of Occupational Safety and Health must observe the framework established by the Directive when it grants dispensations.</p>
<p>If a collective agreement has replaced the provisions of the Working Hours Act concerning hours of work, supervision by a public authority (of compliance with the Act) will not be required. As regards aspects of working time which are not covered by collective agreements, in the future supervision will also involve ensuring compliance with the Directive's minimum acceptable levels of protection.</p>
<h2>Sanctions, etc.</h2>
<p>As noted above, if a collective agreement covering working time is signed, official supervision is not required in this area. This also means that statutory sanctions do not apply. Since we propose that the Working Hours Act should be supplemented by a provision stating that collective agreements must adhere to the framework of the EC Directive, a provision regarding sanctions should be instituted to ensure compliance with the EC Directive.</p>
<p>We propose, on the one hand, that a provision should be introduced which denotes that agreements, or features thereof, are invalid if they imply provisions of a lower protective value for employees than those resulting from the EC Directive. However, a ruling that the application of a collective agreement in a specific case is invalid is probably more common. On the other hand, it should be possible to award damages for breaches of the minimum acceptable levels of protection under the EC Directive.</p>
<h2>Consequences of Our Proposals</h2>
<p>We consider that the consequences of our proposals are very limited. The intention underlying our endeavours in this interim report has been to keep the amendments required to a minimum. This means that our proposals should not affect equality of opportunity between women and men, regional policy or national expenditure.</p>
<p>In the course of our future tasks, we will be returning to the consequences of various proposals for working hours, with regard to productivity, employment, equality, etc.</p>
