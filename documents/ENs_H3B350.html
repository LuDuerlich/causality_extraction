<p>divided by gender. In 2013, about 70 per cent of business owners were men, and to a large extent, women and men run businesses in different branches and professions. Almost 80 per cent of municipal and county council employees are women. The State has an equal gender distribution, but in the private sector, 39 per cent of the employees are women, while 61 per cent are men. However, it is important to remember that more than half of all employed women, 53 per cent, work within the private sector. 82 per cent of all employed men work within the private sector.</p>
<p>An important factor in explaining gender segregation between sectors and professions is Swedish women's high employment rate. A large part of care work, which in many other countries is carried out by women as unpaid labour, is conducted as paid labour within the Swedish labour market, albeit, still by women. This is essentially beneficial, both for the individual and for society. Through paid employment, women improve their self-sufficiency, their power and ability to shape society and their own lives.</p>
<p>Another explanation behind our gender segregated working life is that young women and men largely choose different subjects to study at upper-secondary school and university. In short, education can be divided into three separate spheres: one that is clearly dominated by females, one that is clearly dominated by males, and one that is more or less gender-balanced. The latter largely comprises subjects that have the highest status at upper-secondary school and at university. Parents' educational background has a great influence on the education a young person chooses. Young women and men whose parents are highly educated tend, to a greater extent, to choose gender-balanced subjects at uppersecondary school and university.</p>
<p>Paid and unpaid work</p>
<p>Women and men work, on average, the same number of hours per day; however, men spend more time undertaking paid work and women spend more time undertaking unpaid work. 30 per cent of all women and 11 per cent of all men work part-time. Fewer hours of work imply a lower income. Furthermore, part-time work affects both salary development and career options over time. A</p>
<p>lower income also affects the compensation the employee receives on sick leave, on parental leave, and upon retirement.</p>
<p>The most common reason for working part-time, for both men and women, is that there is no appropriate full-time work. For women, the second most common reason for working part-time is caring for children; for men, the second most common reason for part-time work is studying. Part-time employment increases for women after they have had children. However, when men become parents it does not affect part-time work in the slightest.</p>
<p>The pattern that leads most women to take more responsibility for the home and for their children, and to work part-time to a larger extent than men, is mainly established during maternity leave. Women take parental leave to a greater extent than men. In addition, women stay at home when their children are sick to a greater extent than men. Women take 75 per cent of all paid parental leave and 65 per cent of all temporary parental leave to care for sick children (vab). Furthermore, women take more unpaid parental leave than men. Men usually take between 0 and 20 days of paid parental leave before the child has turned two years old. 25 per cent of men do not take any parental leave at all during the first two years of the child's life. The number of parents who share parental leave equally has increased in recent years, but it still amounts to only 13 per cent.</p>
<p>In addition to more women than men being employed parttime, women also have more temporary employment than men. This means that women, to a greater extent than men, have to handle the demands of the modern labour market with respect to accessibility and, for instance, flexible working hours, alongside family life, which can be hard to plan at times.</p>
<p>Working environment</p>
<p>The fact that women and men largely work in different sectors and have different professions also means that they have different working environments. There are differences in both the physical and psychosocial working environment in femaleand maledominated professions, but there are also differences for women and men working within the same profession. Despite women</p>
<p>having more part-time work than men, they are more often affected by work-related physical and psychosocial problems. However, more men suffer more serious work-related injuries and deaths at work. At the same time, however, recent research shows that women and men who actually perform the same tasks at the same workplace suffer from work-related issues to the same extent. The fact that more women than men report such issues can thus be largely explained by the fact that Swedish working life is segregated.</p>
<p>In general, the working environment is better in genderintegrated professions than it is in gender-segregated professions. This is probably partly due to the high qualification requirements in many gender-integrated professions, and that they imply better conditions in general; but it could also be because the psychosocial working environment of professions that are clearly gendersegregated also are likely to be less accepting of women and men who deviate from the gender norms.</p>
<p>Furthermore, women take sick leave to a greater extent than men. Sick leave can depend on a number of different factors that may or may not be related to working life. If one considers that women both experience more physical problems and problems resulting from stress and mental strains at work, and the fact that it is they who are responsible for the lion's share of the housework, including looking after children and relatives, then the differences in the absenteeism rates for women and men can be seen as a kind of indicator that there is a lack of equality, both in working life and in society in general.</p>
<p>Salary, income, and career</p>
<p>Compensation for work is related to time spent at work. On average, women are paid 13.4 per cent less than men. After standard weighting, which basically involves comparing people who are of the same age, have the same level of education, and work in the same sector and profession, there is still a gender wage gap of 5.8 percent. The gap is calculated using full-time salaries. If parttime work is taken into account, the gender pay gap is, instead, 25 per cent.</p>
<p>The most important explanation with regard to the wage gap between women and men is that they often work in different professions. Yet women often make less money than men, despite having the same profession. With a few exceptions, the salaries in female-dominated professions are on average lower than salaries in male-dominated professions. This is partly due to the supply and demand of labour, and to differences between salaries in the private and the public sectors; however, it can also be seen as an expression of value discrimination. Using a calculation, in which femaledominated professions in the public sector are compared to maledominated professions in the private sector, with regards to a range of criteria normally used for setting salaries, the structural wage gap is estimated to be around SEK 65 billion per year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in many female-dominated professions the wage gap between the lowest paid person and the highest paid person is relatively small. This compressed wage structure means that it is difficult for employees within these professions to affect their salaries. There is no financial reward for professional development, for broadening of expertise or for taking on managerial tasks.</p>
<p>The compressed wage structure can also be viewed as a consequence of the lack of career paths in female-dominated professions. For instance, the number of employees per manager is sometimes high within public, female-dominated organisations; one manager per 30 employees is common. In general, there are more male than female managers. Out of 4.1 million employees, half of which are women and half are men, only a third of managers are women. The proportion of men who are managers is higher than the proportion of men who are employed in the public sector. Leading positions in the business sector are even more imbalanced. A quarter of all listed companies' board members are women, but only five percent of the CEOs. 95 per cent of listed companies' managing directors are men.</p>
<p>Gender Equality Reform work</p>
<p>Three common methods for promoting gender equality in working life are mapping, education, and recruitment. What these methods have in common is that, if they are to be successful, they must</p>
<p>focus on both women and men, and on both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of gender equality. It is not enough to attempt to even out the numerical gender imbalance in a profession or workplace. The social and organisational working environment must also ensure that persons who belong to a minority group of some sort feel comfortable and want to stay. Knowledge about how stereotypical conceptions of femininity and masculinity affect women and men within organisations – i.e. how gender is done – is therefore necessary. Employers, but also internship supervisors, mentors and teachers, have a major responsibility in combating prejudice, harassment and discrimination, and in the provision of inclusive work environments. It is therefore important that they have the necessary knowledge to be able to fulfil this task.</p>
<p>Successful reform work must also take into consideration that women and men face different obstacles and challenges throughout their working lives. Consciously or unconsciously, power and privileges are unequally distributed in the workplace, both between and within the genders, and along lines other than gender. In order for gender equality work to be successful, gender awareness must therefore also take factors such as class, ethnicity, religion, sexuality and functionality into account, and understand how these factors interact with gender in the workplace.</p>
<p>The Delegation's considerations and proposals</p>
<p>A general conclusion that can be drawn from the work of the Delegation is that there is no lack of knowledge regarding gender equality in the workplace, nor of good examples of how it can be improved. However, both political initiatives and efforts of other stakeholders largely lack coordination, control and continuity. In order to improve equality in the work place, this needs to be addressed. The government also needs to be clearer in its use of the instruments available to promote gender equality.</p>
<p>The Delegation has identified two areas that are especially important in the workplace: the time spent at work, and the compensation for work. These areas are partly inter-related. A prerequisite for more women being able to, and wanting to engage in more paid work, thus increasing their incomes and salaries, is to</p>
<p>offer them full-time work with working conditions good enough for full-time work in practice. The social partners have an important role to play here. Another prerequisite for women to take on more paid work is that the responsibility for the home and the children has to be more equally shared between women and men.</p>
<p>However, encouraging women to engage in more paid work only solves a part of the problem with regard to the gender pay gap. Reducing the structural gender wage gap within the framework of the Swedish labour market model is a major challenge for the social partners.</p>
<p>The Delegation's assignment has been extensive. Efforts to develop proposals that promote gender equality in working life have therefore been focused on four areas: a) absence from work during parental leave, b) work conditions, c) salaries and incomes, and d) governance and gender equality policy. The Delegation's proposals on these areas are briefly presented below. The full proposals can be found in chapter 11.</p>
<p>Work and family</p>
<p>The Delegation proposes that:</p>
<p>– Divide the parental benefit into three. Increase the number of days with pay to 420 days: 210 for each parent. 150 of these days are reserved for each parent. The remaining 60 days can be transferred to the other parent. Out of these 60 days, 30 days can be transferred to another person.</p>
<p>– Five years after the introduction of this new  three-way division, the reform should be evaluated. Depending on the outcome, an increase or reduction in the number of days transferable to another person, or  a complete individualisation of parental leave, should be considered.</p>
<p>– The Parental Leave Act should be amended, so that each parent is given the right to reduce their regular working hours by 12.5 per cent.</p>
<p>Work conditions</p>
<p>The Delegation proposes that:</p>
<p>– The social partners should initiate discussions regarding working time, with a special focus on the right to  full-time work and involuntary part-time.</p>
<p>– The social partners should attempt to ensure that the persons in charge of occupational health and safety at each workplace have sufficient knowledge of gender equality within working life in order to carry out their job in a satisfactory manner.</p>
<p>– The social partners should attempt to ensure that internship supervisors and mentors in the workplace have sufficient knowledge of gender equality and diversity in order to prevent harassment and discrimination, and so that they can provide support to students and new employees at the workplace.</p>
<p>Salaries and incomes</p>
<p>The Delegation proposes that:</p>
<p>– The Swedish Annual Accounts Act is amended in order to highlight the gender distribution among managers. The same requirements in respect of information regarding gender distribution in annual accounts are to apply, regardless of the organisational form.</p>
<p>– The action plans regarding salaries and employment conditions that are stipulated by the Discrimination Act should be updated prior to wage negotiations. Employers should undertake an annual analysis of the wage gap between women and men.</p>
<p>– The Swedish National Mediation Office and the social partners should review and develop the collection of genderbased data for the official statistics of salaries and wages.</p>
<p>– The social partners should initiate work to create more career options within female-dominated professions, where there currently are few.</p>
<p>Governance and gender equality policy</p>
<p>The Delegation proposes that:</p>
<p>– The government must strengthen its governance to ensure that authorities and agencies are working with gender equality both internally and externally. Government agencies must report annually on the ways in which they have contributed towards achieving gender equality goals.</p>
<p>– The Swedish Work Environment Authority should develop its directives, inspections and sanctions to ensure that they are enforced equally within femaleand  male-dominated professions. All health and safety work must be conducted with a gender perspective.</p>
<p>– All Swedish educational authorities should ensure that teachers, mentors and internship supervisors have sufficient knowledge of gender equality to be able to support students who want to make, or those who have already made, transgender choices.</p>
<p>– Vocational and career guidance officers should provide information about different professions and the labour market with a gender perspective.</p>
<p>– The Swedish Public Employment Service should develop the ways in which it works to promote gender equality in the workplace.</p>
<p>– The authority responsible for public procurement should offer method support so that attention can be paid to matters of equality within procurement processes.</p>
<p>– A special organisation should be given a permanent responsibility for monitoring the areas of gender equality and gender policy.</p>
<p>– The government should initiate a study that aims to increase knowledge concerning  foreign-born women with weak labour market status. The study should result in a proposal of a detailed design for a national initiative to increase this group's participation in the labour market.</p>
