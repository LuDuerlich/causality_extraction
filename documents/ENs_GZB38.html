<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In September 2009 the Swedish Government gave me the remit (ToR 2009:84, ToR 2010:27) to conduct an inquiry into the future design of upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities in Sweden , which must be adaptable to the individual within the framework of the various study courses. One of the starting-points of the inquiry had to be the reformed upper secondary school education system due to be introduced in the autumn of 2011. Furthermore, the inquiry was to examine: the possibility of enhancing a student’s right to study at another municipality’s or independent upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities; certain issues connected to education programmes that recruit nationally; rules on selection and admissions to upper secondary schools for pupils with learning disabilities; and issues regarding subsidies to independent upper secondary schools for pupils with learning disabilities. The inquiry should also examine the consequences of the proposal for education for adults with learning disabilities at upper secondary level and analyse the need for greater diversification in this form of education. This English summary outlines the proposals I hereby submit to the Swedish Government regarding the future design of upper secondary education with pupils with learning disabilities in Sweden.</p>
<p>The inquiry has attempted to work as transparently as possible. In addition to the expert group, several reference groups and other groups have therefore been linked to the inquiry, including a group of researchers. Furthermore, the inquiry has performed a large number of study visits, held a public hearing and participated in external seminars and conferences.</p>
<h2>Background (Chapter 2)</h2>
<p>Learning disabilities slow down personal development, diminish intellectual ability and impair adaptive functioning. Adaptive functioning is the relative ability of a person to effectively adapt to the surroundings and cope with everyday life, e.g. taking care of a home and managing money. People with learning disabilities perceive and understand the world around in a more concrete way than others. They often find it difficult to use and interpret abstract symbols such as numbers and letters and to plan, control and evaluate the way they act in different situations. The significance of these impairments depends to a large extent on the environment in which they find themselves.</p>
<p>Attitudes to children, young people and adults with learning disabilities have varied over time. The trend has gone from the optimistic and compassionate attitude of the 19th century to one of fearful discrimination in the early 20th century and then gradually towards greater openness for everyone’s right to equal education and participation in society.</p>
<p>Today, society’s ambition of ensuring the participation of all citizens and inclusive education for people with disabilities is stipulated in various international declarations and treaties and in national policy documents. The Swedish Education Act (2010:800) makes it clear for example that everyone shall have equal access to education, unless prescribed otherwise in special provisions. Education shall furthermore be equal in every form of schooling regardless of where in the country it is provided.</p>
<h2>Current upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities (Chapter 3)</h2>
<p>The current upper secondary education system for pupils with learning disabilities shall provide them with an education that is tailored to each individual’s prerequisites and shall, as far as possible, be the same as the education provided in upper secondary school. The Swedish national curriculum (Lpf 94) states that upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities shall prepare them for a meaningful adult life at work, at home and in leisure time. It consists of eight national programmes, specially designed programmes and individual programmes.</p>
<p>The proportion of any given cohort attending upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities has increased dramatically since the beginning of the 1990s, from approximately 0.9 percent in the 1992/93 academic year to about 1.8 percent in 2009/10. This increase in students is greater than in compulsory education for pupils with learning disabilities. The high proportion is however already established during the latter years of compulsory-level education. In other words, the decision to transfer to education for pupils with learning disabilities is often taken before the student starts upper secondary school. There is considerable variation among Swedish municipalities as regards both the proportion of young people registered in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities and how this has developed over time.</p>
<p>There is no single explanation for the large increase in the proportion of students in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities. The current goal-setting and grading system identifies students who are having difficulty keeping up with their school-work, which becomes more abstract and theoretical the older the students get. Changes in attitudes to knowledge and how it is disseminated, with more process orientation, self-study and self-planning, may also play a part. Another reason may be the deterioration in the social situation for school students as they get older. The general increase in the percentage of students in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities may also have to do with the responsibility for it having been transferred from the county councils to the municipalities, a change fully implemented in 1996, and an economic downturn during the 1990s which led to schools in general not receiving adequate resources. The fact that it has also become more common to examine and diagnose students may also be significant, since an examination can provide an objective basis for placing the student in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities. Finally, it is difficult to examine students newly arrived from outside Sweden, which implies some uncertainty in how significant the increased proportion of students with foreign backgrounds is for the trend in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities.</p>
<p>Employment is considerably lower among 20-30 year-olds with general learning difficulties than among other young people. It is difficult to find reliable data on how students from upper secondary schools for pupils with learning disabilities get on later in life. According to the Swedish Voluntary Association of School Career Guidance Officers in Schools for Pupils with Learning Disabilities and Special Schools, the percentage of employees among students who have graduated from national programmes or equivalent education programmes at upper secondary schools for pupils with learning disabilities fell dramatically from the end of the 1970s to 2006; without special support measures, only a small percentage of them now have employment. Swedish Public Employment Service statistics from 1998 and onwards on the proportion of young jobseekers who have found work indicate that the trend is not unique for young people with general learning difficulties. On the other hand, the proportion in employment is considerably less for these people than for other young people. Furthermore, the difference between the groups increases when times are prosperous.</p>
<p>Challenges for the future</p>
<p>The lessons learned from current upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities highlight the challenges facing the future system. It shall equip students for a meaningful adult life at work, at home and in leisure time and in my opinion also lay the foundations for further learning. The knowledge and skills acquired at upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities must give the students a better chance of finding work. The education shall also facilitate the students’ transition into adulthood and aid their personal development. The demands on the students must be realistic yet also challenging to give them an idea of their own potential and limitations.</p>
<p>Prioritising and challenging the students’ knowledge development must be a clear starting-point for upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities. For this to be possible, the teachers need proficient subject knowledge combined with skills in teaching pupils with learning disabilities. Such a teacher’s authorisation should be linked to an undergraduate programme at the right level for this form of education.</p>
<p>The functional integration of premises is a necessary but far from sufficient prerequisite in order to achieve more inclusive education for students with learning disabilities. Furthermore, a management organisation is needed that can facilitate inclusive education in which real meetings between students take place in the education context. For this to be possible, greater collaboration between upper secondary schools and upper secondary schools for pupils with learning disabilities is required.</p>
<p>So as not to create the wrong expectations among students and parents, upper secondary schools for pupils with learning disabilities must make it clear that they offer an education aimed at students with learning disabilities and what this education can lead to.</p>
<p>Greater flexibility between upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities and upper secondary education is one of the ambitions behind the inquiry’s proposals. However, greater flexibility within the upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities system itself is equally important so that all students are given the chance to achieve as much as possible in their studies. My ambition is also that my proposals will help bring greater clarity to the students’ educational goals and make it easier to monitor their progress towards them.</p>
<h2>The aim of future upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities (Section 4.1)</h2>
<p>The provisions on the aim of education currently differ between upper secondary education and upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities. The provisions governing the latter state that the education shall be tailored to each individual student’s prerequisites and shall correspond to the education provided in upper secondary education as far as possible. It is perfectly clear that the aim of upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities and of upper secondary education shall be expressed in terms of what the education shall contribute to, i.e. what the students will derive from it, not how the system shall be designed. Furthermore, the wording used to express the aim of upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities makes no mention of their further studies.</p>
<p>I therefore propose an aim for upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities that is in close concordance with the aim for upper secondary education in general:</p>
<p>Upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities shall give students a tailored education that provides a good basis for working life and further studies, for personal development and for active participation in society. The education shall be designed so that it promotes social interaction and develops the students’ ability to acquire, deepen and apply knowledge both independently and together with others.</p>
<p>Upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities shall in principle build on the knowledge the students have acquired in compulsory education for pupils with learning disabilities or similar form of education.</p>
<p>As a consequence of this, I propose that the aim of compulsory education for pupils with learning disabilities be adapted to the aim of compulsory school in a similar way.</p>
<h2>The future structure of upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities (Section 4.1)</h2>
<p>I propose that upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities shall consist of national programmes and a ‘training programme’ for students who are unable to cope with a national programme. The following nine national programmes are proposed:</p>
<p>• Administration, trade and product management</p>
<p>• Artistic activities</p>
<p>• Property, plant and construction</p>
<p>• Vehicle care and transport</p>
<p>• Handicraft and production</p>
<p>• Hotel, restaurant and bakery</p>
<p>• Health, care and social services</p>
<p>• Civics and languages</p>
<p>• Forest, land and animals</p>
<p>This adapted programme structure is based on my assessment that it is more important to harmonise the educational content with upper secondary education than the form. The number of students in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities is very small compared to upper secondary education, which means that the number of programmes must also be limited. The proposed structure does enable a broader range of educational content to be offered to students with learning disabilities than currently is the case, by making it possible to base a national programme on elements from several different national upper secondary school programmes. It also enables all relevant parts of upper secondary education to be adapted to upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities. The proposal includes both more and less extensive elements from all programmes in the new, reformed upper secondary education system, which gives the students a better chance of choosing an education that suits them.</p>
<p>It should also be a future ambition to ensure that as many students as possible find a suitable vocational programme in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities that can lead to employment after they have completed their studies. Despite this, it is proposed that a civics and languages programme be established. Upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities should also offer choices for students who are interested in civics, have an interest in languages and communication or who need time to decide what they wish to do professionally after leaving school. Youngsters with learning disabilities should not need to do more advanced planning than other young people. Similar to others, they should also, where necessary, be able to supplement their education when they are adults. Through workplace learning, students on this programme should also have the opportunity to test different career options. Students on the programme shall have the opportunity to transfer to one of the vocationally oriented programmes during their studies should they so wish.</p>
<p>I further propose that the national programmes be divided into nationally established specialisations as they are in upper secondary education. This represents a change compared to the current provisions on upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities. Nationally established specialisations help to clarify the content of upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities enabling students to make informed study choices and providing potential employers with more information. A predictable structure also facilitates cooperation between different school governing bodies when planning the range of educational programmes available and between upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities and upper secondary education.</p>
<p>It shall however be possible to provide specially designed alternative programmes, assessed and approved by the Swedish National Agency for Education. The proposed national programmes shall however offer such a high degree of flexibility to render the need for specially designed alternative programmes less necessary. The Swedish National Agency for Education shall also assure the quality and decide on locally initiated courses.</p>
<p>It is also proposed that the structure of the national programmes also be harmonised with the structure of the national programmes in the new upper secondary education system. There are to be common subjects for all the national programmes in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities, i.e. Swedish or Swedish as a second language; English; Mathematics; Sport and health; Arts; History; Civics; Religion; and Nature and the environment. Furthermore, there shall be both common subjects for each programme that give it its character and subjects common to each specialisation within the programme. In addition, it shall be possible to do more in-depth or broader programme studies and to study an individual choice. An upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities project is also proposed as an element of the national programmes.</p>
<p>The proposal for new upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities offers a substantially greater range of specialisations and in-depth studies than previously, giving students more options to choose based on interest and aptitude. About thirty of the sixty upper secondary school specialisations shall be adapted under the proposal. There may still be a need for a student to be able to read courses at upper secondary school. The formal conditions for such cooperation between the two forms of school are already in place, however. Under the new Swedish Education Act (2010:800), it will be possible for a student at an upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities to read all types of courses at upper secondary school.</p>
<p>It is essential that the future programme structure for upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities does not discourage inclusive teaching models, where for example a group of students registered at an upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities attend a class at upper secondary school. In my opinion, however, the fact that the programme structures of the two forms of education are different does not constitute a problem since the concordance between them at the specialisation level provides plenty of scope for the establishment of inclusive models.</p>
<p>It is proposed that a ‘training programme’ be established for students who are unable to cope with a national programme. This programme, which would replace today’s individual programmes, should still encourage the student to transfer to a national programme at a later date. A student who has completed a year on the training programme shall thus have the option of reading four years on a national programme.</p>
<p>However, the current division within the individual programme into vocational training and activity training shall be removed. This is because the dividing-line between vocational training and activity training is in many cases difficult to distinguish and because vocational training has been shown to vary considerably in nature from one school to the next. The concepts of vocational and activity training are also considered to lack relevance. Vocational training does not prepare the student for future professional life and is therefore seen as a form of false marketing. What kind of “activity” activity training is aimed at is very unclear. It is also proposed that the wording on ‘meeting the student’s special educational needs’ be omitted. The new upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities system shall be so flexible and provide so much scope for individual tailoring of the education to render provisions unnecessary.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, the training programme at schools for pupils with learning disabilities shall consist of the following subject areas: Arts; Domestic and consumer science; Sport and health; Nature and the environment; Civics; and Language and communication. The subject areas shall follow on from the ‘training school’ syllabuses used in compulsory schools for pupils with learning disabilities.</p>
<p>The variation in the prerequisites of individual students will also be substantial within the training programme. I therefore propose that the knowledge requirements for the subject areas in the training programme shall be on two levels - one level for basic knowledge and one for in-depth knowledge.</p>
<p>Credits and course breakdown</p>
<p>The guaranteed teaching time in upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities shall continue to be 3 600 hours over four years. This shall apply for both national programmes and for the training programme. It shall be possible in certain cases for students on a national programme to take an additional year to complete their studies.</p>
<p>As regards the national programmes, it is proposed that a credits system of 3 000 upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities credits replace the current timetable. The credits system shall specify the extent of the course content in numbers of credits. A subject could consist of several courses, with grades being set after each completed course. A breakdown of the national programmes in upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities into credits and courses will make it easier to meet each student on his or her level and incorporate a clear progression in the education.</p>
<p>The decision to have a total of 3 000 credits is mainly because I feel that it must be made clear that there is no connection between time and goal fulfilment for upper secondary students with learning disabilities. Furthermore, it is unadvisable to use the same number of credits as for upper secondary school, which could easily substantiate the misconception that upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities leads to the same education as upper secondary school. A completely random number of credits is therefore preferable.</p>
<h2>The student’s individual study plan shall make it clear that he or she is following an adapted course programme (Section 4.3)</h2>
<p>The provision on individual study plans in the Swedish Education Act (2010:800) shall be supplemented by a provision stipulating that in the individual study plan, the principal shall decide whether a student shall follow an adapted course programme. For students on a national programme, such a decision could mean that the extent of their education will be limited in relation to a full programme with regard to the number of upper secondary credits and courses.</p>
<p>The future upper secondary education system for pupils with learning disabilities shall be flexible enough to allow a student either to be admitted to the training programme and read courses on a national programme or be admitted to a national programme and read certain subject areas on the training programme. This must be determined on a case-to-case basis and be based on where most of the student’s education takes place. This type of adapted course programme shall also be decided and highlighted in the student’s individual study plan.</p>
<h2>Diploma documentation (Section 4.4)</h2>
<p>In my opinion, it is more important that every student graduating from an upper secondary national programme for pupils with learning disabilities leaves with comprehensive documentation describing his or her education than just some students receiving a special diploma certificate. Such documentation can for example facilitate the transition from school to working life. The documentation is equally important regardless of how much of the education programme the student has completed. It is proposed therefore that such comprehensive documentation be introduced in the form of a ‘diploma document’ for all students attending upper secondary school national programmes for pupils with learning disabilities. Diploma documents shall also be issued to students on the training programme on request. The Swedish National Agency for Education will be given the task to develop guidelines regarding the content and wording of diploma documents.</p>
<p>The diploma document shall stipulate whether the student has fulfilled the objectives for upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities: attaining at least 2 500 out of 3 000 credits; achieved a pass grade for their school project; and achieved passes at Swedish/Swedish as a second language and mathematics on courses equivalent to at least 100 credits in each subject respectively. Upper secondary school grades shall be validated so that it can be assessed whether or not the student has achieved stipulated upper secondary school diploma objectives for pupils with learning disabilities.</p>
<h2>Workplace learning (Section 4.5)</h2>
<p>Concrete working life experience is important for students at upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities. Knowledge and skills must be trained and consolidated in the form of real-life working tasks at the workplace.</p>
<p>Workplace-based education (APU) shall be replaced by at least 22 weeks of workplace learning (APL). It is desirable to implement workplace learning within the programme being studied by the student but it should be possible to do workplace learning within another programme. All students on upper secondary school national programmes for pupils with learning disabilities benefit from working life experience, which is why workplace learning shall be offered on all national programmes, including the arts programme and the civics and languages programme. Workplace learning shall cover not only vocational knowledge but also understanding workplace culture and being part of a work community. It shall also be possible to offer practical experience on the training programme that is to replace the individual programme.</p>
<h2>The right to upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities (Section 5.1)</h2>
<p>It is vital that students accepted onto upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities belong to the target group for this form of schooling. The consequences for students who are recruited on the wrong grounds can be serious and lifelong in that they may not be given sufficient challenges and their chances of going on to study further or accessing the labour market may be restricted. It is proposed therefore that the provisions shall make it clear that the right of a student who has graduated from compulsory school for pupils with learning disabilities to attend an upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities shall apply only on condition that the student belongs to the target group, i.e. has learning disabilities or has a significant and lasting mental disability due to a brain injury, caused by external violence or bodily disease.</p>
<p>Staff in compulsory schools for pupils with learning disabilities and upper secondary schools for pupils with learning disabilities shall also be duty-bound to report signs that a student does not belong to the target group to the principal. In such cases, the principal is obliged to report this to the student’s home municipality which in turn must examine the matter forthwith. Should this examination show that the student does not belong to the target group for school for pupils with learning disabilities, he or she shall be transferred to compulsory school or upper secondary school. The home municipality shall in such cases be obliged to take the measures necessary to facilitate the student’s transfer.</p>
<p>As a consequence of this, it is proposed that the student’s right to complete a commenced upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities within four years shall apply only to students who belong to the target group.</p>
<h2>Applications and selection (Section 5.2)</h2>
<p>In order for students at upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities to be able to benefit from the many different study courses offered by the future system for upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities, they must have the opportunity to choose their preferred programme. I therefore propose that the student shall apply to a national programme in the same way as students applying to upper secondary school do. It shall also be possible to apply to the training programme.</p>
<p>If the number of places on a national programme is fewer than the number of applicants, priority shall be given based on an assessment of the student’s suitability for the programme. The Government or authority appointed by the Government shall be allowed to issue regulations governing selection to national programmes in upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities.</p>
<p>A student who applies to a training programme shall be admitted to such a programme if the home municipality, after consultation with the student and his or her guardian, deems the student incapable of following a national programme. Otherwise, the home municipality shall accept the student onto a national programme and the student shall be given the opportunity to apply to such a programme.</p>
<p>The preparations prior to a student applying to upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities shall start in good time. It is vital that students receive tailored study and career guidance that enables them to form an opinion about the various study courses open to them and that consultation takes place with the student’s guardian.</p>
<h2>Increased student influence when choosing programmes and being accepted onto upper secondary school induction programmes (Sections 5.3 and 5.4)</h2>
<p>Under the new Education Act (2010:800), the home municipality is responsible for offering students from compulsory school for pupils with learning disabilities vocation induction and an individual alternative at upper secondary school if they want to pursue such an education and the municipality deems them to have the necessary prerequisites to do so. The inquiry shall however submit proposals for upper secondary education that are in harmony with the provisions on parent and student influence when choosing school form within the compulsory education system.</p>
<p>A student belonging to the target group for upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities shall hence have the right to be accepted at an upper secondary school if he or she does not wish to attend an upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities. I therefore propose that the wording “and the municipality deems them to have the necessary prerequisites to do so” (i.e. complete the programme) be deleted from the above provision governing the home municipality’s responsibility for offering compulsory special school students vocational induction and an individual alternative at upper secondary school.</p>
<p>At the same time, I propose that it shall be possible to accept students belonging to the target group onto upper secondary language induction programmes. This can be a good option for a student intending to transfer to a vocation induction programme or individual alternative at upper secondary school after completing the language induction programme. Depending on the composition of the tuition groups, upper secondary language induction may also be suitable for students who choose upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities later on.</p>
<h2>The home municipality’s responsibility to provide education (Section 6.1)</h2>
<p>The need for inter-municipality cooperation is just as great in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities as in upper secondary education in general. I therefore propose that the provisions governing the home municipality’s responsibility to provide education shall make it clear that the home municipality may offer education it provides itself or education provided by another municipality or a county council in accordance with cooperation agreements and that municipalities that have entered into a cooperation agreement form an ‘inter-municipal cooperation area’. How such an inter-municipal cooperation area is organised is just as important so that the municipalities will be able to offer as comprehensive a range of programmes in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities as in the upper secondary system in general.</p>
<h2>Acceptance of students to upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities (Section 6.2)</h2>
<p>Students with learning disabilities shall be able to make informed choices of programmes and specialisations in the future upper secondary education system for pupils with learning disabilities, in the same way as students can do so in the upper secondary school system in general. It must therefore be possible for a student applying to an upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities to be accepted at a school in another municipality, e.g. if the programme is not offered in the home municipality or in the intermunicipal area. If there are no extenuating reasons for taking another course of action, this should take place in the same way as it does in the upper secondary school system in general. The student must also have the option of applying to an independent upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities.</p>
<p>I therefore propose that the rules governing acceptance at an upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities run by a public governing body be the same as those governing the upper secondary school system in general. A public governing body shall primarily  accept applicants who belong to the target group for upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities and who live in the municipality or in the inter-municipal area (‘primary applicants’) onto a national programme or onto a national specialisation, specially designed alternative or upper secondary apprenticeship programme starting in the student’s first academic year. In addition, an applicant shall be deemed a primary applicant if he or she has special reasons with regard to his or her personal circumstances, has applied for a nationally recruiting programme or in certain cases has applied for a programme that is not offered by his or her home municipality. Applicants to a national programme, national specialisation, specially designed alternative, upper secondary apprenticeship programme or nationally recruiting upper secondary school programme for pupils with learning disabilities other than those deemed to be primary applicants (‘secondary applicants’) shall be offered any remaining places not filled by primary applicants.</p>
<p>Regarding the training programme, the provisions in the Education Act relating to acceptance will be replaced by provisions stipulating that a principal must accept a student from another municipality on the training programme in his upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities, provided that the home municipality has deemed the student incapable of following a national programme and that the municipalities agree on financial compensation.</p>
<p>Every independent school offering upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities shall continue to be open to all students who have the right to education at a public upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities, i.e. both students on a national programme and those attending the training programme.</p>
<p>It shall be possible to appeal a municipal or county council decision on acceptance of primary applicants to upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities to the Swedish Board of Appeal for Education. It will also be possible to appeal a decision by a private governing body on acceptance to an independent upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities to the Board of Appeal for Education.</p>
<h2>Inter-municipal compensation (Section 6.3)</h2>
<p>Harmonisation of the rules governing acceptance to upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities with those that apply to upper secondary school in general also enables the provisions on inter-municipal compensation to be harmonised. It is desirable that the provisions do not diverge unnecessarily between different forms of schooling, other than in cases where such divergence is justified by the special nature of the form of schooling in question. Divergent rules governing inter-municipal compensation also lead to divergent rules for students attending different forms of schooling.</p>
<p>I therefore propose that a municipality or county council that has accepted a student onto a national programme at upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities who does not live in the municipality or in the inter-municipal area be compensated for its costs for the student’s education by the student’s home municipality. Unless the home municipality and the municipality or county council providing the education can agree otherwise, or unless there are other provisions, the inter-municipal compensation shall correspond to the provider’s prime costs. If the student has been accepted as a secondary applicant, the compensation shall amount to no more than the costs incurred by the home municipality if it were to provide similar education or, if the provider’s costs are lower than the home municipality’s, compensation shall be payable at this lower rate. As regards nationally recruiting programmes or specially designed national programme alternatives, the home municipality shall pay the amount decided in each special case by the Swedish National Agency for Education.</p>
<p>The inter-municipal compensation for a student attending a training programme shall be agreed on between the student’s home municipality and the municipality or county council providing the education in cases where a student is accepted onto a programme in a municipality other than his or her home municipality or in its inter-municipal area or in a county council.</p>
<h2>Compensation to independent schools (Section 6.4)</h2>
<p>The current provisions governing compensation to independent upper secondary schools for pupils with learning disabilities do not take the variation in costs for different programmes into account, which leads to undesirable consequences.</p>
<p>I propose that the compensation for a student accepted onto a programme at an independent upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities shall continue to comprise a basic amount and where necessary a supplementary amount. The basic amount shall primarily be determined in accordance with the same criteria applied by the home municipality when allocating resources to the programme in question or a comparable programme. The Swedish National Agency for Education shall be given the task of establishing which programmes are comparable. The classification can be expected in practice to follow the national price list (see below). Using such a model, it will no longer be possible to determine the basic amount based on programmes that differ considerably in terms of cost from the programme onto which the student has been accepted.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I propose that the national price list, which is to be used to establish the basic amount in cases where the municipality does not run such a programme or a similar one, be differentiated with regard to differences in programme costs for upper secondary schools for pupils with learning disabilities. The background data is however too limited and the differences in basic amounts in many cases too small to justify the establishment of a separate amount for every programme. I propose instead that the Swedish National Agency for Education is given the task to establish a national price list for upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities comprising a limited number of programme categories, roughly three to four categories, in the future upper secondary education system for pupils with learning disabilities.</p>
<h2>Financial terms for the student (Section 6.5)</h2>
<p>Unnecessary differences in the student grants system should be avoided between upper secondary education and upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities. Students at upper secondary schools for pupils with learning disabilities should therefore be included in the general grants system for other upper secondary students. The need for financial support which depends on the student’s disability should be considered separately.</p>
<p>The proposals in the commission report Lack of haste [Brist på brådska]  (SOU 2008:102) should therefore be implemented without delay so that the activity allowance currently available for extended schooling is abolished and extended child support to students in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities is replaced by study support on the same grounds as for young persons without disabilities.</p>
<p>At the same time, I propose that the home municipality disburses an accommodation allowance for students who need it and who have been accepted as primary applicants onto an upper secondary programme for pupils with learning disabilities run by a public governing body. A student accepted at an independent upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities shall be able to apply for supplementary accommodation allowance from CSN (Swedish National Board of Student Aid). Today, a student attending upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities cannot receive accommodation allowance or supplementary accommodation allowance.</p>
<p>As a result of their disability, some students at upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities studying in a different municipality have costs for accommodation and travel to and from their place of study that far exceed the support they receive in the form of accommodation allowance or supplementary accommodation allowance. A student’s disability can also lead to other extra costs in connection with their studies. I therefore propose that possible designs for a supplementary allowance system for young people studying at upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities be examined so that these young people can make educational choices on the same terms as other upper secondary school students. Such a system should however be designed not just for students with learning disabilities but for also for other students with disabilities.</p>
<h2>Nationally recruiting upper secondary school programmes (Section 7.1)</h2>
<p>In what must be an oversight, there are no provisions governing nationally recruiting upper secondary school programmes for pupils with learning disabilities as there are for upper secondary schools in general. A student in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities who has the necessary prerequisites and interest shall, in my opinion, have equal possibilities as students in upper secondary education to study a nationally recruiting programme. Disabled sports are nowadays very well established. Athletes with learning disabilities will be competing at the London Paralympic Games in 2012. It is therefore difficult to justify the absence of a national sports programme for elite para-athletes at upper secondary school level.</p>
<p>I propose that nationally recruiting programmes be introduced for upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities along the same lines as those for upper secondary education in general, e.g. vocationally oriented programmes, arts-oriented programmes and sports programmes. The nationally recruiting programmes shall be allowed to deviate from what normally applies for national programmes in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities as regards structure, content and educational goals. Independent upper secondary schools for pupils with learning disabilities shall also be considered as organisers of nationally recruiting programmes. The National Agency for Education shall determine the size of the compensation.</p>
<p>Decisions on national recruitment for national recruiting vocational and arts-oriented education programmes could be taken by the Swedish National Agency for Education for national programmes, national specialisations, specially designed alternatives and upper secondary apprenticeship programmes at upper secondary schools for pupils with learning disabilities if the programmes can only be set up at a limited number of locations in the country, or if the knowledge and skills needs of individual students cannot otherwise be met. The requirements for a decision to establish such nationally recruiting programmes are that the programme is of good quality, the costs are reasonable in relation to both the aim of the programme and the costs for other upper secondary school programmes for pupils with learning disabilities and that the selection criteria are fulfilled. The provisions shall otherwise be approximately the same as those that apply to upper secondary education in general.</p>
<p>Nationally recruiting sports programmes shall be available on national programmes and on the training programme. The provisions governing nationally recruiting sports programmes in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities shall otherwise be virtually the same as those governing upper secondary education in general. It shall also be possible to run nationally approved sports programmes within upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities focusing on special sports. The syllabuses for special sports in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities shall make it clear that the subject can only be applied on nationally recruiting and nationally approved sports programmes.</p>
<h2>Nationally recruiting upper secondary special school programmes for students with learning disabilities in combination with other disabilities (Section 7.2)</h2>
<p>The issue of the schooling of young people with learning disabilities combined with visual impairment and other disabilities has been examined before. The commission report Greater equality for students with disabilities [Ökad likvärdighet för elever med funktionshinder]  (SOU 2007:87) proposed that the students of Ekeskolan (one of Sweden’s primary residential special schools for pupils with visual impairment in combination with other disabilities) could be offered three different options once their obligation to attend school ceased to apply: a) continue studying at an upper secondary school or at an upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities in their home municipality, b) study at an upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities in Örebro municipality (where Ekeskolan is situated) by agreement between the Swedish state and Örebro municipality, or c) continue studying at Ekeskolan. The option of extending their schooling at Ekeskolan was later reintroduced following a decision by the Swedish Riksdag. The proposal for a nationally recruiting programme for the target group in Örebro was put on hold and is now a matter for this inquiry.</p>
<p>I propose that through an agreement between the Swedish state and Örebro municipality a nationally recruiting upper secondary school programme for pupils with learning disabilities shall be established at Örebro municipality’s upper secondary school for students with learning disabilities in combination with visual impairment and other disabilities. I also propose that the option of extended schooling at Ekeskolan shall be limited to a maximum of two years, i.e. the same restriction that otherwise applies in the compulsory school system. This will make it possible for all students who have completed their education at Ekeskolan to apply to a programme in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities.</p>
<p>I also propose that the agreement covering current nationally recruiting upper secondary education for students with learning disabilities combined with deafness or hearing impairment shall make it clear that the offer of nationally recruiting upper secondary education for deaf or hearing-impaired students concerns education both on national programmes and on the training programme. Today, students who have followed syllabuses at compulsory school for pupils with learning disabilities at regional special schools are offered education either at the upper secondary school for deaf and hearing-impaired persons or on an individual programme at a nationally recruiting upper secondary school for students with learning disabilities combined with deafness or hearing impairment.</p>
<h2>Upper secondary apprenticeship programmes in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities (Section 8.2)</h2>
<p>There are currently no provisions governing apprenticeship programmes in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities. There are however students in this form of education who would benefit considerably from receiving a substantial part of their education at a workplace. I therefore propose that an upper secondary apprenticeship sub-programme be established as part of the following programmes in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities: Administration, trade and product management; Property, plant and construction; Vehicle care and transport; Handicraft and production; Hotel, restaurant and bakery; Health, care and social services; and Forest, land and animal.</p>
<p>To maintain high quality, it is necessary to locate a certain proportion of the education programme at the workplace, provisionally at least half. Furthermore, there shall be a stable relationship between the student, the school and the employer; the student shall learn and develop at the workplace; his or her learning shall be based on the goals stipulated in policy documents; his or her progress towards the goals shall be clearly documented; he or she shall have a supervisor at the workplace; the school shall have a presence at the workplace in the form of visits by the relevant subject teachers; and guidance shall be given to the student’s supervisor.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the upper secondary apprenticeship education at upper secondary schools for pupils with learning disabilities shall from 2013 onwards be included as part of and financed within the framework of the upper secondary apprenticeship education that has already been decided for upper secondary education.</p>
<h2>Cooperation between schools and working life (Section 8.4)</h2>
<p>The cooperation between schools and working life needed for upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities basically coincides with that needed for upper secondary education in general. In some respects, however, it must take the special circumstances that apply for upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities into account.</p>
<p>Regarding the national level, I propose that cooperation shall take place within the national programme councils that have already been established for upper secondary education, with basically the same remit. It is of value to discuss issues that concern the cooperation between schools and working life in the same context. The partially diverse programme structure should not be an obstacle; it should be possible to integrate the vast majority of programmes in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities into one or in some cases two of the national upper secondary programme councils.</p>
<p>An integrated solution is also of value at the local level. I therefore propose that upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities shall be included in the remit for the local programme councils that will be in place for upper secondary education in general. This can also increase understanding between the different forms of schooling. Other forms of cooperation are however needed on the local level for upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities. Finding a suitable location for workplace learning or preparing for the exit of a student from school and hopefully finding employment requires cooperation between school, employer, the Public Employment Service and several other societal actors. The school’s study and career guidance officer is a key person in this context. To reduce vulnerability, the school must also build up structures and routines for the cooperation.</p>
<h2>Study and career guidance (Section 8.5)</h2>
<p>The existing provisions and guidelines on study and career guidance are generally worded. I do not feel that there is any reason to define the provisions any more precisely, despite the brief for study and career guidance officers at upper secondary schools for pupils with learning disabilities being more extensive than in upper secondary schools in general. I instead propose that the Swedish National Agency for Education be given the task of revising the general guidelines and comments on study and career guidance, thereby highlighting the special demands put on it in both compulsory and upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities. This is especially significant bearing in mind those municipalities where there is little upper secondary education for students with learning disabilities and there is often a lack of knowledge about the special demands put on study and career guidance in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities.</p>
<h2>Education for adults with learning disabilities at upper secondary level (Chapter 9)</h2>
<p>Persons with learning disabilities shall have the same opportunities as other people to continue their learning and development, even in adulthood. Here, education for adults with learning disabilities at upper secondary level has a role to play alongside folk high schools and study organisations. The need to extend this form of education is considerable since many adults with learning disabilities have little or no access to continued learning and development similar to that afforded to the rest of the population.</p>
<p>Those who have the right prerequisites shall in my opinion have the possibility to complete their upper secondary school studies. It is therefore proposed that basically all upper secondary subjects and the upper secondary school project in upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities shall also be available in education for adults with learning disabilities at upper secondary level. In order to increase flexibility in the system, other courses on a level equivalent to the education provided in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities, e.g. in the form of general introductory courses, shall also be available. It is also vital that education with learning disabilities for adults at upper secondary level offers vocationally oriented programmes. Under certain circumstances, it shall also be possible to accept students at the training level within education for adults with learning disabilities at the compulsory level despite them having a previous school background.</p>
<p>I also propose that education for adults with learning disabilities at upper secondary level be divided up into courses and credits, with the same number of credits as for the equivalent course at upper secondary school with learning disabilities. It shall also be possible to establish part-courses in this type of education in the same way as is already possible at the basic level. A specific diploma is not proposed for education for adults with learning disabilities at upper secondary level. It shall be possible on the other hand for an adult student who pursues or completes a upper secondary education programme for pupils with learning disabilities to obtain a diploma document similar to the one proposed for upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities.</p>
<p>I also propose that ‘greatest need’ be removed as a selection criterion in education for adults with learning disabilities at upper secondary level. When selecting students, priority shall instead be given, in the order stipulated below, to an applicant who has not previously participated in a similar education programme, wishes to complete studies he or she has started in accordance with an established individual study plan, wishes to complete studies started at upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities, needs the education for his or her current work situation, or needs the education for a planned or forthcoming vocational choice.</p>
<p>The demand for education for adults with learning disabilities at upper secondary level is currently not being met. To support the development of the system, I therefore propose that the Swedish National Agency for Education be given the task to develop learning examples and support material aimed at both the administrative and executive levels as well as at teachers in education for adults with learning disabilities at upper secondary level. I furthermore propose that a time-limited incentive allowance is set aside for the period 2012-2014 to municipalities that invest in developing their education for adults with learning disabilities at upper secondary level.</p>
<h2>Implementation, monitoring and evaluation (Chapter 10)</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the Swedish National Agency for Education shall be given the task to carry out implementation measures aimed at school governing bodies, principals, teachers and other staff prior to the reforms of upper secondary school for pupils with learning disabilities and education for adults with learning disabilities at upper secondary level. Implementation of the reforms shall also be continuously monitored so that any necessary adjustments to the measures can be made at the local level.</p>
<p>I also propose that the reforms be monitored and evaluated with regard to whether or not they lead to the intended development in upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities and education for adults with learning disabilities at upper secondary level respectively. This should focus on e.g. how well upper secondary schools for pupils with learning disabilities have managed to recruit and accept students with very different prerequisites onto national programmes.</p>
<h2>The consequences of the inquiry’s proposals (Chapter 11)</h2>
<p>The proposals submitted for a modified programme structure for upper secondary education for pupils with learning disabilities do not constitute a radical change from a gender equality perspective. As in upper secondary education, there are programmes that par- ticularly attract either young men or young women. As in upper secondary education in general, however, conscious strategies are needed to prevent upper secondary apprenticeship programmes becoming exclusively men-only. The proposals submitted for edu-</p>
<p>cation for adults with learning disabilities at upper secondary level have no obvious gender equality perspective.</p>
<p>The inquiry has consciously considered the children’s perspec- tive in its work. In my proposals for a future upper secondary edu- cation system for pupils with learning disabilities, the emphasis is very much on students having access to more alternative education paths than they have at present, in the form of different programmes and as a result of the possibility of setting up nation- ally recruiting programmes and upper secondary apprenticeship programmes within the system. Considerable emphasis has also been on other systems increasing student choice, by e.g. making it easier for them to apply for and be accepted onto a programme, and on other rules being equal to those that apply in upper secon- dary school education.</p>
<p>The calculated costs of the reform for municipalities and the state are limited.</p>
