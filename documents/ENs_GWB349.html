<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>Background</p>
<p>A person wishing to start a business in Sweden may choose between several business vehicles. A limited liability company (Sw. aktiebolag) may be formed by one or more persons. One characteristic feature of a limited liability company is that the shares in the company are normally freely transferable and can be distributed to a large number of holders. Another characteristic of a limited liability company is that the shareholders are not personally liable for the obligations of the company. This means that investors are offered the opportunity to finance business activities without risking their personal finances.</p>
<p>As a consequence of these basic principles, the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslag, SFS 2005:551) contains capital protection rules that build on three fundamental elements. The first is the requirement of a contribution of capital when the company is formed</p>
<p>– for private companies at least SEK 100,000 – and subsequently when the capital is increased. The second element consists of limitations on the company's ability to use contributed or generated capital and the third of the rules about involuntary liquidation. These provisions have been ascribed great significance for the protection of creditors but also for the benefit of the shareholders themselves by making it easier to raise capital. It has also been argued that a statutory minimum share capital is required as a form of entry barrier for the use of the limited liability company form, so that a person wishing to use that business vehicle has to be capable of contributing a certain capital and has to be prepared to do so.</p>
<p>In its terms of reference for the Inquiry, the Government states that there may now be reason to review the regulation of share capital. The review may be considered part of the work on simpler</p>
<p>regulation currently under way in Sweden and the EU, whose aims include strengthening the competitiveness of businesses.</p>
<p>Views on the function of share capital vary between countries. Certain countries place great emphasis on legislative protection of the company’s stakeholders and especially of its creditors. In other countries, there is greater focus on flexibility and accessibility, and a greater trust in the ability of the parties to protect their own interests through agreements. In Europe, there is a trend towards lowering or abolishing requirements of minimum share capital for company forms that correspond to the Swedish private limited liability company.</p>
<p>With respect to public limited liability companies, Member States have to design their company law in the light of the EC’s Second Company Directive, which contains a minimum capital requirement. The design of the capital protection set out in the Second Company Directive for public limited liability companies has recently been the subject of discussions within the EU. A study on an alternative to the capital maintenance regime established by the Second Company Law Directive was presented in February 2008. TPF FPT  According to the European Commission, the study shows that, in its present form, the Second Directive does not cause significant obstacles to companies. Consequently, the Commission currently has no plans to follow up or amend the directive. Even though the directive only applies to public limited liability companies, the principles underlying the design of its capital protection regime may also be of interest to private companies.</p>
<p>This interim report deals with the Inquiry’s assignment to consider whether the minimum capital requirements for private companies should be lowered. According to its terms of reference, the Inquiry should consider the levels of SEK 50,000 and SEK 20,000, in particular. Another alternative that the Inquiry is to consider is not specifying a minimum share capital requirement in the Act, i.e. the complete removal of the minimum level. With such a solution the founders of the company could, in principle, set the share capital to SEK 1. Moreover, we have investigated a solution providing for the successive payment of share capital on the formation of a company.</p>
<p>This interim report focuses on considerations relating to the capital requirement and the resultant changes that may be necessary if the requirement is changed. We have not, however, reviewed the general capital protection provisions of the Swedish Companies Act from a simplification perspective. Such a review will be made during the continued work of the Inquiry.</p>
<p>Deliberations and proposals</p>
<p>• The main proposal of the Inquiry is that the requirement set out in Chapter 1, Section 5 of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551) for a minimum share capital in private limited companies be reduced from SEK 100,000 to SEK 50,000.</p>
<p>• The inquiry has elected to also present an alternative proposal to amend the Companies Act to enable private companies to provide for the successive payment of the share capital on the formation of the company. Under this alternative proposal, at least a quarter of the share capital would have to be paid up before a newly formed company can be registered. This alternative may be combined with a simultaneous reduction of the minimum share capital to SEK 50,000.</p>
<p>The main proposal for reduction of the minimum capital to SEK 50,000</p>
<p>The main proposal entails no other changes to the Companies Act than a reduction of the minimum share capital requirement from SEK 100,000 to SEK 50,000.</p>
<p>Initially it may be noted that, in practice, inflation since 1995, when the minimum capital requirement was raised from SEK 50,000 to SEK 100,000, has already resulted in a lowering of the minimum capital in real terms. However, our assignment is to investigate whether it is possible to also lower the present minimum capital in nominal terms and the effects this may lead to.</p>
<p>The inquiry has not been able to find any empirical evidence that the number of new businesses in Sweden would increase as a result of reducing the share capital. However, we have found that the statutory minimum level of share capital may be of significance for the choice of business vehicle. It is, on the one hand, not desirable per se to increase the number of limited liability companies to the</p>
<p>detriment of other business vehicles. On the other hand, smaller businesses with lower capital requirements should also have a greater freedom to choose the vehicle that is most suitable in the individual case. Increased availability of the limited liability form for smaller businesses is therefore an argument for the lowering of the present capital requirement. Lowering the minimum share capital would benefit companies whose initial capital requirements do not amount to SEK 100,000 and where the minimum share capital is thus to be viewed as an obstacle to the selection of the limited liability company form. This primarily concerns businesses in the service industry and particularly in industries where no great investments in tangible assets are needed. In 2006, most new companies, almost four out of five, were started in the service industry.</p>
<p>Another argument that has been advanced for a change of the minimum share capital is an increasing tendency in the EU to form companies in other Member States with lower minimum capital requirements and thereafter conduct business through a branch office in the home country. Considering that the number of branch offices in Sweden of companies registered in other Member States is low, the Inquiry is of the opinion that the possibility of circumventing the minimum share capital provisions by using a branch office is not a convincing argument for removing or radically lowering the minimum share capital.</p>
<p>A statutory minimum share capital has the disadvantage that there is no connection between this more or less randomly determined limit and the capital requirements and business risks of the individual company. If the statutory minimum requirement were removed, the share capital would be determined by the shareholders themselves in proportion to the extent and nature of the operations. Furthermore, in principle a statutory minimum share capital is irrelevant to the creditors who are capable of safeguarding their interests through agreements, called ‘adjusting creditors’ here. Such creditors include suppliers who are able to obtain security through retention of title or leasing and creditors who are able to require personal guarantees or other security. Some creditors are, however, unable to regulate their transactions with the company through agreements and to limit in the risks associated with claims on the company by doing so. These ‘non-adjusting creditors’ include the government with its tax claims. It is also possible that a creditor may be unable for a range of reasons – e.g. lack of ability, will or information – to obtain relevant security. These groups have to rely on the assets of the com-</p>
<p>pany. A minimum capital requirement may therefore be of some value, even if this value should not be exaggerated since the share capital may quickly be consumed in the operations of the company.</p>
<p>In addition, provisions on a minimum share capital and capital protection may be of significance as a collective guarantee for the benefit of present and future creditors. Furthermore the provisions can be viewed as a standard contract for all creditors. An adjusting creditor may make departures from the standard contract in an individual case if it is desirable to do so in the light of the company’s operations. In the absence of statutory provisions requiring a minimum amount of capital, there would be an increased need for individual agreements, which would result in higher transaction costs for both the companies and the adjusting creditors that enter into agreements. So a change in the statutory requirements may result in greater demands by adjusting creditors, such as credit institutions and suppliers, on the company and its shareholders. Swedish banks have indicated that if the minimum share capital requirement is removed altogether or dramatically reduced, they foresee increased use of security such as personal guarantees, increased demands for capital contributions and more extensive information requirements for the individual entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Thus, if removed, the statutory requirements would likely be replaced by contractual requirements by adjusting creditors for companies in need of credit from credit institutions or other creditors. However, these increased contractual requirements would not affect companies without a need for credit.</p>
<p>Another circumstance to be taken into consideration is the function of the minimum capital requirement as an entrance barrier. This barrier may be said to be intended to ensure that an entrepreneur has a well-developed business idea to which he is prepared to commit capital. A second purpose of the barrier is to reduce the risk of the limited liability form being used for illegitimate purposes. A minimum capital requirement certainly does not by itself prevent abuse of the company form but the requirement may at least constitute a certain barrier for persons wishing to start a limited liability company for less than honest purposes.</p>
<p>Against this background we have found that there is – at least at present – no reason to remove the minimum share capital requirement under Swedish law. However, the limited liability company form should be made more accessible by lowering the minimum</p>
<p>share capital requirement, thus increasing freedom of choice for smaller companies.</p>
<p>Given the absence of a clear connection between the capital requirement for limited liability companies and the aggregate number of new businesses, major changes to the present system should be avoided. In weighing the interests of enabling additional businesses to operate in the limited liability form against the presumed detrimental effects of a reduction of the minimum capital requirements, the Inquiry has found that the share capital should not be lowered to below SEK 50,000. In historical terms, this is a very low level.</p>
<p>Our conclusion to propose a reduction to SEK 50,000 instead of SEK 20,000 is partially attributable to an assessment that the additional contractual demands expected from adjusting creditors for increased security, capital contributions and information would be not be as extensive for a reduction to SEK 50,000 as for a reduction to SEK 20,000. Furthermore, the minimum capital requirement will have more effect both as a standard contract for non-adjusting creditors and as a general barrier to entry if its level is not reduced too much. We have also taken into consideration that the lower the capital requirement is, the greater is the risk of the company entering into an involuntary liquidation situation, i.e. a situation where half of the share capital has been consumed, forcing the board to act in accordance with the provisions dealing with involuntary liquidation. Such a situation results in additional requirements on the company, thereby increasing administrative costs.</p>
<p>The alternative proposal on the successive payment of share capital when a company is formed</p>
<p>In addition to the main proposal we have also elected to present a proposal to permit successive payment of the share capital on the formation of a private limited liability company. The alternative proposal also includes the possibility of a simultaneous reduction of the minimum capital to SEK 50,000.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, a precondition for the registration of a private limited liability company would be that at least a quarter of the share capital has been paid up. This means a minimum payment of SEK 25,000 if the minimum share capital is SEK 100,000 or SEK 12,500 if the minimum share capital is SEK 50,000. The shareholder will be personally liable for the unpaid shares until full pay-</p>
<p>ment has been made. In the event of a transfer of an unpaid share, the acquirer will be fully responsible for the payment jointly and severally with the transferor as soon as he or she has requested that the company enter him or her into the share ledger. Under the alternative proposal, the founders have to determine in the memorandum of incorporation the time limit for payment of the share capital. When the time for payment has expired, the Board has to notify the Swedish Companies Registration Office within one month of the payment. A share that is not paid up in time may be revoked and cancelled. Under the proposal, failure to report payment to the Companies Registration Office will also constitute a ground for a decision on involuntary liquidation.</p>
<p>The present requirement of full payment of the share capital as a precondition for registration has been justified by identifying the full payment of the share capital as the point in time when the creditors are compensated for the absence of personal liability for the obligations of the company that enters into effect at registration. This must, however, be weighed against the consideration that a statutory possibility of successive payment of the share capital will offer the founders greater flexibility at the formation of the company, a flexibility that may be particularly significant in cases where the founders have different financial resources. By granting the founders a longer time to pay the share capital, access to the limited liability form would increase primarily to the benefit of certain smaller businesses. This effect would be greater if the share capital were simultaneously reduced to SEK 50,000.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the adjusting creditors of the company may be expected to make greater demands for security and information until the share capital has been fully paid up or amounts to at least SEK 50,000. Banks have indicated that the supply of credit for smaller companies might become tighter under this alternative, particularly if the share capital is reduced at the same time to SEK 50,000. These effects do not, however, affect companies who do not need credit from adjusting creditors due to the nature of their operations.</p>
<p>In addition, the alternative proposal will result in increased information requirements and increased administrative costs for companies contemplating successive payment of the share capital. Individual entrepreneurs may view the proposed provisions as complicated. This is not a desirable consequence in the light of the overarching goal of simplifying the regulatory framework for smaller companies. It may also be noted that if the minimum share capital remains at</p>
<p>SEK 100,000, the businesses that now view the share capital as an obstacle to choosing the limited liability company form would be more or less forced to use the successive payment option in order to have access to the limited liability company form. A simultaneous reduction of the minimum share capital to SEK 50,000 would offer smaller companies greater freedom of choice.</p>
<p>In order to assess whether, despite the drawbacks stated above, the alternative proposal would be seen as positive for smaller companies, we have elected to present a proposal with or without a simultaneous reduction of the minimum share capital as alternatives to be assessed during the consultation process.</p>
<p>Entry into force, etc</p>
<p>The proposed changes should be able to enter into effect on 1 July 2009.</p>
<p>Private companies formed before the amendments enter into effect will be able, under present regulations, to subsequently reduce their share capital to SEK 50,000.</p>
<p>The reform should be evaluated after a number of years. If the results of the evaluation are positive, further reductions of the minimum share capital may be considered.</p>
