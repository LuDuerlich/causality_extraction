<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>Our overall remit has been to consider different ways to increase the possibilities for involuntarily childless people to become parents. This remit includes:</p>
<p>• presenting proposals giving single women a possibility of assisted fertilisation corresponding to the possibilities for married and cohabiting couples;</p>
<p>• considering whether to require a genetic link between the child and the prospective parent or parents in the case of assisted fertilisation;</p>
<p>• considering whether to permit surrogacy in Sweden on the basis that it shall, in that case, be altruistic;</p>
<p>• considering whether special rules are needed for children born through surrogacy abroad;</p>
<p>• considering whether the abolition of the sterilisation requirement and of the ban on retained reproductive capacity in cases of gender change can result in problems when, for example, applying legislation concerning parenthood; and</p>
<p>• proposing the consequential amendments needed to the regulations concerning parenthood and other legislation.</p>
<p>We reported on the part of our remit relating to the possibility for single women to undergo assisted fertilisation and necessary consequential amendments in our interim report Assisted fertilisation for single women  ( Assisterad befruktning för ensamstående kvinnor) (SOU 2014:29) on 16 May 2014. In this final report we deal with the other parts of our remit.</p>
<h2>Ethical starting points</h2>
<p>To begin with, we will say something about the ethical and other starting points that should apply when considering matters to do with permitting new forms of assisted fertilisation in health care in Sweden, and that we build on in our deliberations about abolishing the genetic link requirement and permitting surrogacy. Our starting points in the other parts of the inquiry are set out in the context of relevant part.</p>
<p>Ethical standpoints in matters concerning assisted fertilisation must always be based on a humanistic view of human beings as free and responsible creatures with human dignity. This humanistic view of human beings means that humans have to be viewed as something other and a great deal more than their biological or economic value. In this context it is usual to talk about human dignity, and this leads us to the principle of human dignity. According to this principle, which is of central importance in this area, all human beings have the same worth and the same right to have their rights satisfied. This also means that no person may be viewed or treated solely as a means to an end. However, this principle cannot be held to mean that it is a human right to, at any cost, either give birth to one’s own child or become the parent of a child in some other way.</p>
<p>Decisions on matters to do with assisted fertilisation must also take account of the starting points of justice (or equal care on equal terms), non-discrimination and self-determination (or autonomy). The starting points of justice and non-discrimination mean, for instance, that cases of the same kind have to be treated in the same way and that it is immoral to give a group special treatment unless there are ethically relevant differences between that group and other groups. The starting points of integrity and self-determination mean that everyone has the right to have their values, opinions and wishes respected. A person who is incapable of defending their dignity by exercising their right to self-determination must have their dignity safeguarded by some other party, society for instance.</p>
<p>The right to self-determination is of importance for another starting point, that of informed consent. The main import of that starting point is that a person must be given sufficient information and understand the information before, for instance, giving their consent to assisted fertilisation.</p>
<p>However, the most central starting point for decisions in this area is the principle of the best interests of the child. This is because new forms of assisted fertilisation should not be permitted unless they are held to be consistent with this principle. The point of departure should continue to be that children conceived through assisted fertilisation should not be exposed to greater risks than other children. If there are gaps in knowledge in some particular respect, society has a particular responsibility for monitoring and safeguarding the interests of the children. In such cases the procedure should only be permitted providing that, as a result of legal regulations put in place or other action taken, the procedure can nevertheless be held to be consistent with the principle of the best interests of the child. If this is not the case, the precautionary principle should be applied and result in the procedure not being permitted.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important when taking decisions in this area to also take account of the risk of a selection of individuals, an objectification of reproductive cells, a commercialisation of the breeding of children and too technified a view of human beings.</p>
<h2>Treatment using only donated reproductive cells Introduction</h2>
<p>Under the present regulations in the Genetic Integrity Act (2006:351), an assisted fertilisation may be carried out with a couple’s own reproductive cells or with either a donated egg or donated sperm. But the regulations do not permit assisted fertilisation using only donated reproductive cells, i.e. using both a donated egg and donated sperm or using a donated fertilised egg. This system, which has been justified on the grounds that there must always be a genetic link between the prospective child and at least one of its prospective parents, means that some couples cannot be offered treatment for involuntary childlessness.</p>
<p>As of 1 April 2016 it will be possible for single women to undergo insemination or fertilisation outside the body ( in vitro  fertilisation) in the Swedish health system. Then the situation described for some couples in the previous paragraph will also apply to some single women. To simplify reading we will assume in the following that the rules about single women have already entered into force.</p>
<p>Part of our remit is to consider whether a requirement of a genetic link between the prospective child and at least one prospective parent, and thus a ban on treatments using only donated reproductive cells, should continue to apply to assisted fertilisation. If we conclude that this should be the case, we have also to consider whether egg donation can be permitted in a marriage or cohabiting relationship between two women.</p>
<h2>Analysis and conclusions</h2>
<p>Our view is that the genetic link requirement should be abolished and that treatments using only donated reproductive cells should be permitted in the Swedish health system if there is a need of the treatments, the risks to the parties involved, and especially to the children, can be regarded as acceptable and the other arguments against permitting the treatments do not carry sufficient weight. We begin by considering the need.</p>
<p>There are couples in which both persons have infertility problems that could overcome their childlessness by being treated using only donated reproductive cells. There are also single women who could do so. Moreover, there are couples and single women who currently undergo treatments of this type abroad. It has thus been established that there is a need for these treatments in the Swedish health system. The need is even greater if account is taken of the decrease in the number of children available for adoption in recent years and the fact that many countries do not permit adoption by same-sex couples or single persons. We therefore go on to consider whether the risks to the parties involved, and especially to the children, can be regarded as acceptable.</p>
<p>It can be noted that there is very limited research about families created through the treatments concerned. A large part of the explanation for this limited research is that these treatments are a relatively new phenomenon in many countries. So there are not that many people who have been born through such a treatment and who have also reached adulthood.</p>
<p>At the same time, the gaps in the knowledge base decrease substantially if account is also taken of the research that is available about two closely related paths to parenthood, namely treatments using donated reproductive cells and adoption. The main evidence from this latter body of research is as follows. Generally speaking, families created through a treatment using donated reproductive cells or through an adoption seem to do well. What is important, from a child perspective, seems to be that the social and legal parents are open and honest with the child, that they gradually give the child the information it needs to develop a secure and stable identity and that the child is subsequently given the opportunity to trace its own genetic origins. In such circumstances the fact that there is no genetic link between the child and its social and legal parents seems to be of very little importance for the child's psychosocial development and well-being. The following should also be added.</p>
<p>There is nothing in the research about other treatments using donated reproductive cells to indicate that knowledge about genetic parents and genetic full or half-siblings somewhere else entails any risk for the children or for other parties involved. Nor is there anything in the research about early adoptees to indicate that this is the case. We therefore make the assessment that such knowledge does not entail any risks for children created through a treatment using only donated reproductive cells.</p>
<p>So, the results of the research available do not provide any evidence that the risks of a treatment only using donated reproductive cells are higher than the risks of other treatments using donated reproductive cells, for example treatments using a donated egg. The risks must therefore be regarded as acceptable. We now move on to consider the third point above, i.e. whether there are other arguments of sufficient weight against permitting the treatments in question.</p>
<p>One argument that has been put forward is that permitting these treatments would be an expression of too technified a view of human beings. This argument is saying the treatments concerned using only donated reproductive cells must be regarded as so foreign to Swedish society that they should continue to be banned. At the same time, it can be noted that there are great similarities between these treatments and certain paths to parenthood that are already permitted, including treatment using a donated egg and adoptions. The essential difference is that the treatments in question create a child that does not have any genetic link to its social and legal parents. This difference can certainly be regarded as foreign to Swedish society. But, in view of the knowledge development that has taken place in recent years and the changes that this has resulted in, these treatments cannot be regarded as so foreign or so technified that they should be banned for that reason. Therefore we do not consider that permitting the treatments would be an expression of too technified a view of human beings either.</p>
<p>Other arguments put forward are that permitting treatments only using donated reproductive cells may result in an objectification of reproductive cells, a changed view of parenthood, a greater risk of intimate relations between full genetic siblings and a risk that we may, in the future, accept procedures in the Swedish health system that must be viewed as unacceptable today. On its own, none of these arguments constitutes a sufficient reason for not permitting the treatments. Nor can they be regarded, together or in combination with other arguments, as constituting such a reason.</p>
<p>So, in our view, the genetic link requirement should be abolished and treatments using only donated reproductive cells should be permitted in the Swedish health system. It should be possible to perform treatments using a donated egg and donated sperm or using a donated fertilised egg. In making these assessments there is no reason to consider the question of egg donation in a female samesex couple separately.</p>
<h2>The framing of the regulations</h2>
<p>The rules about treatments using only donated reproductive cells should conform, in all essential respects, to the rules that now apply to fertilisation outside the body. In the main this means the following.</p>
<p>The treatments should be available to couples and single women. In the case of couples, they should be required to be married, registered partners or cohabiting partners. A further requirement should be that the other person in the couple, i.e. the person who will not carry and give birth to the child, should give their written consent to a fertilised egg being inserted into the body of the prospective mother. A further requirement should be that it is medically justified to perform the treatment.</p>
<p>Only the “university hospitals” should be allowed to perform the treatments and they should be preceded by information and a special assessment, in the same way as treatments using a donated egg or donated sperm. When a treatment using a donated fertilised egg is to be performed, the prospective parents should be specially informed of the fact that the prospective child may have genetic parents and full siblings in other families. The special assessment should be adapted to the circumstances in the individual case. But it should always include conversations with professionals with training in behavioural sciences who have good knowledge of the area.</p>
<p>Ahead of a treatment using only donated reproductive cells it is particularly important to assess the ability of the prospective parents to deal with the fact that there is no genetic link between them and the prospective child. When a treatment is to be performed using a donated fertilised egg, it is also important to assess their ability to deal with the facts set out above, i.e. that the prospective child may have genetic parents and full siblings in other families.</p>
<p>If a treatment is refused, the couple or the single woman should be able to request an examination of the matter by the National Board of Health and Welfare. It should, in turn, be possible to have the decision of the Board examined by the general administrative courts.</p>
<p>As stated above, it should be possible to perform a treatment using only donated reproductive cells either using a donated egg and donated sperm or using a donated fertilised egg. The rules on donation of reproductive cells for the first type of treatment should conform, as far as possible, with the rules that currently apply to donation for fertilisation outside the body. However, under these rules it is not possible for a donor to withdraw their consent to a donation after the point in time when a donated egg has been fertilised or donated sperm have been used for fertilisation. We propose amending this rule and permitting a donor to withdraw their consent up until the time when the fertilised egg created from a donated egg or donated sperm has been inserted into a woman’s body.</p>
<p>The conditions for a donation of a fertilised egg should be broadly the same as those for a donation of eggs or sperm. However, in the case of a donation of fertilised eggs, potential donors should also, for example, be informed that their own children may have genetic full siblings in other families. A further condition for the donation of such eggs should be that the fertilised eggs have been created from the donor couple’s own eggs or sperm or from the donor woman’s own eggs and that the couple or the woman are the parent(s) of at least one child.</p>
<p>If all the conditions for a donation of fertilised eggs have been fulfilled, the donors or donor should give written consent to the eggs being inserted in a woman’s body. It should be possible to withdraw the consent until this has happened. When fertilised eggs have been donated by a couple, a withdrawal of consent by one person in the couple should be sufficient for it to no longer be possible to use the eggs.</p>
<p>In these cases, too, it should be the doctor responsible who chooses which donated reproductive cells, or which donated fertilised egg, to use in a fertilisation outside the body. It should also be that doctor who ensures that the donation of the reproductive cells or the fertilised egg has been made by one or two suitable donors and that the donors are still alive when the treatment is performed. If a donated fertilised egg has been created from donated eggs or sperm, the donor of reproductive cells must also be alive when the treatment is performed.</p>
<p>Today it is a generally held view that donors should not give rise to children in more than six families. Our view is that this should also apply to treatments using donated fertilised eggs. For treatments using a donated egg and donated sperm, the following rule needs to apply instead. If a donor’s reproductive cells have been used in such a treatment, he or she should not be allowed to give rise to children in more than three other families. This is because the result will then be that the prospective child can have genetic full or half-siblings in no more than six other families.</p>
<p>Under the present rules the details of an egg or sperm donor have to be noted in a separate record, and the record has to be kept for at least 70 years. What has been stated above should also apply to a donor of a fertilised egg who personally contributed reproductive cells when the egg was created.</p>
<p>As stated above, it is important that the individuals who become parents through assisted fertilisation using donated reproductive cells begin early on to tell the child about its origins. This knowledge is often necessary to enable the child to obtain information about its genetic origins later on. We also propose the following.</p>
<p>A person who has been conceived through a treatment using only donated reproductive cells and who has reached sufficient maturity should be able to give written consent to the disclosure, on request, of information about them to other persons who have been conceived through reproductive cells from the same donor or donors. In that case, the consent and the details should be entered in the separate record containing details of a donor. The person should also be able to access the details noted in such a record that relate to other persons conceived through reproductive cells from the same donor. If a person does not know, but has reason to suppose, that they have been conceived through a treatment using only donated reproductive cells, the municipal social welfare committee should be obliged, on request, to assist that person in finding out whether any details are noted in a separate record. The arrangements set out in this paragraph should also apply when a person has been conceived through a treatment using either a donated egg or donated sperm or when a person has reason to suppose that this is the case.</p>
<p>Our deliberations necessitate certain amendments to Chapter 7 of the Genetic Integrity Act. We also propose that the word givare (giver)  be replaced with donator (donor)  in that chapter, that a definition of the expression fertilisation outside the body  be inserted in the introductory section of that chapter and that this expression is then used in all the sections of the law that do not have to talk about the first or second stage of a traditional IVF treatment (i.e. fertilisation of an egg outside a woman’s body and insertion of a fertilised egg in a woman’s body). We also propose certain consequential amendments to Chapters 5 and 6 of the same Act. One such amendment is the extension of the period for storing frozen fertilised eggs from five to ten years.</p>
<p>Our deliberations also necessitate certain consequential amendments and editorial amendments to Chapter 1 of the Children and Parents Code. One example of consequential amendments is an addition to Section 5 to the following effect. It should not be possible to establish paternity through a judgment for a man who has contributed sperm for the creation of a donated fertilised egg under Chapter 7 of the Genetic Integrity Act.</p>
<h2>Surrogacy in Sweden</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Surrogacy means that a woman makes her body available and becomes pregnant with the explicit intention of handing the child over, after its birth, to a couple or a person who are themselves unable or unwilling to carry a child. Surrogacy can be partial or complete and altruistic or commercial.</p>
<p>In partial surrogacy the surrogate mother’s own egg is fertilised using a prospective father’s sperm or using donated sperm. In these cases the surrogate mother has both a genetic and a biological link to the child. The characteristic feature of full surrogacy is that the surrogate mother’s own eggs are not used when treating her. In these cases the fertilised egg inserted in the womb of the surrogate mother has thus been created using reproductive cells from the prospective parents or donated reproductive cells. In full surrogacy the surrogate mother only has a biological link to the child.</p>
<p>In altruistic surrogacy a surrogate mother does not receive any special payment for being the surrogate mother. However, she can receive compensation for costs of various kinds, including costs of visits to the doctor. In commercial surrogacy a surrogate mother receives special payment for being the surrogate mother.</p>
<p>At present surrogacy arrangements are not permitted in the Swedish health system. Our remit is to consider whether to permit these arrangements in the future, on the basis that the surrogacy shall, in that case, be altruistic. If we conclude that surrogacy should be permitted in the Swedish health system, we are also to propose how a comprehensive set of regulations covering surrogacy should be framed.</p>
<h2>Deliberations</h2>
<p>Our view is that commercial surrogacy should not be permitted in the Swedish health system, and that society should also counter that type of surrogacy. The following are the main reasons for this.</p>
<p>There is broad consensus, both internationally and in Sweden, that the human body and its parts must not, as such, give rise to financial gain. Bans on trade in organs and reproductive cells are one expression of this. It would appear to be inconsistent to introduce regulations permitting commercial surrogacy while maintaining such bans.</p>
<p>Permitting commercial surrogacy would also be hard to reconcile with developments in the EU and its Member States. The fact is that no EU country explicitly permits such surrogacy. Instead, several EU countries have explicit bans on this type of surrogacy.</p>
<p>Moreover, commercial surrogacy is hard to reconcile with the bans on trafficking in women and children and with other rules intended to satisfy the rights of women and children well.</p>
<p>We do not consider that altruistic surrogacy should be permitted in the Swedish health system either. Permitting that procedure does actually have some advantages. The most important is that more involuntarily childless people would be able to become parents. A procedure in the Swedish health system would also be able to offer greater security and better guarantees than provided in many of the countries where it is or has been possible up to now to undergo surrogacy arrangements. Permitting the procedure in the Swedish health system would also mean that the prospective child can be guaranteed a right to information about its origins, and that the legal problems that can arise in a cross-border surrogacy arrangement are avoided. However, the advantages of permitting surrogacy cannot be held to outweigh the disadvantages. In the following we will describe the disadvantages to which we have attached most weight here.</p>
<p>The first disadvantage relates to the present serious gaps in knowledge regarding the consequences for a child born after a surrogacy arrangement. It is certainly the case that the few studies available do not provide any direct support for fears that the children are harmed or that they have negative views about how they were conceived. However, these studies cover a few quite small groups of children and families. All but one of the studies originate from one and the same research group. Moreover, there are no long-term studies extending until the children reach adulthood. So we do not know how adults handle the fact that they were conceived through a surrogacy arrangement and what this can, for instance, mean for their identity development and long-term family relationships. In addition, there are no studies of what happens to the children in cases where surrogacy arrangements are not completed as envisaged, for example because one of the people involved changes their mind. Moreover, important knowledge about how the surrogate mothers’ own children are affected is not available.</p>
<p>We consider that, on account of the shortcomings in the knowledge base, the risks that may exist in the short and long term to, for instance, children born through surrogacy arrangements have not been established. Therefore it is not possible to draw any definite conclusions as to whether the procedure is consistent with the principle of the best interests of the child. In such circumstances, the precautionary principle indicates that surrogacy should not be permitted in the Swedish health system.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage relates to the risk for pressure and commercialisation. In our view, there is an obvious risk that some women may be put under pressure to be surrogate mothers if the procedure is permitted in the Swedish health system. Women may also feel tacit pressure to help a close relative. The risk for pressure might possibly decrease if surrogacy between close relatives is not permitted. At the same time, a system of that kind would increase the risk of covert commercialisation. When it comes to surrogacy, it must also be said that it is, in general, difficult to form a view in advance of what it is like to carry a child and then give the child away to the prospective parents. Even after a careful assessment, and with requirements in place saying, for instance, that a prospective surrogate mother must have given birth to her own child or children, it is not possible to make sure that the woman's consent has not been the result of pressure applied, feelings of inner compulsion or covert economic motives. In view of the serious risks that a surrogacy entails for the surrogate mother, what has been said above is a very weighty argument against permitting surrogacy in the Swedish health system.</p>
<p>A third disadvantage has to do with the mater est  rule and the surrogate mother’s possibilities of changing her mind once the child has been born. Our view is that any regulations in this area must be consistent with the mater est  rule, and thus mean that the surrogate mother is automatically regarded as the mother of the prospective child. Respect for the autonomy of a surrogate mother and her right to self-determination also requires that she must be able to change her mind once the child has been born. So, the surrogate mother must be able, for a reasonable period after the birth, to choose to keep the child. Regulations to this effect can, at the same time, result in serious problems. If a surrogate mother changes her mind, there may be severe conflicts that have an adverse effect on the child. It can also be negative for the child to know that the surrogate mother has kept him or her contrary to the will of the prospective, and perhaps genetic, parents. For the prospective parents such a course of events would be likely to be a tragedy.</p>
<p>There are further disadvantages here: for example, a surrogate mother may also have other difficulties in exercising her right to self-determination, for instance regarding her right to abortion, and there are also difficulties in framing acceptable regulations about the responsibility for costs in a surrogate arrangement. Our view is thus that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages and that surrogacy should not be permitted in the Swedish health system. No legislative amendments are needed to bring this about.</p>
<h2>Surrogacy arrangements abroad</h2>
<p>Our remit in this part of the inquiry is to examine and analyse the applicable regulatory framework and how it is applied in cases where a child has been conceived through a surrogacy arrangement abroad. We also have to look particularly at the international private law and judicial procedure aspects and to consider whether special rules should be introduced for children conceived in this way.</p>
<p>If we conclude that special rules should be introduced, we are also to look at possible solutions, for example expanding the possibilities of establishing parenthood through an acknowledgment or a judgment, making a transfer of parenthood possible, amending the regulations on the recognition of foreign decisions on paternity or making it possible to recognise foreign decisions on maternity. Our deliberations in these matters are to build on our conclusion about whether to permit surrogacy in the Swedish health system and in what circumstances it can then take place. Our terms of reference state that any regulations shall be intended to remove the current uncertainty about the legal position while countering circumvention of a ban or restrictions on surrogacy in Sweden.</p>
<p>If we conclude that there is no need to introduce special rules in this area, we are instead to consider whether special transitional rules should be introduced instead. The latter rules are to cover cases where a child is already in Sweden, or is on its way here, and where it is not possible to establish that any person other than the surrogate mother is the legal parent or custodian of the child or there are difficulties associated with doing so.</p>
<p>Irrespective of what conclusion we arrive at in the above matters, we are also to consider what information measures need to be carried out to make public authorities and the general public aware of the meaning of Swedish legislation and to propose which body or bodies should be responsible for these information measures.</p>
<p>As of 1 April 2016 it will be possible for single women to undergo insemination or fertilisation outside the body in the Swedish health system. To simplify reading we will also assume in this section that the rules about single women have already entered into force.</p>
<h2>An analysis of the Swedish regulatory framework and its application</h2>
<p>Almost all surrogacy arrangements abroad to date that have included persons who are habitually resident in Sweden have been carried out with the sperm of a prospective father. We will therefore deal first with the rules that apply to those cases and then deal with the rules that apply to other cases. However, before dealing with these rules, we will say something about the position when the application of international private law rules leads to the conclusion that Swedish law is to be applied to the question of parenthood.</p>
<p>In these cases an application of Swedish law means that the surrogate mother shall be regarded as the legal mother of the child and that her husband shall regarded as the legal father of the child. If a prospective father’s sperm have been used in the surrogate arrangement, the man can, under certain conditions, be established as the legal father of the child. However, this requires that the paternity of the surrogate mother’s husband is annulled first or that there was no man, at the time of the birth of the child, who would automatically be regarded as the legal father of the child. In contrast, other prospective parents cannot be established as the mother, father or parent of the child after a surrogacy arrangement abroad. Parenthood for these prospective parents thus requires adoption.</p>
<p>When a surrogacy arrangement abroad has been carried out using a prospective father's sperm, the question often arises of whether there is a foreign establishment of paternity for him that is valid under the International Paternity Act (1985:367) and that can therefore be recognised in Sweden. In assessing that question it may be necessary to consider what is to be regarded as a valid acknowledgement under that Act. It may also be necessary to consider whether there is what is called a ground for refusal in the particular case. For instance, a foreign establishment of paternity shall not be recognised if it is manifestly contrary to the foundations of the Swedish legal order to do so (what is called “public policy”).</p>
<p>The question of whether a foreign establishment of paternity is valid in Sweden shall normally be examined by the authority where the question is raised, for example the Swedish Tax Agency. If the foreign establishment has taken place through a judgment, the question can also be examined by a general court. The Svea Court of Appeal examined relatively recently whether it can be deemed to be contrary to public policy to recognise a US judgment on the establishment of paternity that established the genetic father and the social father as the child’s legal fathers. In these matters the Court of Appeal found that this was not the case and that the US establishment was therefore valid in Sweden. None of the orders was appealed to the Supreme Court, which has therefore not examined the question.</p>
<p>If a foreign establishment of paternity is valid under the Act and the established father is a Swedish citizen, the child is regarded as having acquired Swedish citizenship at birth. The child can then obtain a Swedish passport and travel to Sweden with its legal father and any partner he may have. After arriving in Sweden the father can apply for sole custody of the child and the father’s partner can apply for what is called a “stepchild adoption”.</p>
<p>When there is not a valid foreign establishment of paternity, the question arises of whether paternity can be established by a Swedish municipal social welfare committee or in a Swedish court. If the child is still in its country of birth and the establishment of paternity in Sweden is thus to take place at a distance, it is generally not possible for paternity to be established by a Swedish social welfare committee. It may, however, be possible, under certain conditions, to establish paternity in a Swedish court. If, instead, the establishment is to take place after the child’s arrival in Sweden, the question arises of how the child is to be able to enter Sweden. Since the child is not a Swedish citizen, it must have a passport or other essential travel documents. It must also have a permanent residence permit in Sweden. Neither the Swedish Migration Agency nor the migration courts have examined questions concerning a residence permit after a surrogacy arrangement abroad. The legal situation in this area must therefore be viewed as unclear. We now move on to describe what the position is when the sperm of another man, for example a donor’s sperm, have been used in a surrogacy arrangement instead.</p>
<p>What is common to all these cases is that it is not possible under the Children and Parents Code to establish that the prospective parents are the legal parents of the child. How to apply the rules on the recognition of foreign establishments of paternity in the International Paternity Act can therefore also be regarded as unclear. Would the Svea Court of Appeal have come to the same conclusion in its rulings mentioned above if none of the men had had a genetic link to the child? Which assessments would the Court have made if the foreign judgment had instead been about establishing maternity or parenthood for two women? In the absence of guiding decisions it is not possible to give a clear answer to these questions.</p>
<p>If it is not possible to obtain a valid establishment of the parenthood in Sweden, an adoption is required to make the prospective parents the legal parents of the child. The scope for recognising a foreign adoption decision after a surrogacy arrangement abroad seems to be limited. The same applies to a Swedish court's possibilities of examining an adoption application before the child comes to Sweden. But, if the child has come here, there is no impediment to a Swedish court examining the question of adoption. In such a case the court shall apply Swedish law. As regards the possibilities for a child to travel to Sweden and take up residence here, we refer to what was stated above. It should be added that, as far as is known, there are no guiding decisions in matters concerning adoption after a surrogate arrangement abroad. So the legal situation in this area must also be regarded as unclear.</p>
<h2>Starting points</h2>
<p>International surrogacy arrangements can result in problems of various kinds and magnitudes. The more serious problems include “limping legal parentage” and statelessness for the child. In many instances the problems are a result of countries having different views and rules about surrogacy arrangements and of prospective parents and surrogacy-friendly countries not respecting these differences. It must, at the same time, be added that up to now Sweden has been spared more serious problems in these contexts. The problems that have come up here have chiefly related to the processing of matters by public authorities after the arrival of the child in Sweden.</p>
<p>There are, at the same time, advocates who put forward the view that, in the light of the principle of the best interests of the child, we nevertheless need to implement extensive changes in this area. They argue, for instance, that we in Sweden – irrespective of whether or not we permit surrogacy – must focus on the newborn child and take every conceivable measure to enable the prospective parents to bring the child here. However, such a system is hard to reconcile with the conclusion we have already drawn to the effect, first, that surrogacy should not be permitted in the Swedish health system and, second, that commercial surrogacy arrangements abroad should be countered in various ways. We can hardly be regarded as countering the occurrence of commercial surrogacy arrangements if, at the same time, we always accept the consequences of such arrangements. We have therefore reached the following conclusions.</p>
<p>The principle of the best interests of the child cannot be held to demand that we, in Sweden, make extensive amendments to legislation in this area or that we take other far-reaching measures to solve all the problems that may arise when individuals from Sweden receive children through a surrogacy arrangement abroad.</p>
<p>But this principle must be held to demand that we in Sweden have good regulations for the children who are here and for the children abroad who are Swedish citizens. In addition, the principle must, of course, be taken into account in various contexts that concern a child, for instance when amending legislation.</p>
<p>Our view is thus that there may be a need to introduce special rules to deal with the problems that have arisen in Sweden after a surrogacy arrangement abroad. There may also be a need to introduce such rules to counter the emergence of other problems. At the same time, we must add the following. Our terms of reference state that our deliberations in this part of the inquiry are to start from the conclusion we draw as to whether to permit surrogacy in Sweden, and that the purpose of regulations is to be to counter circumvention of a ban or restrictions on surrogacy in Sweden.</p>
<p>We have, as stated above, concluded that surrogacy should not be permitted in the Swedish health system and that commercial surrogacy abroad should be countered in various ways. This part of the inquiry is therefore largely concerned with, on the one hand, trying to solve the problems that must be solved and, on the other, taking measures to counter individuals in Sweden undergoing surrogacy arrangements – generally commercial in nature – abroad. This means that we are not going to propose introducing rules about the transfer of paternity or parenthood after a surrogacy arrangement abroad or rules about the recognition of such transfers.This is because rules of this kind cannot be regarded as being needed to solve problems identified and will, instead, only mean that more individuals can undergo surrogacy arrangements abroad. Nor are we going to propose any amendments to the material rules about maternity, paternity or parenthood under Chapter 1, Section 9 of the Children and Parents Code or to the rules for Swedish citizenship and entry requirements to Sweden. It should be added that the latter rules fulfil important functions in society. One of them is to counter trafficking in children and other cross-border crime.</p>
<p>The fact that we do not propose any alterations to the material Swedish rules about the parenthood of a child means that in the cases in question there will only be one group of prospective parents in Sweden who can be held to be the legal parents of the child, and that is the genetic fathers. This is because we must, as a rule, accept that the genetic father of a child can be established as the legal father of the child. The fact that we must accept this means, in turn, that the procedure for this should be as simple and efficient as possible. Any other system can result in negative consequences for parties involved, and especially for the child.</p>
<p>Parenthood for prospective parents other than the genetic fathers should, in cases where the issue arises, continue to presuppose a stepchild adoption or an ordinary adoption. There are no reasons to make any amendments at present to the regulations about adoption after a surrogacy arrangement abroad. But there are reasons to carry out information measures in the area. We return to this matter and our other deliberations in the next section.</p>
<h2>Proposals and assessments</h2>
<p>In our opinion, the starting point should be that we in Sweden recognise foreign establishments of parenthood through judgments or acknowledgements that have been based on a fact that can constitute grounds for a corresponding establishment under Swedish law. Another starting point should be that, as a rule, we do not recognise other establishments. What has been said here means the following.</p>
<p>It should be possible to accept a foreign establishment of maternity in Sweden if it is based on the established mother having carried and given birth to the child. It should be possible to accept a foreign establishment of paternity if it is based on a presumption of paternity or a genetic link between the child and the established father. It should also be possible to accept a foreign establishment of paternity, in the same way as a foreign establishment of parenthood, if it is based on the person established as the parent having consented to the person’s spouse, registered partner or cohabiting partner undergoing assisted fertilisation.</p>
<p>The Svea Court of Appeal has, as already mentioned, issued two decisions that deviate from what is stated above. In these rulings the Court has, namely, accepted a foreign establishment of paternity for a man who could not have been established as the legal father under Swedish law. The existence of these two decisions necessitates the insertion of a new ground for refusal in the International Paternity Act. Under the new ground for refusal, a foreign establishment of paternity shall not be valid in Sweden if the child has been conceived through insemination or fertilisation outside the body, the treatment has been carried out on a person other than the spouse or cohabiting partner of the established father and the treatment has been performed using the sperm of another man. If a foreign establishment of paternity refers to two men and one of them is also the genetic father of the child, what is stated in the ground for refusal shall only apply to the other man. Thus the part of the establishment that refers to the genetic father of the child does not need to be invalid.</p>
<p>We have already concluded that we must, as a rule, accept that the genetic father of a child can be established as the legal father of the child and that this procedure should be as simple and efficient as possible. We therefore propose expanding the competence of Swedish social welfare committees and courts to establish paternity after a surrogacy arrangement abroad. Under this proposal, it would be possible for a Swedish social welfare committee or a court to establish paternity, under Swedish law, if the child is habitually resident in another country, the establishment refers to a man who is habitually resident in Sweden, the ground for paternity is that the child was conceived using the man’s sperm, and the child does not have any other legal parents in its country of habitual residence than the man and his spouse, registered partner or cohabiting partner.</p>
<p>This part of our proposals necessitates certain amendments to the International Paternity Act and consequential amendments to that Act. However, we cannot see that any other amendments need to be made to legislation in order to deal with the problems identified. Nor can we see that there is any need to introduce any special transitional regulations as stated in our terms of reference. However, information measures need to be carried out about surrogacy arrangements abroad. Our view is that the Government should commission the Swedish Family Law and Parental Support Authority to carry out these information measures in collaboration with other relevant authorities and organisations.</p>
<h2>Parenthood when assisted fertilisation is carried out at home or done abroad Introduction</h2>
<p>Under the present regulations in the Children and Parents Code, consent can be a ground for paternity or parenthood according to Chapter 1, Section 9 of the Code in the case of assisted fertilisation in the Swedish health system. As regards different-sex couples, the same rule applies when the couple have carried out a “home insemination” or have undergone a treatment abroad. So, paternity can also be based on consent in such cases. Our remit is to consider whether the latter regulations should also apply to female same-sex couples.</p>
<p>As of 1 April 2016 it will be possible for single women to undergo insemination or fertilisation outside the body in the Swedish health system. This change means that our deliberations in this part of the inquiry also cover single women.</p>
<h2>Deliberations</h2>
<p>One important starting point for consent to be a ground for paternity or parenthood under Chapter 1, Section 9 of the Children and Parents Code should be that the prospective child has a right to information about its genetic origins. The regulations should therefore guide behaviour and encourage potential parents to choose the assisted fertilisations that give the child such a right. Another important starting point for consent to be a ground for paternity or parenthood should be that society has reasonable possibilities of insight and control. The third and final starting point is that, as far as possible, different-sex and same-sex couples should be treated in the same way in these cases. In the light of the starting points set out here there are reasons to let our deliberations cover both different-sex and same-sex couples. There are also reasons to propose regulations to the following effect.</p>
<p>It should no longer be possible for consent to be a ground for paternity in a case of home insemination. Nor should it be possible for it to be a ground for parenthood in such an insemination. So in these cases legal parenthood for a person who has not carried and given birth to the child should require a stepchild adoption.</p>
<p>Consent should continue to be a possible ground for paternity in cases of assisted fertilisation in foreign health services. At the same time, there should also be a requirement that the treatment has been performed at a competent health care facility abroad and that the person who was conceived through the treatment has a right to information about the identity of the donor. This should also apply to parenthood under Chapter 1, Section 9 of the Children and Parents Code. Here, too, the regulations will be the same for different-sex couples and female same-sex couples.</p>
<p>The rule in Chapter 1, Section 3, second paragraph of the Children and Parents Code that enters into force on 1 April 2016 and that means that paternity or parenthood shall not be established when a single woman has undergone assisted fertilisation in the Swedish health system should not apply to home inseminations. So, in these cases a paternity or parenthood should continue to be established for the child. But it should be possible for a single woman to become a single parent through assisted fertilisation in a foreign health service. However, the treatment must have been performed at a competent health care facility abroad and the person who was conceived through the treatment must have a right to information about the identity of the donor.</p>
<p>Our deliberations necessitate certain amendments to Chapter 1 of the Children and Parents Code. But they do not necessitate any amendments to other statutes.</p>
<h2>Parenthood in cases of gender change Introduction</h2>
<p>Previously there was a requirement that persons who changed their gender from male to female (MTF) or from female to male (FTM) had to be sterilised or to be without reproductive capacity for some other reason. This “sterilisation requirement” was abolished on 1 July 2013 and today it is possible for an FTM to give birth to a child. It is also possible for an MTF to contribute sperm to the creation of a child.</p>
<p>When the sterilisation requirement was abolished, the Government stated that regulations concerning parenthood can be applied analogously in cases where a person has changed gender. The same would apply, according to the Government, to other relevant statutes. At the same time, the Government stressed the importance of following the application of the law in the area closely.</p>
<p>Our remit is to consider whether the abolition of the sterilisation requirement and the ban on retaining reproductive capacity in cases of gender change can result in problems when applying the legislation concerning parenthood. We are also to consider whether there is a need to amend that legislation or any other legislation.</p>
<p>Our investigations, which have included contacts with the Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Rights (RFSL) and the Swedish Tax Agency, have shown that the abolition of the sterilisation requirement has led to certain problems in applying legislation in the population registration service. As an example of problems in applying legislation it can be mentioned that the Swedish Tax Agency has registered an FTM who had given birth as the mother of the child. This means that there are reasons to consider amendments to the regulations concerning parenthood.</p>
<p>Our assessment is that parenthood in these cases should be classed and registered in a way that reflects a parent’s legal gender. An FTM who gives birth to a child should thus be classed and registered as the legal father of the child. In addition, parents who have changed gender should have the same rights, benefits and obligations as they would have had if they had not changed gender. An FTM who gives birth to a child should have the same rights, benefits and obligations as a legal mother. If an FTM is unmarried when the child is born, he should thus have sole custody of the child (cf. Chapter 6, Section 3 of the Children and Parents Code). In view of this we propose introducing a regulation to the following effect in Chapter 1 of the Children and Parents Code.</p>
<p>An FTM who gives birth to a child shall automatically be regarded as the father of the child. The person shall, at the same time, be covered by what is said in other chapters of the Code and other statutes about a mother and maternity. The fact that paternity in these cases shall follow automatically means that it does not need to be established through an acknowledgement or a judgment. However, the parenthood of the person who did not give birth to the child shall be established in the usual way. There are exceptions in cases where an FTM has undergone assisted fertilisation as a single person under the rules in Section 3, second or third paragraph. For, in such a case, it is possible for an FTM to be the child’s only legal parent.</p>
<p>In these cases the parent who did not give birth to the child should always be regarded as a father if he is an FTM or a man who has not changed gender, or a mother in instances of an MTF or a woman who has not changed gender. As stated above, parenthood has to be established by acknowledgement or a judgment. The regulations on parenthood for the person who has not given birth to the child should thus have the following content.</p>
<p>An FTM who has consented to his spouse, registered partner or cohabiting partner undergoing assisted fertilisation under Section 9 shall be regarded as the father of the child. If the child was given birth by an FTM, the same applies to a man who has not changed his gender and who meets the conditions to be established as the father under Section 5 or to be regarded as the father under Section 8. In other words, the man must have contributed sperm to the creation of the child under Section 5, first paragraph or given consent to his spouse or cohabiting partner undergoing an assisted fertilisation under Section 8.</p>
<p>An MTF who fulfils the requirements to be established as the father under Section 5 or to be regarded as the father under Section 8 (i.e. those just stated) shall be regarded as the mother of the child. If the child has been given birth by an FTM, the same applies to a woman who has not changed gender and who has consented to her spouse, registered partner or cohabiting partner undergoing an assisted fertilisation under Section 9. A person who is regarded as a mother under this paragraph shall be covered, at the same time, by what is stated in other chapters of the Code or in other statutes about a father and paternity. This means, for instance, that the regulations in Chapter 2 of the Children and Parents Code will be applicable to the investigation of maternity in these cases.</p>
<p>The fact that an FTM shall be covered in these cases by the rules on a mother and maternity and that the opposite shall apply to an MTF means that the change of gender may need to be disclosed in cases where the person wishes to assert a particular right, benefit or obligation. In our opinion it must be the individual who decides whether or not to disclose their change of gender and to which party or parties to disclose it in such a case. An FTM who has given birth to a child and who wants to assert the rights of a mother must therefore himself disclose to the authority or party concerned that he has changed gender.</p>
<p>This part of our deliberations does not necessitate any consequential amendments to the Children and Parents Code or other statutes.</p>
<p>There have also been some problems in the health system, partly because it was not known that a pregnant FTM has the same rights as a pregnant woman. We consider that the issue here is problems of knowledge, which do not necessitate any legislative amendments. However, information measures may need to be taken to overcome these problems.</p>
<h2>Financial impacts</h2>
<p>Our deliberations are assessed as resulting in certain cost increases for the health system, pharmaceutical benefits and the Family Law and Parental Support Authority. These cost increases are chiefly a result of the proposal to permit treatments using only donated reproductive cells in the Swedish health system and the proposal to carry out information measures about surrogacy arrangements abroad.</p>
<p>The cost increases for the Swedish health system are estimated to total SEK 7–8 million. It must, in the same way as with earlier changes in this area, be up to each county council to assess how to allocate available resources on the basis of the health care priorities endorsed by the Riksdag (Swedish Parliament). It must, in other words, be up to each county council to decide whether the possi- bility of obtaining assisted fertilisation can be provided within its existing services or whether patients are to be charged for this type of treatment. The proposals are therefore not assessed, either sepa- rately or together, as affecting local self-government or raising the question of an application of the financing principle.</p>
<p>Our assessment is that the cost increase for pharmaceutical benefits, which is estimated at about SEK 1 million, can be handled within the expenditure area and that it should be possible to finance the cost increase for the Family Law and Parental Support Autho- rity, which is estimated at about SEK 2 million, within the existing appropriations for the areas affected by the commission.</p>
<p>We assess that our deliberations will only have limited impacts on municipal social services. They are therefore not assessed as affecting local self-government or raising the question of an appli- cation of the financing principle. What is said about the impacts on social services also applies to the impacts on the National Board of Health and Welfare, the Swedish Tax Agency, other agencies affected and the courts. So it should be possible to deal with any cost increases within existing financial frameworks.</p>
