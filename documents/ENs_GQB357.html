<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The Swedish Patent and Registration Office (PRV) is a central, feefinanced authority, whose principal purpose is to grant patents and register trademarks and designs, as well as to issue legal registration for limited companies, trading partnerships, sole traders, economic associations, banks and insurance companies and other forms of business enterprise where registration is needed. The authority is led by a Director-General and has a Board of Directors with limited responsibility.</p>
<p>PRV is divided into four departments, which are geographically located in three areas: the Patent Department and the Commercial Services Department in Stockholm, the Trademarks Department in Söderhamn and the Companies Department in Sundsvall. The authority’s management group is based in Stockholm. The authority has some 950 employees, almost half of whom are employed in the Companies Department.</p>
<p>SoftCare AB, a firm of business consultants, was commissioned by the Government to review the core activities of PRV in the year 2000. The main focus of the investigation was on the areas of caseprocessing, management and control, as well as on the authority’s finances. The background was the unduly long time involved in the processing of trademark and company applications and the fact that the authority’s finances were not in balance. This situation had affected customers negatively. SoftCare concluded that PRV as a whole did not operate efficiently since the common vision had become diffuse among many of its employees, the synergies in core operations were small and becoming smaller, a separate and independent corporate culture had developed in the Companies Department, financial management had become weak and the central management group functioned poorly. SoftCare therefore suggested that PRV should be divided into two separate authorities – a “Company Registration Authority” based in Sundsvall and a “Patent Authority” based in Stockholm. SoftCare did not make any concrete suggestion as to which authority the Trademarks Department should belong.</p>
<h2>The assignment</h2>
<p>Our assignment is to look more closely at the findings and consider the questions arising from SoftCare’s report. The main question is whether PRV should be divided into several authorities or re-constructed in another form. We are to investigate whether a division of PRV would solve the problems relating to caseprocessing time, financial control and management or whether other solutions would create better conditions for the separate departments and ultimately lead to improved management control. The assignment also includes analysing how a new Board of Directors or control function could be created.</p>
<h2>Considerations</h2>
<p>There are clear differences between the activities carried out by PRV’s Patent and Trademarks Departments and the Companies Department within five definable areas – case volume, caseprocessing time, clients, staff, and external networks.</p>
<p>The number of cases arriving annually at the Companies Department is nearly ten times greater than the number of cases the Patent and Trademarks Departments receive jointly. The Companies Department is also required to make decisions within very short deadlines – one to two working weeks after a case has been received. This can be compared with a period of up to three years before a patent is granted and it is not unusual for the registration of trademarks to take up to one year.</p>
<p>The majority of clients of the Patent and Trademarks Departments are represented by proxy via patent offices. Clients of the Companies Department often handle their cases themselves or through their accountants.</p>
<p>Most of the administrators at the Patent Department are engineers who are recruited from a nationwide labour market.</p>
<p>Administrators at the Companies Department are seldom required to have post-secondary education and can therefore, to a large extent, be recruited from a regional labour market. Lastly, the Companies Department is involved in many projects at national level, while the Patent and Trademarks Departments are often engaged in international projects and working groups.</p>
<p>The only areas within PRV where there appears to be synergy are in the Trademarks Department’s administration of trademark cases and the Companies Department’s administration of cases concerning company names. As the formal and material processing of these cases is similar, cooperation could achieve positive effects by harmonising case law in both departments, by sharing experience between the administrators and by making resource levelling possible when necessary. Apart from meetings related to case law once or twice a year, no other forms of cooperation have yet been initiated.</p>
<p>A glance at the rest of Europe has shown that several European countries have designated just one authority, a Patent Office, to take care of matters concerning patents, trademarks and designs. The registration of company particulars is taken care of by special authorities or by local trade councils or courts. Only Finland has a similar organisation to Sweden’s, with a combined authority for patents, trademarks, designs and company registration.</p>
<p>The administration management’s difficulties in steering PRV is, in our opinion, a consequence of the clear disparity between the authority’s various core activities. This is also the reason that a separate culture has emerged within the Companies Department. This culture has been accentuated by the geographic distance between the Companies Department and the administrative management. The control and steering problems have resulted in poor finances, which has caused the Companies Department to increase its fees and in that way has affected customers negatively. The control and steering problems have also resulted in long caseprocessing times at the Companies Department as well as at the Trademarks Department.</p>
<h2>Proposal</h2>
<p>In order to solve the problems with management and financial control, we have considered two main alternatives for the future organisation of PRV. (1) PRV remains a unified authority but with considerably strengthened financial control and management functions. This can be achieved with the placement of a Deputy  Director-General in Sundsvall and with the Board of Directors receiving full responsibility for the authority. (2) PRV is divided into a “Companies Authority” and a “Patent Authority”. Each of these authorities will have a  Director-General and be led by a Board of Directors which has full responsibility for the authority.</p>
<p>The advantages  of allowing PRV to remain as a unified authority, but with the financial control and management functions considerably strengthened, are as follows.</p>
<p>N  Control of the Companies Department would be strengthened to a lower cost than the cost related to the alternative of dividing PRV into two separate entities. The personnel need only be strengthened by the now existing department head being replaced by a Deputy DirectorGeneral.</p>
<p>N  Giving the Board of Directors full responsibility for the authority would enable the recruitment of competent persons with wide experience from the industry as board members, persons who could pass on their experience to the authority operations. Customer needs could thus be picked up at an early stage. Experience has shown that committed board members with wide responsibility provide a strengthened management function, increased operational focus in questions of strategy and a general heightening of the quality of boardroom work.</p>
<p>N  The cases concerning trademarks and company names would remain within the same authority. This would create opportunities for harmonising case law within the Trademarks and Companies Departments, for the sharing of experience between case administrators and also the possibility of resource levelling when necessary.</p>
<p>The disadvantages  of allowing PRV to remain as a unified authority, but with the financial control and management functions considerably strengthened, are as follows.</p>
<p>N  There is no guarantee that the culture which has developed in Sundsvall will in fact disappear. The Deputy DirectorGeneral should act as an extension to central management but may face difficulties in working towards centralised control if the culture is deeply rooted throughout the unit.</p>
<p>N  The model would still mean long decision making paths due to the location of central management in Stockholm.</p>
<p>The advantages  of dividing PRV into two separate authorities, each of which would have a Director-General and would be led by a Board of Directors, are as follows.</p>
<p>N  When the Companies Department becomes an independent authority, the problems with control and management are expected to disappear. Opportunities for local solutions and short decision paths which provide increased efficiency would be created, thus benefiting the customers. Staff would be closer to the decision-making processes and could thereby affect the core operations, which should result in better customer service.</p>
<p>N  The organisation of the Companies Department would be similar to that of other countries in the European Union where a special authority takes care of company registration.</p>
<p>N  The advantages with the Board of Directors would be the same as in alternative (1).</p>
<p>The disadvantages  we have found with the proposal to divide PRV into two authorities are as follows.</p>
<p>N  The cases concerning trademarks and company names would be split between two separate authorities. However, it should be noted that the synergies that exist between these case types have not yet been utilised to any great effect.</p>
<p>N  This proposal would entail higher costs than those associated with alternative (1). This is, among other things, due to the fact that each authority would have its own management and control functions.</p>
<p>We propose that PRV should be divided according to alternative 2. In our opinion, the differences in core operations are now so great that there is no reason to keep PRV’s activities together. Through the proposed division, the operations would be made more efficient, case-processing times reduced and customer service improved. Customer needs could be picked up at an early stage when the Board of Directors at the “Companies Authority” and the “Patent Authority” receive full responsibility, provided that the business sector is well represented on the boards. This form of management should result in more committed board members, strengthened management authority, increased focus on strategic questions and a general rise in the standard of boardroom work.</p>
<h2>Financial consequences</h2>
<p>We do not consider that the proposal to divide PRV into two authorities would entail any increased costs for the new “Companies Authority”. As regards the “Patent Authority”, we estimate the division would lead to a cost increase of approximately five million Swedish crowns per annum. This cost could, however, be absorbed within the framework of existing operations by means of the continued rationalisation of support functions. It should therefore not affect the fee level in either of the two authorities.</p>
