<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>Our remit was to survey how the Swedish Migration Board’s decisions are formulated and how they are perceived by individual parties, higher instances and other agencies. The remit included submitting proposals, on the basis of the survey, for how the formulation of the Migration Board’s decisions could be improved.</p>
<p>We have also had the task of deciding whether there is reason to further improve how the migration courts’ and the Migration Court of Appeal’s judgments and decisions are formulated, beyond the work that is already under way. The point of departure for this assessment was the survey and proposals concerning the Migration Board’s decisions.</p>
<p>According to the terms of reference, the Inquiry is to present its findings in such a way that they can provide a platform for continued work on these issues by the Migration Board and the National Courts Administration.</p>
<h2>Decisions of the Swedish Migration Board</h2>
<p>Legislative provisions for the formulation of Migration Board decisions</p>
<p>From a linguistic point of view, the formulation of Migration Board decisions is affected by the provisions of the Language Act (2009:600) which states that public administration is to use language that is cultivated, simple and comprehensible. Also important for the formulation of decisions are the general provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (1986:223) on the processing of matters and on how administrative authorities are to formulate their decisions.</p>
<p>For decisions on certain special migration matters, the Aliens Act (2005:716) contains special provisions on the obligation to state reasons. Chapter 13, Section 10 of the Aliens Act states that a decision must be in writing and contain the reasons on which the decision is based. This applies to decisions on residence permits, but also decisions concerning travel documents, status declaration, refusal-of-entry or expulsion. The Aliens Act does not contain any more precise guidelines on more detailed reasons for a decision.</p>
<p>Limitations of the Inquiry’s work</p>
<p>Every year, the Migration Board issues over 200 000 decisions. These decisions are attributable to various parts of the Board’s activities and divided into different categories. Our remit was not limited to decisions from only one or some of these categories. But in our view, there were objective reasons for us to focus on decisions from a few different categories. We therefore opted in our Inquiry to concentrate on decisions concerning residence permits on grounds of a need for protection and on grounds of personal ties, as well as decisions concerning unaccompanied minors.</p>
<p>There were several reasons for limiting our closer examination to these particular categories. One reason was that our remit to survey how Migration Board decisions are perceived by applicants, higher instances and other agencies meant that the decisions we examined should be decisions that are appealed in the special system for hearings and appeals made up of the migration courts and the Migration Court of Appeal. They should also be decisions that are often appealed and that regularly have recipients among groups other than the higher instances. We have also sought to focus on decisions that may contain reasoning concerning the children’s perspective and the situation in the applicant’s country of origin. We also considered that it was important to choose categories of decisions that are often the subject of media and public interest.</p>
<p>Work on writing decisions at the Swedish Migration Board</p>
<p>To be able to determine how the formulation of Migration Board decisions could be improved and how the Board can continue its work on these issues, it is necessary to be aware of the key aspects involved in writing decisions at the Migration Board. Matters in our focus categories are decided on once a case officer has drawn up a written proposal for a decision and the decision has been made by an official – a decision maker. Decisions are written in one of the Migration Board’s decision templates.</p>
<p>Migration Board staff who write decisions are given internal drafting courses. These courses take place within the framework of the training programme ‘The Migration Programme’. The Migration Board is currently reviewing its training needs and the design of drafting courses, among others. The Migration Board’s language planning work is undergoing change and just over a year ago the Board employed a special language adviser.</p>
<h2>Judgments and decisions of the migration courts and the Migration Court of Appeal</h2>
<p>Legislative provisions for the formulation of judgments and decisions</p>
<p>The formulation of judgments and decisions by the administrative courts is not regulated in law to any great extent. As is the case with Migration Board decisions, the Language Act requires the language to be cultivated, simple and comprehensible. Further, the Administrative Court Procedure Act (1971:291) states that the reasons that have determined the outcome of a matter must be stated in the decision (see Section 30). Certain requirements concerning the details that must be included in a judgment or a decision are also included in Section 32 of the Ordinance on record keeping, etc. at the administrative courts (1979:575). This ordinance states that a judgment or a decision is to contain details of the parties’ claims and objections.</p>
<p>Efforts to improve the formulation of the courts’ judgments and decisions</p>
<p>The report by the Inquiry on Public Trust, Greater trust in the courts – strategies and proposals  (SOU 2008:106), is an important starting point for work on judgment writing at Swedish courts. The Inquiry proposed that the National Courts Administration should draw up uniform and long-term strategies for improvement efforts. The</p>
<p>National Courts Administration has produced such a strategy for writing judgments and an action plan for implementing the strategy. Efforts are ongoing under the auspices of the National Courts Administration to implement the strategy.</p>
<p>The three administrative courts that are migration courts and the Administrative Court of Appeal in Stockholm – the Migration Court of Appeal – are all working on issues to do with writing judgments. The courts have examined their own decisions, sought opinions from various categories of recipients of judgments and decisions, and in several cases organised training for staff who write decisions.</p>
<h2>Survey of how the Swedish Migration Board’s decisions are formulated</h2>
<p>Carrying out the survey</p>
<p>To survey how Migration Board decisions on migration matters are formulated, we conducted a systematic analysis of decisions from the Board. We requested fifty decisions chosen at random but according to certain precise criteria. Thirty of the decisions concerned residence permits on grounds of a need for protection, ten decisions concerned residence permits on grounds of personal ties and ten decisions concerned unaccompanied minors. We requested both decisions to grant and reject a residence permit, and the selection criteria included the requirement that there should be a representative spread of factors such as the applicant’s gender, age and country of origin, as well as divisions at the Migration Board where the decision was taken.</p>
<p>We examined the decisions on the basis of the legal reasoning in them and their readability and comprehensibility. To aid the examination, we drew up criteria for the analysis that the Inquiry’s legal experts used to carry out a systematic assessment of the decisions.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s language expert, Maria Sundin, analysed the decisions from a comprehensibility perspective, based on the recommendations for agency decisions drawn up by the Language Council of Sweden. She has written her conclusions in a special report contained in an annex to this report.</p>
<p>Results of the survey</p>
<p>Our survey of how the Migration Board’s decisions are formulated showed that they often fall short in terms of structure. The information provided in the decisions is written in a way that makes the decisions difficult to understand. A recipient who wants to know why  the Migration Board has made a particular assessment is forced in such cases to look for information in several places in one decision. The shortcomings in terms of structure may also be evident in that the Migration Board’s evaluations may be mixed with other information on the matter, which makes it difficult to see clearly what the Board’s actual reasons for the decision are and what refers to other matters. In some decisions, the applicable legal provisions, the applicant’s reasons for applying and his or her own account, as well as the Migration Board’s actual reasons for the decision are contained under one and the same heading. In such cases, there are often no clear transitions between the various parts of the text and it is not obvious what belongs to which part of the content.</p>
<p>The graphic formulation of the decisions is not consistent. Heading levels are not always used logically and the headings are too few. Moreover, the heading does not always reflect the text below it.</p>
<p>The Migration Board’s decisions also fall short in terms of the legal reasoning. Relevant arguments are often presented, but they are of a general nature and are not applied to the specific case in question. One clear example is the much-used reason concerning written documents, which states that they are ‘of a simple nature and of little probative value’. This kind of formulation does not provide sufficient information to the applicant, who probably wants a more thorough explanation of why his or her documents are not considered to be of probative value. Moreover, detailed explanations are often lacking concerning the conclusions that the available country information has led to for the individual applicant. The legal reasoning concerning the children’s perspective is another example of when the reasons for a decision often only touch on an issue superficially. In many cases, the decision simply refers to what is stated on the issue in the Aliens Act and includes a short sentence to say that the child’s needs have been taken into account.</p>
<p>In many respects, the formulation of decisions is not sufficiently tailored to the recipient. From a language perspective, decisions contain a mix of different styles. It is often clear that parts of the text have been taken from other texts and cut and pasted into the decision. Consequently, decisions sometimes contain both a formal style using highfalutin officialese and a more colloquial style. One shortcoming of many decisions is that they have not been proofread carefully enough.</p>
<h2>Survey of how the Swedish Migration Board’s decisions are perceived</h2>
<p>Carrying out the survey</p>
<p>To survey how the applicants perceive the decisions of the Migration Board, we approached public counsels. By interviewing a number of counsels, it was possible to identify potential difficulties applicants may have in reading and understanding decisions. A total of 28 interviews were conducted. The survey was carried out using a qualitative method in the form of in-depth interviews. Markör Marknad & Kommunikation AB was commissioned to conduct the interviews.</p>
<p>The Inquiry Chair and the Inquiry Secretary visited the migration courts and the Migration Court of Appeal to find out how these higher instances perceive decisions by the Migration Board.</p>
<p>We also approached other agencies, such as the Swedish Police and the Transport Service of the Swedish Prison and Probation Service, to find out how these agencies perceive the Migration Board’s decisions.</p>
<p>How do applicants perceive the Migration Board’s decisions?</p>
<p>Our survey of how applicants – the people applying for residence permits, etc. – perceive the Migration Board’s decisions has shown that the applicants who have public counsel are able, on the whole, to understand the decision. However, they often ask for more detailed reasons for the decision and would like to see a line of reasoning that is better adapted to their personal case and that would explain why the Migration Board’s assessment has led to that particular outcome in their particular case. The formulation of the reasons for the decision is important, especially as the public counsels’ ability to explain to applicants what the decisive factor was is affected by how well the reasons have been expressed. If the legal reasoning is too brief, the counsels will be less able to explain to applicants what the decisive factor for the Migration Board was. It has also emerged that long and complex legal reasoning can be difficult to communicate to applicants.</p>
<p>How do the higher instances and other agencies perceive the Swedish Migration Board’s decisions?</p>
<p>By and large, the migration courts and the Migration Court of Appeal have a positive view of the Swedish Migration Board’s decisions. However, they think that decisions could be improved in terms of structure. The courts have also stressed the importance of welldeveloped reasons for the Migration Board’s assessment. Explanations of applicable law and more general country information should have a less prominent position in favour of clearer and more detailed reasoning concerning the Migration Board’s assessment of a case.</p>
<p>The Swedish Police has stated that it is very important in enforcement cases that the Migration Board’s decision clearly states the considerations concerning an applicant’s identity and the country to which the decision on refusal-of-entry or expulsion applies. The Transport Service of the Swedish Prison and Probation Service did not have any specific opinions on the formulation of Migration Board decisions.</p>
<h2>How can the formulation of Migration Board decisions be improved?</h2>
<p>Basis for our considerations</p>
<p>A starting point for our considerations on how the formulation of Migration Board decisions could be improved was that the Migration Board must work actively on this to successfully improve the quality of its decisions. Therefore, our considerations mainly consist of overall recommendations for how the Migration Board can continue its work in this area rather than detailed proposals for what Migration Board decisions should  look like.</p>
<p>There are many different recipients of Migration Board decisions. The most important category of recipient by far is applicants, and the Board’s decisions should therefore be formulated based on the perspective and needs of the applicants. The way in which decisions are tailored to recipients needs to be reviewed and improved, e.g. in terms of the information included, the structure, the formulation of the reasons for the decision and the language used.</p>
<p>The detailed formulation of Migration Board decisions</p>
<p>In our assessment, the Migration Board’s efforts to improve the formulation of its decisions should cover certain specific aspects of the decisions.</p>
<p>Migration Board decisions should have a uniform visual formulation. This should cover the graphic formulation and also the headings, which should be consistent in terms of how the different heading levels are marked and how the headings are formulated. The Migration Board should also consider using more subheadings. The formulation of the operative part of decisions should be reviewed and the Migration Board should draw up guidelines for how the operative part should be formulated.</p>
<p>The structure of decisions should be reviewed. When doing this, the Migration Board should consider using a technique whereby the parts of the decision that are most important to the applicant are placed early on in the text. Different parts of a decision should be clearly separated so that it is obvious, for example, what is a description of the applicant’s information and what is the Migration Board’s analysis of the information.</p>
<p>The Migration Board should strive to make the language in decisions cultivated, simple, comprehensible and tailored to the recipient. This requires the linguistic style to be simpler and easier to understand than is currently the case. Where technical terms cannot be avoided, their meaning should be explained.</p>
<p>We consider that the applicant’s name should be used in the decision. This is more appropriate than addressing the applicant directly with the word ‘you’ in a decision.</p>
<p>One step towards tailoring decisions to recipients is to only include in a decision the text that is intended for the main recipient, i.e. the applicant. This is particularly clear concerning descriptions of applicable law. When writing decisions, the Migration Board should consider giving only a brief description of the legislation that is relevant to the case and creating an annex to the decision containing the current legal provisions in their entirety.</p>
<p>The legal reasoning in decisions should be a high priority in the Migration Board’s continued work on formulating decisions. The reasons for the Migration Board’s assessment in a case should be stated clearly, and the reasons for the decision should give the applicant an answer to the question: Why was this the outcome?  The legal reasoning should be the focus of the decision, and both the children’s perspective and the way in which the country information was dealt with should be clearer in Migration Board decisions.</p>
<p>The Migration Board should draw up clear guidelines for how decisions are to be formulated in cases concerning several applicants who, in one way or another, are dealt with together. In our view, such cases should be determined with a decision covering all the applicants. Exceptions must be made in cases where secrecy applies between the applicants.</p>
<p>The Migration Board’s continued work on improving its decisions</p>
<p>One prerequisite for the Migration Board to successfully improve the quality of its decisions is that it works actively on these issues. The Migration Board is best placed to determine the forms this work should take. Certain key points are especially important in this change process.</p>
<p>Migration Board staff who write decisions should receive training in this. The Migration Board is already working on developing training for those concerned and this should continue. This training should be obligatory for staff who write decisions.</p>
<p>Migration Board decisions are often written using different templates and the Board is working on a new system for using templates. This work should continue and the Migration Board should consider whether the initiative to create new or revised templates could come from the language adviser at the Migration Board.</p>
<p>Language planning matters should be a priority for the Migration Board. These matters should be given higher status within the organisation than currently appears to be the case. One way of achieving this is to place language planning high up in the Migration Board’s organisational structure.</p>
<p>One method for streamlining decision-writing is to produce common guidelines for the formulation of decisions. Rapporteurs who produce proposals for decisions should be able to comply with these guidelines and not tailor decisions to suit individual decision makers’ wishes.</p>
<p>Irrespective of how the Migration Board chooses to organise efforts to improve the formulation of decisions, this work must be pursued systematically over time. The change process should be managed in a permanent structure and not in project form. Quality improvement is a continuous process and the Migration Board should regularly investigate how the formulation of decisions affects applicants’ ability to understand decisions.</p>
<p>Applicants often do not have a command of Swedish and therefore require help to understand decisions. Regarding applicants’ ability to understand decisions, we consider that two key factors are of primary importance: how applicants are informed about decisions and how interpretation works. In its efforts to improve the formulation of decisions, the Migration Board should consider these matters too.</p>
<h2>Are additional measures needed to improve the formulation of judgments and decisions of the migration courts and the Migration Court of Appeal?</h2>
<p>The courts that decide on migration cases are all actively involved in improving the formulation of their judgments and decisions. These courts, just like any other courts in Sweden, must report on their work to the National Courts Administration no later than 31 December 2014. Not until the current work has been completed, reported and evaluated will it be possible to determine how this work should continue. Our considerations concerning Migration Board decisions do not, therefore, call for any change in the work on judgment writing currently under way at the migration courts and the Migration Court of Appeal. However, many of the linguistic viewpoints we have presented concerning the formulation of Migration Board decisions can also be applied to how the courts write their judgments.</p>
<p>Yet for the courts, we have first and foremost drawn attention to one issue, namely that there are differences in how the migration courts apply secrecy rules. This means that different judgment-</p>
<p>writing techniques are used. However, the problem does not primarily concern judgment writing. We have therefore concluded that the issue does not fall within the framework of our terms of reference. We have highlighted the issue but not submitted any proposals in this regard.</p>
