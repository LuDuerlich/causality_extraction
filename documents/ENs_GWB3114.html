<h1>Summary of the Inquiry’s proposals</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes the introduction of a financial support requirement as a condition for family member immigration. Under this requirement, the sponsor, i.e. the person already in Sweden, will have to have a sufficient income to support himself or herself and have suitable accommodation at his or her disposal for himself or herself and for the family members who want to settle in Sweden. As long as the sponsor is of working age, the income, in principle, is to come from his or her own work as an employee or entrepreneur.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has developed its proposals on the basis, apart from its terms of reference, of Directive 2003/86/EC on the right to family reunification, generally known as the Family Reunification Directive, TPF FPT  which allows EU Member States to make immigration of family members conditional on the sponsor having stable and regular resources and suitable accommodation. All EU countries except Sweden have introduced some form of financial support requirement as a condition for the immigration of family members.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the financial support requirement apply to sponsors who are third country nationals or stateless. However, the financial support requirement is not to be made a condition for the immigration of family members of refugees, quota refugees, or people otherwise in need of protection who have a well-founded fear of capital punishment or torture or who need protection because of external or internal armed conflict. TPF FPT  In addition, the financial support requirement will not apply if the sponsor is a child.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a general exemption from the financial support requirement will be made in the case of immigration of family members of a person who has spent at least four years in Sweden with a permanent residence permit. Other exemptions will also be possible in cases where there are exceptional grounds. As is the case in other EU states with which the Inquiry has been in contact, the Inquiry does not propose any general exemption for children. In assessing whether there are exceptional grounds, the Inquiry does however point out that the provision on the best interests of the child in Chapter 1, Section 10 of the Aliens Act (2005:716) may entail that circumstances relating to the child do not need to be as serious and weighty as is required in the case of an adult.</p>
<p>Why should there be a financial support requirement?</p>
<p>Sweden is a country of immigration. Most of the people granted residence permits in Sweden have immigrated as family members. High net immigration is to the advantage of a small country like Sweden but also requires the successful and speedy integration of new arrivals, a process in which both individuals and society must play their part. There are obvious advantages if family member immigration is planned so that accommodation are available when the family member arrives in the country. Unplanned family member immigration places a great strain on both society and individual people, particularly children.</p>
<p>According to information from Malmö, Botkyrka and Göteborg, many new arrivals today have a very problematic housing situation, which affects children in particular. Many asylum seekers and other new arrivals choose to settle in a municipality where they have a social network. Many lodge with relatives or friends, or rent accommodation with insecure forms of tenure that can lead to them having to move frequently and at short notice. The housing situation becomes particularly acute when family members arrive in the country. Many newly arrived families with children have to live in overcrowded conditions. This overcrowding affects not only the new arrivals but also the host families who let them share their accommodation. The insecure housing situation poses special problems for children. The housing segregation also makes it more difficult for new arrivals to establish themselves in the labour market.</p>
<p>The prime purpose of introducing a financial support requirement as a condition for the immigration of family members is to promote the integration of both the sponsor and the family member. The financial support requirement aims to create incentives for working and self-support. The Inquiry does not doubt that the great majority of new arrivals wish to start working as soon as possible after arriving in the country. However, the housing situation of new arrivals and housing segregation make it difficult for many new arrivals to establish themselves in the labour market. The financial support requirement aims to give new arrivals an incentive to settle in municipalities where there are good opportunities for them to obtain work and accommodation of their own. The financial support requirement will ensure that newly arrived family members obtain properly organised accommodation with secure tenure directly after arriving in the country. In addition, the newly arrived family members will come to a person living in this country who has become integrated in society in the sense that he or she has accommodation of his or her own and a job, which will simplify the integration of the newly arrived family members themselves.</p>
<p>The purpose of the financial support requirement is for new arrivals to enter into a state of inclusion instead of exclusion.</p>
<p>Who will be covered by a financial support requirement?</p>
<p>The financial support requirement does not change the current rules on family member immigration in any way except that a financial support requirement is established as a general rule as a condition for the immigration of family members.</p>
<p>Since the purpose of the financial support requirement is to promote integration by increasing incentives for people to obtain work, earn their own living and move to municipalities where they have a good chance of obtaining work and a place of their own to live, the basic principle is that as many people as possible will be covered by the financial support requirement. As a general rule, the financial support requirement will cover everyone who can apply for a residence permit on the grounds of personal ties, which includes spouses, partners and children. In addition, as a general rule, everyone who can be a sponsor under Chapter 5, Section 3 or 3a of the Aliens Act will be covered by the financial support requirement. However, a number of exemptions to this rule are envisaged.</p>
<p>There will be a general exemption for family members who apply for a residence permit on grounds of personal ties to someone who has been in Sweden with a permanent residence permit for four years. This means a maximum time limit will be introduced for when a residence permit can be granted to family members without reference to the financial support requirement. In accordance with its basic principles, the Inquiry also proposes that the financial support requirement should not apply as a condition for the immigration of family members of Swedish citizens.</p>
<p>The Inquiry is also of the opinion that an exemption from the financial support requirement should be made if the sponsor is a national of an EU state, an EEA state or Switzerland. This is due to the fact that no real interest is served by letting the financial support requirement apply to nationals of an EU state, an EEA state or Switzerland. This is because there are special rules on right of residence and residence permits for such nationals and their family members, requiring in principle that the national concerned is professionally active or has other means of support. Moreover, it would be against the principle of equal treatment laid down by Community law to let the rules that apply to the granting of residence permits to family members under Chapter 5, Section 3 or 3a of the Aliens Act differ depending on whether the reference is to ties to a Swedish citizen or to a national of another EU state.</p>
<p>An exemption from the financial support requirement will also be made if the sponsor is a child. Furthermore, refugees and certain categories of people otherwise in need of protection will be exempted from the financial support requirement. The Inquiry considers that those people otherwise in need of protection who should be exempted are people granted a residence permit on the grounds that they feel a well-founded fear of capital punishment or of being subjected to corporal punishment, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or on grounds of external or internal armed conflict. TPF FPT  Under the Family Reunification Directive, as a general rule a financial support requirement may not be made a condition for the reunification of a spouse and underage children with a refugee. The Qualification Directive TPF FPT  prescribes that people</p>
<p>otherwise in need of protection who are covered by the Directive (people with subsidiary protection status) are to be guaranteed certain rights similar to those accruing to refugees. The Inquiry considers that people who are regarded as being in need of protection according to the Directive should be treated in the same way as refugees with regard to the financial support requirement as well.</p>
<p>The Inquiry is also of the opinion that there may be situations in which there is reason to grant an exemption from the financial support requirement. The Inquiry proposes a possibility of exemptions in cases where there are exceptional grounds. Such grounds may exist, for example, if the sponsor has a protracted impairment of his or her ability to work because of illness. Exceptional grounds for granting an exemption from the financial support requirement can also be found to exist in view of the living conditions of a child applying for a residence permit under Chapter 5, Section 3 or 3a of the Aliens Act. The Inquiry recalls that the provision in the Aliens Act concerning the best interests of the child is to be taken into account in making this assessment.</p>
<p>Substance of the financial support requirement</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes as a general rule that a financial support requirement should be made a condition for an alien being granted a residence permit on the grounds of personal ties under Chapter 5, Section 3 or 3a of the Aliens Act. The financial support requirement is directed towards the sponsor in this country and means that he or she must have economic resources that are sufficient for his or her own maintenance and must have at his or her disposal suitable accommodation for himself or herself and for the person (family member) who is applying for a residence permit.</p>
<p>The examination of whether the financial support requirement is met will take place only in connection with examination of whether the residence permit application is to be granted on grounds of personal ties under Chapter 5, Section 3 or 3a of the Aliens Act. After a residence permit has been granted no further control is to be made of whether the sponsor meets the financial support requirement.</p>
<p>who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted, OJ L 304, 30.9.2004, p. 12, Celex 32004L0083.</p>
<p>The principle is that the sponsor will be considered to have an adequate financial support capacity if he or she has regular income from work of a certain permanence corresponding to the level of the reserve amount for a single person specified in the norms for an attachment of earnings order under the Swedish Enforcement Code, which presently stands at SEK 4 734 per month, plus requisite funds to cover his or her own housing expenses. The sponsor is to have accommodation at his or her disposal, for example, owneroccupied or rented accommodation. If the sponsor is renting accommodation, he or she must have a valid lease or sublease of a certain permanence. The assessment of whether the accommodation is suitable for the sponsor and the applicant (the family member) is to be based on the National Board of Health and Welfare’s General Advice on Financial Support, TPF FPT  concerning norms for reasonable housing standards in connection with a change of accommodation.</p>
<p>Hence, the financial support requirement does not mean that the sponsor has to support his or her family members. The financial support requirement the Inquiry proposes therefore differs substantially from the financial support requirement that applies under the Family Reunification Directive and the financial support requirements laid down as conditions for granting a right of residence or a residence permit to family members of nationals from EEA states and EU states and for granting third country nationals permanent resident status in Sweden.</p>
<p>Other matters</p>
<p>As already stated, the purpose of the financial support requirement is to increase incentives for people to obtain work and support themselves. Consequently, even if the purpose is not to increase society’s revenue it has become clear that society will gain substantially if the financial support requirement leads to people moving from benefit dependence to self-support. The reform will be economically justified (i.e. the revenue is higher than the costs) even if only a small proportion of the sponsors who are now wholly dependent on financial support become self-supporting.</p>
