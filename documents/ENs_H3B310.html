<p>Remit</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit was as follows:</p>
<p> to review the present Swedish legislation on maritime boundaries;</p>
<p> to review the baselines;</p>
<p> to propose a revised outer limit of Swedish territorial waters;</p>
<p> to propose the establishment of a contiguous zone in all or part of the waters adjacent to the Swedish territorial sea; and</p>
<p> to propose any legislative amendments that may result from the inquiry.</p>
<p>Updated baselines and revised territorial boundary</p>
<p>This report presents proposals for updated baselines along the Swedish coast (chapter 3) and a revised territorial boundary at sea (chapter 4). All baselines have been determined in accordance with generally accepted international law, including the provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Most proposed baselines differ only marginally from the present baselines. The ratio between normal baselines and straight baselines is almost identical to the present ratio. Consequently, the proposed revised Swedish territorial boundary at sea is closely aligned to the present boundary. In several instances the breadth of the territorial sea is considerably less than 12 nautical miles due to the proximity of territorial waters or maritime zones of neighbouring States.</p>
<p>The baselines are drawn between base points located on the low water line along the coast, on islands and on certain low-tide eleva- tions. Points on some low-tide elevations outside the baselines have also been used to calculate the breadth of the Swedish terri- torial sea.</p>
<p>The outer limit of the Swedish territorial sea has been calculated in accordance with generally accepted international law, including the provisions of UNCLOS.</p>
<p>All points are identified by geographical coordinates expressed in the Swedish reference system SWEREF 99. Heights and depths are measured in the Swedish reference system RH 2000. An average low water line has been established at the level of -0,5 meters along the whole of the Swedish coast. This sea level has been calculated by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) on the basis of continuous observations at its 23 permanent measuring stations along the coast over a period of 30 years, taking into account the rate of land rise.</p>
<p>The geographical coordinates for each point have been deter- mined after geodetic field surveys by the Swedish Maritime Administration covering a large number of potential sites identified from aerial photographs taken at an altitude of 3 000 metres by Lantmäteriet and other available material.</p>
<p>Establishment of a contiguous zone</p>
<p>The report also proposes an act that will establish a contiguous zone outside the Swedish territorial sea limit in accordance with article 33 of UNCLOS (chapter 5). The zone extends no more than 24 nautical miles from the baselines, i.e. no more than 12 nautical miles beyond the territorial sea limit. In several places its breadth is less than 12 nautical miles due to the proximity of territorial waters or maritime zones of neighbouring States. The purpose of the new zone is to enable Sweden to exercise the control necessary to prevent and punish infringement of its customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws and regulations within its territory as well as to protect archaeological and historical objects found at sea within that zone.</p>
<p>Continental shelf and economic zone</p>
<p>The report presents updated geographical coordinates for the outer limits of Sweden’s continental shelf and economic zone respectively (chapter 6). These coordinates have, when necessary, been converted into SWEREF 99 from the various other reference systems used in agreements with neighbouring States on the delimitation of the continental shelf and/or the economic zone.</p>
<p>A new comprehensive act</p>
<p>The report reviews some of the background to the existing legisla- tion on the lines of delimitation of Sweden’s internal waters, terri- torial sea, continental shelf and economic zone. It is proposed that a new comprehensive act on Sweden’s territorial waters and mari- time zones replace the present Act concerning the Territorial Waters of Sweden (1966:374) as well as certain sections of the Act on the Continental Shelf (1966:314) and the Swedish Economic Zone Act (1992:1140), (sections 3.2.4, 4.5 and 6.2.5).</p>
<p>The main objective of the new act is to unite all provisions on the geographical extent of Sweden’s internal waters, territorial sea, contiguous zone, continental shelf and economic zone in a single comprehensive legal instrument, so as to provide a concerted view of these provisions and to facilitate and improve their implemen- tation. The geographical coordinates of the lines of delimitation of the respective sea areas are listed in five separate annexes to the new act.</p>
<p>Under the new act, the baselines, the territorial boundary and the lines of delimitation of the maritime zones will be shown on nautical charts and all geographical coordinates will be freely available to download from an official website.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the report proposes a number of amendments to other Swedish laws to take into account consequences and effects of the new comprehensive act on Sweden’s territorial waters and maritime zones and the new act on the establishment of a con- tiguous zone.</p>
<p>The report notes a need to improve the capacity of relevant government bodies to manage and administer issues related to Sweden’s maritime boundaries. It is therefore proposed that the responsibility for all legislation on the geographical extent of Sweden’s territorial waters and maritime zones, and all issues related to updating and implementing that legislation shall be assigned to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>The necessary technical support to the Ministry also requires strengthening. At present, the Swedish Maritime Administration and Lantmäteriet each provide such support on an ad hoc  basis. As a result, certain technical revisions and the regular joint reviews of the entire Swedish-Norwegian and Swedish-Finnish borders have not been conducted in a timely fashion in accordance with agreed schedules. The report highlights this problem but does not present any proposals (chapter 3).</p>
<p>Proposals related to property law</p>
<p>The report also provides an analysis of the historical background to the Swedish State’s present rights as regards ‘common water’ at sea and in Sweden’s four largest lakes (chapter 8). It reviews the legislation on how to distinguish ‘common water’ from privately or publicly owned water property, as well as the issue of the State’s right of ownership/right of disposal over ‘common water’ (chapter 7).</p>
<p>The report proposes to clarify the present legal position by pro- viding legislation that explicitly lays down the Swedish State’s right of disposal over ‘common water’ as well as its right to charge a fee when it decides to grant the right to use ‘common water’ for economic or other activities to a private or public entity.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the ongoing implementation of the new Swedish reference system for heights and depths, RH 2000, certain other amendments are proposed to the legislation on how to dis- tinguish ‘common water’ from privately or publicly owned water property at sea and in the four lakes.</p>
<p>A new act is also proposed to provide compensation to those who suffer financial loss due to the amended rules is.</p>
