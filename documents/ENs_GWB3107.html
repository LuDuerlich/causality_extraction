<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Our general view</h2>
<p>The Swedish Government and Riksdag (parliament) have stated that the National Pension Funds – the AP-funds – are to administer allocations in such a way as to ensure the greatest possible benefit to the pension system. The aim is a high rate of return in the long term in relation to the investment risk. The funds are not to be used for the achievement of industrial policy or economic policy goals. The AP-funds are, however, required to take environmental and ethical considerations into account in their investment activities without deviating from the overall objective of a high rate of return. The task of the present committee has been to evaluate how the funds have lived up to their obligations in this respect and the way this has been reflected in their corporate governance.</p>
<p>In our view, the AP-funds have dealt commendably with this task. However, it is desirable that the assignment be more closely defined and that working methods be further improved. In future, the funds should work more proactively and seek to integrate sustainability aspects into the investment management process. To consolidate and strengthen confidence, the funds’ governing boards should adopt, follow up and communicate a set of basic values or principles for how the funds should operate. Further resources need to be set aside for the purpose of analysing and following up the governing boards’ governance practices. Finally, the AP-funds’ governing boards should be appointed on the basis of a professional nomination process.</p>
<h2>The work so far</h2>
<p>In recent years, interest in what is usually referred to as “sustainable” or “responsible” investment has increased significantly among institutional investors both in Sweden and abroad. Extensive international cooperation has developed, partly within the UN, where the AP-funds have played an active role. A wide range of terms and designations are used in this sphere. We have chosen to confine ourselves principally to the term ESG (Environment, Social, Governance) , which is internationally established and which in our view best encompasses both the role of the AP-funds and our own remit.</p>
<p>This area of activity is still developing rapidly. Nevertheless, fairly extensive research has been conducted internationally on ESG impact and it would seem that taking ESG-factors into consideration is more likely to boost than to reduce returns, although it is difficult to draw any unequivocal conclusions in this respect. The various funds have to some extent chosen different approaches and profiles when working in this area, and have developed methods and procedures both jointly and separately. The efforts of some of the funds have attracted international attention. Returns on the AP-funds’ investments have not had any demonstrably adverse effects, and administrative costs have been kept down. In a number of cases, the activities of the AP funds – and of other investors – have led to improvements in the enterprises owned by the funds and also to closer consideration of environmental and ethical issues in these enterprises.</p>
<p>While the AP-funds have worked well in this sphere, there is potential for further growth and improvement in some respects. The committee would, however, like to begin by making clear that the basic task of the funds – to help ensure good pension levels through high returns, which in turn ensures the wellbeing of pensioners both present and future – is in itself a fundamental ethical objective.</p>
<h2>Our proposals</h2>
<p>1. The funds’ overall objective is to create security in the national pension system. This is to be achieved by means of high rates of return in the long term. Without deviating from this overall objective, the funds are also required to consider environ- mental, ethical and other sustainability aspects. This can be made clear by incorporating the provisions regarding ESG consideration – which have hitherto been present only in the preparatory material – into the relevant law, i.e. the Public Pension Funds Act (2000:192).</p>
<p>2. The problems that have beset the international finance markets in the autumn of 2008 have made abundantly clear the impor- tance of confidence in financial activities. For institutions like the  AP-funds public confidence  is even more crucial. Pensions management is a complicated field of activity that most people are unable to follow and assess in detail. Where knowledge fails, confidence must take over, and confidence is built on factors such as levels of skill, transparency and integrity. The funds must proceed from this perception in their working methods, organisation and communication.</p>
<p>3. The funds must define a set of principles or  basic values  on which to base their activities, incorporating ESG aspects. This will involve formulating clearly and coherently the key values that are to inform the way they proceed in their investment activities. For the AP funds – which act on behalf of all Swedish citizens – these basic values must be communicable and must have broad public support. A natural starting point for the development of such values is the perspective of agency reflected in the Swedish Constitution's Instrument of Govern- ment – aiming to promote the freedom and welfare of citizens so as to enable them to act independently, and to support them in this endeavour. This also includes ensuring a good environ- ment for present and future generations. The international conventions that Sweden has signed represent a practical expression of these basic values and may therefore be viewed as further starting points for the funds’ work on developing a set of fundamental principles. The funds should actively commu- nicate their basic values to the public and describe how these govern their investment activities.</p>
<p>4. We take the view that ESG aspects represent both risks and opportunities that can be confronted and exploited respectively by  integrating  them into ongoing analytical and management processes as far as possible, instead of treating them as a separate issue. Developing methods for analysing and applying ESG-aspects in investment activities and corporate governance is in many respects a complicated endeavour that necessarily proceeds by stages. What is important is to ensure that there is a clearly defined target to work towards and that there are strategies for reaching it. How quickly and by what precise means progress is to be made in this direction must be up to the AP funds themselves to decide, although they must be able to show why they have chosen a particular course in this respect.</p>
<p>5. The  AP-funds have formulated requirements for corporate information in an exemplary manner in their ownership policies . These have to be followed up and further developed in accordance with market developements. One step is to proceed from the information acquired in this way and develop stra- tegies for future investments taking into account ESG-aspects. One such course might be to develop a strategy for the fund portfolio’s total carbon emission count.</p>
<p>6. It should be the task of the  governing boards  to adopt a set of fundamental values and on the basis of these principles to establish and follow up how the funds are to operate.</p>
<p>7. In light of the board assignments, the question arises of how the board members are recruited, how they work and how they are paid. In future, the Government should appoint board members on the basis of recommendations from a government- appointed, professionally active and  broad-based nominating committee . Boards must be allowed to have fewer than the nine members currently stipulated by law.</p>
<p>8. The provision requiring a given number of board members to be nominated by trade unions and employers’ organisations (social partners) should be abolished.</p>
<p>9. External  evaluations of the boards’  work should be undertaken regularly, in line with standard practice in the business sector in</p>
<p>recent years, and should serve as a basis for the work of the nominating committee.</p>
<p>10. Sufficient  resources  should be set aside for the purpose of securing the requisite procurement skills and quality in work with ESG-issues. This applies to information gathering, ana- lysis, dialogue and follow-up.</p>
<p>11. Opportunities should be created for broadening  cooperation  between the AP-funds on ESG-issues without this conflicting with the independence of each individual fund, as called for by central government. This applies for instance to ESG-dialogues with Swedish enterprises.</p>
<p>12. Ownership  is the foundation on which the influence of the AP- funds rests. This should be exploited as effectively and deter- minedly as possible. A well-developed ownership policy – which each of the First-Fourth AP-Funds has formulated separately – is essential in this respect. Ownership and invest- ment policies embracing ESG-aspects should be considered for all types of assets, not just listed shares, and must be followed up regularly.</p>
<p>13. The restriction on the  Seventh  AP-Fund’s   right to vote in respect of its share holdings should be removed. Other regulatory restrictions preventing the funds from playing an active ownership role should be reviewed. The funds’ owner- ship role should otherwise be defined in such a way as to strike a balance between an investor perspective and a long-term ownership perspective.</p>
<p>14. The principles governing  board and management remuneration and compensation are ownership issues with important confi-  dence-related  implications, for the funds themselves, for the enterprises concerned and for the business sector as a whole. The funds must continue to actively encourage the develop- ment of a remuneration system that is moderate and transpa- rent and provides incentives for  well-judged   risk-taking.  The way incentives for the funds’ own employees are constructed will also have an impact on how  ESG-aspects  are dealt with and on the extent to which public confidence is maintained.</p>
<p>15. The funds’ ESG work should be  evaluated  regularly. The Government’s annual evaluation process, therefore, should also encompass these aspects of the funds’ operations. This is in line with the idea that ESG analyses need to be integrated into the work of the funds.</p>
<p>16. We propose that the Public Pension Funds Act (2000:192) be  revised  on five counts:</p>
<p>The preparatory text requiring the funds to take environ- mental and ethical considerations into account is incorpo- rated into the text of the law.</p>
<p>A nominating committee is responsible for recruiting the members of governing boards.</p>
<p>The restrictions concerning the Seventh AP Fund’s voting rights are removed.</p>
<p>The number of board members is to be nine at the most</p>
<p>The provision requiring four board members to be pro- posed by the social partners is abolished.</p>
