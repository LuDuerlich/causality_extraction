<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Environmental charges on fertilizers and pesticides were introduced in 1984. In 1995, these charges were renamed taxes in the relevant legislation, i.e. fertilizer tax  and pesticide tax , respectively.</p>
<p>Fertilizer charges were originally levied on the basis of the content of nitrogen and phosphorus in commercial fertilizer. In 1994 the charge on phosphorus was abolished and a charge was levied on the cadmium content in phosphorus fertilizers instead.</p>
<p>The fertilizer tax is payable at the rate of SEK 1.80 per whole kilogram of nitrogen in the fertilizer and SEK 0.30 per gram of cadmium in fertilizer where the cadmium content exceeds 5 grams per tonne of phosphorus.</p>
<p>The pesticide tax is levied on the amount of active substances in the pesticide. The tax is payable at the rate of SEK 20 per whole kilogram of active substances.</p>
<h2>Evaluation of the taxes Effects of the fertilizer tax on the use of nitrogen and cadmium</h2>
<p>The vast majority of the commercial nitrogen fertilizer that is sold in Sweden is used in agriculture. Only small amounts are used in horticulture and in forestry. The amount of commercial nitrogen fertilizer sold for use in agriculture and horticulture in recent years is about 200,000 tonnes per year.</p>
<p>Several factors affect the use of commercial nitrogen fertilizer in agriculture. Among the most important of these are the choice of crops, the expected yield, the nitrogen price and the product price. During the period 1995-2001 the input price index for commercial fertilizer rose while the settlement price index for cereals fell during the same period.</p>
<p>Starting in the 1970s, the cadmium content in the phosphorus fertilizers that are used in Sweden has steadily fallen and the levels are now among the lowest in Europe.</p>
<p>The Inquiry concluded that the tax on commercial nitrogen fertilizer has had comparatively little impact on its use in agriculture. But the tax on cadmium, combined with the measures taken by the agricultural sector, has clearly had a favourable effect by reducing inputs of cadmium to arable land in Sweden.</p>
<h2>Impact of the pesticide tax on the use of pesticides</h2>
<p>Sales of pesticides, expressed as the amount of active substances, totalled about 8,600 tonnes in 2001, and about three-quarters of this was sold to industry. Most of the latter consisted of wood preservatives, which are anyway exempt from tax. Agriculture’s share of the amount sold was about 20 % while that of horticulture and forestry was 0.5 % and 0.1 %, respectively.</p>
<p>Average annual sales of pesticides for use in agriculture, horticulture and forestry in 1981–1985 totalled 4,561 tonnes of active substances. The corresponding figure for 1991–1995 was 1,690 tonnes. Sales have subsequently risen slightly. In 2001, pesticides containing a total of 1,793 tonnes of active substances were sold to these sectors. Most of the preparations used in agriculture are herbicides.</p>
<p>The use of pesticides is determined by various factors. One factor is the cost of pest control, which includes the cost of the preparations, including the pesticide tax. Other factors are the choice of crops, growing conditions and the amount of weeds and pests. One important circumstance in this connection is that, in order to reduce nitrogen leaching, agriculture has switched to methods of cultivation that increase the need to control weeds and pests. Furthermore, there are in practice often no real alternatives to chemical control. These factors also explain why the use of pesticides, after declining during first half of the 1990s, has increased again.</p>
<p>The present rate of tax on pesticides corresponds on average to about 7 % of their sale price. It has been calculated that at normal doses the tax only represents a cost of SEK 20 per hectare in cereal production and SEK 60–100 per hectare in the production of potatoes and sugarbeet. Pesticide prices have fallen in recent years, mainly due to decreases in the prices of the group of herbicides known as glyphosates.</p>
<p>The Inquiry concludes that the tax on pesticides has helped to reduce their use. However, the tax level is so low that it has limited effect. The indirect effect of the tax has been greater, since the tax has made it possible to finance other more effective measures to reduce the use of pesticides out of public funds.</p>
<h2>Effects of the fertilizer tax on the environment</h2>
<p>Although the tax on commercial nitrogen fertilizer has made little impact on its use, it helps to reduce nitrogen leaching from arable land. The contribution made by the tax to reducing leaching is estimated to be about 1,500 tonnes of nitrogen per year. The tax has also made farmers aware of the problems associated with nitrogen leaching.</p>
<p>The cadmium tax has helped to reduce the input of cadmium to arable land, thus reducing, in particular, the risk of adverse health effects.</p>
<h2>Effects of the pesticide tax on health and the environment</h2>
<p>The use of pesticides can be harmful to human health and the environment. Risks occur in connection with the handling of pesticides and with the intake of food and water containing pesticide residues. Generally speaking, reducing the use of pesticides also helps to reduce the risks that are associated with their use. The tax has only had a small effect on the use of pesticides. Therefore it must be assumed that the impact of the tax when it comes to reducing the risk of harmful effects on health and the environment by reducing consumption is also small. Nor does the tax appear to have had any appreciable effect when it comes to encouraging a switch to the use of lower-risk pesticides or nonchemical alternatives.</p>
<h2>The cost of tax collection and control</h2>
<p>In 2001 the revenue from the fertilizer tax and the pesticide tax totalled SEK 407 million, SEK 367 million of which was from the fertilizer tax and about SEK 40 million from the pesticide tax. SEK 364.5 million of the fertilizer tax related to nitrogen and SEK 2.5 million to cadmium. The number of registered payers of fertilizer tax in 2001 was 76. The corresponding figure for the pesticide tax was 42.</p>
<p>The taxing authority is the National Tax Board through its the Special Tax Office in Ludvika. About one full-time employee is needed for administration of the taxes. The cost of administration is estimated to be about SEK 375,000 per year. In addition to this cost there are control and audit costs that vary depending on the amount of work involved.</p>
<p>The administration of the fertilizer and pesticide taxes is simple, and the resources needed in the form of personnel etc. are limited. The administrative costs are considered relatively low.</p>
<h2>Effects of the taxes on the international competitiveness of agriculture</h2>
<p>During the last six years the economic situation for Swedish agriculture has not developed as favourably as that in other EU Member States. The main reason for this appears to be that the relationship between product prices and input prices has been less favourable in Sweden than in other countries. An unfavourable relationship between these prices means that an increase in the price of an input due to a charge or tax may affect competitiveness.</p>
<p>The competitiveness of agriculture depends on several factors. Ever since Sweden joined the EU, various support instruments have been a substantial element of agricultural income. It is therefore difficult to assess the real impact on competitiveness of the taxes on commercial fertilizer and pesticides.</p>
<p>Agriculture in Sweden and the other EU Member States is governed by the Common Agricultural Policy. Since Sweden is currently the only country that has a tax on commercial nitrogen fertilizer, Swedish farmers have to pay a higher price for this nitrogen than farmers in other countries. This has affected the competitiveness of Swedish agriculture. The question is: how much?</p>
<p>On the basis of the available information, the Inquiry can only conclude that the impact of the fertilizer tax on the international competitiveness of Swedish agriculture has been relatively modest. The pesticide tax appears to have had little impact on competitiveness.</p>
<h2>Changes in the taxes The fertilizer tax</h2>
<p>Agriculture is today the largest source of nitrogen emissions to the sea. A large-scale action programme has been adopted in order to reduce nitrogen losses from agriculture. The tax on nitrogen in commercial fertilizer is one of several economic instruments and measures included in the programme.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also studied some other economic instruments. The systems used in Denmark and the Netherlands, which encourage greater nitrogen efficiency in agriculture, are of particular interest. The Inquiry also studied models that encourage reduced nitrogen leaching. However, none of these have got beyond the model stage in any country.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s assessment and proposals</p>
<p>The Inquiry does not consider it possible to introduce any of the systems mentioned above in the short term, but this may be feasible in the longer term. In that case a system aimed directly at reducing nitrogen leaching should be chosen in the Inquiry’s opinion. To make it possible to introduce such a system, measures should be taken immediately to provide a framework for methodological development, an improved data base and research and test results.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also considered whether the tax base should be broadened. This could be done by levying the tax on the nitrogen content in feed in addition to fertilizer and pesticides. The Inquiry concludes that broadening the tax base by this means is not appropriate. There are a number of problems in this area and there is no guarantee that the tax would be more effective in reducing leaching.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the present tax base be retained. The tax rate should remain the same as before. The Inquiry does not consider it likely that an increase would appreciably improve the environmentally beneficial effect of the tax. Nor should the tax be lowered, since compensation would have to be found for its contribution to reducing leaching, at the same time as it might be necessary to take further measures in order to achieve the environmental quality objective Zero Eutrophication  by 2020. Consideration of appropriate measures falls outside the Inquiry’s remit.</p>
<p>As regards the tax on the cadmium content in phosphorus fertilizers, the results of the work now in progress in the EU should be awaited before any changes are made.</p>
<h2>The pesticide tax</h2>
<p>Chemical pesticides will continue to be used to control weeds and pests in the foreseeable future, both in agriculture and in conventional horticulture. The main purpose of the measures that have been taken so far is to reduce the use of pesticides. Future efforts are likely to focus more on reducing the risks that are associated with the use of pesticides.</p>
<p>The use of pesticides is dealt with mainly in connection with the environmental quality objective A  Non-Toxic  Environment.  Under a subobjective related to this environmental quality objective the risks to health and the environment associated with the production and use of chemical substances are to be continuously reduced up to 2010 with the help of indicators adopted by the competent authorities. In order to achieve these environmental objectives, all appropriate economic instruments should be used and other measures taken. Taxes are one such economic instrument.</p>
<p>In connection with the implementation of environmental programmes it has become increasingly obvious that some objectives conflict with others. One conflict of objectives that has received particular attention is that between reduced nutrient leakage and reduced use of pesticides. There may appear to be another conflict between the objective of competitive and viable agriculture and various environmental quality objectives.</p>
<p>The present tax on pesticides corresponds on average to about 7 % of product prices. Calculations indicate that a tax rate corresponding to 30 % of product prices would lead to a reduction of 4–8 % in the use of pesticides. For the tax alone to appreciably reduce the use of pesticides, the rate would have to be multiplied several times over.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has considered introducing other economic instruments as alternatives to a tax, in particular quotas and tradable options to buy pesticides.</p>
<p>The present tax is based on the amount of active substances in the pesticide. Assuming that the tax should continue to be levied as an economic instrument, the Inquiry considered alternative levying bases. Instead of levying the tax on the basis of the amount of active substance, a percentage of the sale price or a predetermined normal dose per unit of area (per hectare dose) could be used. Regardless of which of these bases is chosen, the rate could be differentiated, for example depending on the uses of the pesticide or the harmfulness of the active substance to health and the environment.</p>
<p>The Inquiry based its analysis on studies of the Danish system of charges, under which charges are levied in relation to the retail price of pesticides, with differentiation depending on their uses, and the Norwegian model, which is based on rates calculated in relation to a predetermined normal dose per unit of area, under which rates differ depending on the harmfulness of different pesticides to health and the environment.</p>
<p>The Inquiry emphasizes the importance of ensuring that future measures aimed at reducing the risks associated with the use of pesticides are harmonized at the EU level wherever possible. A thematic strategy for sustainable use of pesticides is being prepared within the EU. The European Commission has not proposed designing a fully-fledged Community system for pesticide taxes, but has pointed out that that if taxes or charges are to be imposed on pesticides, the Member States should be encouraged to apply differentiated rates for taxes or charges in order to provide users with sufficient incentives to choose pesticides that are less harmful to the environment.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s assessment and proposals</p>
<p>The Inquiry does not regard quotas or tradable options to buy pesticides as feasible alternatives to an environmental levy on pesticides. Such a levy should therefore be retained as part of a package of economic instruments. Various levying models were considered.</p>
<p>The Inquiry concludes that the model that, if combined with other economic instruments and other measures, would provide the most effective means of achieving an appreciable reduction of the risks associated with the use of pesticides is one in which environmental levies differ depending on the harmfulness of the pesticide to health and the environment. The Inquiry therefore proposes that preparation for a changeover to a risk-differentiated levy be included as an essential element of the action programme that has been drawn up with a view to reducing pesticide-related risks. The Inquiry proposes that the National Chemicals Inspectorate should be instructed in connection with this preparation to develop a classification system as soon as possible that is based on the harmfulness of pesticides.</p>
<p>Risk-differentiated levies could be based either on a predetermined normal dose per unit of area (per hectare dose) or on the price of the preparation. In connection with the development of a classification system based on the harmfulness of pesticides it should be decided which of these alternatives should be chosen as a basis for the environmental levy. An analysis of the two alternatives can only be made when the classification system is basically complete. The choice of levying basis will determine whether the levy will take the form of a tax or a charge.</p>
<p>If sufficient resources are allocated, it should be possible to start the changeover to the new system within a five-year period.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also considered whether it was appropriate to raise the level of the present tax and, if so, whether a levying basis other than the amount of active substances in pesticides should be used during the period prior to introduction of a risk-differentiated model. A substantial increase in the tax might, given the present levying basis, have undesirable effects, such as favouring low-dose agents.</p>
<p>A rather large increase in the tax is necessary in order to substantially improve the effectiveness of the pesticide tax as an environmental policy instrument. On the other hand, a drastic increase would conflict with the objective of reducing nitrogen leaching, as well as impairing the competitiveness of Swedish agriculture. Against this background, the Inquiry proposes a moderate increase in the tax rate from SEK 20 to SEK 25 per kilogram of active substance.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s view, an increase of SEK 5 in the tax rate is not so large as to make it necessary to choose a different levying basis. Nor is there any other reason to change the present levying basis, i.e. a tax on the amount of active substances in pesticides, for a limited period.</p>
<p>Consequences of the Inquiry’s proposals</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s view, an increase of SEK 5 per kilogram in the tax rate will have an effect on the use of pesticides during the next few years. Assuming that the consumption of active substance is about 1,750 tonnes, it is estimated that the increase will raise gross tax revenue by SEK 9 million. The accrued net effect during the period 2004–2006 and also the permanent net effect in the form of increased tax revenue for the public sector will be over SEK 6 million per year.</p>
<p>The Inquiry expects that the increase in costs for agricultural, horticultural and forest enterprises will be moderate. The effect on the profitability of individual enterprises should be marginal. Increasing the charge will help to reduce pesticide-related risks, which in turn will slightly improve cost-effectiveness from an environmental point of view.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<h2>Proposed amendments to the Tax on Fertilizers Act and the Tax on Pesticides Act etc.</h2>
<p>Experience of control actions and subsequent court proceedings show that additions should be made to the rules in the Tax on Fertilizers Act and the Tax on Pesticides Act defining who is liable to tax in various situations. The Inquiry proposes that persons who take delivery of fertilizers or pesticides in Sweden should also be liable to tax in certain circumstances. Additions should also be made to the provisions of the Tax on Pesticides Act relating to the commencement of tax liability. Amendments to the Tax Payment Act (1977:483) are also proposed, the effect of which would be to shorten the period within which certain taxpayers must submit a special tax return.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate control activities, the Inquiry proposes introducing provisions obliging the Swedish Customs to report to the taxing authority when it learns that fertilizers and pesticides have been imported into Sweden from another EU country. The Swedish Customs should also notify the taxing authority when fertilizers and pesticides are imported into Sweden from third countries.</p>
<h2>Illegal imports</h2>
<p>There is no evidence of illegal imports of commercial fertilizer into Sweden, but there are suspicions that such imports occur. On the basis of some calculations, the average amount of illegally imported commercial fertilizer in recent years may represent about 5 % of total consumption. This would be equivalent to a tax shortfall of about SEK 15 million.</p>
<p>There are various reasons for illegally importing pesticides into Sweden. One reason is that the prices of such products are lower in other countries. Another is that there are sought-after fertilizers in other countries that are not approved in Sweden. According to the ‘market’, most illegal imports consist of preparations that are not permitted in Sweden. There are also reports of illegal imports of glyphosate products. These reports indicate that pesticides are imported into the country illegally, but there is no solid evidence on which to base an assessment of the volume of such imports.</p>
