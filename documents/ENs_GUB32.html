<p>Remit</p>
<p>My remit has been to investigate the likely extent of decisions on Swedish citizenship that are made on erroneous grounds or are otherwise made in an erroneous way. I have also been instructed to take a position on the question of whether a possibility should be introduced of revoking decisions on Swedish citizenship found upon review to be erroneous, and if so, to propose necessary legislative regulations. Finally, I am also instructed to analyse the extent to which erroneous decisions can be dealt with by treating them as nullities.</p>
<p>Current provisions</p>
<p>The Swedish Citizenship Act (2001:82) contains provisions on the acquisition of Swedish citizenship. Upon application, an alien can be accepted as a citizen by special decision (naturalisation). For naturalisation, the alien must have provided proof of his or her identity, have reached the age of 18, hold a permanent Swedish residence permit, have been domiciled in Sweden for a certain minimum period, normally five years, and have led and can be expected to lead a respectable life.</p>
<p>In certain cases, Swedish citizenship can also be acquired by a simplified procedure known as notification. Under this procedure, a person becomes a Swedish citizen if he or she meets certain conditions that are specified in the Citizenship Act.</p>
<p>Current Swedish law does not allow revocation of a decision to grant Swedish citizenship. This is made clear in Chapter 2, Article 7, second paragraph of the Instrument of Government.</p>
<p>Survey</p>
<p>From contacts with different authorities, the inquiry has found that there are cases in which Swedish citizenship is granted on the basis of false or incomplete information from applicants. However, the number of cases per year is estimated to be very small. It has not been possible to establish how many cases are involved. As regards decisions on citizenship that have been made by some other improper procedure, the only known cases are the decisions concerned in the judgment of Norrköping District Court of 1 December 2003, concerning gross misuse of office and bribery.</p>
<p>Analysis of the issue of nullity</p>
<p>I note that great caution must always be observed before a decision favouring an individual is held to be a nullity. The more far-reaching consequences a decision has, the greater this requirement for caution becomes. Since a decision on Swedish citizenship is precisely a case of a favourable administrative decision with far-reaching legal consequences, it is probably extremely rare that such a decision can be regarded as marred by such fundamental deficiencies that it must be considered a nullity.</p>
<p>Even if a possibility of revocation is introduced for certain cases, this will not make it impossible in future to regard a decision on citizenship as a nullity for the purposes of legal application. The question as to whether erroneous decisions can be dealt with in exceptional cases by treating them as nullities should, in my opinion, continue to be settled in the application of the law.</p>
<p>A decision on citizenship should be subject to review</p>
<p>The question of whether a possibility should be introduced of revoking a decision on Swedish citizenship has been assessed in the context of several previous inquiries and legislative works. The main reason that has been adduced against introducing a possibility of revocation has been that such a possibility would lead to two sorts of citizenship, one definitive and one that is subject to review. Further, the risk of statelessness arising as a result has been emphasised, as have enforcement problems and family law complications.</p>
<p>Since the issue was last considered in a legislative context, some new factors have become relevant. One such factor is that the increased risk of statelessness that a possibility of revocation would entail is now less significant than before since Sweden and several other countries now allow dual citizenship, which was not the case previously. Moreover, in recent years several countries in Europe have introduced new rules that make it possible to revoke decisions on citizenship that have been made on erroneous grounds. Also, in one specific case, it has been discovered that Swedish citizenship has been granted on false grounds because of irregularities in the processing of the case.</p>
<p>In my opinion, however, there are still many strong reasons against introducing a possibility of revocation. It is therefore questionable whether the reasons that exist for a change of position are sufficient to warrant changing a stable system that gives the individual legal security and that a large majority in the Riksdag has repeatedly endorsed.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I have chosen to present a proposal under which in future, in certain cases, it will be possible to revoke a citizenship decision that is found upon review to be erroneous. Naturally, on general principles, it is desirable that decisions by authorities are correct in both formal and material terms. It is unsatisfactory that the state is unable to intervene against a person who has unfairly or fraudulently obtained possession of such a far-reaching and basic right as citizenship. I have therefore seen it as my task to show the shape a legal regulatory system could take. The proposal mainly targets cases in which a person has been granted citizenship as a result of bribery or other improper procedures. It also covers cases in which false identity information has been provided to conceal a serious criminal record, a link to terrorism or a similar background. I wish, however, to emphasise that the principal ambition should be for citizenship cases to be processed scrupulously and for the internal controls of the authorities concerned to function effectively.</p>
<p>The proposal requires amendments to the Instrument of Government and the Swedish Citizenship Act.</p>
<p>The proposal provides a possibility of revoking a decision on Swedish citizenship if this has been obtained through false or incomplete information or by some other improper procedure. The proposed revocation rule covers citizenship that has been obtained both by notification and upon application. The improper procedure must have had a decisive influence on the decision. When a review</p>
<p>is made of whether to revoke a citizenship decision, a balance must be struck between how reprehensible the conduct involved is, on the one hand, and how great an effect a revocation decision will have for the individual, on the other hand. Under the proposal, a citizenship decision must not be revoked if, at the time the question of revocation arises, the individual meets the requirements for obtaining Swedish citizenship.</p>
<p>Unless there are weighty reasons otherwise, a child who is under the age of 18 and who has obtained Swedish citizenship simultaneously with a parent or because the parent was Swedish is to be deprived of citizenship as a result of a decision to deprive the parent of citizenship. The question of whether to deprive the child of citizenship must be examined separately. In assessing whether to deprive the child of citizenship, particular attention must be paid to the best interests of the child. The child must not be deprived of citizenship in these cases if either of the child’s parents retains Swedish citizenship or if deprivation would result in the child being stateless.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Swedish Migration Board or the county administrative board that has first examined a Swedish citizenship application or notification should serve as first instance for examining questions concerning loss of Swedish citizenship. For appeals, the same sequence of instances will apply as in other citizenship cases.</p>
