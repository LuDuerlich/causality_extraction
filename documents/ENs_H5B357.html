<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The PNR Directive</h2>
<p>On 27 April 2016, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive (EU) 2016/681 on the use of passenger name record (PNR) data for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime (referred to below as the PNR Directive).</p>
<p>PNR refers to data provided by passengers when booking flights and during check-in. This data can include names, travel dates, route, luggage information and method of payment. Air carriers already collect and process such data about their passengers for their own operational and commercial purposes. PNR data is also of interest for law enforcement purposes. The data can be used, for example, to screen out previously unknown passengers who should be subject to further examinations by the authorities. PNR data can also be used in connection with criminal investigations or to analyse and establish suspicious travel and behavioural patterns.</p>
<p>Authorities all over the world have begun to collect more PNR data from air carriers and to analyse it for the purpose of combating terrorism and serious crime. In Sweden, the Swedish Police Authority, the Swedish Security Service and Swedish Customs are already permitted to request certain PNR data from air carriers and to use it for law enforcement purposes.</p>
<p>The PNR Directive is an EU-wide regulatory framework for the collection and use of PNR data in certain law enforcement activities. The Inquiry’s overall remit is to present proposals on the legislative amendments necessary to implement the PNR Directive in Swedish law.</p>
<h2>A new Act on air passenger data for law enforcement purposes</h2>
<p>We propose that the PNR Directive should mainly be implemented through a new act, the Act on air passenger data for law enforcement purposes. This Act will contain provisions on the transfer by air carriers of PNR data to the passenger information unit and the processing of PNR data in activities for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences or serious crime. The purpose of this Act is to meet the need for access to PNR data in such activities and protection of privacy in the processing of such data.</p>
<p>The Act, like the underlying PNR Directive, will contain regulations on both operations and data protection. Regarding the latter, we consider it most appropriate to adapt the legislative proposal as far as possible to the data protection reform that will be implemented in the first half of 2018. The provisions in the Act will apply in addition to, or instead of, the general provisions in the General Data Protection Regulation, the new framework law – the Criminal Data Act – which has been proposed to implement the new Data Protection Directive (SOU 2017:29), and other special regulations on data protection that apply or will apply to relevant authorities.</p>
<p>The Act will be accompanied by an ordinance implementing certain detailed provisions of the Directive.</p>
<h2>Unlawful processing of PNR information</h2>
<p>The Act will contain a preamble stating that PNR data transferred by air carriers or the results of a unit for the processing of such passenger information, i.e. PNR information, may not be processed for any purposes other than the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences or serious crime. Terrorist offences are defined in the Act as the offences referred to under domestic law in Sweden or other Member States in Articles 1–4 of Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism. Serious crime refers to the offences listed in annex II of the PNR Directive, and for which domestic law in Sweden or other Member States prescribes imprisonment of three years or more.</p>
<p>The Act also contains a general ban on processing PNR data that is sensitive personal data. In the event that the passenger information unit or a competent authority receives such data, it must be deleted immediately.</p>
<h2>A passenger information unit</h2>
<p>Under the Act, there will be a passenger information unit at the Swedish Police Authority. This unit will have responsibility for collecting PNR data from air carriers, storing and processing this data, and transferring PNR information to competent Swedish authorities. The unit will also be responsible for the exchange of PNR information within the EU.</p>
<p>PNR data that is processed by the unit will not be directly available to competent authorities or to others working at the Swedish Police Authority. Direct access to PNR information processed at the unit will therefore not be permitted. In this unit, access to PNR information will be restricted through special authorisation provisions.</p>
<h2>Obligations on air carriers</h2>
<p>Under the Act, PNR data should be transferred from air carriers with a valid operating licence or equivalent permitting them to carry out, with compensation, carriage of passengers by air, and that collect and process PNR data in reservation systems in their regular activities. One starting point is that the transfer obligation does not apply to the majority of small air carriers conducting taxi flights from small airfields that do not have departure control systems for passengers.</p>
<p>PNR data is to be transferred electronically to the passenger information unit. An annex to the Act specifies the PNR data to be transferred. ‘API’ data (see below for details about this kind of data) is included in the PNR data to be transferred. However, the data referred to in the annex may only be transferred when air carriers collect it as part of their regular activities. Therefore, the Act does not oblige air carriers to collect additional PNR data about their passengers; it simply states that they must transfer data to which they already have access.</p>
<p>PNR data should normally be transferred on two occasions prior to every flight arriving to or departing from Sweden. The first transfer should take place 24–48 hours before the flight departure, and the second transfer should take place immediately after the gate has been closed. The obligation to transfer data applies to flights both within the EU and to or from a third country.</p>
<p>An air carrier that has not transferred PNR data in accordance with the provisions in the Act or provisions issued in connection with the Act must pay a financial penalty. For every flight conducted without the air carrier fulfilling its transfer obligation, the financial penalty is set at a minimum of SEK 20 000 and a maximum of SEK 100 000. The financial penalty may be reduced or waived, in whole or in part, if the infringement is excusable, or if, in view of the circumstances, it would be unreasonable to impose the penalty.</p>
<p>Air carriers must inform passengers about the transfer of PNR data to the passenger information unit and the reasons for this transfer.</p>
<h2>Processing of PNR data at the passenger information unit</h2>
<p>The PNR data that has been transferred to the passenger information unit from air carriers must be stored in a special database at the unit for a period of five years. It must then be deleted. After six months, the PNR data in the database must be masked, which means that accessible data directly attributable to a natural person must be made invisible to users without special authorisation to access the data.</p>
<p>PNR data that has been transferred to the passenger information unit from air carriers may be processed for the following purposes only.</p>
<p>• Advance assessment: the data may be processed to enable the unit to conduct an assessment of passengers before their estimated arrival to or departure from Sweden so as to select individuals who need to be further investigated by competent authorities or Europol (use in real time). In this kind of advance assessment of passengers, PNR data may be compared with data in relevant databases or other data collections, and with  pre-determined criteria.</p>
<p>• Responding to enquiries: stored data may be processed to enable the passenger information unit to fulfil its responsibility under the Act to transfer PNR information to competent recipients upon request (reactive use).</p>
<p>• Devising selection criteria: data may be analysed to enable the unit to update or create new criteria to be used when conducting advance assessments of passengers.</p>
<p>The passenger information unit will also have access to PNR information transferred to the unit from corresponding units in other Member States. This data may only be processed for further transfer to competent authorities.</p>
<p>The Swedish Police Authority is the personal data controller for the processing of personal data conducted at the passenger information unit. The Swedish Police Authority will appoint a data protection officer for the passenger information unit. The officer’s duties are stated in the Act.</p>
<h2>Transfer of PNR information from the passenger information unit</h2>
<p>The passenger information unit will function as a hub at which the mass of PNR data transferred by air carriers is received, stored and superficially analysed. Only PNR information considered to be of interest for combating terrorist offences or serious crime will subsequently be made available to competent domestic authorities for further analysis and action. The Government has appointed the Swedish Police Authority, the Swedish Security Service, Swedish Customs, the Swedish Economic Crime Authority and the Swedish Armed Forces as competent authorities to receive and request PNR data from the passenger information unit. Additional agencies may be appointed in the future. Under the Act, the unit is required, in individual cases, to transfer the results of its advance assessments to one or several competent authorities so that they can conduct an additional examination of the PNR information. The unit should also transfer PNR information to competent authorities in response to special requests from a competent authority. Moreover, the unit should forward PNR information received from other Member States’ passenger information units to competent authorities. An official at the unit is required to have always carried out an assessment of the PNR information before it is disclosed by the unit.</p>
<p>Under the Act, the passenger information unit should also transfer PNR information to corresponding units in other Member States. This is what should be done if, after an advance assessment, the unit considers that certain information is also relevant and necessary for another Member State. Data should also be transferred to other Member States in response to a request from that Member State. Moreover, PNR information should be transferred to Europol.</p>
<p>The Act also contains provisions stating that the passenger information unit may transfer PNR information to a third country under certain conditions.</p>
<p>The transfer of unmasked PNR data, i.e. complete PNR data in which personal data has previously been masked, may only occur if certain more closely defined conditions have been met. If a preliminary investigation is under way, a request from a competent authority on gaining access to unmasked PNR data must have been approved by a public prosecutor. In all other cases, the disclosure must have been approved by the head of the Swedish Police Authority. The National Police Commissioner should be able to delegate the right to decide, subject to certain limitations.</p>
<h2>Processing of PNR information by competent authorities</h2>
<p>The Act will contain special provisions on the processing of PNR information by the competent authorities. They state, among other things, that the result of an advance assessment of passengers by the passenger information unit must be immediately deleted by competent authorities if it proves to be irrelevant for the purposes stated in the preamble to the Act. In addition, there is an exemption from the Act’s preamble on the unlawful processing of PNR information. If information has emerged about some form of offence other than a terrorist offence or serious crime – known as ‘excess disclosure’ – in connection with a competent authority’s actions as a result of having processed PNR information, this information may be used for the prevention, investigation and prosecution of the offence.</p>
<h2>Other provisions</h2>
<p>The Directive’s requirements concerning general data protection provisions and the rights of individuals are largely met by other applicable data protection regulations, and need not – with the occasional exception – be regulated separately in the new Act.</p>
<p>Supervision of personal data processing under the Act should be carried out by the supervisory authority in accordance with the proposed Criminal Data Act and in line with the provisions on supervision in that Act.</p>
<p>A financial penalty may be charged by authorities acting as personal data controllers in the event of a breach of certain fundamental provisions in the Act intended to protect personal privacy. When determining the size of the financial penalty, and in processing issues, the financial penalty system in the proposed Criminal Data Act and the accompanying ordinance should be applied.</p>
<h2>Secrecy</h2>
<p>Current secrecy legislation is considered to provide sufficient protection for PNR information at both the passenger information unit and competent authorities. There is no need for any new or amended secrecy regulation. Nor is there any need for special provisions on secrecy exemptions.</p>
<h2>How does the PNR Directive relate to the API Directive?</h2>
<p>API (advance passenger information) data refers primarily to information contained in the machine-readable part of a passport, such as name, date of birth, nationality and passport number. API data is considered to constitute verifiable information and is therefore mainly used as a tool for identification purposes. Council Directive 2004/82/EC of 29 April 2004 on the obligation of carriers to communicate passenger data (referred to below as the API Directive) regulates carriers’ obligations to provide national authorities, upon request, with such passenger information ahead of travel from countries outside the Schengen area. In Sweden, the Directive has been implemented primarily through certain provisions of the</p>
<p>Aliens Act (2005:716) and through the Passenger Name Record Act (2006:444).</p>
<p>Under the PNR Directive, air carriers should transfer both PNR and API data to the passenger information units. Therefore, the obligation to transfer API data is imposed not only by the API Directive, but also by the PNR Directive. Our remit includes analysing whether and how the PNR Directive affects Sweden’s implementation of the API Directive and proposing how the system of flight passenger data can enable processing of both PNR and API data.</p>
<p>In our view, the PNR Directive neither replaces nor affects the API Directive or its implementation in Sweden. The Directives and their implementation will therefore be applicable in parallel. We have also found that the coordinated processing of PNR and API data at the passenger information unit is possible, also with regard to API data processed under the Passenger Name Record Act. However, this requires that API data processed under the Passenger Name Record Act is kept separate from the API data transferred from air carriers under the new Act, that it is always clear which purpose and under which regulatory framework API data is processed, and that it is ensured that the differences in the regulatory frameworks concerning access to data, for example, are monitored.</p>
<h2>Significance of the PNR Directive for the existing regulations</h2>
<p>Implementation of the Directive will also have an effect on the existing regulations. We therefore propose that the Police Act (1984:387), the Customs Act (2016:253) and the Act on the powers of Swedish Customs at Sweden’s borders with other European Union countries (1996:701) (the Internal Borders Act) include provisions requiring that obligations on air carriers under these acts to transfer booking data to the Swedish Police Authority, the Swedish Security Service and Swedish Customs should not apply when the Act on air passenger data in law enforcement is applicable.</p>
<h2>Travel agencies and tour operators</h2>
<p>In a declaration adopted at the same time as the PNR Directive, the Member States stated that they, in accordance with their national legislation and subject to parliamentary processing in certain Member States, undertake to expand the collection of PNR data to also apply to actors that are not air carriers. Examples given in the declaration include travel agencies and tour operators that offer travel-related services. The declaration gives no time limit for when this should be implemented in national legislation. In our view, travel agencies and tour operators are already covered by the system for collecting PNR data as they transfer PNR data to air carriers for further transfer to the passenger information unit. We consider that further expansions of this system should be deferred until further notice. However, the issue should be monitored and possibly investigated further.</p>
<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>The proposals would mean more PNR data concerning individual air passengers being collected for law enforcement purposes, which we consider would have a positive impact on law enforcement efforts. The proposals also mean that protection of personal privacy would be guaranteed in the competent law enforcement authorities’ processing of data.</p>
<p>The proposals will add a burden in terms of work and costs for air carriers. However, we do not consider that their competitiveness will be affected to any great extent. In addition, the proposals would mean increased costs for the Swedish Police Authority linked to the establishment of a passenger information unit and the running of such a unit. However, the economic consequences for the Swedish Police Authority and other relevant authorities are deemed to fall within the existing economic framework.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the new Act enter into force on 25 May 2018.</p>
