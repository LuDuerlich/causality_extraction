<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Swedish Delegation for Roma Issues was appointed in January 2007 in order to investigate the situation for the Roma minority in Sweden and propose reforms.</p>
<p>The delegation decided to adopt a rights perspective, using as its base both the internationally recognized basic human rights and minority rights. The aim was to abandon the patron-client discourse all too often applied to Roma issues with its view of Roma as ”the other”, and substitute it with a human rights discourse, evaluating whether or not Roma in Sweden have full access to their rights.</p>
<p>Indeed, they do not today.</p>
<p>The Roma minority of Sweden is estimated to 50.000, including five major groups defined by their respective period of arrival in Sweden. The number of Roma has grown substantially during the past decades primarily because of immigration from new EU member states and from the wars in former Yugoslavia. About half of the Swedish Roma minority are represented by the Swedish Travellers, a Roma group with roots in Roma arriving in the 16th century, the rest arriving at later stages. Today, Roma enjoy the status of being a national minority together with four other groups: the Sami, the Swedish Finns, the Jews and the Tornedalers.</p>
<p>Our investigation shows that Roma today are almost completely excluded from mainstream society. Sweden does not allow for ethnic registration and thus we do not have any statistical base but have had to resort to in-depth interviews and other sources of information. Still, the picture comes out very clear: there is a strong, almost unbreakable pattern of social, economic and political exclusion and marginalization. 80 percent of adult Roma are estimated to be unemployed. A majority of Roma children do not complete primary school, very few continue to secondary school and even fewer reach university level. Functional illiteracy is</p>
<p>not uncommon among adult Roma. Health problems start earlier, there are life style related health problems, health problems dating back from the times before Roma were resident, and life expectancy is judged to be clearly below average. Living standards are lower than average. Children do not have full access to education in their mother tongue as stipulated in law, there is no or little mentioning of Roma as a national minority in school books. Adult Roma who wish to complete their primary education can not do so because of financial restrictions in the study grant system. Roma cultural institutions and media are few and with scarce resources and do not have a secure financial situation. The culture and language of Roma Travellers is endangered, much because of the stigma connected with being a Traveller. Roma are virtually absent from politics, their civil society organisations are weakly developed and they have no official representation as a minority, nor their own national organisation.</p>
<p>Discrimination is rampant. Attitudes towards Roma are more negative than towards any other group. They remain the most clearly discriminated group on the labour market at all stages: when they seek a job, during the interview, and in case they did get the job they risk losing it if their ethnicity becomes known. There is wide spread discrimination in the housing sector including when Roma wish to rent apartments in public as well as privately owned houses and when they wish to buy apartments. Roma are severely discriminated in public spaces such as shops, restaurants etc, and the Ombudsman for Discrimination has successfully brought a number cases to trial, but this is only the tip of the iceberg since Roma in general hesitate to file complaints, or are unaware of their rights. Hate crimes exist but the hidden statistics may be high. Also in the public sector, including the social and judicial sectors, there is evidence of institutional discrimination.</p>
<p>A number of strategies have been developed by Roma to counter the discrimination, ranging from hiding ones ethnicity (particularly when applying for jobs) to simply give up and accept dependency on welfare.</p>
<p>The situation for Roma in Sweden is thus not very different in nature compared to the rest of Europe. The level of exclusion may be different though, since the welfare systems assure that no-one, including marginalized Roma families, falls below a certain poverty line. Human and minority rights including antidiscriminatory laws and a number of institutions to ensure basic rights are in place, but</p>
<p>Roma access is limited because of the low level of education and lack of awareness of their rights.</p>
<p>The Delegations finds that the exclusion and the structural discrimination of Roma has deep roots, in Europe as a whole as well as in Sweden throughout the period of 500 years that Roma has been living in Sweden. Antiziganism has influenced laws and actions on behalf of the state, institutions, the church, the private sector and individual Swedes throughout these 500 years. Antiziganist legislation and state action led to among other things a closing of the border for Roma between 1914–1954 (meaning that no Roma was allowed to seek refuge from Hitlers persecutions), forced abductions of children and forced sterilizations especially hitting Roma Travellers, refusal for Roma families to settle in a muinicipality more than a few weeks at a time leading to Roma being denied the right to send children to school, denial of child allowances and denial of being registered to vote just to mention a few of the human rights violations of Roma during the past century.</p>
<p>Apart from creating an almost completely sealed bubble right in the middle of Swedish society of a Roma minority denied many of their basic rights, the historic antiziganist policies and remaining structural discrimination have created a deep-rooted lack of trust within the Roma minority towards the state and all public institutions in mainstream society. The delegation has found evidence of a deep confidence divide, which endangers all efforts to improve the situation.</p>
<p>We believe that very little will change if this trust divide is not addressed and if antiziganism is not attacked, and propose that a reconciliation process is initiated through the means of a truth commission with a mandate to uncover past abuses of the Roma minority in Sweden.</p>
<p>The present situation is unacceptable to a modern democracy and a welfare state that prides itself of promoting human rights and minority rights. The delegation believes that reforms only will not improve the situation, which is why we propose a political, financial and organisational push - a Swedish Roma Strategy. The strategy should be implemented and concluded during the course of 20 years. The Strategy has three over-arching goals:</p>
<p>• to close the welfare divide between Roma and mainstream society</p>
<p>• to reduce the power deficit of Roma</p>
<p>• to bridge the confidence gap and build Roma trust in state institutions and mainstream society</p>
<p>The delegation states a number of future goals that the National Strategy will help implement such as:</p>
<p>All Roma children shall complete primary school, adult roma illiteracy shall be abolished, Roma unemployment shall not be higher than average, life expectancy shall not be lower for Roma than average, Roma culture and cultural heritage shall be developed, protected and accessible and constitute a future area of Roma autonomy, there shall be Roma politicians and voter participation shall be equally high as for others, the Roma minority shall have their own national representation, antiziganism shall be abolished.</p>
<p>Reforms to help implement these goals are among many others: State subsidies for primary education allowing for teacher assistants and other support targeted for Roma children, financial support for adult Roma students, a set of instruments to help Roma youth find a job and a careeer upon leaving school, municipalities shall cooperate with the National Employment Board on targeted programs for labour market access for Roma, health information officers for national minorities should be established, the status of the Romani language shall be elevated and equal to territorial minority languages, a Roma-led committee for Roma culture will be established as an institutional home for Roma culture with a budget equal to the culture budget of the Sami minority, the state institution responsible for minority issues (at present the county administration of Stockholm) shall have a Roma democracy budget for voter education programs, dialogue with political parties on Roma political participation and continued dialogue with Roma representatives in order to produce a proposal for a national Roma representation, Sweden shall join the Dosta!campaign, the Ombudsman for Discrimination shall implement rights awareness programs for Roma.</p>
<p>The organisation to implement the National Roma Strategy is proposed to be a Secretariat for Roma Issues, partially modeled on the Finnish Roma Delegation and sorting directly under the</p>
<p>government, being a mix between an intragovernmental body and an authority and with a Roma representation on the board of no less than 50 percent, with a mandate to implement the strategy and coordinate the various programs and reforms of the National Strategy, but not executing them. The life-span shall be 20 years, equal to one generation. The delegation believes that the Roma babies born today shall have equal opportunities as they step into adult life 20 years from today – this is our vision.</p>
