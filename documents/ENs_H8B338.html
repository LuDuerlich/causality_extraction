<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The remit of the Inquiry has been to assess and propose how the Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2019 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law (the Directive) should be transposed into Swedish law. The remit has included proposing in what areas the new Swedish legislation should apply and how it should relate to other legislation. The remit has also included proposing necessary legal measures to implement the directive's requirements on internal and external reporting channels and follow-up of reporting.</p>
<h2>The Directive</h2>
<p>The Directive was adopted in October 2019 and must be transposed by 17 December 2021. The purpose of the Directive is to enhance the enforcement of Union law and policies in specific areas by laying down common minimum standards providing for a high level of protection of persons reporting breaches of Union law. The Directive prescribes that persons reporting breaches (reporting persons) must, under certain conditions, be protected against retaliation of various kinds. The Directive also requires legal entities of a certain size in the private and public sectors to establish specific internal reporting functions (internal reporting channels and procedures). In addition, competent authorities of the Member States shall be designated to having external functions for reporting breaches (external reporting channels and procedures).</p>
<h2>A new Act on reporting of wrongdoings</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Directive is mainly transposed through a new Act that replaces the existing Whistleblowing Act. The new Act should apply in all private and public organizations, i.e. not only in the areas and regarding the breaches that fall within the material scope of the Directive.</p>
<h2>The new Act should supplement and not replace sector-specific Union acts on the reporting of breaches</h2>
<p>Several regulations have been introduced into Swedish legislation on reporting of breaches of EU law, particularly in the area of financial services, products and markets, and prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing. It is proposed that these existing regulations shall remain. The new Act should not apply if there are deviating provisions in these regulations. The new Act should however supplement the existing regulations when a matter is not regulated in those sector-specific regulations.</p>
<h2>The Act should also supplement other legal protection for whistleblowers</h2>
<p>In Swedish law there are provisions that protect whistleblowers, inter alia, in the Constitutional Acts, the Employment Protection Act and the Co-determination Act. Protection can also be found in case law. The proposed protection should not limit the protection that already exists, but instead supplement it. It will thus be possible for a whistleblower to be compensated for damage due to retaliation both on the grounds of the new Act and other law. In effect, the applicable regulatory framework will be determined by which legal basis that the injured party chooses to bring his or her action.</p>
<h2>The meaning of the protection</h2>
<p>A reporting person should not be made liable for breaches of restrictions on disclosure of information, except in exceptional cases, i.e. breaches of a confidentiality clause in an agreement or a duty of confidentiality that follows from the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act. Exemptions from the freedom from liability are proposed if the reporting person discloses a secret document or violates a qualified duty of confidentiality in accordance with the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act, i.e. such a duty of confidentiality that takes precedence over the constitutional freedom to provide information for publication.</p>
<p>According to the proposal, a reporting person should not be made liable for the acquisition of or access to information, e.g. liability arising from the reporting person having violated an employer's restrictions on access to certain premises or information technology systems.</p>
<p>Furthermore, reporting persons must be entitled to remedies and compensation for damage from the person who exposes the reporting person to retaliation because of the reporting or has hindered or has tried to prevent reporting. However, the right to damages for retaliation does not apply if the reporting person has committed a criminal offence by reporting.</p>
<h2>The protection should include a wide personal scope</h2>
<p>The scope of persons to be protected includes workers, selfemployed persons, volunteers and trainees, persons belonging to the administrative, management or supervisory body of an undertaking, including non-executive members, and shareholders who are active in the undertaking. The protection should also apply before the work-based relationship has begun and after it has ended.</p>
<p>Protection should also be provided in cases where retaliation is directed at persons who facilitate in the reporting or are connected to the reporting person and at legal entities that the reporting person owns, works for or are otherwise connected with in a work-related context.</p>
<h2>Only information of public interest shall be protected</h2>
<p>The protection is proposed to apply when the reported information on wrongdoings is of public interest. This includes information on breaches of EU law that fall within the scope of the Directive, e.g. breaches of EU regulations in the financial market and in the environmental and data protection areas. However, the protection should not to be limited to reported information on breaches of EU law, but also include information on breaches of Swedish law. In some cases, the protection encompasses information that does not reveal breaches of any law, but which is nevertheless such that it is in the public interest that the information is disclosed. Information relating only to the reporting person's own working or employment conditions will be protected only in exceptional cases.</p>
<h2>Reporting of knowingly false information should not be protected</h2>
<p>The proposal requires that the reporting person has reasonable grounds to believe that the information on breaches reported was true at the time of reporting. With this requirement, protection will be provided even if the reporting person is mistaken about the accuracy of the information, if the person has reasonable grounds to believe that the information is true. However, no protection will be awarded if the person is knowingly reporting false information.</p>
<h2>Protection when reporting through reporting channels</h2>
<p>If the other conditions are fulfilled, a reporting person is protected if the person uses internal or external reporting channels when reporting. The person should be free to choose whether to first report through an internal reporting channel or to directly report through an external reporting channel.</p>
<h2>Protection will under certain conditions also be provided when reporting is done in other ways</h2>
<p>If the reporting is done in a different way than via internal or external reporting channels, protection will be provided under certain conditions. Protection should apply for internal reporting that is conducted in a manner other than through internal reporting channels if there are no such channels or if the available channels do not meet the requirements of the Act. External reporting to a public authority is proposed to be protected even if the reporting is not done via external reporting channels in some cases, e.g. if the reporting has first been done internally but no appropriate action was taken in response to the report. It is also suggested that public disclosures are protected in certain cases, e.g. if the reporting has been done to an authority, without the authority having taken reasonable follow-up measures in response to the report.</p>
<h2>Consultation with representatives or trade unions is given specific protection</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the protection applies when a person considers reporting and for that reason consults his or her trade union.</p>
<h2>Obligation to establish internal reporting channels</h2>
<p>Employers who at the start of the calendar year had 50 workers or more are according to the proposal obliged to establish internal reporting channels and procedures for reporting and follow-up. The reporting channels should be made available to reporting persons under the supervision and direction of the employer and for reporting persons otherwise working with the employer. The employers are obliged to choose an impartial person or department competent for handling the reporting channels and follow-up on the reports.</p>
<p>Employers must ensure that there is clear and easily accessible information regarding the procedures for reporting and regarding the protection of persons providing information. Furthermore, it should be possible to report orally, either by telephone or a physical meeting, or in writing. There should be acknowledgement of receipt of the report and the reporting person should receive diligent follow-up and feedback.</p>
<p>Employers with 50 to 249 workers and local authorities and regions should be able to share reporting channels.</p>
<h2>It should be possible to deviate from the rules on internal reporting channels in collective agreements</h2>
<p>It should be possible to make deviations from the requirements on the design of the reporting channels through a collective agreement that has been concluded or approved by a trade union on the national level. However, the deviations may only be made provided that the agreement respects the rights of reporting persons and persons concerned referred to in the Directive.</p>
<h2>The Swedish Work Environment Authority shall supervise the establishment of internal reporting channels</h2>
<p>The Swedish Work Environment Authority is proposed to supervise that employers meet the obligations in regard to establishing internal reporting channels and procedures. For this purpose, the Authority should have powers to request the information and documents needed for the supervision. Furthermore, the Authority should be allowed to decide on necessary injunctions in order for the employer to fulfil its obligations under the Act.</p>
<h2>Competent authorities shall be appointed to establish external reporting channels</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that certain public authorities should be designated as competent authorities and obliged to establish external reporting channels and procedures for receiving, providing feedback on and following up reports on breaches of law within the areas of the material scope of the Directive. The authorities are the Swedish Competition Authority, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, the Swedish Board for Accreditation and Conformity Assessment (Swedac), the National Inspectorate of Strategic Products, the Swedish Transport Agency, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management, the Swedish Chemicals Agency, the National Food Agency, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority, the Swedish Board of Agriculture, the Medical Products Agency, the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, the Public Health Authority of Sweden, the Swedish Consumer Agency, the Swedish Data Protection Authority, the Swedish Economic Crime Authority, the Swedish Tax Agency, the Swedish Competition Authority and the Government Offices of Sweden.</p>
<p>Similar requirements should be imposed on external reporting channels as for internal reporting channels.</p>
<h2>There should be an obligation to keep records</h2>
<p>There are requirements in regard to keeping records of the reports submitted via internal or external reporting channels. Oral reports received at a physical meeting must be documented and stored. Other oral reports can be documented and stored. Written reports must be stored. It should thus be possible to use the reports and records later, e.g. as evidence in court proceedings or in enforcement actions. However, the reports and records must be deleted no later than two years after the follow-up of a report. Access to personal data in follow-up matters should be limited to special personnel who need the information in order to fulfil their duties.</p>
<h2>Information that can identify the reporting person or other individuals must be protected</h2>
<p>Confidentiality should apply within a public authority for information on follow-up and measures because of reporting, if the information has been submitted to the authority through an internal or external reporting channel and the information enables identification of the reporting person. Under the same conditions, information by which another individual can be identified should be confidential, if it is not obvious that the information can be disclosed without the individual suffering damage. Furthermore, confidentiality shall apply for information on trade secrets handled by the competent authorities. There should also be a duty of confidentiality in the private sector that obliges a person who fulfils a task in handling a follow-up case not to disclose information that can reveal who the reporting person or any other person is.</p>
<h2>There should be information and advice</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that government grants should be provided to the social partners and other non-governmental organizations in order to provide information and advice. The information and advice shall relate to which reporting is covered by the Act's protection, which reporting channels may be most suitable to use, what alternative procedures and reporting options are available if the information is not covered by the Act and the rights of persons concerned.</p>
