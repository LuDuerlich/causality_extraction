<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>Access to energy is fundamental to the production of all goods and services, both on an industrial and household scale. This means that all businesses, organisations and households are linked to one or more energy markets. The purpose of this study is to clarify and analyse, from an economic perspective, how the Swedish energy markets work and to suggest measures to improve the functioning of these markets in various ways.</p>
<p>The primary focus is on the electricity and district heating markets and markets for emission allowances (EU ETS) and electricity certificates. The oil, gas and coal markets are dealt with more generally, looking mainly at their impact on Swedish electricity and district heating prices. The biofuels market is briefly discussed in the section on the district heating market.</p>
<p>The overarching question is whether Swedish energy markets have the structure and regulations conducive to efficient energy production and distribution. This also includes whether the different forms of energy are traded at prices that reflect the costs involved. This means that factors such as competition, regulation, policy levers and pricing are central to the analysis.</p>
<p>Sweden is a country with high energy use per capita and per unit of GDP. The cold climate, long transport distances and a high material standard of living are key factors behind Sweden’s high energy use. However, the single most important factor is that energy-intensive industries, such as the pulp and paper and iron and steel industries, account for a large share of Sweden’s business sector output.</p>
<p>The first post-war decades were marked by rapid economic growth, especially in sectors with high energy use per unit of output. As a result, energy use, particularly electricity use, increased faster than GDP. But after the oil price hikes of 1973 and 1979, growth in energy use slowed and since the early 1990s, growth in both total energy use and electricity use has been insignificant. Meanwhile, oil has almost completely been phased out of the Swedish energy system, except for in the transport sector. Over the next decade, Sweden’s energy use is expected to increase very slowly.</p>
<p>International prices of oil, gas and coal</p>
<p>For a long time, expected and actual developments in the international oil market have led to rising prices. At the same time, gas prices have been linked to oil prices, while coal prices have been determined by supply and demand at the international coal market. However, the rapid exploitation of shale gas in the United States, the ‘shale gas revolution’, has rapidly created new price conditions in the international markets for fossil fuels. Today, the prevailing expectations are about increasing supplies rather than increasing demand. The result will be stagnating or even falling fossil fuel prices over the next decade.</p>
<p>The electricity market</p>
<p>The electricity market is in many respects the most important energy market. The use of electricity accounts for a large and growing share of the energy used. The electricity market is also complex and, perhaps for this reason, often much debated. A large part of this report therefore concentrates on the electricity market. From an economic perspective, two basic conditions must be met for a market to be described as efficient. One is that there must always be a (finite) price at which the commodity in question can be bought or sold. In this regard, the deregulated electricity market is definitely efficient. The second condition is that prices should be set equal to the relevant marginal costs, including environmental costs, and that these costs should be as low as possible.</p>
<p>Theory and practice suggest that competition among a sufficient number of producers leads to both cost-effectiveness and little or no difference between price and marginal cost. The chief obstacle to this type of efficiency is that one or several producers, by virtue of their size, could have and abuse market power. The question of the existence and abuse of market power is therefore a subject of detailed analysis in this report.</p>
<p>A central conclusion is that since the Nordic electricity markets are highly integrated, no power company operating in Sweden has any substantial market power. However, a sustained high level of competition in the electricity market is dependent on transmission grid and interconnector capacity remaining sufficiently high. For this reason, consideration should be given to lowering the required return on investments in transmission grids and interconnectors. More specifically, the normal required rate of return could be reduced using a ‘competition bonus’. The appropriate size of this bonus and how it could best be calculated are questions that deserve further considerations.</p>
<p>Although the electricity market works well from an economic perspective, it faces major challenges. The most important one is the extensive expansion of wind power. The challenge is that wind power production cannot be predicted in the same way as production in conventional power plants. This increases the risk of power shortages during periods of peak electricity demand. At the same time, increased wind power production results in shorter operating times and consequently a weaker financial position for conventional power plants.</p>
<p>The need for ‘capacity markets’ when the wind power component increases is being discussed internationally. The conclusion of the analysis performed here, however, is that such a measure would mean that the responsibility for power industry investments would in effect be taken over by the system operator (the Swedish National Grid). Instead, greater acceptance of periods with temporarily very high electricity prices is recommended. This would strengthen incentives for power companies to maintain sufficient capacity during peak consumption times while creating incentives on the demand side for greater short-term flexibility in electricity consumption.</p>
<p>Regulation of network charges</p>
<p>End-user electricity prices do not only depend on production prices. Taxes play a major role, but network charges are also important. Regarding network charges, the issue is not market efficiency but rather the design of regulations governing the revenue frameworks of the network companies. A new model for regulating network operations is currently being implemented. An important parameter included in this model is the real rate of return allowed on the network companies’ capital base.</p>
<p>In an economic perspective, this rate of return should be sufficiently high, but not higher than necessary, to attract the capital needed for investment in electricity networks. The real interest rates that the Swedish Energy Markets Inspectorate recommends are at a level that is likely to ensure high-quality Swedish electricity networks. Having said that, the new regulatory model may lead to higher prices for electricity network services in different parts of the country.</p>
<p>The market for electricity certificates</p>
<p>Subsidies for renewable electricity are primarily organised through trade in the system for electricity certificates. Under the system, producers of renewable electricity receive one electricity certificate per MWh of electricity supplied. This certificate can be sold in a market where the buyers are electricity trading companies that, on behalf of their clients, must have electricity certificates corresponding to a certain proportion of the electricity used. Thus the market-determined price of certificates is equal to the subsidy per MWh of renewable electricity produced that is paid to the producer.</p>
<p>Although the system overall works well, it should be altered so that subsidies for renewable electricity cannot be given during periods when spot prices are very low or negative. It is also important to thoroughly evaluate the subsidy system’s impact on the cost of renewable electricity. The aim of the system is, or at least should be, to subsidise the various forms of renewable electricity until economies of scale and ‘learning by doing’ have made these alternatives perform competitively under market</p>
<p>conditions. If it turns out that such cost-reducing effects do not occur, the subsidy system should be reconsidered.</p>
<p>Profitability of the power industry</p>
<p>With stagnating demand and significant additional capacity in the form of wind power and a new nuclear power plant in Finland, producer prices for electricity will come under pressure. From an economic perspective, this indicates that the capacity of the power industry has expanded too fast relative to growth in demand. For the power industry, the lower prices mean lower profitability, which may have a negative impact on innovation and technological development in energy production. Subsidies for renewable electricity are in themselves support for innovation and technological development in the power industry. At the same time, it is important to see this support in a perspective that is broader than climate policy objectives. It is also in the public interest that the power industry is sufficiently profitable to cater for its own dynamic long-term development.</p>
<p>District heating</p>
<p>District heating plays a very important role in Sweden’s energy system. The production of district heating is among the areas where the use of biofuels has been able to rapidly expand and replace oil as a fuel for residential and commercial heating. However, in recent years, district heating has been facing competition from local heat production. Among other things, this has changed the demand distribution over time, with relatively higher demand during the coldest winter period. In the short run, this is a pricing problem but it could eventually become a threat to the profitability of district heating companies.</p>
<p>The district heating market consists of a large number of local markets, most of which are small relative to the production in a plant that effectively exploits economies of scale. Since the scope for effective competition in the district heating system is very limited, each individual system should be regarded as a vertically integrated natural monopoly. For this reason, district heating, just</p>
<p>like electricity networks, should be subject to regulations ensuring that consumer interests are safeguarded. The appropriate design of these regulations should be examined separately. However, from an economic perspective, it is important that district heating regulations are formulated so that prices reflect relevant marginal costs, i.e. that prices in winter reflect the cost of ensuring that sufficient capacity is available during this period.</p>
<p>Need for reform</p>
<p>All markets must change as supply and demand conditions change. This also applies to markets that, like electricity and district heating markets, rely on a certain infrastructure and have regulations largely determined by the Government. The most important conclusion of this study is that the need for political interventions in the Swedish energy markets is limited.</p>
<p>As regards the Government’s role in the future development of the energy markets, the analysis conducted in this study has resulted in four proposals summarised in the following points:</p>
<p>– Introduce a ‘competition bonus’ on investments in transmission networks and transmission interconnections that can safeguard or increase competition in the electricity market.</p>
<p>– Redesign the subsidies for renewable electricity so that they cannot be used during periods when spot prices are very low or negative.</p>
<p>– Carefully evaluate the support for renewable electricity to identify its impact on the costs for the various alternatives available.</p>
<p>– Introduce regulation of district heating using regulation of electricity networks as a model.</p>
<p>In terms of the public debate on the electricity market and future studies of this market, it would be valuable if the Swedish Energy Agency, in addition to these measures, would change its electricity market statistics so that they consistently cover the entire Nordic electricity market. In light of the developments in the electricity market, it is now misleading to talk about ‘the Swedish electricity</p>
<p>market’. From an economic point of view, the relevant market is the integrated Nordic electricity market.</p>
