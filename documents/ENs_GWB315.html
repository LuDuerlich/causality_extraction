<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The main remit of the inquiry chair is to examine the conditions for giving older people and persons with disabilities more opportunity to choose their provider of social services. The inquiry chair is to present proposals for a free choice system that is geared to Swedish and Community legislation on public procurement and that is easy to apply, increases choice and influence for older people and persons with disabilities and promotes a diversity of providers.</p>
<p>To make it easier for municipalities to go over to a free choice system, the Government has set aside SEK 300 million for grants to stimulate and accelerate implementation. The remit of the inquiry chair includes proposing how to use this incentive grant.</p>
<p>In supplementary terms of reference the inquiry chair has also been instructed to clarify whether legal conditions exist to also use the free choice system proposed by the inquiry chair for elderly and disabled care in health care.</p>
<h2>New act on free choice systems</h2>
<p>The inquiry chair proposes the introduction of a new act, the act on free choice systems. The act is intended to function as a voluntary tool for municipalities and county councils that want to competition test services provided in-house so as to be able to transfer the choice of provider to the user. The proposed act is an alternative to the Public Procurement Act (2007:1091) and can be applied to health care services and social services, i.e. B services, category 25 in annex 3 to the Public Procurement Act.</p>
<h2>Alternatives to in-house provision of services</h2>
<p>The inquiry chair establishes that there is a contractual relationship between the public authority that is the buyer of the services and the supplier of the services, and this means that one of the above two acts must be applied when competition testing in-house provision. The alternatives open to a public authority are therefore to - run the service  in-house; - make agreements with external suppliers for the provision of services after a procurement under the Public Procurement Act; or - make agreements with external suppliers under the act on free choice systems.</p>
<p>The purpose of the public authority in competition testing the services will determine which act is applied. The act on free choice systems is suitable when the authority’s purpose is to move power from politicians to citizens, to increase the choice and influence of users and to promote a diversity of providers.</p>
<p>It is the public authority that decides whether to apply the act on free choice systems and, if so, for what services. Moreover, the authority decides what requirements prospective providers of services must meet before agreements can be made.</p>
<h2>Requirements concerning providers</h2>
<p>One important part of the political process in applying the act on free choice systems is deciding what requirements to specify for prospective providers of social services or health care. Over and above the fundamental requirement that the service has to be conducted in accordance with current law, there are a number of other requirements that municipalities and county councils can set up on condition that they comply with the principles of Community law that are applicable in this context, i.e. non-discrimination, transparency, predictability, mutual recognition and proportionality. One question that the political leadership must decide about is quality requirements. Other requirements that it is relevant to set up for suppliers can include requirements concerning the level of education of staff and managers, liability insurance, financial capacity, cooperation between the provider and the authority, R&D cooperation, crisis and disaster preparedness and accessibility.</p>
<p>The list of requirements may look completely different depending on the service being bought and the aims of the public authority. The effects of the requirements set up must be analysed in advance so as to be able to attain objectives specified for the free choice system. The higher the requirements set, the fewer the companies that will be interested in an agreement with the authority. Small businesses, and therefore also women entrepreneurs, are seldom able to live up to high levels of requirements concerning financial capacity, for example.</p>
<p>All requirements have to be stated in the contract documents.</p>
<h2>Contract documents</h2>
<p>When applying the act on free choice systems, the public authority must specify in the contract documents what requirements the provider must meet for an agreement to be concluded. In addition, the authority also has to state the payment that the supplier will receive for providing a particular service. The basis of the free choice system is that there is no price competition between suppliers. The public authority lays down the price in advance. All providers, including, in principle, the in-house provider, will be paid according to the same principles. The design of the payment can vary depending on the service being bought; the main thing is for it to be transparent and non-discriminatory, i.e. the same for everyone.</p>
<p>In addition, there should be a description of the service, contact information, monitoring, follow-up and control rules and the other contractual terms and conditions. Over and above the type of requirement set out above, this refers to rules on the term of agreements, rules for the amendment of contractual conditions, the duty to provide information, the monitoring and follow-up of the service, cancellation of the agreement due to a breach of contract and the possibility for the supplier to cancel the agreement if, for instance, it does not succeed in attracting enough users.</p>
<h2>Continuous advertising</h2>
<p>To give interested providers access to information that the authority has introduced or is planning to introduce or change a free choice system, the act contains a duty for the public authority to advertise in a national database. The contract documents will have to be available in the database. Under the proposal of the inquiry chair, the database will be administered by the National Financial Management Authority. In contrast to the position for public procurement, free choice systems will be advertised continuously.</p>
<p>The main purpose of the database is to make it easier for providers to find municipalities and county councils that have introduced a free choice system. Another purpose is to simplify the exchange of experience between authorities that are considering the system or want to develop it.</p>
<p>It is proposed that advertising be compulsory in the national database but can also take place in other appropriate media.</p>
<h2>Application and award of contracts</h2>
<p>Suppliers interested in providing services in the authority’s free choice system submit their application to the authority. The authority assesses whether the providers that have applied meet the requirements in the contract documents. If so, the supplier is entitled to sign an agreement with the authority. Unlike under the Public Procurement Act, the tenders do not have to be assessed according to the principles of “most advantageous in financial terms” or “lowest price”. All providers that meet the requirements in the contract documents are admitted to the system. An agreement under civil law is signed between the authority and the provider.</p>
<h2>Review</h2>
<p>One of the fundamental requirements in Community law is the right to have your case heard. The proposed act on free choice systems therefore contains the possibility of requesting a review by a general court. The court has to order correction in cases where the public authority has breached the fundamental principles of equal and non-discriminatory treatment or some other provision of the act. A correction can also be sought if an authority does not approve a provider because the authority makes the assessment that the provider does not meet the requirements in the contract documents. In that case, the provider can request a review of the authority’s decision by the county administrative court. For the court to order correction, the applicant, i.e. a provider who has not yet been approved in the system, must show that it has suffered damage or may suffer damage as a result of the incorrect action of the authority.</p>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p>Under the proposed act, the public authority is responsible for the user obtaining adequate information about the free choice system and about all the providers the user can choose between – including the authority's own in-house service. The information has to be objective, relevant, easy to understand, readily accessible and, above all, comparable concerning different providers. The information has to be in writing and be available both in printed form and on the municipality’s website and it has to be formulated on the basis of the needs of the individual. Certain information making it possible to compare the different providers must be included in the information material: examples are the education and competence of staff.</p>
<h2>Choice of provider and no-choice alternative</h2>
<p>The individual user has to be supported by the authority in choosing a provider. The authority is responsible for assisting the individual and explaining what the freedom to choose entails and what providers are available. Measures taken under the Social Services Act build on a decision to provide assistance and in these cases the assistance officer has an important role to play. In the social services it is the public authority that has contact with the providers and makes sure that the user’s choice is put into effect.</p>
<p>For people who are not capable of choosing by themselves, or who want help from someone else in making their choice, there are rules on deputies, representatives and legal assistance as in ordinary cases when free choice systems have not been introduced.</p>
<p>The choice is an opportunity for the user. A person who does not want to choose, will not have to do so. In these cases, the user will be referred to the no-choice alternative decided in advance by the public authority and described in the authority’s information material. The same quality requirements apply to the no-choice alternative as to the other providers.</p>
<p>The individual also has to be given the chance to change provider in a simple way. It is the individual’s opportunity to choose and choose again that is the very core of the system and that is intended to help to maintain and further develop the quality of the services included.</p>
<h2>Monitoring, follow-up and checks</h2>
<p>One very important factor for a functioning free choice system and for the confidence of the individual in the system is that monitoring of and checks on both external suppliers and the in-house service functions well. It is the public authority that is responsible for checking that all the requirements specified in the contract documents are met throughout the term of the contract. If this is not the case, the authority has to take the necessary measures and ultimately cancel the agreement</p>
<h2>Social services and free choice systems</h2>
<p>If a municipality chooses to introduce a free choice system, this affects how the municipality makes its choice of providers and the system enables the user to have access to more providers and greater diversity concerning the content of the services involved. But the act on free choice systems does not affect the responsibility of the social welfare committee for services and the right of the individual user to assistance is neither extended nor restricted.</p>
<p>However, in its present form, the provision in the Social Services Act on when a decision on assistance has to be executed can restrict the possibility of the individual user to choose a provider. To prevent this, the inquiry chair proposes adding a provision to the Social Services Act allowing the social welfare committee to wait before executing a decision on assistance. A consequential amendment must also be made to clarify that in certain cases the county administrative board is not to apply for a special charge. These amendments are necessary to enable a user to choose to wait before receiving a service, so as to receive it from a particular provider, without the municipality risking a special charge for a decision that has not been executed. It will only be possible to execute a decision at a later time at the request of the individual user. If the decision has not been executed within one year, it has to be reconsidered. The inquiry chair proposes that the National Board of Health and Welfare be instructed to follow up the application of the proposed provisions.</p>
<p>The proposed act on free choice systems does not affect the activities of the social services in a way that results in any need for more detailed control and monitoring. However, when free choice systems are introduced, greater demands may need to be made on the statistics collected regularly about social services in areas including their level of detail and frequency. According to the inquiry chair, the matter should be transferred to the inquiry chair with the remit (under terms of reference 2007:146) of reviewing the collection and publication of statistics concerning the local government sector.</p>
<h2>Quality</h2>
<p>Part of the remit of the inquiry chair is to propose national requirements and quality criteria that have to be fulfilled before a provider is approved in the free choice system. The inquiry chair also has to make an assessment of whether it is possible for a municipality to set up additional requirements, over and above the national requirements and quality criteria, for providers operating in that particular municipality.</p>
<p>The introduction of the proposed act on free choice systems means that there will not be any doubt as to whether or not there is a contractual relationship between the municipality and the supplier. The inquiry chair therefore considers that the desire for national requirements and quality criteria no longer has the same relevance. The inquiry chair has therefore chosen not to present any proposals on this matter.</p>
<p>The work on quality indicators being done by the National Board of Health and Welfare and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions may eventually make it possible to set up certain specified national quality criteria for the activities of the social services concerning older people and persons with disabilities. In the view of the inquiry chair, these requirements should then apply to all providers.</p>
<p>The inquiry chair has not found any obstacle to municipalityspecific quality requirements as long as these requirements are on a level with, and do not go beyond, the national requirements in current legislation. The conditions set up must also fulfil all the Community law principles that are applicable in this context, i.e. non-discrimination, transparency, predictability, mutual recognition and proportionality.</p>
<h2>Extra services</h2>
<p>An extra service can both be a service that is included in a decision on assistance but that the user wants to extend in some way, for example the frequency with which the service is provided, and a service that is not included in the decision on assistance. Extra services are based on an agreement between the user and the provider and are paid for personally by the user.</p>
<p>The terms of reference for the inquiry state that the proposal prsented by the inquiry chair has to secure and, if possible, facilitate, offers of such extra services.</p>
<p>The inquiry chair considers that, in itself, the act on free choice systems facilitates offers of ‘extra services’ by external providers. However, local government powers should not be extended to also enable municipalities to offer and carry out such services. An option for a municipality to provide extra services can have negative consequences for small enterprises, including women’s enterprise, something that the act on free choice systems is intended to encourage instead. Above all, no general interest is served by municipalities taking on this kind of activity.</p>
<p>Some of the services that are extra services can also be practical services under the Act (2006:492) on municipal powers to supply practical services for older people. In July 2008, the Act will have been in force for two years and, in the assessment of the inquiry chair, a follow-up and review of the Act should then be conducted.</p>
<p>Both to get a picture of what effect the Act has had on the services market and, especially, to clarify its effect for users. If the Act on municipal powers to supply practical services for older people is to be retained, there is a great need for a clarification of the dividing line between this act and the Social Services Act. A clarification is probably necessary in order to ensure that a reasonable standard of living is really guaranteed within the framework of assistance under the Social Services Act and to ensure that individuals are not referred incorrectly to practical services or the purchase of extra services.</p>
<h2>Municipal cooperation on a free choice system and providers in another municipality</h2>
<p>The inquiry chair has not found any legal obstacles concerning cooperation between municipalities during the process of building up a free choice system, when developing quality criteria and payment systems, etc. It is more problematic for municipalities to cooperate on the provision of services. The possibility of cooperating in these cases, and the scope for individual users to choose a provider outside their home municipality, are affected by the rules in the Social Services Act on the responsibility of the residence municipality.</p>
<p>Municipalities that introduce the free choice system proposed by the inquiry chair will be able to conclude agreements with providers of home care services outside the municipality, even when the provider is another municipality, and users will have the option of choosing a provider from outside their home municipality in cases where there is an agreement. However, as regards users who need home care services provided by a municipality other than their home municipality, during a temporary stay in that municipality, it is not possible for the home municipality to conclude an agreement with the municipality of temporary residence. An amendment to the legislation could increase user choice and make it easier for older people and persons with disabilities to stay in other municipalities and also make it possible for municipalities to cooperate in these cases.</p>
<p>In the view of the inquiry chair, the question of the need for amendments to the legislation should be transferred to the inquiry that has the remit under terms of reference 2008:13 of reviewing the rules in the Social Services Act on the responsibilities of the residence municipality.</p>
<p>The assessment of the inquiry chair is that the proposed free choice system extends the possibilities for municipal cooperation concerning special forms of housing. The inquiry chair has considered whether to propose adjustments to the provisions of the Social Services Act on the responsibility of the residence municipality in order to further extend user choice concerning special forms of housing in other municipalities, but has found that the negative effects can too large. The views of the inquiry chair on the matter should also be transferred to the inquiry that the Government has appointed to review the rules in the Social Services Act on the responsibilities of the residence municipality.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate cooperation between municipalities, the inquiry chair sees it as important to realise the proposals of the inquiry on local government powers on the form of cooperation called a ‘joint board’.</p>
<h2>Incentive grants</h2>
<p>The Government has set aside SEK 300 million to make it easier for and encourage municipalities to introduce a free choice system. The inquiry chair proposes that SEK 10 million of these funds be allocated to the National Financial Management Authority for the construction of a national database for advertising free choice systems. The National Board of Health and Welfare and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions are each allocated SEK 5 million for advice and support to the municipalities in applying the new act. The remaining SEK 280 million are distributed among the municipalities applying for incentive grants and that will start, in 2009, work to investigate the conditions for introducing a free choice system in their municipality. Applications for and payments of incentive grants will take place in the autumn and be concluded by 31 December 2008 at the latest.</p>
<h2>Financial consequences of the free choice system</h2>
<p>In the view of the inquiry chair, the proposed act on free choice systems will not result in tangible financial consequences for public authorities that choose to apply it. On the other hand, the act can be expected to result in savings for the courts system as one anticipated effect of the act is a decrease in the number of reviews compared with the number currently being conducted under the Public Procurement Act.</p>
<p>The proposed amendments to the Social Services Act are also expected to result in savings – for the courts system because the number of cases concerning special charges will decrease and for the county administrative boards, where the quantity of cases concerning applications for special charges ought to be reduced.</p>
<p>The proposed national database is expected to result in costs for the National Financial Management Authority. To cover the Authority’s costs the inquiry chair proposes that SEK 10 million out of the SEK 300 million incentive grant be assigned to the Authority.</p>
<h2>Other consequences</h2>
<p>The proposed act on free choice systems clarifies the legal position in an area previously marked by great uncertainty. By itself this clarification may result in greater interest among municipalities and county councils in using free choice systems. The proposed act gives municipalities and county councils another tool that they can use in a situation where they want to competition test services provided in-house in order to transfer the choice of provider to the user. The proposal does not have any negative effects on local selfgovernment.</p>
<p>The act on free choice systems is expected to result in greater choice and more influence for older people and persons with disabilities. The intention is that the opportunity for individuals to exercise choice will make publicly funded services more responsive to the needs and wishes of the individual user.</p>
<p>For business the proposed act will mean simpler rules and this can lead to better opportunities for companies to operate and develop by being able to compete in a simpler way with municipalities’ in-house services. This also applies to NGOs.</p>
<p>Free choice systems favour diversity and provide greater opportunities for small businesses, values-based activities and cooperatives of various kinds to enter the market. A majority of staff in health care and social care are women and the proposed act gives them a completely new opportunity of starting a business in the industry where they have previously been employees.</p>
<h2>Health care</h2>
<p>Responsibility for health care is shared by central government, the county councils and the municipalities. Central government has overall responsibility for health care policy. The county councils and the municipalities are responsible for meeting the health care needs of the population and of patients. They have to ensure that their inhabitants receive health care in hospitals, care facilities, special forms of housing and their own homes. The main task of the county councils and the municipalities is to commission and fund the activities to be carried out.</p>
<p>With the exception of compulsory mental care and forensic mental care, heath care does not have to be provided by public bodies. In addition, with certain exceptions, other tasks that involve the exercise of public authority may not be carried out by private providers of health care, even when financed with public money.</p>
<p>Interest in free choice systems in health care is growing in Sweden. What distinguishes the systems that have been developed is that they place even more focus on the inhabitant than in the past. The characteristic feature of these systems is that they give inhabitants themselves the opportunity to choose providers and that, if they are not satisfied with their choice, inhabitants can choose again.</p>
<p>In the view of the inquiry chair, the proposed act on free choice systems can also be used in health care. In practice, a few of the provisions will be applied in different ways in health care and the social services respectively, but this does not result in any need for statutory regulation – either in the proposed act or in any other statute.</p>
<p>Municipal health care and social services are provided in close cooperation and, in the view of the inquiry chair, it is essential for these services that municipal health care can also be included in a free choice system.</p>
<h2>Implementation of the proposals</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes that new act on free choice systems and the amendments to the Social Services Act enter into force on 1 January 2009.</p>
