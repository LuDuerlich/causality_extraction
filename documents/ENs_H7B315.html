<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Some of the inquiry’s proposals in brief:</h2>
<p>• Common to several of our proposals is to provide citizens with improved possibilities to make  well-informed decisions if they consider seeking complementary or alternative care. Several of the proposals address safety issues in complementary and alternative care.</p>
<p>• A policy to introduce new therapeutic methods in healthcare should be neutral as to origin. This means that complementary methods should be introduced under the same conditions as other methods. We propose that the government commissions the Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services to evaluate complementary methods that may be candidates to be introduced in healthcare.</p>
<p>• To increase insights into complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in healthcare, we propose that a short course on CAM is introduced in the education of several categories of healthcare professionals. The aim is that patients and healthcare professionals should be able to discuss questions on complementary and alternative care and thus facilitate patients’ possibilities to make  well-informed decisions. We propose that the National Board of Health and Welfare and the Swedish Higher Education Authority are commissioned to promote this introduction. We also suggest that the National Board of Health and Welfare is commissioned to develop teaching material on CAM aimed at healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>• We present several proposals to improve citizens’ access to independent information on complementary and alternative care, including descriptions of methods used, at the national information website 1177 Vårdguiden. Improved consumerdirected information on complementary and alternative care with focus on consumer rights should be available at the website of the Swedish Consumer Agency.</p>
<p>• In an additional directive, the inquiry has been commissioned to review parts of the Patient Safety Act that address issues on complementary and alternative care. This will be presented separately in our final report.</p>
<p>In April 2017, the Swedish government appointed a special investigator to explore several issues concerning “care and treatment other than that conducted in the established care”. The inquiry was titled The CAM Inquiry, CAM being the abbreviation of Complementary and Alternative Medicine.</p>
<p>In July 2018, the inquiry received an additional task to review the paragraph of the Patient Safety Act that concerns treatment by nonlicensed therapists (formerly “the quackery law”) and the accompanying penal provisions. This will be reported separately later.</p>
<p>In this summary, we first report on the inquiry’s considerations and proposals according to our specific terms of reference. Then, we describe the background material we have collected, including mappings, reviews of previous governmental inquiries, published material and interviews with stakeholders in the area. Lastly, we describe how the inquiry has worked. Definition used by the enquiry are presented in Fact Box 1.</p>
<h2>Fact Box 1. Definitions</h2>
<p>To comply with the government’s terms of reference, we have used operational definitions. Our definitions are close to those used in Norwegian and Danish legislation. The definition of healthcare is that of the Patient Safety Act.</p>
<p>Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is the conceptual and knowledge basis of complementary and alternative care (CAC). Complementary and alternative medicine/care means healthcare-related methods and other interventions that are entirely or mostly applied outside of healthcare.</p>
<p>Integrative care  aims at integrating complementary methods with the methods used in healthcare under certain conditions.</p>
<p>Healthcare  is care provided by professionals that are subject to inspection by IVO, the Health and Social Care Inspectorate, and is based on either scientific evidence or proven experience among the healthcare professions.</p>
<h2>Task 1 and 2: Review of the law</h2>
<p>From the terms of reference: … review if the right for those who are not licensed healthcare professionals to treat certain serious mental disorders should be restricted.</p>
<p>From the terms of reference added in July 2018: … review the regulations in the 5th and 10th chapters of the Patient</p>
<p>Safety Act and other relevant regulations […]. The investigator should also propose bills that are judged to be required.</p>
<p>Our proposals related to these two tasks will be presented separately in our final report.</p>
<h2>Task 3 and 4: Research and methods of evaluation</h2>
<p>From the terms of reference: … perform a mapping of present results of research and ongoing research as to methods of treatment used out of healthcare. and … to map what different methods of evaluation that are used for [CAM] treatments. In addition, it should be reported to what extent the alternative methods that are subject to clinical testing in accordance with conventional practice and what possible obstacles to such testing that may exist.</p>
<p>We have commissioned a bibliometric analysis (qualitative analysis of the scientific literature) and interviewed stakeholders in this field, including researchers and funders of research. Worldwide, at least 5 000 articles and book chapters on CAM and CAC are published each year. This represents 0.5-0.6 percent of all publications in medicine, health, and adjacent topics. Swedish researchers publish around 70 articles per year. A fifth of these publications are on clinical trials of CAM systems or CAM methods. Research on body-mind therapies and acupuncture dominate. Topics in Swedish CAM research are similar to those of international research, with the exception of a greater focus on women’s health and disease in Swedish research.</p>
<p>Swedish CAM research groups are, with a few exceptions, small. Collaborations between Swedish CAM researchers are strikingly sparse, and interdisciplinary research is uncommon. Of the most cited Swedish articles, few are on primary research.</p>
<p>Systematic reviews of the international literature show large numbers of scientific publications on certain types of CAM therapy, in particular acupuncture, homeopathy and body-mind therapies. Because of methodological problems and diverging results, it has been difficult to draw definite conclusions.</p>
<p>The Swedish Research Council, the Karolinska Institute and the Ekhaga Foundation are leading funders of Swedish CAM research. Most stakeholders in CAM research that we have interviewed consider insufficient funding to be the greatest obstacle. With the exception of the Ekhaga Foundation and the Sjöberg Foundation, research funding organisations that we have interviewed refute the idea of earmarked funding of CAM research.</p>
<p>Our inquiry was not commissioned to present proposals in the area of CAM research. We present, however, one proposal that seems to be relatively easy to realise: – some of the national quality registers in healthcare could include CAC variables that may serve to promote knowledge on CAM methods.</p>
<p>Many of the CAM proponents we have met have emphasised that the research methods used in today’s research in medicine and health are not well suited for the CAM area. Instead of clinical trials, they want to see more individual narratives and other types of qualitative research and more emphasis on observational studies. Concomitantly, we have met researchers in the CAM area who have underlined the importance of controlled trials on the effects of CAM methods. CAM practitioners also emphasise that they should be involved in the research. The CAMbrella Project funded by the European Union (EU) has developed a roadmap for European CAM research.</p>
<h2>Task 5: Policy to introduce CAM methods in healthcare</h2>
<p>From the terms of reference: … propose a policy to evaluate and regulate therapeutic methods that do not belong to established healthcare today but that, after evaluation, could be a valuable component of such care.</p>
<p>The term science and proven experience  is used in The Patient Act and The Patient Safety Act to describe the basis for healthcare. However, the term has not been defined. Science and experience often develop in interaction. In the Swedish system for governance by knowledge, there are structures to evaluate the strength of the scientific support and proven experience.</p>
<p>CAM proponents as well as proponents of evidence-based medicine (EBM) in healthcare emphasise outcomes that are important to patients. In addition, EBM proponents usually underline that therapeutic methods should not contradict commonly accepted science in, for instance, biophysics, biochemistry, physiology or psychology (a plausibility criterion).</p>
<p>When assessing any therapy, questions on unspecific effects arise. This applies to methods in healthcare as well as in complementary and alternative medicine. Unspecific effects (placebo effects in a broad sense) may also be regarded as biologically beneficial and an asset to be taken advantage of in healthcare and complementary and alternative care. They encompass much of what is considered as “art of care” that may improve outcomes. These factors are common to integrative, complementary and alternative care as well as healthcare.</p>
<p>Measures to promote confidence and positive expectations are in concert with the basic principles of EBM, while using placebo therapy under the prospect that it has specific effects is not in accordance with the individual’s right to make well-informed decisions. However, CAM practitioners generally stress that the CAM therapies do have specific effects.</p>
<p>We have reviewed a limited number of methods that have previously been considered as CAM therapies and have now been partially introduced in healthcare. Was it possible to discern a common pattern? We observed no such pattern.</p>
<p>In Swedish healthcare, there is a generally accepted model for introduction of new methods in publicly financed healthcare. Important components in this governance by knowledge are systematic reviews with grading of evidence, a national priority-setting model, and national and local guidelines with systematic follow-up of implementation in clinical practice. In the inquiry, we consider that this model also should be applied for CAM methods that are candidates to be adopted by healthcare. Thus, the model should be neutral as to origin, i.e., no special track for methods with a CAM origin should be initiated.</p>
<p>To provide a high-quality basis for priority-setting, we suggest that the government commission the Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services to perform an inventory of what CAM methods could be candidates to be introduced in healthcare and conduct assessments of the scientific support of those methods that are judged to be particularly relevant from this point of view.</p>
<h2>Task 6: To promote contact and understanding in order to improve patient safety</h2>
<p>From the terms of reference: … contribute to improve contacts and understanding between the established care and care out of the established care in order to improve patient safety. If the communication needs to be improved, proposals to this end shall be presented. “Improved understanding” may be interpreted in various ways. We have deemed it unrealistic to present proposals aimed at CAM practitioners at large to share the epistemology and models of explanation of healthcare and vice versa. Instead, we propose that healthcare professionals improve their knowledge of CAM and CAC and the thinking underlying the most common CAM systems and methods. We also propose that the CAM professional organisations work to improve knowledge about the methods of healthcare and their underlying models of explanation.</p>
<p>In accordance, we advise universities and colleges involved in education of physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, psychologists and dieticians to introduce a brief CAM course. The aim is that patients and healthcare professionals should be able to discuss CAM methods and thus facilitate patients’ possibilities to make well-informed decisions. Improved knowledge about CAM methods and possible interactions with healthcare methods could contribute to improved patient safety. We suggest that the National Board of Health and Welfare is commissioned to develop educational material on CAM and CAC for health care professionals.</p>
<p>Other proposals that serve to contribute to “improved contacts and understanding” between CAC and healthcare concern CAM variables in selected national quality registers, a policy for accepting CAM methods in healthcare and a system for information to the public on CAM and CAC, which may also be used by healthcare professionals.</p>
<h2>Task 7: Information system for citizens</h2>
<p>From the terms of reference: … deliver a proposal of a system that contributes to patients getting such information that is needed to make  well-informed choices of care and avoid unserious and hazardous treatment options.</p>
<p>Presently, independent public information in Swedish on CAM and CAC is only presented in fragments on websites such as the official information site of the public healthcare providers (“1177 Vårdguiden”) or at websites of governmental agencies. An independent information system would improve the possibilities for citizens to exert an influence on their own care.</p>
<p>We deem that there is a need for independent information in Sweden on what characterises various CAM methods, what is known about possible benefits and risks and what a potential customer/ patient should know more generally if use of a CAM is considered.</p>
<p>Information directed to citizens and healthcare staff should be available at a common portal and searchable by therapeutic methods, symptoms and diagnoses. We propose that an editorial board is placed at the National Board of Health and Welfare and that this authority is source owner of the information. The editorial board is proposed to be supported by an advisory committee including representatives of users, CAM practitioners, healthcare and governmental agencies. To facilitate the production of information, we suggest agreements with existing information sites in Norway and Denmark. This information should be adapted to the Swedish setting by the editorial board.</p>
<p>We consider the information site 1177 Vårdguiden to be the most appropriate site for making the information available to the citizens. The information at 1177 may also be a source of information for healthcare staff seeking information on CAM methods.</p>
<p>At the websites of governmental agencies in the healthcare arena, there is no easily accessed information on regulations, insurances or where to turn for complaints on a CAM treatment or a CAC practitioner. We therefore propose that the National Board of Health and Welfare be commissioned to coordinate generic information on CAC to citizens by governmental authorities. In addition, the Health and Social Care Inspectorate (IVO) should be mandated to clarify its role concerning handling of complaints in the CAM area.</p>
<p>We propose that the Swedish Consumer Agency is commissioned to provide generic information on CAM at its website “Hallå konsument”.</p>
<h2>Proposals to improve patient safety</h2>
<p>Although not included in our specific tasks, the need for improved patient safety is emphasised in more general terms in the terms of reference. Several of our proposals are aimed at strengthening safety in complementary and alternative care.</p>
<p>Our upcoming review of the Patient Safety Act regarding care provided by non-healthcare professionals will focus on safety issues. This part of the inquiry will be presented in a later report.</p>
<p>A couple of our proposals aim at providing a person who uses CAC improved information to make well-informed decisions. The suggested information system described above includes information on what is known about possible health hazards.</p>
<p>Our proposed policy for introducing CAM methods in healthcare also has a patient safety dimension. We suggest that CAM methods should not have a special track but be introduced according to the same model as other methods that are candidates to be adopted in healthcare. This includes a review of what is known about possible risks.</p>
<p>Also, our proposal to introduce an education package on CAM and CAC has patient safety aspects. If it is materialised, there are prerequisites for more improved, more trustful communication on CAC issues between patients and healthcare professionals. The risk for interactions as well as the risk that the patient terminates effecttive treatment prescribed in healthcare will be reduced. Our proposal to include CAC variables in some of the national quality registers in healthcare will create the possibility to follow-up on safety issues in a more systematic way, when CAC is used.</p>
<h2>Proposals directed to CAC practitioners and their organisations</h2>
<p>In addition to proposals directed toward governmental agencies, universities and colleges and publicly financed healthcare, we find a need for the CAC sector to ascertain good patient safety. Thus, CAC professional organisations are encouraged to ensure that CAM practitioners have basic education about the methods used in healthcare and their underlying models of explanation. Safety aspects, such as a risk for interruption or reduction of effective treatment and possible interactions with treatment prescribed in healthcare should be addressed.</p>
<p>We emphasise the need for a strengthened dialoque between the CAC sector and the Swedish Consumer Agency. A collaboration could result in a branch agreement between the major CAC organisations and the Agency. If so, the agreement would clarify relevant rules and regulations for CAC practitioners. It would also provide the citizen who considers using CAC a basis for selection of a practitioner that meets certain standards regarding education, insurance and handling of complaints.</p>
<p>Our general task was to investigate the question of a possible national register of CAC practitioners, but not a specific term of reference on this point. This question has been reviewed by previous governmental inquiries. None of the proposals has led to any initiatives by the government.</p>
<p>Some of the CAM professional organisations have registers of their member that are publicly available on websites. If such organisations sign branch agreements with the Swedish Consumers Agency, it will become easier for those seeking CAC to identify what organisations that exist and to what extent they work on systematic quality improvement and safety issues among their members. We estimate that registers kept by the CAM organisations, combined with branch agreements, at least partly meet the requirements that citizens may, in a reasonably safe manner, identify appropriate practitioners. In view of this and previous difficulties in realising propositions on a national register by governmental inquiries, we consider the potential advantages of a register run by the state not being in proportion to the resources that would be required.</p>
<h2>Previous inquiries</h2>
<p>CAM issues have been the subject of several previous governmental inquiries. One of these (1989) was commissioned to deal with the entire CAM area, whereas others have concerned limited questions within the CAM area.</p>
<p>In the present Patient Safety Act, one of the paragraphs concerns healthcare-related interventions by non-licensed practitioners. This act dates back to a year 1915 law with successive minor modifications since then. Modifications of parts of this law/paragraph have been suggested by four inquiries since 1989, not resulting in any substantial changes.</p>
<p>It is also striking that very few of the other proposals by previous inquiries have been implemented. These have included compulsory basic medical education for CAM practitioners, register of CAM practitioners, an independent public-oriented information system on CAM methods, and targeted support for CAM research.</p>
<h2>Professional organisations and educations</h2>
<p>Without any claim to be complete, we have identified approximately 30 professional CAM organisations in Sweden. Most of them are oriented toward a particular method or therapeutic system, but there are also umbrella organisations. The majority have some kind of ethical guidelines and some require that members have insurance.</p>
<p>Most professional organisations are also running more general questions like dissemination of information, quality and patient safety issues, requests for more research, licensing and improved economic conditions for CAM practitioners.</p>
<p>Usually, the organisations request their members to have training in a specific method, sometimes also basic medical education. CAM education is, with very few exceptions, privately run.</p>
<p>We have also mapped to what extent the education of healthcare professionals-to-be involves knowledge about CAM. Such elements appear but to a low extent, varying considerably between universities. A few optional courses with CAM elements have been identified, usually corresponding to one month of study.</p>
<p>No compiled official statistics on CAM practitioners or CAM enterprises exist in Sweden. The total membership of CAM organisations known to us is around 8 000, but far from all practitioners are members of any professional organisation. According to Statistics Sweden, there are 21 900 enterprises, most of them with sole proprietors, in which the activities is reported to be “other human health activities not elsewhere classified” or “physical well-being activities”; it is likely that many of them offer some kind of CAC.</p>
<p>In an inquiry to providers of publicly financed healthcare, only a few CAM-related activities emerged, for example non-financial support to integrative care, information on CAC, education in mindfulness and projects on green rehabilitation.</p>
<h2>Use of CAM and attitudes</h2>
<p>We identified 20 Swedish surveys (scientific studies or polls) published in the years 1987–2018, in which the use of CAM and/or attitudes about CAC had been mapped either in the population at large or in restricted groups of patients. In surveys with the best coverage from the last 20 years, 17–39 percent of the population report that they have used CAC or taken CAM medicines during the preceding year. In other studies, higher proportions (up to approximately 70 percent) have been reported. Most often, this has included the use of chiropractic and naprapathy. A majority of the population studies have reported more frequent use of CAM, including CAM medicines, by women compared to men. Many studies have also observed that a higher level of education (in general associated with higher income) and lower self-estimated health are associated with CAC use.</p>
<p>Among patients with diagnosed disease, the proportion that have been using some form of CAC at the time of survey or during the preceding year has been 29–58 percent.</p>
<p>The most commonly used CAM methods, apart from chiropractic treatment and naprapathy, are medical massage, acupuncture, CAM medicines and relaxation techniques, such as medical yoga.</p>
<h2>International outlooks</h2>
<p>We have collected information on regulations and other aspects of CAM in the Nordic countries and, to a limited extent, in France, Germany, the UK and the US. In most countries, there are restrictions on the treatment of serious disorders, for example cancer, by others than licensed healthcare staff. In Denmark, Iceland and Norway, there is special legislation regarding CAM and voluntary national registers of CAM practitioners. In Denmark and Norway, CAC may be exempted from VAT under certain circumstances. Norway is the only Nordic country with a national research centre for CAC.</p>
<p>A small proportion of German physicians have a supplementary education in a CAM field, such as acupuncture, anthroposophical medicine or homeopathy. In Germany, there is special regulation of care conducted by others than licensed healthcare professionals that includes limitations on what medical conditions are permitted to be treated. The compulsory German health insurance does not cover out-patient CAC treatment, although there are a few exceptions. Some insurance companies have a CAC profile and cover a broader spectrum of CAC interventions.</p>
<p>In the UK, there is no legislation on who may practice CAC. However, there are restrictions on what disorders the practitioners are allowed to treat.</p>
<p>In the US, there are state regulations on what services a CAM practitioner may offer. Usually, publicly financed insurance systems do not cover expenses for CAC, but private insurances do so to an increasing extent. A national centre for complementary and integrative health has been in operation since 1991.</p>
<h2>Review of CAM and CAC</h2>
<p>The CAM area involves a broad spectrum of diagnostic and therapeutic systems and methods. We classify the therapies into five categories: (a) therapeutic systems, (b) manual and other body-oriented therapies, (c) mind-body-therapies and other psychological therapies, (d) natural medicines and other therapeutic products and (e) other therapies. We describe examples of seven CAM systems and some 30 CAM therapies in total, chosen because they are common, principally interesting or particularly controversial. In addition, we describe a few CAM diagnostic methods.</p>
<p>Some recurrent themes when CAM proponents are describing CAM are presented. Examples are the historical background of many CAM systems and therapies, holism and focus on the individual, energies, reference to new physical theories and phenomena, mobilisation of a person’s healing capacities and focus on well-being rather than disease.</p>
<p>Some common societal values may contribute to an interest in CAM, for instance a focus on personal well-being and fulfilment, pluralism and a critical attitude toward “the establishment”. Commercial interests and widespread attention in traditional and social media may also contribute. Scientific studies have shown some motivations that occur particularly often in people seeking CAC, for instance striving for the original, the natural and the holistic.</p>
<p>The inquiry’s terms of reference include issues on patient safety.</p>
<p>We have therefore searched for information on patient or customer safety in the CAM area. A national register on adverse effects does not exist. From the scientific literature, we give examples of adverse effects and harm related to acupuncture, homeopathy, treatment with herbal medicines and psychologically oriented therapies. A considerable number of adverse and harmful events have been reported, mild as well as serious, even fatal. This should be seen in the light of the widespread use of these CAM therapies. Termination of effective treatment prescribed by healthcare may involve particularly high risks in patients with serious diseases, such as cancer or psychosis.</p>
<h2>Criticism of healthcare by CAM proponents</h2>
<p>In discussions of CAM and CAC, it is common that CAM proponents criticise healthcare. The criticism includes healthcare being culturally and sociopolitically constrained, having a narrow biomedical perspective, being too expensive and focusing on disease rather than health. It is also said to rely too heavily on scientific evidence and not on other elements of good care. People seeking medical attention who are critical of healthcare point out the lack of time at consultations and shortfalls in the personal encounter, and they often presume that the risks of CAM treatment are lower than those in healthcare.</p>
<h2>The debate on CAM and CAC</h2>
<p>Criticism of CAM and CAC primarily comes from healthcare professionals, scientists in medicine and natural sciences as well as from other people with a sceptical standpoint regarding what they call pseudoscience. A considered lack of scientific evidence and lack of plausible explanation are crucial elements of this critique. According to the critics, many of the CAM proponents are characterised by knowledge resistance and a general scepticism against “the medical establishment”. Perceived improvements reported by people seeking CAC may, according to the critics, be explained by unspecific effects, spontaneous improvement or other mechanisms not directly related to the specific treatment.</p>
<h2>Ethical aspects of CAM and CAC</h2>
<p>Most professional organisations in the CAC sector have ethical guidelines for their members. They are usually similar to those adopted by healthcare professional organisations.</p>
<p>The four “classical” ethical principles in healthcare (beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy and justice) may be applied also in the</p>
<p>CAM area. In addition, we discuss, from an ethical perspective, questions on integrity, secrecy, informed consent, medical pluralism, hope and commercial interests. According to the Swedish ethical platform for prioritisation in healthcare, allocation of publicly financed resources should be by need, not demand. Since CAC is privately financed, demand plays a greater role.</p>
<h2>How we have worked</h2>
<p>The investigator appointed an expert committee with insights into CAM (both proponents and a critic), a representative of CAM prac- titioners, and representatives of governmental agencies, healthcare professions and healthcare providers. The investigator did not strive for consensus in the expert committee. Although the report is based on discussions with the members of the expert committee members, they are not responsible for the content of the report.</p>
<p>In addition to meetings with the expert committee and its in- dividual members, they have commented on preliminary versions of the text. A special working group was appointed for questions on CAM treatment of mental disorders. We have consulted with the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Education, governmental agencies concerned, representatives of regional health- care provider and other actors in the area. We have also consulted other governmental inquiries working on topics close to CAM. In addition, we have had a large number of meetings with CAM prac- titioners, healthcare professionals and their representatives, labour unions, researchers, research funding organisations, patient organi- sations, media, insurance companies and politicians.</p>
<p>We have made study visits in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Germany, participated in conferences and seminars and arranged a dialogue meeting to which all interviewees were invited.</p>
<p>Information was collected from scientific literature, textbooks, governmental reports, existing regulations and their preparatory work, court decisions and websites.</p>
<p>Questionnaires were used to survey academic education on CAM and continuing education on CAM. We mapped Swedish CAM professional organisations and reviewed non-academic education in CAM. The Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and</p>
<p>Assessment of Social Services and the National Board of Health and Welfare have made inventories of their activities in the CAM area. A bibliometric analysis of the scientific CAM literature, with special emphasis on Swedish research, has been performed by researchers at Umeå University.</p>
<p>We have made several delineations and set priorities. However, we have not addressed various kinds of drugs; the drug area is gen- erally well regulated in Sweden. We have not included diets and food supplements, unless they constitute a part of a therapeutic system. Interventions to promote general well-being and not related to ill- ness have not been covered, nor have aesthetic interventions and religious activities.</p>
<p>During our work, many actors have supplied us with extensive material on the effects of different CAM methods. In accordance with the terms of reference, this inquiry proposes a policy for evaluation of CAM methods that could be candidates to introduce in Swedish healthcare, but we have not evaluated single methods or therapeutic systems.</p>
