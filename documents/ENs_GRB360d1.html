<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>Stabilising the concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere is an essential challenge facing the international community in the 21st century. This stabilisation must be achieved while a higher living standard is simultaneously striven for. With present-day technology, this will be extremely difficult. To reduce the risk of future climate changes in the long term, global emissions must decrease. By the year 2050, according to the Riksdag, Sweden’s total annual emissions must be lower than 4.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO ) equivalents per capita. A further decrease must then ensue.</p>
<p>Limited impact on the climate is attainable only through an active climate policy that is integrated throughout society. Achieving this objective requires extensive international collaboration and efforts in every country.</p>
<p>Trading in emission allowances (‘emissions trading’) is a key, cost-effective policy instrument for helping to bring about the objective of stabilising and reducing GHG concentrations in the atmosphere. An emission allowance entitles the holder to emit one tonne of CO equivalents. The basis for emissions trading is the setting of a cap on total emissions (the maximum quantity of allowances) for installations in a particular region included in the scheme over, for example, one year. Nevertheless, this does not involve imposing a cap on emissions from individual installations. Rather, a certain number of transferable emission allowances are allocated to each installation covered by the scheme. In aggregate, these allowances correspond to the cap on total emissions in the region concerned. A requirement is then imposed whereby the plants included in the trading scheme at a certain specific date should be able to show possession of trading allowances corresponding to each installation’s actual emissions. Operators with high costs of reducing emissions will purchase emission allowances, which are offered on a market by operators whose costs of reducing emissions are low.</p>
<p>In its 2002 resolution on climate policy (Govt. Bill 2001/02:55, Report 2001/02MJU10, Govt. Comm. 2001/02:163), the Riksdag laid down that Swedish emissions of the six GHG, averaged over the period 2008 12, should be at least 4 per cent lower than the country’s emissions in 1990. The emission figures must be corrected for a normal year, to ensure comparability between years with respect to variation in temperature and precipitation.</p>
<p>Purpose of the interim report</p>
<p>In October 2001, the European Commission published a draft directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a scheme for trading in GHG emission allowances within the Community. The Council agreed, in December 2002, on a Common Position regarding the content of this directive, on which the European Parliament is expected to decide in summer 2003. The presentation in this report is based on the Council’s Common Position.</p>
<p>Under the draft directive, an EU-wide scheme for trading in GHG emission allowances (the ‘Community scheme’) is to be introduced from 1 January 2005. Under this proposal, the Community scheme relates to emissions of carbon dioxide only. This report deals primarily with the initial period of the scheme, from 2005 to 2007, during which emission allowances should according to the draft directive be allocated free of charge. Other key features of the directive include the stipulation that each Member State should devise a national allocation plan to form the basis for allocating transferable emission allowances, and the requirement that this national allocation plan should meet the criteria contained in Annex III of the directive.</p>
<p>Under the draft directive, the Community scheme should initially comprise installations used for ‘energy activities’, including combustion installations with a rated thermal output exceeding 20 MW in power and heat production; ‘production and processing of ferrous metals’; ‘mineral industry’; and ‘other activities’, including production of pulp, paper and board. In Sweden, the trading sector will therefore comprise some 300 installations.</p>
<p>In this report, the Commission on a system and regulatory framework for the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol (FlexMex2 Commission) presents its views on two aspects in particular. One is the principles on which the allocation of emission allowances is intended to be based. The other is how the national allocation plan should be drawn up, for Sweden’s part, in the run-up to the scheme of emissions trading that is to be introduced throughout the EU from 1 January 2005.</p>
<p>The FlexMex2 Commission wishes to point out that it still remains for the European Parliament to decide on the proposed Council directive, and that the European Commission’s forthcoming clarification of the directive may come to alter the basis of the following proposals submitted by the FlexMex2 Commission.</p>
<h2>The FlexMex2 Commission’s proposals –– allocation principles</h2>
<p>With respect to the principles for allocating emission allowances in conjunction with the introduction of a European Community emissions-trading scheme for the period 2005 07, the FlexMex2 Commission’s proposals may be summarised in the following points.</p>
<p>• It is the  quantity  of emission allowances allocated  to the Swedish trading sector that should be compared with the national targets to be attained in 2008 12. The Riksdag will, as a supplement to its 2004 checkpoint, consider a target that includes the flexible mechanisms.</p>
<p>• The FlexMex2 Commission wishes to emphasise that, although the figures on which the FlexMex2 Commission’s standpoint is based have undergone quality assurance according to a special procedure, they are nonetheless subject to marked uncertainty. This assessment also applies to the forecasts that have been used.</p>
<p>• The FlexMex2 Commission’s assessment is that the Swedish trading sector’s aggregate  emission-allowance requirement may amount to some 24 million tonnes (Mton) of CO annually in 2005 07. This assessment rests on the following calculations:</p>
<p>• The final figure, representing the Swedish trading sector’s aggregate emission allowances, will be set by the Government after the FlexMex2 Commission’s interim report has been circulated for official comment prior to the Government Bill in question in September 2003. In this context, the Government should balance the trading sector’s scope against other sectors’ needs. The Riksdag’s decision in response to the Government Bill of September 2003 will form the basis of the allocation plan that the Government is to submit to the Commission not later than March 31 2004.</p>
<p>• Allocation to sectors and installations should be based on historical activities.</p>
<p>• CO emissions in each sector are divided into two categories: first, emissions from raw materials  that cannot be replaced  if the product is to be manufactured, and, secondly, emissions from fossil fuels  that are replaceable  and are used for the primary purpose of producing power, heat or transport energy.</p>
<p>• Average emissions during the  four-year period 1998 2001 will serve as the basis for allocation of the total number of emission allowances. In cases where exceptional circumstances (e.g. breakdowns or large-scale conversions) prevailed for an installation for a year during this period, the operator should be eligible to apply for the allocation of emission allowances on the basis of its average emissions over a three-year period instead.</p>
<p>• The option for a Member State to apply, under Article 27, for temporary exemption for certain installations  (‘opt-out’, as it is called) should not be exercised.</p>
<p>• The option for the Member State to engage in trading in emission allowances for installations below the capacity limits defined in Annex I of the directive should not be exercised.</p>
<p>• Further measures are required to increase requirements concerning the transport sector’s contribution to a limited climate impact. An overall strategy should be drawn up to make the transport system more efficient, bring about the introduction of more  fuel-efficient vehicles and clarify how renewable forms of energy are to be introduced in various sectors. The FlexMex2 Commission points to the need, at this stage, for analysing the scope for and consequences of including transport in the trading sector during 2008 12, the first Commitment Period of the Kyoto Protocol, for the purpose of restricting GHG emissions. In addition, the FlexMex2 Commission recommends that activities not covered by the trading directive should be permitted, during the 2008 12 Commitment Period, to join the trading scheme. This would enable them to meet the stipulations that, under point 51.1 of the Community’s environmental guidelines , are necessary to obtain a reduction in, or exemption from, taxes introduced for environmental reasons.</p>
<p>• New entrants will be taken into consideration when the total number of emission allowances available for trading is set. These ‘new entrants’ include both activities that have received their  first permits  for GHG emissions and those that have renewed their permits  for GHG emissions after the national allocation plan has been reported to the European Commission. The FlexMex2 Commission proposes that the increase forecast, between 2001 and 2005, in emissions related to non-replaceable raw materials should be entered in the national allocation plan under the heading ‘New entrants that have renewed their permits’  and allocated annually during the period 2005 07. The FlexMex2 Commission will reconsider the regulatory system for new entrants when further clarification has been obtained from the Commission.</p>
<p>• ‘Early action’ (i.e. measures taken previously) is taken into account partly through the use of average emission figures in the years 1998 2001 in the allocation.</p>
<p>• Exemption from participation in the trading scheme during 2005 07 should not be granted with reference to  long-term agreements. The FlexMex2 Commission finds that, under point 51.1 of the Community’s environmental guidelines, whether operators participate in the trading scheme or have long-term agreements with the state makes no difference in terms of grounds for obtaining exemption from, or a reduction in, taxes introduced for environmental reasons.</p>
<p>• Decisions on the emission allowances granted for the separate years in the period 2005 2007 are to be taken not later than 1 October 2004.</p>
<p>• The statistical quality assurance that has already begun should be developed further and extended to comprise other sectors that are contributing to climate change. Collaboration in forecasting between the National Institute of Economic Research and the Swedish Energy Agency, in particular, should also be developed and reinforced. A strategic plan for this collaboration should be promptly drawn up.</p>
<p>• An overall impact analysis and coordination of the management of existing and proposed policy instruments in the environmental sector are lacking at present. The FlexMex2 Commission therefore proposes that the Government investigate the scope and forms for bringing about this kind of necessary coordination.</p>
<h2>The FlexMex2 Commission’s proposals emissions trading, carbon tax and financing</h2>
<p>In its report, the FlexMex2 Commission has considered three options with respect to the matter of whether carbon tax should be retained (possibly including certain limitation rules) or abolished in the sectors that will be covered by emissions trading. The FlexMex2 Commission’s assessment of this matter is as follows:</p>
<p>• SNED’s proposal for a new system of energy taxation has not yet been circulated for official comments. Some investigative work remains to be done to clarify the practical scope for implementing an alternative in which carbon tax, including certain limitation rules, is retained. The FlexMex2 Commission therefore does not wish, in this situation, to recommend one of the options surveyed in its report. Instead, it proposes that the question of the role of carbon tax in the future scheme of emissions trading be raised for further elucidation in the FlexMex2 Commission’s continued investigative work. Accordingly, greater clarity should be obtained in the matter of the requirements for introduction of SNED’s proposals for a new energy-tax system. The FlexMex2 Commission considers that proposals should be financed primarily within the system of energy and environmental taxes.</p>
<h2>The FlexMex2 Commission’s proposals organisational issues</h2>
<p>The proposals put forward by the FlexMex2 Commission may be summarised in the following points:</p>
<p>• The scheme of emissions trading, with its  market-based design, differs from the regulatory system of the Swedish Environmental Code. There may therefore be reasons to allow both systems to function separately to bring about an efficient procedure and, in view of this dual-system functioning, set up a new public agency to administer emissions trading.</p>
<p>• However, the preparatory period between now and the initiation of the trading scheme on 1 January 2005 is brief. For practical reasons, most of the tasks to be performed before and during the period 2005 07 will have to be promptly assigned to existing agencies at central level, especially the Swedish Energy Agency and the National Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>• Nonetheless, to create a more independent  decision-making process for emissions trading, an autonomous, small agency with overall responsibility for these issues should be set up.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Government should assign the FlexMex2 Commission, in cooperation with the Energy Agency, the Environmental Protection Agency and Statistics Sweden (SCB), to compile additional documentation for the continued drafting of the allocation plan. The requisite legislative proposals should be drawn up by the FlexMex2 Commission.</p>
<p>• The assignment of issuing, as the authorised public agency concerned, permits for operators to conduct activities after 1 January 2005 that will yield CO emissions covered by the trading directive should be given either to Svenska Kraftnät (the utility that owns and operates Sweden’s national electricity grid) or to the county administrative boards. The Environmental Protection Agency should be promptly assigned to develop regulations, criteria and systems for the permit-issuing procedure.</p>
<p>• A decision on allocation of emission allowances should be taken by the small, autonomous agency whose establishment is proposed by the FlexMex2 Commission. The Environmental Protection Agency should be charged with receiving and preparing applications for allocation of emission allowances and, in consultation with the Swedish Energy Agency and Swedish Business Development Agency (NUTEK), submit draft decisions.</p>
<p>• Permit and allocation decisions should be subject to appeal. Appeal against other decisions should normally also be permitted.</p>
<p>• The task of issuing emission allowances to operators should be entrusted either to the Environmental Protection Agency or to the organisation that will later be charged with keeping a register of the emission allowances held by these operators, and of changes in the same.</p>
<p>• The Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Agency should be commissioned to jointly draft and publish suitable information material, which should then be disseminated to operators, the public, etc.</p>
<p>• The Environmental Protection Agency should be assigned to develop appropriate procedures for inspection, monitoring, cancellation of allowances, etc to take place during 2005 07. This assignment should also include considering any organisational issues that may arise. The work should take place in consultation with the FlexMex2 Commission and the Energy Agency.</p>
<p>• A rough estimate is that the tasks involved in the  run-up to the initial period, 2005 07, which will mainly be performed during the year 2004, will cost some SEK 15 20 million. Activities in the years 2005 07 should be considerably less costly: the annual expense may amount to an estimated SEK 5 million at most. In part, at least, it should be possible to meet the financing requirement by means of charges.</p>
<p>• Work in 2005 07 should be evaluated in good time before the next period, and this evaluation should include reconsideration of the organisational issue.</p>
