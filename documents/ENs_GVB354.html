<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Terms of reference</h2>
<p>The Inquiry was instructed to review the provisions concerning the portrayal of children in pornographic pictures and related legislation. The aim of the review is to enable more effective prevention of child pornography and to strengthen the situation of children in child pornography crimes.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit has also included considering whether it would be possible and appropriate to introduce a definite 18-year age limit into the definition of ‘child’ in the provisions on child pornography, or in some other way to extend the legislation’s protection of children under the age of 18. Another of the Inquiry’s tasks has been to consider whether the crime of child pornography needs to be redefined with reference to types of crimes that are punishable and whether criminalisation should be extended to other types of involvement with child pornography. The Inquiry has also been instructed to consider existing needs for exemptions to the criminal area and, based on case-law regarding the classification of the crime and penalties in child pornography crimes, the need for changes in the area. The remit has also included clarifying whether children who are depicted in child pornographic material can be regarded as injured parties in a child pornography crime and be entitled to, for example, injured party counsels and financial compensation, and the need for changes with regard to damages and support in legal proceedings. Finally, the Inquiry was instructed to consider whether the rules on statutory limitation in child pornography crimes are appropriately designed and to examine whether the dual criminality requirement for child pornography crimes should be removed or limited.</p>
<h2>Definition of child pornography</h2>
<p>Under present law, the crime of child pornography falls under Chapter 16, “On crimes against public order”, of the Swedish Penal Code. The reason is that, systematically speaking, the crime is not a sexual crime within the meaning of the Penal Code. A child pornography crime aims at actions beyond the sexual crime itself, such as dissemination of the child pornographic picture. The purpose of criminalisation of child pornography is not only to protect the specifically depicted child from being violated, but also children in general. The Inquiry finds no reason to make a different assessment with regard to the category of crimes in which the crime of child pornography is placed. Thus the crime of child pornography should continue to fall under Chapter 16 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>In the current penal provisions for the crime of child pornography, a child is defined as a person whose pubertal development is not complete or, if it is apparent from the picture and its attendant circumstances, who is less than 18 years of age. Thus the definition of ‘child’ does not contain an 18-year age limit in the formal sense; instead the area of application is limited through the requirement that it should be apparent from the picture and its attendant circumstances, such as a picture caption or a cover, that the person portrayed is under 18 years of age.</p>
<p>There has been criticism from several quarters of the fact that the scope of child pornography legislation is limited in this way. According to the critics, because of this, not all children under the age of 18 are protected against child pornography crimes; cases where the depicted child’s pubertal development is fully complete, and the age is not apparent from the picture and its attendant circumstances fall outside the penal provisions. Demands have therefore been expressed for the inclusion of a definite 18-year age limit in the definition of child pornography.</p>
<p>The Inquiry can confirm that children whose pubertal development is fully complete have been portrayed in pornographic pictures and that it is possible for people to involve themselves with these pornographic pictures without being guilty either of a child pornography crime or any other crime. The technical developments and developments in crime that have occurred since the 1999 child pornography reform place entirely new demands on the need to protect young people from this type of crime. Developments have meant that the violations to which children have been exposed by being portrayed in pornographic pictures have generally become more serious. Using the Internet, pornographic pictures of the child can now be extensively spread, in principle, to an unlimited number of people, and the risk of the pornographic picture circulating ad infinitum is considerably greater today. This not only applies to children whose pubertal development is not complete and who are therefore covered by the penal provisions on child pornography crimes; it also applies to children whose pubertal development is complete who are not at present covered by the provisions. In the Inquiry’s opinion, the violations are just as punishable with regard to children whose pubertal development is complete. The interest in protecting these children from the violation of integrity that child pornography entails is very important. Extending the scope of the penal provisions so that they also include these children would in some sense allow them more of a chance to receive redress for the violation that they have suffered, increase the chance of obtaining a conviction for the perpetrator of the crime in any individual case, and increase the child’s chances of obtaining damages from the perpetrator. An extension in scope also clearly indicates, and sends a stronger signal on the part of society, that it is forbidden to exploit children in pornographic contexts in any way and that this applies regardless of the individual child’s physical development.</p>
<p>There are, however, strongly competing interests of which account must also be taken. These strongly competing interests include the fundamental values of freedom of the press and freedom of expression. Other interests to consider are the requirement for the effectiveness of a new criminalisation and the principle of legality.</p>
<p>Having considered all the interests that should be taken into account in this context, the Inquiry has found that, on balance, the reasons indicate that a definite 18-year age limit should be incorporated into the definition of child pornography. What determines criminal responsibility in individual cases will thus always be whether the person depicted is in fact a child and not, as under present law, what the viewer of the picture may perceive. However, even in the future, the main rule will be that the pubertal development of the depicted child is decisive. This means that the protection applying now to people whose pubertal development is not complete and who cannot be identified or who are 18 or over the age of 18 has been retained. The Inquiry thus proposes that in the penal provisions on child pornography crimes, a ‘child’ shall refer to a person whose pubertal development is not complete, or a person who is under the age of 18.</p>
<p>In connection with the 1999 child pornography reform, the crime of child pornography ceased to be a crime against freedom of the press or freedom of expression. Since then, the Freedom of the Press Ordinance and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression have stated that they are not applicable to portrayals of children in pornographic pictures. It is not entirely clear what is meant by the concept of ‘child’ in the exemption clauses of the fundamental laws. In order to remove possible doubts, the Inquiry proposes that the provisions be more clearly defined. The Inquiry proposes that the provisions be formulated so that ‘child pornographic pictures’ are explicitly exempted from the scope of the fundamental laws.</p>
<p>Pornography in which adults are portrayed as children or are given various attributes that are suggestive of children should not, in the Inquiry’s opinion, be criminalised.</p>
<h2>The scope of criminalisation</h2>
<p>At present child pornography is produced and spread extensively using information technology, primarily the Internet. Technical development has meant that good quality pictures can be incredibly easily and effectively disseminated to a large number of people. The development has also led to child pornographic pictures being more easily accessible for mere viewing. New types of involvement with child pornography have arisen as a result of technological advances and this can be expected to continue in pace with increasing technical development. In the Inquiry’s opinion, every presentation of a child pornographic picture represents a violation of both the depicted child and children in general. This violation can be caused by the originator of the picture himself, or by others at a later stage, if, for example, the picture has been circulated to other people. The point of departure for the Inquiry is therefore that criminalisation of child pornography must as far as possible encompass all types of involvement with child pornographic pictures that may be considered punishable.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s investigations have shown that several of the new types of involvement with child pornographic pictures that have arisen fall under the present criminal area. Today’s technology, however, allows certain types of involvement where the present penal provisions appear to be difficult to apply in some cases and not at all applicable in others. For example, by making a payment, people can view child pornographic material that is made available via certain websites (pay-per-view sites). Another way of obtaining access to such pictures may be to take part in a digital forum or community where child pornographic pictures are made available; a member of such a forum does not always need to contribute pictures himself. It is also possible to view child pornographic pictures using other Internet-based services.</p>
<p>The kind of involvement with child pornographic pictures that we are now talking about – and that can only be brought under the present criminal area with difficulty or not at all – can be described as qualified channels for viewing child pornographic pictures; the individual has made some kind of effort to be able to view precisely these kinds of pictures. From the point of view of penal value, there is no material difference between these types of involvement with child pornographic pictures and the kind of involvement implied by possession. It is likely that, as may be the case with possession, such qualified viewing creates a demand for new pictures. Thus the market for child pornography is also maintained in these cases. This contributes to more children being subjected to sexual abuse and possibly also to increasingly serious abuse. In the Inquiry’s opinion, these types of involvement with child pornographic pictures are so objectionable that there are good reasons for criminalising them. For this reason, the Inquiry proposes that the criminal area be broadened.</p>
<p>So that there should be no risk of limiting the freedom of information guaranteed by fundamental law in a too extensive and therefore unacceptable manner, the Inquiry considers that this new type of criminal act be accompanied by limiting necessary conditions. The Inquiry proposes that the criminal area be broadened so that a person who, for payment, according to a predetermined plan, on repeated occasions, extensively or in another, similar manner acquires access to child pornographic pictures, will be sentenced for the crime of child pornography.</p>
<h2>Exemptions from the criminal area</h2>
<p>The reform in 1999 led to an explicit exemption for craftsmanlikeproduced pictures, which means that the prohibitions against portrayal and possession do not apply to a person who draws, paints or in some other similar, craftsmanlike fashion produces a child pornographic picture, as long as the picture is not intended for dissemination, transfer, licensed use, exhibition or availability in any other way to others. At the same time, the exemption introduced in 1980 for acts that are justifiable was retained, which means that an act shall not constitute a crime if, having regard to the circumstances, it is justifiable. The Inquiry’s investigations show that the present exemption clauses are necessary. The Inquiry has come to the conclusion that there is no reason either to limit or extend their present scope.</p>
<p>Sexuality has taken an increasingly prominent place in Swedish society. The consumption of pornographic material – which, as a result of technical development has become more and more easily accessible – has increased, also among young people. Several studies have shown that there is a strong connection between having viewed pornography and having tested certain sexual acts. It is likely that greater sexualisation has led to the attitude of many of today’s children with regard to, for example, sexuality and nakedness not being the same as it was a few years ago. It has become increasingly common, for example, for children to publish ‘sexy’ pictures of themselves on the Internet. It also happens that children depict their own sexual behaviour. How such and similar practices are to be assessed using current legislation on child pornography crimes is not entirely clear.</p>
<p>With regard to crimes against the general public, an individual person may not place himself above this public interest. Since the purpose of criminalising child pornography is not only to protect the depicted child from being violated but also children in general, the Penal Code’s provision on consent as a general ground for freedom from liability cannot be applied in these cases. This means, for example, that a child cannot effect freedom from liability by consenting to be portrayed in a pornographic picture or allowing someone else to possess the picture. Nor, for example, can the child with impunity disseminate pictures of him or herself that under the penal provision on child pornography crimes would be regarded as child pornography. The Inquiry is of the opinion that the above-mentioned acts do not constitute punishable acts in all cases and therefore proposes that rules on freedom from liability be introduced for these situations.</p>
<p>With regard to children who depict their own legal sexual behaviour, the Inquiry proposes that the rule on freedom from liability is limited to a person who depicts in a pornographic picture a child who is over the age of 15 or possesses such a picture, provided that the difference in age and development between the child and the perpetrator is minor and the circumstances otherwise do not warrant the person who has committed the act being convicted of a crime. Freedom from liability cannot ensue when consent is given to types of activities other than portrayal and possession; firstly, the general interest of protection takes precedence in these cases, and secondly it may be difficult for the child to foresee the consequences of his or her consent to another type of activity. The Inquiry considers that children under 15 years of age need absolute protection against child pornography crimes and that therefore freedom from liability should only ensue in cases where the portrayed child was over the age of 15 when he or she was portrayed. The proposed rule on freedom from liability cannot be applied if the act is to be considered a gross child pornography crime.</p>
<p>With regard to a person who commits punishable acts with child pornographic pictures of himself or herself, the Inquiry proposes that the rule on freedom from liability be limited to apply to a person who is under the age of 18, provided that the picture was produced when that person was over the age of 15 and circumstances otherwise do not warrant him or her being convicted of a crime. The rule on freedom from liability is thus only applicable in those cases in which the perpetrator at the time of the act was over the age of 15 but under the age of 18. The rule thus cannot be applied if an adult person commits punishable acts involving a child pornographic picture of himself or herself; an adult person must in no case be able to cause a child to be regarded as a sexual object. The general interest of protection in child pornography crimes is extremely important with regard to children under the age of 15. The rule on freedom from liability therefore only covers pictures depicting a person who has committed the act after the age of 15. The proposed rule on freedom from liability cannot be applied if the act is to be considered a gross child pornography crime.</p>
<h2>Scales of penalties and degrees of seriousness</h2>
<p>The scale of penalties for child pornography crimes is imprisonment for at most two years, or if the crime is minor, fines or imprisonment for at most six months. The scale of penalties for a gross child pornography crime is imprisonment for at least six months and at most six years.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s investigation of judgments has not revealed any reason to propose any changes in the scale of penalties for child pornography crimes. They are well in line with what applies to other similar crimes.</p>
<p>With regard to classification of the crime in child pornography crimes, and in view of what the Inquiry’s investigation of judgments has shown in general, there is no reason to make any changes with regard to child pornography crimes that are only moderately serious or to be regarded as minor.</p>
<p>Under the present system, when assessing whether a child pornography crime is gross, special consideration shall be given to whether it was committed in the course of business or otherwise for profit, was a part of criminal activity that was systematically practised or practised on a large scale, or concerned a particularly large number of pictures or pictures in which children are exposed to especially ruthless treatment. In view of the results of the Inquiry’s investigation of judgments, there is no reason either to exclude any of the criteria, or to add any new ones. Another reason for this is that the criteria mentioned in the text of the law are only examples.</p>
<p>There is, however, reason to re-formulate one of the abovementioned criteria, i.e. “pictures in which children are exposed to especially ruthless treatment”. One reason for this is that no special statements or guidelines have been drawn up for what the expression “especially ruthless treatment” entails. This criterion can therefore create problems in applying the law and can also be interpreted in different ways. Another reason is that our investigation of judgments shows that, when assessing whether a child pornography crime was to be regarded as gross in view of the fact that the crime concerned pictures in which children are exposed to especially ruthless treatment, the reasoning of the courts differed. This primarily applied to cases in which the type of act involved possession. Despite apparently similar circumstances, in some cases a child pornography crime was considered gross, while other cases were deemed to be only moderately serious. As a result of this, the perpetrator in the former case was often sentenced to imprisonment, and in the latter, usually to a suspended sentence combined with a fine determined on the basis of income.</p>
<p>Against this background, the Inquiry proposes that the criterion “pictures in which children are exposed to especially ruthless treatment” be clarified and re-formulated, which could contribute to a clearer, more consistent application of the law. The Inquiry proposes introduction of the criterion “pictures showing children who are particularly young, who are exposed to violence or coercion or who are otherwise exploited in a ruthless manner”. The Inquiry considers that acts involving pictures of the above-mentioned type, regardless of the type of act concerned, should generally lead to the crime being considered gross.</p>
<h2>The status of the child</h2>
<p>As a rule, there is probably no injured party in crimes against public order, apart from the state. Criminalisation of a certain act may however take place to protect several different interests. It is therefore by no means out of the question for an individual person to be given the status of injured party even in such crimes.</p>
<p>The subjects of protection in child pornography crimes are both children in general and the depicted child. In the Inquiry’s opinion, a child pornography crime, regardless in principle of the type of act concerned can be deemed to have been committed against the child depicted in the pornographic picture. In any case the child may be deemed to have been offended by the crime. The depicted child is therefore normally to be regarded as an injured party in a crime of child pornography. The issue of whether the child has the status of an injured party must, however, be determined in each individual case.</p>
<p>To be able to appoint an injured party counsel for a crime other than those particularly named in the Injured Party Counsel Act, imprisonment must be included in the scale of penalties and, in view of the personal situation of the injured party and other circumstances, there must be reason to assume that the injured party has a particular need of such a counsel. With regard to the crime of child pornography, imprisonment is included in the scale of penalties for all degrees of the crime. If the other conditions are met, it is thus possible under present law to appoint an injured party counsel for the child depicted in a crime of child pornography, regardless of the type of act in question. In addition the Inquiry on injured party counsels (SOU 2007:6) has proposed that a new provision be included in the Injured Party Counsels Act. Under the proposed provision, an injured party counsel must be appointed in crimes that may result in imprisonment, if the injured party is under the age of 18, unless it is obvious that the injured party has no need of such a counsel.</p>
<p>The Inquiry on victims of sexual crimes (Ju 2004:I) proposed that the person who has been the victim of a crime under Chapter 6 of the Penal Code must be entitled to free legal advice from a member of the Swedish Bar Association for a maximum of two hours, before the event has been reported to the police. For those children who have been depicted in pornographic pictures and who have been exposed to a sexual crime at the same time, this proposal would mean a right to legal advice. It is, however, possible to produce pornographic pictures of children without at the same time committing a sexual crime directed at the child. Children in these cases would not be covered by this right. Moreover a child pornography crime not only includes the production of the picture itself but also other activities such as dissemination and possession of the picture. Children who have been exposed to such crimes would not be included in the right to legal advice either. The very fact that child pornographic pictures – that can then be disseminated to other people – are produced, entails, as in sexual crimes, a violation of the victim of the crime that seriously affects their personal integrity. These people also need to be given information on the contents of the legislation, on the functioning of different parts of the legal system and on what opportunities there are for support and assistance during the course of the criminal investigation and the further legal process. In this respect, there is no reason for differentiating between cases in which a person has been victim of a sexual crime and cases in which a person has been victim of a child pornography crime. For this reason, the Inquiry proposes that people who have been portrayed in child pornographic pictures also be entitled to free legal advice from a member of the Swedish Bar Association for a maximum of two hours.</p>
<p>For a special representative to be appointed for a child, there must be reason to believe that a crime that can lead to imprisonment has been committed against the child and that it is the custodian or a person close to the custodian who may be suspected of the crime. In other respects, the type of crime is irrelevant to the question of whether a child is to have a special representative. With regard to child pornography crimes, imprisonment is included in the scale of penalties for all degrees of the crime. Under present law, it is thus possible to appoint a special representative for the child in child pornography cases, regardless of the type of act in question.</p>
<p>Children who are portrayed in pornographic pictures may have the right to damages in child pornography crimes. This applies regardless of the type of act the crime concerns. The causal link between the criminal act and the injury inflicted that must exist for liability for damages to come into question at all, however, is generally weaker the closer one is to the lower limit for what is punishable as a child pornography crime. It is doubtful whether damages can be paid in child pornography crimes that consist of possession of pornographic pictures of the child. A depicted child may also be entitled to criminal injuries compensation. In the Inquiry’s opinion, the child’s need for financial compensation in this type of case may be considered to be met by the present legislation. Opportunities for the depicted child in a child pornography crime to receive compensation other than damages and criminal injuries compensation should therefore not be extended.</p>
<p>It is important that the professionals who come into contact with cases involving children who are the victims of crime receive continual education and skills development. Education and skills development, including information on the rights of the child, child development and methods of talking with children, are required to ensure the child victim’s legal security. Child pornography crimes are not the most common of crimes. Only seldom do officials in the legal system have to deal with these crimes. They are crimes that seriously violate children and that can have far-reaching harmful effects. It is therefore important that officials are given greater detailed knowledge about child pornography crimes, such as knowledge about children’s pubertal development and how perpetrators use the Internet in these contexts. The Inquiry wishes to emphasise that it is important that the training initiatives being undertaken in the legal system include the above-mentioned type of issues.</p>
<h2>Statute of limitations</h2>
<p>Under present law the statutory limitation period for child pornography crimes is five years for moderately serious crimes, two years for minor crimes, and ten years for gross crimes. Statutory limitation periods are counted from the day of the crime. For certain more serious sexual crimes against children, however, the statutory limitation period does not begin until the child attains or would have attained 18 years of age. Making the special statutory limitation provision applicable to sexual crimes where the minimum punishment is a fine determined on the basis of income has not been considered justified.</p>
<p>It is important that the regulatory system is designed so that it allows effective legal proceedings, not only for sexual crimes against children but also for child pornography crimes. The penal sanctions system has a central role when fighting violations that are the result of a crime of child pornography. This is particularly evident against the background of the fact that the pictures produced in recent years tend to contain more and more serious violence against children than was common previously. A child pornography crime, regardless of the type of act involved, is such that it cannot inflict physical injury on the depicted child. As with many sexual crimes, the harm caused by child pornography crimes is instead at the psychological level. Children who have been depicted in a pornographic picture are not always able to talk about what they have experienced before they reach their late teens, and perhaps not even then. The fact that children do not always tell anyone, combined with the fact that the crime does not result in visible harm, may lead to child pornography crimes not being discovered until a long period has elapsed. This situation is particularly apparent with regard to a child pornography crime that consists of portrayal rather than dissemination, exhibition, possession, etc.</p>
<p>Several circumstances indicate that it is not appropriate to introduce a special statutory limitation provision – similar to that applying to certain sexual crimes – for child pornography crimes in general. One of these circumstances is that the proportion of identified children is small compared with the number of unidentified children. Another is that in many cases, investigatory work would be hindered and take considerably more time than is currently the case.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned circumstances are less applicable with regard to child pornography crimes that consist of portrayal. In such cases the depicted child is often identified, and consequently practical problems with using an age limit as the point of departure for calculating the period of limitation would not arise. Investigatory work with regard to a depiction crime would probably, in most cases, not be affected by a special regulation. Nor do legal security reasons apply in this type of crime.</p>
<p>There is every reason to try to achieve a system that improves opportunities to institute legal proceedings against, at any rate, those producing child pornographic pictures. A person who has produced such pictures can be said to be the originator of the suffering to which the child has been exposed, i.e. the fact that the pictures were once produced makes it possible for others to see the pictures of the child, and in turn, pass them on to other people. The Inquiry considers that the interest, in certain cases, of trying to achieve better opportunities for bringing perpetrators to justice outweighs the interest of having a uniform system for all crimes of child pornography with regard to calculating the period of limitation.</p>
<p>In view of this, the Inquiry proposes that a special provision on the period of limitation for child pornography crimes consisting of portrayal be introduced. The provision will be limited to apply to pictures portraying real children and only such pictures where it is absolutely clear that a real child has been depicted, such as photographs. The period of limitation will be extended so that the period of limitation does not begin until, at the earliest, the date on which the injured party attains or would have attained 18 years of age. The provision will apply when the child pornography crime is moderately serious or is to be considered a gross crime, and to attempted crimes of this kind. If application of the main rule in Chapter 35, Section 4, first paragraph of the Penal Code means that the period of limitation starts at a later point in time, that rule shall be applied instead.</p>
<h2>The dual criminality requirement</h2>
<p>In order to institute legal proceedings in Sweden for a child pornography crime that has been committed abroad, by, for example, a Swedish citizen, it is necessary for the act to also be punishable where it was committed, i.e. dual criminality is required. In connection with the new sexual crime legislation, this requirement for dual criminality was removed for certain more serious sexual crimes</p>
<p>against children under the age of 18. A limit was set so that crimes with fines in the scale of penalties would still be covered by such a requirement. The reasons given for removing this requirement were that adult sexual abuse of children committed abroad in the context of child sex tourism constitutes a serious violation of the fundamental rights and human dignity of children and that it cannot be considered satisfactory that such actions can be committed by, for example, Swedish citizens visiting other countries where this conduct is not punishable.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that corresponding reasons apply with regard to child pornography crimes. The Inquiry considers that being able to take legal measures against child pornography crimes, both when the crime is committed in Sweden and when committed abroad, is an important element in the international fight against child pornography crimes. In order to bring about effective legal protection against child pornography crimes, the Inquiry proposes that Swedish courts are to have the competence to try moderately serious or gross child pornography crimes committed abroad. The same will apply to attempts to commit such crimes. Further, Swedish courts will not be bound by the punishment prescribed for these crimes in the countries where they were committed.</p>
