<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes that a Baltic Centre should be established in Visby, with a geographical focus on Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia (with an emphasis on the adjacent area of northwest Russia), Belarus and Ukraine (“the priority countries”). The Baltic Centre is intended as a national centre whose overall objective will be to facilitate and develop contacts and cooperation with these countries. In principle, the Baltic Centre will not replace organisations, institutions and support schemes that already exist but will serve to reinforce and supplement them. Under the inquiry’s proposal, the Baltic Centre will have a staff of 15 people and an annual budget of just over SEK 80 million when activities are fully developed in 2006. As the Baltic Centre becomes established, the Government Offices Baltic Billion Secretariat will gradually be wound up as the activities funded by the Baltic Billion programme come to an end.</p>
<p>The proposed activities of the Baltic Centre are as follows:</p>
<p>1. to inform people in Sweden – the general public and specialists</p>
<p>– about Swedish cooperation with the priority countries and to inform interested people in these countries about Sweden. A mainly IT-based information office will be set up at the Baltic Centre,</p>
<p>2. to promote networking and experience exchange between different national actors involved in Swedish Baltic Sea cooperation. The main vehicle for this activity will be seminars,</p>
<p>3. to promote more  in-depth work in areas that are considered of special interest for developing Swedish cooperation with the countries concerned,</p>
<p>4. to contribute to policy formation, by actors who participate in the activities of the Baltic Centre formulating common conclusions and recommendations,</p>
<p>5. to be responsible for managing and implementing the so called Visby Programme, i.e. a scholarship programme focussed on the priority countries, and be resonsible for a new scholarship programme, (”leadership programme”), targeting future leaders in the business world and the public sector in the countries concerned.</p>
<p>In addition, we propose that:</p>
<p>6. the objective of the Visby Programme should be changed to promote more specifically deeper cooperation on research and education between Sweden and its counterparts in the countries concerned,</p>
<p>7. the possibility should be examined of moving the International Programme Office to Visby, where it would take over operational responsibility for the Visby Programme and other scholarship programmes in the area of education and research for which the Swedish Institute is currently responsible. An arrangement of this kind would mean that in Sweden, as in a number of other countries, the management of education and research scholarships for foreign students would be brought together into a single system.</p>
<p>The inquiry has also been asked to take a position on the question of whether any activities previously financed from the appropriation for “Business development in the Baltic Sea region” should continue and, if so, how these should be administered and financed.</p>
<p>In this connection, we propose that:</p>
<p>8. the Baltic Region Business Opportunity project (Affärschans Östersjön) should continue within the framework of the normal activities of the Swedish Trade Council, focusing on the priority countries and with increased  co-financing by participating companies,</p>
<p>9. the trade development and promotion activities in the Barents Region that are now financed through Baltic Billion 2 should be evaluated prior to any decision on extension,</p>
<p>10. the active project development programme conducted by the Projects Export Secretariat at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs should continue as part of the regular export promoting activities of the Ministry. An evaluation should be made of the programme, covering the period  2000–2005,</p>
<p>11. additional resources should be appropriated for the monitoring of projects that are of interest to Swedish industry in the priority countries,</p>
<p>12. additional funds be set aside for Swedish consultant trust funds at the international financing institutions that have activities in the countries concerned, if evaluations can show that these funds have improved opportunities for Swedish companies to compete for contracts.</p>
