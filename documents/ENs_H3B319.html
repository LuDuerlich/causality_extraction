<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In this final report, the Inquiry presents a proposal for a new system of accounting supervision in Sweden. The current accounting supervisory system, introduced in 2007 and based on provisions in the Transparency Directive, has not demonstrated the advantages intended on its implementation. This model – which involves a division of supervisory responsibility between Finansinspektionen (the Swedish financial supervisory authority) and the stock exchanges – has demonstrated shortcomings in terms of consistency and has not functioned well in combination with the cooperation in supervisory matters conducted within the European Economic</p>
<p>Area (EEA). The aim of the Inquiry’s proposal has been to create an independent and legally secure system of accounting supervision that is effective and efficient with respect to the purpose of the supervision and the European supervisory cooperation.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposal involves removing the statutory requirement that a stock exchange must monitor periodic financial information published by those issuers whose transferable securities have been admitted to trading on a regulated market run by the exchange. The Inquiry instead proposes that Finansinspektionen, the competent authority under the Transparency Directive, is to be responsible for monitoring the periodic financial information published by all issuers that have Sweden as home Member State.</p>
<p>Finansinspektionen’s current monitoring responsibility includes only issuers that have Sweden as home Member State and whose transferable securities have been admitted to trading on a regulated market in another EEA country.</p>
<p>In the event of a breach of the provisions on periodic financial information, Finansinspektionen may take action against the issuer by ordering the issuer to rectify the matter, and by issuing a caution.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the breach must be serious in order for Finansinspektionen to be able to issue a caution.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the new accounting supervisory system be financed through fees payable to Finansinspektionen by those issuers that are subject to supervision. The legislative amendments should enter into force on 1 January 2016. This means that the responsibility of the stock exchanges to monitor periodic financial information will cease as of that date. In the Inquiry’s view, no particular considerations need to be taken with respect to the entry into force of the new provisions.</p>
