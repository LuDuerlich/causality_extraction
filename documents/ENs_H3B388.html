<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Designed Living Environment – a new policy for architecture, form and design: The Commission of Inquiry’s remit</h2>
<p>The current policy on architecture, form and design was adopted in 1998 via the Framtidsformer [Forms for the Future] action plan. Since then much has happened, both in the field of architecture, form and design, and in society as a whole. In 2014 the Government decided that policy in this field should be reviewed. The Commission of Inquiry entitled Gestaltad livsmiljö – en ny politik för arkitektur, form och design (Ku 2014:02) [Designed Living Environment – A new policy for architecture, form and design (Ku 2014:02)] was therefore given the remit to review the current policy on architecture, form and design and to propose a new policy in this field.</p>
<p>The objective of the remit is to strengthen the value and significance of architecture, form and design to the individual, the living environment and the sustainable development of society.</p>
<p>According to the Directive (Dir. 2014:69), the Commission of Inquiry will suggest how a new policy on architecture, form and design can be formulated based on an assessment of the field’s future challenges, and how architecture, form and design can have a greater effect in the relevant areas of society. The remit includes analysing the use of concepts and language in order to promote and develop communication about architecture, form and design. In a comparison with other countries, the Commission will describe what lessons can be learned for formulating a new Swedish policy for this field. The Commission will analyse the national objectives for an architecture, form and design policy and propose new objectives where necessary. The Commission will analyse and propose measures to raise competency in public procurement and to increase opportunities for knowledge development and training at various levels in the context of the sustainable building of society. According to the supplementary directive (Dir. 2015:24), the Commission will also analyse and submit proposals for how the architecture, form and design field can be characterised to a greater extent by dialogue and participation which contribute to sustainable social development. The consequences of the proposals will be described.</p>
<h2>Analysis of the current policy (Chapter 2)</h2>
<p>The Framtidsformer action plan was adopted in 1998 and constitutes the current policy on architecture, form and design. A review of the measures implemented as a result of Framtidsformer shows that a large number of activities were initiated and carried out. The political will to make the field more cohesive and to implement broad measures was a positive mobilisation of forces for the development of architecture, form and design. In subsequent years the level of activity was high but the Commission has found that today's knowledge about and application of the action plan is limited.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that comprehensive changes in society have led to the expansion of the field of architecture, form and design since Framtidsformer was formulated. The perspective has shifted from Framtidsformer’s pronounced environmental, product and object perspective, which is still relevant, to a greater awareness of challenge-driven processes and the value of the processes in and of themselves. There is now a deeper understanding of globalisation’s physical, cultural, environmental and social consequences. The conditions for and possibilities of production, consumption and communication have changed, mainly as a result of extensive technological development. More travel and increased migration have contributed to an awareness of and need for cultural diversity. Research and climate change have made us more aware of nature's terms and limits and of the fact that development must occur in a sustainable manner.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, this constitutes a basis for the need for renewed objectives based on today's challenges and for a continuous follow-up of an active policy for architecture, form and design.</p>
<h2>Discussion of the language and concepts (Chapter 3)</h2>
<p>A communication and discussion of how the concepts of architecture, form and design are used aims to increase understanding between the field’s practitioners, regardless of the roles in which they encounter each other in the process of society building. A shared concept of what architecture, form and design do  is the starting point for a deeper insight into which values should guide the development of a designed living environment. Excessively divergent interpretations of this field’s content and meaning can be detrimental both to the work with architecture, form and design, and to a policy intended to strengthen the position of this field. A shared viewpoint also creates an opportunity to bring together various practitioners and stakeholders.</p>
<p>In order for the policy and its long-term measures to have a broad impact, the Commission believes it is necessary to have a continuous discussion about and communication of the field as a cohesive whole and of the perspective of a designed living environment in the context of the relevant societal challenges.</p>
<h2>The perspective of a designed living environment and society’s challenges (Chapter 4)</h2>
<p>The starting point of the report is a holistic perspective based on the individual human being’s needs and possibilities both today and in the future. We have chosen to call this holistic perspective designed living environment  and it is the core of the new policy which we propose. The perspective is based on the view that architecture, form and design are a cohesive field which shapes the human living environment in interaction with other social and policy fields, the inhabitants and the business community.</p>
<p>Architecture, form and design provide powerful tools and methods, which, through deliberate and inclusive usage, can contribute to a sustainable development of society and to bridging the growing economic, social and geographical divides in society. Under the overall heading of Sustainable development  with the three dimensions of environmental, social and economic sustainability, the Commission identifies a number of societal challenges. Climate and resources  is a discussion of unsustainable resource use and how climate change is challenging people's life patterns. In the section entitled Technological development  we describe a radical technological development and the consequences of digitisation and increasing access to information. Urbanisation, the city, and rural development  addresses the ongoing globalisation’s effects, segregation, health differences, accessibility, demographics and the development of the countryside and small localities in relation to urbanisation and densification. The section entitled Housing  discusses housing’s significance to the individual and society, and the fact that the extensive housing construction in Sweden permits great opportunities to create communities which bridge social, economic and geographical divides.</p>
<p>The perspective of a designed living environment and the architecture, form and design objectives should always relate to society's challenges and help to resolve them. The policy should be periodically evaluated and new measures initiated. An active, debating and engaged architectural, form and design policy will thereby continue to be relevant to addressing future challenges.</p>
<h2>Policy on architecture, form and design in other countries (Chapter 5)</h2>
<p>The Commission was mandated to describe how policy in this field has developed in a few selected countries and what the current situation in this field is like today. The Commission examines the architectural and design policy work of Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, the UK and the European Commission, and also examines the interaction between the actors in architecture, form and design. Based on the Commission's directive and perspective, the Commission also indicates what policy work on sustainable social development is like internationally in an overall survey of some cities and countries' policy objectives and strategies.</p>
<p>The Commission notes that national support in the form of tools and methodological advice to municipal architectural policy is well developed in Denmark, for example. The UK and Denmark are far advanced in the design of public sector services to increase trust among citizens. Both the public and private sectors perceive advantages in using design expertise in their development in both the product and service sectors. Furthermore, the comparison in this chapter reveals that the countries described have come a long way with regard to the renewal of their policy but that they do not have a cohesive perspective on architecture, form and design in the same way that Sweden does. In its work on a new policy from the perspective of a designed living environment, Sweden is a role model.</p>
<h2>Proposal for new national objectives (Chapter 6)</h2>
<p>Since the late 1990s, state measures in architecture, form and design based on the objectives have promoted development in this field and provided good support for work done in this field. However, we believe that these measures should be characterised by a broader approach based on the perspective of a designed living environment, in which the field’s tools are given an active role in solving society's challenges. We therefore propose new objectives for this field. The objectives will be designed to interact more closely with the existing environmental and cultural policy objectives and also other relevant objectives.</p>
<p>The overall objective of the national policy for architecture, form and design is to strengthen the field’s influence and thereby help to create a well-designed living environment with long-term sustainability. In working to achieve this goal, state measures in architecture, form and design shall actively promote:</p>
<p>• a holistic view characterised by quality, cooperation and dialogue in the creation of an attractive designed living environment,</p>
<p>• an inclusive and democratic society with access to good living environments, both individual and shared,</p>
<p>• exemplary action from the public sector, in all its roles, for enhanced quality in a designed living environment and</p>
<p>• broad and  cross-sectoral knowledge development in education and for practitioners and actors in the field of a designed living environment.</p>
<h2>The Agency for a Designed Living Environment (Chapter 7)</h2>
<p>To meet the objectives and achieve a powerful and long-term impact, the Commission believes a state agency is required which can develop and drive the policy for architecture, form and design, and which can continuously track the development of knowledge, provide a perspective, collaborate, stimulate, debate, follow up how the state is fulfilling its function as a role model, and, when necessary, propose new objectives.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the Swedish Centre for Architecture and Design (Arkdes) is restructured to be the Agency for a Designed Living Environment. The name should be regarded as a working name and can be finally determined at a later date.</p>
<p>The proposal involves the following:</p>
<p>• The collections will be transferred to a  state-funded museum with good conditions for handling both the conservation and exhibition of the collections.</p>
<p>• The exhibition activities in their current form will not form part of the new agency. The agency will be able to have exhibition activities of an investigative and debating nature and will also produce and participate in productions of exhibitions at other locations.</p>
<p>• a design function will be established at the Agency for a Designed Living Environment to provide support for and increase the use of design methodology in state activities.</p>
<p>• The Agency for a Designed Living Environment will cooperate closely with the existing and new regional actors, which will function as active nodes within the field.</p>
<p>• The agency will be a national meeting place with good capabilities of providing a perspective on and demonstrating the benefit of architecture, form and design, and of stimulating other actors to adopt and drive the perspective of a designed living environment in their respective operations.</p>
<p>• The pedagogical remit, library and research activities will be included in and developed as part of the new agency’s operations.</p>
<p>• The agency will follow up the state’s work and function as a role model by cooperating with other agencies and will be responsible in various ways for ensuring that the perspective of a designed living environment is applied and used within the public sector.</p>
<p>• The agency will allocate monies from the development fund proposed by the Commission for this field.</p>
<h2>The public sector and proposed measures as part of a new policy (Chapter 8)</h2>
<p>Measures by the central, county council and municipal governments will support the policy for architecture, form and design nationally, regionally and locally. The Commission gives an overall description of the public sector and the municipalities’ and county councils’ tasks, and gives proposals for how the public sector should work together to strengthen the perspective of a designed living environment.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposals and assessments in this chapter include the following:</p>
<p>• The position of national architect will be created at the National Property Board of Sweden. The Property Board will be given special responsibility for developing cooperation over architectural quality in construction and property management by the state.</p>
<p>• a development fund will be built up to promote a development of the field of architecture, form and design throughout the country and to support  export-promoting measures.</p>
<p>• the Agency for a Designed Living Environment and the National Property Board of Sweden will be mandated to provide guidance and support to the development of architecture, form and design programmes in state agencies.</p>
<p>• international exchange in and the Swedish export of architecture, form and design will be strengthened. The exportpromoting actors should be supported in their efforts to raise the cultural values and strengthen exports in this field.</p>
<p>• the Agency for a Designed Living Environment, the Swedish National Heritage Board, Public Art Agency Sweden and the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning will be mandated to develop guidance and provide support for the development of municipal programmes for architecture, form and design.</p>
<p>• state funding will be given to the  wild card  system to increase diversity and stimulate the architectural and design industry by giving practitioners at the start-up stage a greater opportunity to participate in procurements, competitions and innovation processes.</p>
<h2>Greater competency in public procurement (Chapter 9)</h2>
<p>A very large proportion of public procurement contracts are in some way linked to products, services or processes which contain architecture, form and design. The procuring agencies have a great responsibility to employ our common funds in the optimal way. Effective tools and a high level of competency are necessary to ensure that the correct form of procurement is applied, that the regulations are interpreted in a relevant manner, that follow-up is done and that knowledge about the field enables a greater focus on quality in public procurement.</p>
<p>The proposals and assessments in the chapter include the following:</p>
<p>• continued and increased support should be given to some research actors to increase competency in the procurement of goods and services in the field of architecture, form and design, and in the innovative building of society based on the perspective of a designed living environment.</p>
<p>• The National Agency for Public Procurement in cooperation with the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions should develop a quality policy for the municipalities for the procurement of architecture, form and design.</p>
<p>• The National Agency for Public Procurement should develop and provide methodological support and guidance for new forms of procurement which facilitate the focus on quality in the public procurement of architectural, form and design services.</p>
<p>• procuring agencies and suppliers will have access to a forum to enable meetings and create dialogues.</p>
<h2>Measures for knowledge, competency and collaboration (Chapter 10)</h2>
<p>The population’s involvement and participation is an important prerequisite for the development and strengthening of this field of knowledge. Citizen dialogue is a tool for communicating with the inhabitants. Children and young people should acquire knowledge about architecture, form and design early on and throughout their entire schooling. The role of the architect and designer should be developed through cross-sectoral cooperation. Students of architecture, form and design programmes at colleges and universities should be given broader knowledge during their training. It is also important that decision-makers and procurers of architecture, form and design in public-sector activities, businesses and organisations have the knowledge to utilise the possibilities of this field.</p>
<p>The Commission raises the problem of selection bias in recruiting students for the educational programmes. Broader recruitment increases the quality of the education and develops both the students and the programmes.</p>
<p>The proposals and assessments in the chapter include the following:</p>
<p>• the qualities of the architecture, form and design educational programmes should be evaluated from the perspective of broadened recruitment to promote greater diversity.</p>
<p>• a call should be made for research applications in the field of building a sustainable society from the perspective of a designed living environment.</p>
<p>• continued support for the research networks should be tested in the forthcoming research bill, as should the possibilities of establishing a corresponding infrastructure for the applied arts and crafts.</p>
<p>• the consequences of the introduction of tuition fees for the form and design educational programmes for students who are citizens of countries outside the European Economic Area should be investigated.</p>
<h2>Need for changes to the current legislation (Chapter 11)</h2>
<p>This chapter describes the current provisions of the Planning and Building Act, the Road Law, the Railways Act and the Environmental Code. In conjunction with the adoption of the Framtidsformer action plan, changes were made to the Planning and Building Act (1987:10), the Road Law (1971:948) and the Construction of Railways Act (1995:1649) with the introduction of the so-called “beauty sections”. These sections enable publicsector procurers to make appropriate demands on aesthetic design at an early stage of the process. The Commission considers that the current provisions of the Environmental Code and the Planning and Building Act complement each other well.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that:</p>
<p>• no changes be made to the relevant sections of the Road Law, the Railways Act and the Planning and Building Act, or to new provisions in the Environmental Code.</p>
<p>• the Government should expand the appropriation for innovative construction to include all categories of housing construction. Funds should also be allocated for dissemination and implementation. Some of the investment subsidies for rental housing could appropriately be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>• the Agency for a Designed Living Environment should be given a remit to do a cohesive  follow-up of the changes to the relevant legislation that came into force in 1999 and that was subsequently altered when legislation in each sector was reviewed.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposals (Chapter 12)</h2>
<p>The economic consequence of establishing the Agency for a Designed Living Environment is cost neutral in the long term. The restructuring itself, however, can lead to costs for work at the Government Offices and involved authorities. The proposal to transfer the collections to a state-funded museum will require making a financial adjustment and reviewing the needs of the involved activities with regard to their premises.</p>
<p>The Commission’s other proposals has no or only minor financial consequences in the form of increased costs. The new position of national architect proposed for the National Property Board is an unfunded reform which affects the surplus that the National Property Board repays to the state.</p>
<p>The proposed fund for supporting development measures in architecture, form and design should be built up gradually and the financial consequences of the proposal need to be studied more closely. The Commission proposes that state agencies develop programmes for architecture, form and design, which can involve a new cost for those agencies that have not previously worked with such programmes. Implemented programmes can lead to cost savings.</p>
<p>In general the proposals involve no direct effect on municipal self-government through legislation. No significant initial effects on the national level of employment are predicted.</p>
<p>The Commission’s starting point is an inclusive and democratic society with equal access to good living environments. This comprises the foundation of long-term consequences in the form of the equal distribution to all inhabitants of social welfare benefits, access to health care, schooling, services, public spaces and digital services. A consequence of reinforcing this field would be to increase employment by means of more exports and stronger corporate development. In the long term the Commission’s proposals will contribute to increased health, equality, equitable distribution and democracy in the broad sense and will have positive consequences for the possibilities of achieving the integration policy objectives.</p>
