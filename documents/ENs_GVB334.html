<p>Summary of proposals</p>
<p>The committee of inquiry proposes that children in families who have gone into hiding to avoid the enforcement of a refusal-ofentry or expulsion order be entitled to education in the state school system for children and young people on largely the same terms as children resident in Sweden. In the case of such children, school attendance will not be compulsory. We also propose that the children covered by our mandate shall have the right to take part in public preschool and school-age child care activities.</p>
<p>In our assessment, the system of rules proposed here is compatible with current Swedish secrecy provisions and with the provisions concerning the duty to report, provide information and notify the police and social services, and that no statutory amendments will therefore be required in these areas. Nor do we consider that there is any need to introduce a ban prohibiting police from fetching children due for expulsion/refused entry from preschools or schools.</p>
<p>The mission</p>
<p>Our assignment has been to examine the prospects for regulating entitlement to preschool and school education and to school-age child care for children and young people who have gone into hiding to avoid the enforcement of a decision concerning refusal of entry or expulsion. In the process, we have reviewed which activities and principals should be covered by such regulations.</p>
<p>Our tasks have included examining what such regulations might look like and whether there is any need for changes in educational or aliens legislation or in other provisions governing activities in this area. A further task has been to decide whether such a</p>
<p>regulatory system is compatible with current Swedish secrecy provisions and with provisions concerning the duty to report, provide information and notify the police and the social services, or whether statutory amendments would be required. This has also involved considering the question of whether police work relating to the enforcement of expulsion/refusal-of-entry orders should be subject to special regulation. In addition, the mandate has required us to review the situation of staff in schools and other areas of activity.</p>
<p>Finally, we have been assigned to review current forms of government compensation to the municipalities.</p>
<p>Which children are covered by the mandate?</p>
<p>We take the view that those covered by the mandate are persons under 18 years of age whose applications for residence permits in Sweden have been turned down and who have gone into hiding to avoid enforcement of the expulsion/refusal-of-entry order that accompanied the decision. The mandate is not, however, deemed to cover children who have arrived in Sweden without applying for residence permits here (‘paperless children’), children who have previously had a temporary residence permit that has expired, or children whose decisions on expulsion/refusal of entry have ceased to apply due to statutory limitation under Chapter 12, Section 22 of the Aliens Act (2005:716) or to earlier legislation of a corresponding kind.</p>
<p>Should entitlement to preschool and school education and to school-age child care be introduced?</p>
<p>Children living in hiding are in a vulnerable position that as a rule they can do nothing about. In the great majority of cases, it is the parents who choose not to comply with decisions concerning expulsion or refusal of entry. The question of a child’s entitlement to schooling in such cases, therefore, must be viewed from the perspective of the individual child. The right to attend school would give children the opportunity to break out of their isolation, to attain the same level of knowledge as other children and thus to prepare for adult life, wherever they may live in the future.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has criticised Sweden for failing to allow ‘children in hiding’ an education. While in principle there may be arguments against providing children in the present category with an education – especially the argument that in Sweden such entitlement would conflict with the principle of regulated immigration – it is our considered opinion that the strong individual grounds for making such provision outweigh these objections. We propose, therefore, that the children covered by our mandate be granted entitlement to education. This confers a corresponding duty on municipalities and other public educational principals to absorb these children into their preschool/school and school-age child care systems.</p>
<p>Which activities should the new regulations cover?</p>
<p>Children covered by our mandate are to have the right to attend all forms of schooling in the public education system for children and young people, i.e. publicly run compulsory schools, preschool classes, upper secondary schools, compulsory schools for students with learning disabilities, upper secondary schools for students with learning disabilities, special schools for students with impaired hearing, and Sami schools. To be allowed to attend the above two upper secondary school forms, however, children must begin their courses before the age of 18. No compulsion to attend school is proposed for the children covered by our mandate.</p>
<p>In addition, the children are to have access to public preschool and school-age child care services on the same terms as children resident in Sweden.</p>
<p>Under our proposals, entitlement to education for children in families that have gone into hiding to avoid the enforcement of expulsion/refusal-of-entry orders does not extend to independent schools or to preschool classes, preschool activities or school-age child care activities run privately. However, there is nothing to prevent children being accepted into such activities on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>Educational content</p>
<p>The children covered by our mandate are to be entitled to education on largely the same terms as children resident in Sweden. The tuition provided is to take into account the needs and capabilities of the individual student.</p>
<p>Students are to be entitled to mother-tongue tuition and study supervision in their own languages, and to be taught Swedish as a second language on the same terms as children resident in the country. Insofar as they experience difficulties in their school work, they are entitled to special support on the same terms as other students. In exceptional cases, however, the fact that a student is in hiding to avoid enforcement of an expulsion/refusalof-entry order and can thus be expected to leave the country at a relatively early stage means that a school may have reason to limit the extent of its educational input and provision.</p>
<p>Students are to be entitled to progress talks/performance appraisals on the same terms as other students in the school. In addition, they are to receive grades and certificates reflecting their educations.</p>
<p>Public access and secrecy</p>
<p>Current provisions on secrecy in the public educational system for children and young people and in the preschool and school-age child care services offer relatively good protection against information that could identify children in families that have gone into hiding to avoid the enforcement of expulsion/refusal-of-entry orders, or could identify those close to them. Additional provisions that further strengthen confidentiality in this respect are not required. Nor is there any reason to reduce the extent of such protection for these children. Thus the introduction of entitlement to education for the children covered by the present mandate will not necessitate any amendment to the provisions in Chapter 7, Sections 1 C, 9 or 38 of the Act on Secrecy (1980:100).</p>
<p>The present rules governing secrecy between school, preschool and school-age child care and other public authorities should not be amended. This means for instance that the question of whether classified information about children in families that have gone into hiding to avoid the enforcement of expulsion/refusal-of-entry orders may be provided to the police or the Swedish Migration</p>
<p>Board is to be decided in each individual case pursuant to the catch-all clause in Chapter 14, Section 3 of the Act on Secrecy.</p>
<p>The duty of school, preschool and school-age child care facilities to notify the social welfare committee of any malpractices under Chapter 14, Section of the Social Services Act (2001:453) will also apply in the case of the children covered by the present mandate.</p>
<p>Should preschools and schools represent ‘free zones’?</p>
<p>In the course of our inquiry, we have discussed whether preschools and schools should be ranked as free zones where police would not be allowed to fetch children due for expulsion/refusal of entry. Free zones where police are not allowed to intervene for the purpose of enforcing legally valid decisions are nowhere present in Swedish legislation. In our assessment, a ban whereby police were not allowed to fetch children from the above facilities would militate against enforcement work and require public authorities to act in opposing ways. Also, such a prohibition would result in a number of troublesome demarcation problems. In our view, therefore, police should not be banned from fetching children due for expulsion/refusal of entry from preschool or school facilities.</p>
<p>As we see it, the principles laid down in the Swedish Police Act (1984:387) concerning needs, proportionality and consideration, along with the principle of the child’s best interests laid down in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, are sufficient to ensure that enforcement is undertaken in a manner that is compatible with what is best both for the child who is due for expulsion/refusal of entry and for other children in the activity concerned. In our opinion, therefore, there is no need for the introduction of any provisions in Swedish acts or ordinances prescribing when and how police should be allowed to enter preschools or schools to fetch children who are due for expulsion/have been refused entry.</p>
<p>Practical problems</p>
<p>It is impossible to foresee today all the problems that might arise in the event of children covered by our mandate becoming entitled to public education. Nor is it possible to provide detailed proposals on how conceivable problems might be solved. Children live in</p>
<p>different situations and have different backgrounds and capabilities. Often, therefore, it should be a matter of arriving at individual solutions from case to case.</p>
<p>We have discussed and considered solutions in respect of the following practical problems:</p>
<p>– The responsible authority – Which municipality/municipalities should be responsible for receiving children who have gone into hiding to avoid the enforcement of  expulsion/refusal-ofentry orders?</p>
<p>– Information to families living in hiding – How are families living in hiding to obtain information about their children’s entitlement to education and to preschool and  school-age child care services?</p>
<p>– Contact with custodians – What problems may arise for schools, preschool facilities and  school-age child care services in terms of cooperation with the custodians of children living in hiding?</p>
<p>– Insurance – Are the children of families that have gone into hiding to avoid the enforcement of  expulsion/refusal-of-entry orders covered by the collective accident insurance policies taken out by municipalities?</p>
<p>– Class lists etc – Should the children of families that have gone into hiding to avoid the enforcement of  expulsion/refusal-ofentry orders be registered in class lists or in other lists of children attending school, preschool or school-age child care?</p>
<p>Government compensation to the municipalities</p>
<p>Our proposals concerning school education for children covered by the present mandate entail extra costs to the municipalities. We therefore propose that the municipalities be compensated by means of a specific government grant. The size of the grant is to be determined annually by the Government, whereupon compensation is to be paid to the municipalities in proportion to the number of asylum-seeking children living in their areas. In our assessment, the total size of the grant should be calculated on the basis of the</p>
<p>estimated number of children who have gone into hiding to avoid the enforcement of expulsion/refusal-of-entry orders, and should take into account the actual costs of school education, preschool activities and school-age child care services. We therefore propose that the more immediate responsibility for decisions on government grants to the municipalities, and the payment thereof, should lie with the Swedish Migration Board.</p>
<p>In our opinion, county councils should not benefit from the proposed government grant. It is fair to assume that a very limited number of young people who have gone into hiding to avoid the enforcement of expulsion/refusal-of-entry orders will attend upper secondary schools run by the county council. Given the compensation model chosen, therefore, county councils would in all likelihood be over-compensated in relation to the municipalities were they to have access to the government grant.</p>
<p>Under our proposals, entitlement to education for children covered by the present mandate would not extend to independent schools or preschool classes, preschool activities or school-age child care activities run privately. We do not believe that independent schools and privately run facilities that accept these children on a voluntary basis should qualify for municipal grants.</p>
