<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) entered into force on 27 June 2019, with the exception of certain articles which require supplementary provisions at national level and which therefore will not be applied until 28 June 2021. The main purpose of the Regulation is to achieve a high level of cybersecurity, cyber resilience and trust within the Union, and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit for this first part consisted of proposing the adaptations and supplementary national statutory provisions necessitated by the EU Cybersecurity Act and which must be in place when the entire Regulation begins to apply on 28 June 2021.</p>
<p>The remit included considering and proposing which existing national authority should be designated to perform the tasks and assigned the areas of responsibility ensuing from the EU Cybersecurity Act, including the task of supervising compliance with the European cybersecurity certification framework. It also included examining which supplementary national provisions – including procedural provisions and provisions on penalties – are required by the Regulation or which should be introduced for other reasons.</p>
<p>In its final report, the Inquiry will analyse and consider whether requirements should be introduced on certification and approval of certain products, services and processes that will be used in activities of importance to Sweden’s security. A report on this part of the remit is to be presented by 1 March 2021.</p>
<h2>Need for increased cybersecurity</h2>
<p>Digitalisation is described as the strongest factor for change of our time and means that a growing proportion of social activities depend on networks and information systems used by public authorities, organisations, companies and private individuals. The digital transformation provides major opportunities to improve and streamline people’s normal lives and different activities. Digitalisation has created new forms of communication, data management and data storage. Today, many information management systems are based primarily on digital information and communications technology (ICT). Following in the wake of the increasing digitalisation and globalisation, which increase dependencies over national and sectoral borders and across areas of responsibility, is also increased focus on cyber issues in society. Information and cybersecurity efforts – by both public and private actors – are seen as necessary in digitalisation processes so that society is able to function and develop in line with the objectives that have been set in the different policy areas. At the same time as a growing number of countries are developing their cyber strategies, doctrines and capabilities, cyberattacks against different interests and activities are increasing. These threats may consist of attacks that have political, financial or criminal motives, but unintentional incidents that affect cybersecurity are also increasing. Cyber incidents can disrupt the provision of essential services, such as water, health and medical care, electricity and mobile services. The possibilities of influencing information systems in democratic election processes and disinformation campaigns are also a challenge. Dependency on digital infrastructure and services through connected devices and widespread internet connectivity creates increased vulnerability, which places higher demands on information security and cybersecurity. The importance of information and cybersecurity increases to a corresponding degree. Monitoring and certifying ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes can make them more secure and also increase trust in them.</p>
<h2>EU Cybersecurity Act</h2>
<p>The EU Cybersecurity Act is divided into two parts. The first part deals with objectives, tasks and organisational matters relating to the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA). The second part regulates the establishment of a European cybersecurity certification framework. The Commission will prepare a rolling work programme for European cybersecurity certification which sets out strategic priorities for future European cybersecurity certification schemes. With the help of expert advice and in close cooperation with the European Cybersecurity Certification Group (ECCG), ENISA will submit proposals for European certification schemes. The aim is to ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity for information and communication technology (ICT) in the Union, and to avoid fragmentation of the internal market with regard to cybersecurity certification schemes in the Union. The creation of the European cybersecurity certification schemes will mean that certificates issued under these certification schemes will be valid and recognised in all Member States. In addition to describing the security objectives that must be considered when designing the European cybersecurity certification schemes, the EU Cybersecurity Act specifies what the minimum contents of such schemes should be.</p>
<h2>New legislation that supplements the EU Cybersecurity Act</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the necessary supplementary national provisions to the EU Cybersecurity Act be collected in a new law and a new ordinance. The law will specify that the Government is to designate a national cybersecurity certification authority and provide supplementary provisions on this authority’s powers and ability to impose penalties for infringements of the regulatory framework, and also certain procedural provisions.</p>
<h2>A national cybersecurity certification authority</h2>
<p>The EU Cybersecurity Act requires that Member States designate one or more national authorities for cybersecurity certification. Considering that an existing authority is to be selected for this role, requirements on knowledge and experience of information and communication technology (ICT), and bearing in mind that the Swedish Certification Body for IT Security (CSEC) at the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration must be involved when it comes to cybersecurity certification at the highest assurance level, it is proposed that the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration be designated as the national authority for cybersecurity certification. Accordingly, the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration will therefore carry out the tasks that follow from the European cybersecurity certification framework. These tasks include international monitoring of the cybersecurity certification field, cooperating with national and international actors, taking responsibility for cybersecurity certification at the highest assurance level and supervising compliance with the regulatory system.</p>
<p>The Swedish Certification Body for IT Security (CSEC) at the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration is proposed as the accredited conformity assessment body under Articles 56.5 and 56.6 of the EU Cybersecurity Act. This means that the CSEC, or any other accredited conformity assessment body that is appointed, will be responsible for cybersecurity certification at the highest assurance level.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the certification body’s independence as the accredited conformity assessment body, it is proposed that it be specified in law that there is to be an accredited conformity assessment body at the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration pursuant to the EU Cybersecurity Act.</p>
<p>When the head of the accredited conformity assessment body conducts activities pursuant to the EU Cybersecurity Act, they are not subordinate to the head of the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration. The certification body’s financial resources should be determined by the Government in a special procedure.</p>
<h2>Supervision</h2>
<p>The EU Cybersecurity Act states that the national authority for cybersecurity certification is to supervise and enforce the provisions of the European cybersecurity certification framework.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that as the national authority for cybersecurity certification, the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration is to carry out the supervisory tasks that follow from the EU Cybersecurity Act and thus be granted the powers as regulated in the the Act.</p>
<p>The Swedish Defence Materiel Administration will deal with complaints concerning an EU statement of conformity that has been issued or a European cybersecurity certificate. It will also check that manufacturers or providers that conduct conformity self-assessments of ICT products, ICT services and ICT processes (i.e. when an EU statement of conformity is issued) carry out their obligations and that a European cybersecurity certificate that is issued complies with the requirements of the relevant European cybersecurity certification scheme. The Defence Materiel Administration will also assist the national accreditation body in the monitoring and supervision of the activities of conformity assessment bodies in accordance with the provisions of the Cybersecurity Act.</p>
<p>Powers</p>
<p>The EU Cybersecurity Act grants the national authority for cybersecurity certification certain minimum powers so that it can fulfil its supervisory tasks.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes certain supplementary provisions concerning supervisory powers. The authority will determine the orders necessary to ensure compliance with the EU Cybersecurity Act, the implementing acts issued pursuant to the Regulation, the new act and regulations issued in connection with the act. It can order a relevant actor to provide information or take some other appropriate action. The authority can also approve cybersecurity certificates and revoke a certificate that has been issued. The authority may decide that an order is to apply with immediate effect. A decision to issue an order may be accompanied by a conditional financial penalty. The authority may also conduct an examination of the relevant actor’s premises for supervisory purposes. However, the right to access premises will not apply to living accommodations. It is proposed that the authority have the right to be assisted by the Swedish Enforcement Authority when conducting supervision. It is also proposed that the Government or the authority designated by the Government be permitted to issue more detailed regulations on the forms for submitting information, the supervisory procedure for investigations and examination procedures when accessing premises.</p>
<p>Penalties</p>
<p>The EU Cybersecurity Act states that Member States are to establish rules on penalties for infringements of the provisions in the European cybersecurity certification framework. The penalties are to be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the national authority for cybersecurity certification be allowed to impose fines on those who: fail to report an EU statement of conformity or possession of a European cybersecurity certificate; issue an EU statement of conformity without meeting established requirements on cybersecurity; submit incorrect or incomplete information when applying for cybersecurity certification; hold a European cybersecurity certificate and fail to provide information on vulnerabilities or irregularities that are detected; or issue an EU statement of conformity or who hold a cybersecurity certification and who fail to submit supplementary security information. It will also be possible to impose fines on those who violate the conditions for issuing, maintaining, continuing and renewing European cybersecurity certificates, as well as the conditions for reducing or extending the scope of certification, infringe on a prohibition decision or use a European cybersecurity certificate that has been revoked. Accordingly, the fee may be imposed on issuers of European cybersecurity certificates and certificate holders (ICT manufacturers and providers), and conformity assessment bodies.</p>
<p>The fee is to be imposed even if the infringement was not committed intentionally or through negligence, e.g. strict liability applies. If there are special grounds or if, in view of the circumstances, it would otherwise not be reasonable to impose a fine, it may be reduced. The fine is to be set at no less than SEK 10 000 and no more than SEK 15 000 000.</p>
<h2>National strategy</h2>
<p>The Government should consider preparing a national strategy to safeguard national interests when the European cybersecurity certification framework is developed. Relevant public authorities, other public sector actors and business should have the chance to participate in this work.</p>
<h2>Cooperation</h2>
<p>To ensure that national interests can be represented and safeguarded in work on the European cybersecurity certification framework, there must be adequate national representation in the European Cybersecurity Certification Group. This requires expanded and efficient cooperation among relevant public authorities, business organisations and companies.</p>
<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>The aim of the Inquiry’s proposals is to meet the requirements of the EU Cybersecurity Act and to contribute to effective and effi- cient acceptance and application of the European cybersecurity certification framework. However, the analysis of the need for sup- plementary national provisions has been hampered by the uncertain- ty about the detailed contents of future European cybersecurity certification schemes (implementing acts).</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that it is not currently possible to assess the direct impact that introduction of the European cybersecurity certification framework will have for the designated national author- ity for cybersecurity certification or for other actors affected by the specified framework, since no implementing act has yet been adopted. Nor is it possible to assess the extent to which relevant actors will make use of the option to obtain EU statements of conformity or issue European cybersecurity certificates, which also affects the need and scope of supervision. Consequently, it is also not possible to estimate the funding needed for implementation of the legislative proposals, except regarding the national authority for cybersecurity certification’s need for certain additional resources.</p>
<p>When drafting the proposals concerning matters such as tasks for and the organisation of the national authority for cybersecurity certification, the Inquiry took account of the alternative that can be expected to be the most appropriate and cost-effective. Under the EU Cybersecurity Act, the authority’s duties entail costs for admin- istrative work and for supervision. Among other things, new powers and the possibility to impose penalties entail a need to train staff and change certain working methods. However, the initial costs for this are expected to be limited. It is proposed that the CSEC’s activities continue to be funded by appropriations for certain basic functions, and continue to be funded by fees for cybersecurity certification tasks.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals on supplementary provisions regarding the authority’s powers and the possibility to impose fines are not expected to entail any financial consequences in themselves.</p>
<p>The proposals presented by the Inquiry that primarily deal with cooperation and coordination between the relevant authorities are expected to have a marginal impact in terms of costs.</p>
<p>The European cybersecurity certification framework involves voluntary or mandatory cybersecurity certification. A financial actor decides to provide ICT products or services in the Union market on condition that the provisions on cybersecurity certification are fol- lowed. It is not possible to estimate the number of companies affected by the Inquiry’s proposals. Nor is it possible to make a more detailed assessment of the impact of the proposals on companies or enterprises in Sweden, other than that the companies that choose to issue an EU statement of conformity or apply for a European cyber- security certificate will incur costs in connection with the procedure. Effective supervision also increases the possibilities for entrepre- neurs to compete on equal terms. In the long term, the proposed provisions are expected to lead to increased cybersecurity and a more efficient market, which will ultimately benefit both financial actors and the functioning of the Union market.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the new act and other legislative amendments enter into force on 28 June 2021.</p>
