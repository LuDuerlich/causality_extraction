<p>Background</p>
<p>The main tasks for the Commission, specified in the terms of reference were to review the so called Elderly Reform (Ädelreformen) introduced in Sweden in 1992. The aim with the reform was to integrate social and medical care for the elderly and provide good housing and living conditions for them. In general the reform has improved the living conditions for the elderly in many ways. For instance old people no longer stay in hospitals when their medical treatment is considered completed and institutional nursing homes and long-term hospitals have been rebuilt into special housing for elderly and disabled. Homecare is also available around the clock. The number of hospital-beds has decreased due to better medical treatments and shorter stays in hospitals. However, the Government states that there still remain problems to be solved.</p>
<p>Problems</p>
<p>The target group for the Commission is mainly elderly people with multiple chronic conditions which can swiftly change over time. They are discharged rapidly from hospitals but are often soon back again because of inadequate integration of social and medical resources in the primary health care and social services. The responsibility for home nursing and rehabilitation is divided between the County Councils and the Local Authorities causing conflicts between them and also between the staff concerned. For instance physicians seldom make home visits to persons who are receiving home nursing services. In general medical and rehabilitation efforts are judged inadequate especially concerning people who live in their own home.</p>
<p>Aims</p>
<p>The main tasks for the Commission is to propose how social and medical care including rehabilitation and aids for disabled should be organized to ensure an integrated care and service for the elderly. The Commission has focused on legislation and collaboration between County Councils and Local Authorities.</p>
<p>Proposals</p>
<p>This report contains the Commission`s considerations and proposals. The proposals concern three main areas:</p>
<p>• A responsibility for the Local Authorities to provide an integrated social service and medical care in peoples ordinary homes or in special housing facilities and as well in short stay units and centers for day activities. The care and service must be based on a holistic assessment of individual social and medical needs and on equal terms for all people. Experts on rehabilitation such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists are needed to supervise nurses and nurse`s aids in their work helping patients with their daily activities.</p>
<p>• To integrate resources from the primary health care centers into a coherent homecare. The responsibility for the physicians shall remain with the County Councils but they should be due to come on terms with the Local Authorities to provide physicians for  home-visits on longterm and stable conditions.</p>
<p>• To ensure collaboration between hospital care, primary health care and home care. Multidisciplinary interventions are required for optimal results. Legal agreements are required to ensure collaboration between the County Councils and Local Authorities.</p>
<p>The Commission has carried out its work in an open-minded way with out-reaching activities. Comparisons have also been made with care systems in Denmark, Finland and Norway.</p>
