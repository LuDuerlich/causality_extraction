<p>The commission was charged with reviewing the system for subsidies on food for special medical purposes and with proposing changes to the present system. A guiding principle was that food for special medical purposes would continue to be subsidised by the state but that the costs for the proposed reform should not exceed society’s current costs for these substances. 'LHW DQG KHDOWK</p>
<p>The correlation between diet and health has recently received increasing attention. In the case of some illnesses, intolerance to certain products, or functional impairment a special diet may be required if the patient’s energy and nutritional requirements cannot be satisfied with normal food. Patients’ organisations have emphasised that individuals with special dietary requirements must have the same right to nourishment as healthy persons.</p>
<p>Today children under the age of 16 are legally entitled -  within the framework of subsidies on medicines -  to receive foodstuffs at a reduced price in the case of certain illnesses and if prescribed by a doctor. Most county councils have voluntarily undertaken to subsidise food for special medical purposes for out-patients over the age of 16. Municipalities bear the responsibility in the case of individuals living in supervised municipal accommodation.</p>
<p>The commission’s findings show that the rules for county council financial support vary clearly throughout the country. This is perceived as unfair. It is also unfair that the costs for foods for special medical purposes can differ so greatly within different patient groups. As a rule, those whose dietary requirements are satisfied entirely through food for special medical purposes pay the same charge as those who only receive a dietary supplement.</p>
<p>Variations in different parts of the country regarding adults’ rights to subsidised food for special medical purposes have also emerged. The present rules on the diagnosis of diseases and age limits for children are perceived as outdated. In the light of these findings, the commission considers it necessary to introduce a comprehensive reform.</p>
<p>In recent years the issue of public financing of treatment with foods for special medical purposes has been discussed in several official reports. More than one public authority are involved, in different ways, in the administration of these substances today. There is no cohesive system for product and price control.</p>
<p>The deficiencies of the present system have been analysed and the commission has considered various proposals for change. Close consultations with public authorities, county councils, municipalities and patients’ organisations have resulted in the proposals presented below.</p>
<p>In accordance with the directive that different solutions can be tested and in view of the fact that the current scheme for subsidies on medicines is being reviewed, the commission has presented two different proposals.</p>
<p>Both proposals rest on the premise that prescription of food for special medical purposes will be based on the patient’s medical needs. The commission has therefore proposed that the present list of diagnoses that entitle a patient to prescription be abolished. It is proposed that prescriptions may be made both by the categories of doctors who are currently permitted to prescribe food for special medical purposes and by dieticians within their spheres of operations. $OWHUQDWLYH QR</p>
<p>Alternative no. 1 – which is recommended by the commission – entails that once a medical need has been established, individuals will be legally entitled to receive foods for special medical purposes in accordance with nationally consistent rules concerning subsidies on medicines. Thus, with regard to subsidies, treatment with food for special medical purposes will be placed on a par with treatment with medicines.</p>
<p>A cash allowance is proposed for persons with gluten intolerance, in order to cover the additional costs for purchase of gluten-free products. Such products are now available in grocery stores, often at lower prices than in pharmacies. The cash allowance will give patients the freedom to buy products in ordinary grocery stores, which may stimulate a continued improvement of product choice.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the cash allowance be set at SEK 200 per month for children under the age of 16 and SEK 250 per month for adults. The proposed levels are based on an estimation of the additional costs for individuals with gluten intolerance and the available financial scope for this subsidy.</p>
<p>For foodstuffs of a medicinal nature that are not related to gluten intolerance, a needs-related model is proposed with four standard fee levels for children and adults respectively. The model is based on normal food expenses for a healthy person. The fee is then set with regard to how large a proportion of the patient’s energy requirements the special foodstuff is estimated to constitute. In this way it will be possible to normalise food costs for people with special dietary requirements in relation to those for healthy people.</p>
<p>The fee should be between SEK 200 and SEK 1000 per month for adults and SEK 170 and 750 per month for children.</p>
<p>A state-controlled fixing of prices is also proposed. An advisory committee should be set up to determine which products may be prescribed. This should lead to more consistent routines and a greater knowledge of the area. In addition it is proposed that the county councils should determine the forms under which the individual patient is to receive food for special medical purposes. $OWHUQDWLYH QR</p>
<p>Alternative no. 2 entails that the county councils and municipalities will be obliged, under the Health and Medical Services Act, to provide food for special medical purposes. The county councils and municipalities should themselves determine what rules and routines should apply locally. They would also be responsible for procurement of the products. &RVWV</p>
<p>In 1998 the costs for food for special medical purposes within the scheme for subsidies on medicines amounted to SEK 101 million including patients’ fees and VAT, or SEK 82 million excluding patients’ fees and VAT. The county councils’ voluntary subsidies on food for special medical purposes in 1998 were estimated to SEK 60 million excluding patients’ fees and VAT. The county councils’ total costs for food for special medical purposes therefore amount to just over SEK 140 million excluding patients’ fees and VAT.</p>
<p>The commission’s main proposal - alternative no. 1 - is estimated to cost approximately SEK 148 million excluding patients’ fees and VAT. This would entail a net increase in costs of just under SEK 7 million. Administrative costs would be added to that figure. According to the commission’s directives, the proposed reform should not exceed the current annual costs within the scheme for subsidies on medicines (SEK 101 million in 1998). This would mean a compensatory payment of SEK 47 million from the government to the county councils. If, on the other hand, the county councils’ total present costs for food for special medical purposes are taken into account, there would be scope to implement the proposal.</p>
<p>The commission proposes interim rules and that an evaluation be conducted after three years.</p>
