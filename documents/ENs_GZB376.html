<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>Under the terms of reference, we have had the task of analysing the regulations concerning the use of force (including coercive measures) by personnel of the Swedish Armed Forces in international peace and security-building operations (international military operations). The remit can be divided into three parts.</p>
<p>The first part of the remit was to survey the existing legal framework of international law and national law applicable to the use of force by personnel of the Swedish Armed Forces during international military operations. In this connection, the Inquiry was to examine issues concerning the deprivation of liberty of individuals during international military operations and the applicability of Swedish penalty provisions when Swedish military personnel are serving in such operations.</p>
<p>The second part of the remit involved describing how other countries, particularly other Nordic countries, view the issue of using force during international military operations and any legislative solutions they may have chosen.</p>
<p>The third part of the remit was to consider whether there is a need for special regulation of the use of force by personnel of the Swedish Armed Forces during international military operations, and to present proposals for such a regulation if necessary.</p>
<h2>Our deliberations and proposals</h2>
<p>Our remit thus includes the task of considering the need for special regulation of the use of force that may be an issue for personnel of the Swedish Armed Forces in international military operations. Such personnel are, by definition, military personnel . In order to take a position on the need for special regulation, we have formed a view of how these types of operations are designed and how Sweden has normally chosen to take part in such operations. We have also looked at the international and national regulations that apply, or that should apply, to such operations and how other countries have chosen to address these kinds of issues.</p>
<p>Chapter 6  contains an account of our deliberations on issues that have become more topical in relation to the survey of international and national (both that of Sweden and other states) law that is contained in Chapters 2–5.</p>
<p>The view of international military operations and Swedish participation in them on which we based our deliberations can briefly be summed up under the following four points:</p>
<p>Firstly , a Swedish decision to provide troops for an international military operation is an action of the state for which Sweden carries international responsibility. When such a decision is taken, Sweden’s obligations under international law must be considered, and the decision and its consequences must be in line with the international law to which Sweden is bound, that is to say that Sweden may only provide troops for an international military operation insofar as Sweden’s obligations under international law do not represent an obstacle (cf. Chapter 2).</p>
<p>Secondly , the international military operations in which Swedish troops may need to use force that go beyond self-defence are essentially limited to operations for which the use of force has been approved by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. Swedish participation in such measures has traditionally required that the operative command of the operation is exercised by another state, or group of states, or an international organisation (e.g. the UN, EU or NATO), and that Swedish participation is limited to Swedish troops being made available to the operation (see Chapter 2). The handover of Swedish troops to the operation is carried out through the transfer of authority to the military chief heading the operation on behalf of the state or organisation that is responsible for the operative implementation of the operation. As a rule, therefore, Sweden does not have jurisdiction in the area of operation. However, Sweden retains the right to recall its troops, and has the responsibility to support them, as well as the disciplinary and penal responsibility for its troops.</p>
<p>Thirdly , the forms of Swedish participation in international military operations of the kind in which Sweden so far has participated mean that the actions of the troops during an ongoing operation should generally be attributable to the state or organisation leading the operation. The Swedish force’s relationship to the unit leading the operation as regards obeying orders also means that the force – with regard to the implementation of operative activities – is obliged to follow the rules and instructions, etc. that the state or organisation leading the operation specifies are applicable during the operation. However, it should also be considered that by deciding to provide troops and by deciding to transfer operational control of an operational unit, Sweden probably has an obligation to ensure that these national decisions do not have such repercussions in the area of operation that they contravene Sweden’s obligations under international law.</p>
<p>Fourthly , a prerequisite for Swedish law applying abroad is that the act concerned must have some sort of link to Sweden. We regard it to be a natural premise that it be stated in legislation, or at least that it be clear from preparatory documents, when an extraterritorial application of Swedish law is intended, as for example is the case with the Swedish penal code in relation to the personnel of the Swedish Armed Forces participating in international military operations. In other words, we proceed from the assumption that Swedish law is territorially limited to Sweden, unless otherwise stated in law or in the preparatory work. In light of what is stated above and in accordance with what has been reported in Chapter 4, the Inquiry does not consider that the set of Swedish rules that, in one way or another, could affect the Swedish Armed Forces’ use of force is applicable abroad during international military operations. This also applies, therefore, to the rules contained in the Instrument of Government concerning fundamental rights and freedoms, which, lacking a legal basis or preparatory documents, are not relevant to the use of force by Swedish troops during international military operations.</p>
<p>It is against this background that we have considered whether there is a need for a special Swedish regulation concerning the use of force by Swedish personnel during international military operations. To be able to take a position on this, we have looked, among other things, at which Swedish national rules  are currently of interest for decisions on contributing troops to international military operations as well as for the implementation of these operations, and whether they need to be supplemented. We must also assess which rules under international law  Sweden and the participating Swedish personnel are obliged to observe.</p>
<h2>Need for national regulation</h2>
<p>Against the background of the survey and analyses we have carried out, and based on the ambiguities in both international law and national law concerning the use of force during international military operations, we propose that – in line with what has been done in Finland and France – an overall regulation be introduced into Swedish law which, under certain circumstances, permits the use of force during international military operations.</p>
<p>Our proposal entails clearly defining in national law: that  Swedish military personnel in international military operations are permitted to use force within certain specified parameters; that  the permitted use of force must be in line with the mandate for the operation and applicable international law; that  the permitted used of force may not intrude more on individuals’ rights and freedoms than is necessary and proportional with regard to the importance of the operation’s mandate being fulfilled or the threat scenario; that  the non-derogable rights must never be compromised; and that  Swedish military personnel are obliged to observe Sweden’s obligations within the area of international humanitarian law if personnel take part in an armed conflict.</p>
<p>Due process considerations concerning the limits of criminal liability were accorded great weight in the proposal to expressly permit the use of force within certain parameters. For the same reasons, the rule permitting the use of force also needs to be limited in an appropriate manner so that the area of impunity corresponds with Sweden’s position and intentions in the area. As far as possible, the provisions should provide guidance for the personnel of the Swedish Armed Forces in matters concerning what, in general, is to apply regarding the use of force during international military operations.</p>
<p>Moreover, the rules must not limit the Government’s scope for deciding on additional limits in connection with operations, e.g. with regard to the use of force by the participating Swedish personnel.</p>
<p>The statutory regulation proposed should also be seen as one component in Sweden’s overall ambition to strengthen respect for international law, including observance of international humanitarian law and human rights.</p>
<p>Our position concerning the need for the clarifications we are proposing in national law – with regard to the use of force during international military operations – is summarised under the following headings.</p>
<h2>The right to use force under certain circumstances needs to be clearly defined</h2>
<p>As has been mentioned already, the use of force in international military operations is ultimately based on the international mandate for the operation. However, it is problematic that Swedish law does not contain any clear support for the use of force during international military operations to fulfil the mandate, beyond what is contained in the rules on self-defence and emergency situations in Chapter 24 of the Swedish Penal Code. It is thus unclear where the limits for criminal liability lie. As the use of force must always have a legal basis, this is not satisfactory.</p>
<p>In the interest of clarity, it is not satisfactory to have to refer only to the Security Council mandate, an uncertain international legal situation and general arguments concerning what is reasonable under some unwritten principle of discharge from liability. Clarity can be created by stating in Swedish law that force may be used in the fulfilment of the mandate under certain circumstances .</p>
<p>An overall regulation in national law clarifying that the use of force under certain given circumstances is permitted during international military operations would also help to reduce the current uncertainty concerning individual criminal liability, and it would be preferable to a legal situation that is determined by an unwritten and thus rather unclear principle of discharge from liability.</p>
<p>Concerning the  circumstances under which a right to use force exists , as well as the limits for this, it seems natural that the use of force – beyond being a part of the fulfilment of the operation’s mandate (which is the legal basis of the right in itself) – should be: - in accordance with the operation’s national and international law mandate, and other applicable international law; and - exercised with respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, including in situations where it is not certain how far the formal obligation to do so extends.</p>
<h2>The mandate under international law</h2>
<p>Concerning the mandate under international law, the legislation should be based on the fact that there is ultimately a mandate under international law that permits the use of force. In light of the fact that the only force that are permitted under international law are those that are permitted within the mandate under international law (normally a resolution by the Security Council), it is necessary to link this permission to the mandate under international law.</p>
<h2>The national mandate</h2>
<p>The legislation should not apply to the issue of Sweden’s responsibility for ensuring respect for its obligations under international law prior  to an operation. However, we proceed from the assumption that the Government determines any limits that may be needed concerning the use of force prior to an international military operation.</p>
<p>In light of this, the law should state that the context for the use of force does not simply follow from the mandate under international law, but also from the national mandate that consists of the Riksdag’s (the Swedish Parliament) consent to, and the Government’s decision before, the operation, including the national limitations (known as caveats) concerning the tasks in which Swedish personnel may be involved during the operation, and which may refer to the use of force. These conditions can be taken into account by referring in the legislation to the ‘mandate for the operation’, which means both the national mandate and the mandate under international law.</p>
<h2>The importance of respecting applicable international law should be made clear</h2>
<p>Concerning respect for international law, the legislation should, for obvious reasons, state that the use of force must occur in accordance with applicable international law. It is not possible to permit the use of force in contravention of applicable international law. Applicable international law means the substance of international law that, due to treaty-based commitments or customary law, may be formally applicable during the operation and thus form the context of the use of force.</p>
<p>Difficulties may arise when trying to reconcile human rights with the task stated in the Security Council mandate (see Chapter 6.4.1), particularly when wording such as “take all necessary measures” is used to solve a number of specified tasks. However, it is our view that a clear conflict of standards, where Articles 25 or 103 must be applied, only will arise in rare cases. Respect for human rights will therefore not normally be hindered due to such wording in the mandate (compare, for example, the Al-Jedda case, para. 102). In the event that a clear conflict of standards should arise, we consider that the Security Council mandate, with support from Articles 25 and 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, must take precedence, also with regard to the obligations we define in our legislative proposal. As we have shown, this can happen in various ways. However, we do not consider that these circumstances need to be clarified in Swedish law.</p>
<h2>The importance of respecting international humanitarian law should be made clear</h2>
<p>There is now broad consensus that the rules of international humanitarian law  must be applied during international military operations if and when the military personnel participate in an armed conflict, even if the state to which the personnel belong cannot be said to be party to the conflict. Applying the treaties during operations, on a strictly formal basis, may be problematic. The motives for international humanitarian law being applicable to Swedish military personnel, even if Sweden as a state is not party to the armed conflict, can be sought in the fact that Sweden has an obligation to ensure that its treaty-based commitments are followed when authority is transferred to another state or another body in an international military operation. This is primarily a matter of responsibility on the part of Sweden, when deciding on participation in operations, to ensure, for example by means of caveats or in the rules specific to the operation, that personnel will not be used in contravention of commitments. This obligation also carries with it commitments under ongoing operations. The basis of this argument is that Sweden, as party to the key conventions of international humanitarian law (the Geneva Conventions with Additional Protocols), has committed itself to respect and to ensure respect for the provisions in the conventions in all  circumstances (for example, AP I, Article 1). This overarching requirement to respect international humanitarian law is thus relatively far-reaching.</p>
<p>We consider, in the same spirit as the Swedish International Humanitarian Law Inquiry (final report SOU 2010:72), that it is natural for personnel of the Swedish Armed Forces to de facto  apply international humanitarian law when participating in an armed conflict, regardless of whether or not the state of Sweden is party to the conflict. Application of the international humanitarian rules on a formal legal basis presupposes that the warring parties are party to the conflict, which would probably not be the case for Sweden when Swedish military personnel participate in international military operations.</p>
<p>The fact alone that uncertainties may arise concerning the obligation to apply international humanitarian law on a formally legal basis in an international military operation is justification for national law clearly stating that the personnel of the Swedish Armed Forces are obliged to follow international humanitarian law during an international military operation if the personnel participate in an armed conflict.</p>
<h2>The importance of respecting human rights should be made clear</h2>
<p>There is a problem concerning the formal application of human rights  during international military operations. To simply limit the law in relation to formally applicable international law appears therefore to be problematic in this respect as well. The legal situation is more problematic than the situation concerning international humanitarian law.</p>
<p>Human rights are probably not formally applicable in the type of operations in which Sweden so far has participated.</p>
<p>It can be noted that it is difficult to maintain that Sweden as a troop-contributing state is obliged to apply the European Convention on Human Rights in relation to inhabitants in the state receiving troops during international military operations of the kind that Sweden so far has participated in. This is due to the fact that a troop-contributing state is not considered in such a situation to have ‘effective control’ over persons or territory within the meaning of the European Convention on Human Rights, and the fact that an act carried out by military personnel in a similar operation is normally not attributable to the troop-contributing state. As long as the Swedish force is under the exclusive command and control of the operation, whether this command and control are exercised by another state or an international organisation, the actions of the force within the meaning of international law are not attributable to Sweden, which means that there is no Swedish jurisdiction in the area of operation.</p>
<p>In opposition to this, it can be stated that there is no complete certainty that arguments that ultimately originate from the European Court of Human Rights also apply to other human rights conventions. The argument can also be made – based on the argument concerning states’ overall responsibility for human rights during international military operations in which personnel are made available to another state or an organisation – that states have formal obligations to respect human rights. However, this is also an issue that is unclear and difficult to assess. It is also difficult at the present time to predict legal developments in this area.</p>
<p>Yet it is clear that if Sweden meets the criteria of an occupying power or if Sweden intervenes in the operative command and control of the force, for example, through an order or directive about how activities are to be conducted, the actions of the force are attributable to Sweden. This would mean that Swedish extraterritorial jurisdiction exists in the area of operation, and that the Convention is formally applicable. Also insofar as a legal commitment is considered to apply, it is difficult to determine who  should be considered responsible for ensuring this commitment, which rights  should be respected and how  this should happen within the framework of an international military operation.</p>
<p>Suitable limitations to the permitted use of force are necessary</p>
<p>In light of the uncertainty over the formal application of human rights in the types of operations in which Sweden so far has participated, and in light of the need to clearly limit the permitted use of force, it is important that legislation defining a right to use force also addresses the limitations for this use. As has been stated, to simply refer to applicable international law would mean that the legislation does not make any express demands that human rights be respected, despite the fact that the Government and the Riksdag have stated on repeated occasions that they must be observed (see Chapter 6.6.4). In our view, this is not sufficient.</p>
<p>The discrepancy between the Swedish position that human rights must be respected during international military operations and what is formally legally binding in each situation can be eliminated if the Swedish legislation states that the rules concerning human rights must be respected by Swedish personnel participating in international military operations when they use force. The aim of such a regulation would therefore be for Swedish military personnel to respect the rules as far as possible, even though it can be debated which rules are formally legally binding. In this respect, however, consideration must be given to the importance of the mandate being fulfilled, and current threats must be taken into account, including protection of the lives and health of personnel (see Chapter 6.7.1). In our view, this does not entail any extension of state responsibility, which would presuppose that formally binding rules are contravened. Special statutes, instructions, etc. are of a generic nature and are already in force before troops are made available. A statutory provision can therefore not be considered to be an interference in the operative command of the force; instead, it should primarily be regarded as a national caveat.</p>
<p>Framework for the application of human rights</p>
<p>We believe that it is possible to be more precise – in the way we have described in Chapter 6.7 – concerning the framework for the permitted use of force than is the case in Finnish and French legislation. At the same time, we do not wish to go into so much detail as to give the impression that this is an exhaustive regulation or that the proposal will make international cooperation more</p>
<p>difficult. Our clarifications thus focus on how human rights are to be respected in general, with reference to a justifiability requirement , and by stressing the importance of non-derogable  rights  never being compromised. The requirement that human rights be respected should therefore be expressed by the legislation stating that the use of force must be justifiable, i.e. necessary and proportional. In addition – as has already been mentioned – the legislation should state which human rights must never be compromised (see Chapter 6.7).</p>
<p>We do not consider that it is appropriate, on top of this, to introduce detailed rules about the use of force and coercive measures. It would be tricky to design general rules to suit all types of international military operations, and detailed rules may make cooperation with other countries in such operations more difficult and may also obstruct international agreements in this area.</p>
<p>Which rights are relevant and what is to count as justifiable use of force in a certain situation must instead be assessed with consideration for the mandate of that particular operation and the security situation in the area of operation. Which rights are concerned also depends on which decisions or measures are actually involved concerning force.</p>
<p>In light of this, we consider that it is appropriate to link the clearly defined obligation to respect human rights in the use of force to situations in which Swedish personnel must, under the mandate, perform  or decide on such acts that in some way have an impact on the rights and freedoms of individuals, and situations in which they actually perform, neglect to perform or decide on  such acts. (See Chapter 6.7.1). By the latter, we mean situations in which a Swedish force performs acts, neglects to perform acts or takes decisions that in some way have a specific and real impact on people’s rights.</p>
<p>One aim must be to respect human rights as far as possible. In this respect, international case-law – and preferably the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights – should to a great extent serve as guidance, despite the fact that it refers to international military operations only in exceptional cases.</p>
