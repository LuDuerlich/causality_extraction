<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The 2012 Research and Innovation Bill (Government Bill 2012/13:30) notes that Swedish registers are unique in many respects. Combining data from them yields great opportunities for research. There are a number of important questions that can be answered by means of various registers and bodies of data.</p>
<p>Against this background, the Government has commissioned the Swedish Research Council to institute a function with the task of improving access to register data and facilitating their use for research purposes.</p>
<p>Statements made in the bill also constitute the background to this committee of inquiry. The committee's terms of reference give prominence to the potential existence of legal impediments to registerbased research. My task has been to analyse these impediments and to submit legislative and other proposals in order to</p>
<p>• increase the extent to which agencies responsible for registers may disclose data for research purposes with regard paid to the protection of the individual's privacy,</p>
<p>• facilitate joint processing of register data for research purposes and</p>
<p>• make possible the  privacy-assured collection of personal data for registers maintained for specific and explicitly stated research purposes and for longitudinal studies confined to the scope of such purposes.</p>
<p>With regard to the last point, this task is further specified in the terms of reference. The terms speak of the need for being able to create “new database infrastructures for definite, but relatively general, research purposes”. I have been asked to make proposals for the building of these infrastructures that can be used by researchers in various research projects and that can be updated and augmented with new data when performing, e.g. longitudinal studies.</p>
<p>I have also had the task of investigating whether the existing secrecy protection regarding data handled within research is adequate to protect the individual's privacy in research.</p>
<p>In the work on this inquiry, I have been assisted by Associate Judge Magdalena Petersson, in the capacity of secretary, and by an expert group with representatives from ministries, government agencies and the research community. During the work, I have had numerous contacts with researchers possessing extensive experience of register-based research and with many of the agencies concerned.</p>
<h2>What is meant by a register?</h2>
<p>In the present context, registers principally refer to structured collections of personal data that have been created at government agencies primarily for purposes other than research. Examples may be given of registers at central government agencies that have been created for administrative or statistical purposes and registers at regions and county councils that have been created for evaluation and quality assurance in health care. Also of great interest in this context are biobanks, which are collections of biological specimens from individuals taken mainly in connection with care and treatment.</p>
<p>However, in the committee's terms of reference, registers also denote certain collections of data that have been primarily created for research purposes. The data in these can be collected from individuals directly or from theagency registers in question. Research registers of this kind are usually created for a specific research project, but there are also instances of registers being constructed to provide a basis for a number of future research projects that have not initially been defined. In this inquiry, these research registers are called research databases. They are an example of the infrastructure mentioned in the terms of reference.</p>
<h2>Why is register data good for research?</h2>
<p>It is a great advantage in many contexts for research to have access to extensive bodies of data. Agency registers, which generally contain data on all Swedish residents, or at least all those relevant in some respect, are invaluable when seeking to describe the state of the population. The inclusion of all residents means that minorities and unusual phenomena can also be captured. An example of the latter might be rare diseases.</p>
<p>As a rule, the alternative to using data from registers is the collection of data directly from a sample of individuals. Such sample surveys are sometimes necessary because registers do not contain all the data in which researchers are interested. However, sample surveys may entail certain problems. Often, the research subjects selected are not especially representative. Even when the samples are representative, they often have to be limited, if nothing else, for economic reasons, and a certain loss also has to be accommodated, i.e. that some of those approached do not wish to participate for various reasons. Representativeness, sample size and loss all increase the uncertainty of research results. There are numerous examples of conclusions that have been drawn on the basis of smaller sample studies and proven to be incorrect when tested on the entire population in question.</p>
<p>Researchers are also dependent on extensive bodies of data in contexts other than the study of unusual phenomena. When they want to study how a particular intervention affects different individuals, a sample study might be adequate, but if they want to identify the various causes of a complex social phenomenon, a more extensive body of data is required. In longitudinal studies, which follow individuals or study one and the same phenomenon over time, registers are a particular asset. If these involve repeated contact with the individuals, there is a great risk that the sample will dwindle fairly quickly, e.g. because they get tired of participating.</p>
<p>It is often advantageous to be able to combine data that researchers themselves have collected during sample studies with data from registers. If certain data can be retrieved from registers, researchers will be able to limit the number of questions that they need to ask their interviewees. To obtain historical data on an individual participating in a sample, registers can frequently contain more reliable information than the individual is able to provide from memory. To follow up on the progress of individuals who have participated in a sample study, register data can be used to avoid inconveniencing these individuals with repeated questions. Data on all the different individuals involved in various sample surveys can only be found in comprehensive registers.</p>
<p>Data on individuals, also sensitive data, is often necessary for research. This is especially true of medical research, whose aim is to understand the origin and development of diseases and to find cures. At the same time, all processing of personal data entails certain risks to the personal privacy of individuals. The greatest risk is of someone being exposed to the contempt of others if his or her personal circumstances become known. This is the background to the extensive legislation that is designed to protect the personal privacy of individuals and to manage the weighing of various interests that may be required.</p>
<h2>Legal prerequisites for register-based research</h2>
<p>Several international organisations, the United Nations (UN), the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European Union (EU), have produced guidelines on how personal data must be handled. Of particular importance to Sweden is the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated in Swedish law since 1995, and the EU Data Protection Directive, which in Sweden has been implemented through the Personal Data Act (PUL). The EU is currently discussing a new Data Protection Regulation, which, if adopted, will become directly applicable in all Member States and thus replace PUL in Sweden. It is unclear when this might be adopted, and this inquiry therefore proceeds on the basis of existing law.</p>
<p>The Instrument of Government states that everyone shall be protected against significant invasions of their personal privacy, if these occur without their consent and involve the surveillance or systematic monitoring of the individual’s personal circumstances. This provision may be restricted by law, but only to satisfy a purpose that is acceptable in a democratic society.</p>
<p>PUL governs the processing of personal data. Such data may be collected only if this is legal and only for specific, explicitly stated and justified purposes. It may not be processed for any purpose that is incompatible with that for which the information is collected. Government agencies usually have legal support for the processing of personal data in special register statutes, which, i.a. specify the purpose and the data that may be processed. Under PUL, the processing of data for historical, statistical or scientific purposes shall not be regarded as incompatible with the purposes for which the information was collected. The aforementioned means that it is possible, e.g. in research, to make secondary use of data that has been collected for other purposes.</p>
<p>The processing of data for purposes other than the original requires either the consent of the persons concerned to this processing or its necessity for, e.g. being able to perform a task of public interest. Research might be an example of such a task.</p>
<p>PUL classifies certain personal data as sensitive and prohibited to process. This applies to data disclosing race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of a trade union or pertaining to health and sex life. However, following ethics approval, such data, as well as data pertaining to certain kinds of legal offence and biological specimens, may be processed in research. Ethics approval is granted pursuant to the Act concerning the Ethical Review of Research Involving Humans (Ethical Review Act) by an ethical review board consisting of government-appointed representatives of the research community and the general public. The ethical review board shall also assess whether consent should be obtained or whether the data can be processed without consent. Where utilisation of an agency register is extensive, the praxis is not to require consent, as this would presuppose a disproportionate investment of resources.</p>
<p>The collection and other processing of personal data by government agencies is often justified by their need of that data in being able to fulfil their administrative tasks. This may relate to keeping track of the country's residents, to producing electoral registers for general elections, to assessing how much tax citizens should pay and the grants they are entitled to, and so on. In many cases, the data is used for decisions concerning individuals. In cases where agencies have been instructed to process personal data, the benefits from this processing have been assessed to outweigh the risks to personal privacy.</p>
<p>Another aim involved in the processing of personal data by government agencies is the production of statistics or the evaluation and quality assurance of activities. The production of statistics is often based on data from administrative registers, but in some cases, data is collected specifically for statistical purposes.</p>
<p>Official documents held by Swedish agencies are in principle public, but the right of the general public to view such documents may be restricted if called for out of consideration to, e.g. the individual's personal and financial circumstances. In such cases, there are often varying degrees of secrecy. The strongest secrecy applies to data that has been collected for statistical purposes. Here, secrecy is absolute, which means that the data is in principle not to be disclosed.</p>
<p>However, also for this data, there exist certain provisions that override secrecy. For example, the data may be disclosed for research purposes if this can be achieved without risk of damage or harm to the person – or relatives of the person – whom the data concerns. If secret data is disclosed to another agency, such as a university or a university college, for research purposes, secrecy automatically attaches to that data. Where the disclosure is made to another party, it is usually with special reservations designed to provide equivalent protection.</p>
<p>It is the duty of the agency holding the register to consider whether personal data may be disclosed. Where the disclosure is made for research, it is common for the data to be disclosed in anonymised form. This means that researchers do not know which individuals the data concerns. Anonymised data can be coded or de-identified. Coded data means that the researcher receives data with a designation, e.g. a serial number, that does not carry identity information, while the agency retains a code key that links serial numbers to personal identity numbers and that makes it possible to supplement the data later on. The existence of such a possibility is important, for example in the case of longitudinal studies. When data is de-identified, this possibility does not exist.</p>
<p>Even if data is anonymised, there may be a risk of ‘reverse identification’, i.e. identifying an individual by compiling a series of data about that person. This is prohibited and, as far as is known, has never occurred in research. It is nevertheless a potential risk that might even increase with advances in computer technology. For this reason, it is important to have a clear set of regulations and security arrangements regarding personal data in research environments as well.</p>
<p>In some cases, particularly in medical research, there are instances of the disclosure of identifiable data. Often, the purpose is to allow researchers to contact the individuals in question or to check register data with data from patient records.</p>
<h2>Privacy and register-based research</h2>
<p>Responsibility for the processing of personal data in research lies with the responsible research bodies; as a rule, universities and university colleges. This responsibility ultimately belongs to their boards. There have been no instances of data leaking from research environments. An important explanation for this is the rules for secrecy and secure management that are in force. But like researchers, universities and university colleges also have other strong incentives for ensuring compliance; namely, to allow them to obtain data and conduct research. In addition, researchers are not primarily interested in individuals, but in population patterns.</p>
<p>It was in 2011 that the current provision of the Instrument of Government was introduced regarding the individual's protection against significant invasions of personal privacy, where these occur without consent and involve the surveillance or systematic monitoring of the individual’s personal circumstances. The question has been raised of whether the secondary use of personal data in agency registers without consent could be in conflict with this constitutional provision. The effect of collecting data for research could, regardless of intention, be considered to at least constitute the mapping of personal circumstances.</p>
<p>The Government Bill on a reformed Constitution noted that any assessment of significant invasions must attend, inter alia, to the purpose of processing data. The aim of research is not to map individual persons, but to identify patterns in a population. The processing of data from agency registers has its legal basis in the special register statutes that exist for agency registers and in PUL's provision stating that processing for scientific purposes is not incompatible with the original purposes for the processing of that data.</p>
<p>The legislator's intention is not likely to have been to prevent this processing of personal data in research. Also in the bill concerning the processing of personal data at the Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy (IFAU), the Government noted that the ‘IFAU database’ is not in conflict with the Constitution. However, it was the Government's assessment that considering this case involves the retention of a lot of data for a long period, it is plausible that there is a legal basis for the database.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that register-based research, research registers and research databases do not entail significant invasions of the personal privacy of individuals, but that it is important that there be clear legal support for this activity.</p>
<p>According to the proportionality principle, central government should not impose restrictions or obligations beyond what is necessary to achieve the goal of a measure. The goal of register-based research is to gain knowledge about how society works and the measure being considered in this context; that is, the use of e.g., register data that has been collected for other purposes.</p>
<p>There are great advantages to being able to use register data in research. There is knowledge to be gained through such research that is difficult to gain with other methods. The risk of leaks and attendant harm to respondents is small. This is particularly true when data is disclosed in anonymised form, but even otherwise. When the benefits are weighed against the risks, register-based research appears to be a largely proportionate measure.</p>
<h2>Experience from the Nordic countries</h2>
<p>The prerequisites for register-based research are very similar in the other Nordic countries. They too have to proceed from applicable international regulations. Their counterparts to Sweden's Personal Data Act are, like that law, based on the EU Data Protection Directive and thus very similar. In some respects, they have chosen different solutions to Sweden in order to facilitate register-based research. Examples that may be given are that Denmark has created a well-developed system for remote access to health data and that Norway has established an independent organisation for depositing and archiving research material. Such examples may serve as sources of inspiration when the systems are being developed in Sweden.</p>
<h2>Background, present situation and challenges</h2>
<p>There are four important sources of data for register-based research: agency registers, health care quality registers, biobanks and research registers of various kinds.</p>
<p>Agency registers have been created primarily for purposes other than research. It is not possible for quality and documentation to always meet the needs of research. Data often needs to be processed before they can be used in research. There is potential for development in this respect.</p>
<p>Quality registers in health care are constructed on the basis of interventions, disease episodes or chronic illnesses. They are of varying quality, but a major investment is now being undertaken by the Government and health care providers to increase quality and accessibility. At present, there are around 80 certified quality registers. Certification means that they meet certain quality standards. The current development programme covers the period 2013-16. When this expires, an assessment will have to be made about how to proceed.</p>
<p>Biobanks contain biological specimens. There are about 600 biobanks in Sweden, of which half are with health care providers and around 50 at universities that conduct medical research. One challenge is to increase the traceability of biobank specimens to make them more available to research.</p>
<p>There are many different kinds of research register. Most have been created for specific research projects. The Swedish National Data Service (SND) is a national resource for the coordination of existing and new research registers in the social sciences, humanities and medicine. SND is currently a joint project between the Swedish Research Council and the University of Gothenburg. One of its aims is for data collected for specific research to be made available and to be reusable in new research projects. However, the Data Inspection Board has determined that SND does not have the right to maintain registers containing personal data, by which is meant data that can in some way be identified (e.g. where a code key is still held). This represents a serious limitation of SND's activities.</p>
<p>The use of sensitive personal data or biological specimens in research requires ethical permission. When data is to be provided in anonymised form, the ethical review boards assess the risks as minor and grant permission as a matter of routine. This assessment is well in line with that made in some appeal matters considered by a court or by the Government. For the disclosure of such data in Denmark and Finland, these countries have chosen to work with general ethical permissions for certain authorised organisations. In Sweden, it should be possible to test a simplified process. Many of those concerned also perceive the forms that researchers have to fill in for ethics applications to be more detailed than necessary. There may be reason to review these forms, e.g. under the Register Data Council recently created by the Swedish Research Council.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, Statistics Sweden (SCB) has developed a system for remote access to data. It is called MONA, Microdata Online Access. The system is used to make data available, not only from SCB but from most central government agencies responsible for official statistics. Researchers use a terminal in their work environment to connect to MONA and can process data without this leaving SCB. Processed data, in the form of, e.g. tables, may then be sent to researchers by e-mail. An evaluation of the MONA system has recently been initiated by the Swedish Research Council. As yet, there is no corresponding system for health data from the National Board of Health and Welfare, but the possibility of creating one will be examined during the evaluation of MONA.</p>
<p>There appear to be no legal impediments to providing data for research. The problems that may exist are instead found at the administrative level. For SCB, and also other agencies, research is not a priority task. In December 2012, the Statistics Inquiry proposed that SCB be instructed to make it a priority to supply data for research. The Ministry of Finance has announced that it intends to propose such an amendment, but no decision has yet been made. It is urgent that this be done as soon as possible. There may also be reason to make corresponding adjustments to the instructions of other agencies.</p>
<p>A register service unit has now been created at the National Board of Health and Welfare. At present, SCB is conducting an internal investigation with a somewhat similar aim in view. It is urgent that SCB also should create a central research service unit.</p>
<p>Much of today's research takes place in international collaboration. The disclosure of data across national borders is a challenge. These are complicated issues that have not been possible to analyse within the scope of this inquiry. However, discussions between the central agencies for statistics in the Nordic countries have recently been initiated by the Nordic Council and its research council, NordForsk, and are in progress.</p>
<p>Joint processing of data from various registers is often necessary in research. Even when multiple agencies are involved, this joint processing appears to be functioning relatively well. Where statistical agencies disclose sensitive data among themselves to facilitate joint processing, the legal basis for doing so has been questioned on occasion. It has also been questioned if there is a legal basis with regard paid to secrecy to disclose secret data to another agency to faciliate joint processing of data on behalf of a third agency. My conclusion is that this processing can be carried out according to existing law.</p>
<p>Joint processing could be facilitated through the development of a ‘federated system’. This involves the retrieval of data from various sources to a trusted location, an institution that all the data owners trust and to which they can provide access to data without concern for its being spread. Connected to a trusted location of this kind, researchers work in the same way as in the current MONA system. Data is retrieved electronically to this trusted location directly from the sources without any transfer of data among the agencies taking place. In its Research and Innovation Bill, the Government was positive towards such a solution and stated that this would be investigated separately. However, no such initiative has been taken. A federated solution requires extensive technological development. Achieving a solution of this kind is likely to require a government initiative, possibly in coopeartion with the University of Umeå which has recently initiated av development program in this field.</p>
<p>SND is an important infrastructure for Swedish research. It is important that SND should become a permanent activity and be given reasonable conditions to fulfil its tasks. Today, researchers deposit copies of their data with SND. It would be advantageous if SND could become an archiving agency where original data could be deposited. As an archiving agency, SND would also become the controller of personal data for the information held, which would tackle the Data Inspection Board's objections to the current order. Norway and Denmark have organised corresponding activities in another way: in Norway as an independent organisation under the Ministry of Education and Research, and in Denmark as part of the State Archives. The Norwegian solution appears to be the most attractive with respect to the independence and development of the activity. The Government should appoint a committee of inquiry to draft a long-term solution for SND.</p>
<h2>Assessments and proposals</h2>
<p>Ethical Review</p>
<p>To simplify the management of matters where the research aim is to use only anonymised data from agency registers, it is proposed that the boards be able to delegate such matters to the chair.</p>
<p>It is further proposed that researchers should have the right to receive an opinion from the ethical review board on research projects that do not fall under the Ethical Review Act. The opportunity to request such an opinion exists today, but the board itself determines whether or not it wants to give an opinion.</p>
<p>It is also proposed that disclosure from research databases should always require ethical permission, regardless of whether this involves sensitive personal data.</p>
<p>Code key procedure</p>
<p>When data is disclosed in anonymised form, the disclosing agency may retain a code key that makes it possible to supplement the data later on. This possibility has primarily arisen to enable longitudinal studies, where the same individuals or phenomena are followed for a long period, and similar studies.</p>
<p>In longitudinal studies, the disclosing agency and researchers agree on how long the code key is to be retained. Normally, it is retained for three years with the possibility of extension. The disclosing agency may, however, be reluctant to retain the code key if it feels that the research questions have changed.</p>
<p>A code key might also be created and retained for other research projects, but normally for a considerably shorter period, usually three months. The aim is to be able to supplement disclosed data if something has gone wrong or if the researcher has overlooked something in the application.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for the standard retention of code keys for a longer period. Linking retention to the posing of the same research questions does not seem to be reasonable. It is natural for the research questions in a longitudinal study to be successively modified. During an ongoing project, a researcher might find that data needs supplementing even if this was not anticipated when the data was requested. Besides this, it is important in all research to provide opportunities for replication or for re-analysis of the same, or supplemented, data.</p>
<p>In light of this, it is proposed that code keys be retained at the disclosing agency for twenty years from the date of disclosure with the possibility of prolongation.</p>
<p>A new secrecy provision</p>
<p>To maintain public confidence in research, it is important for the regulatory framework to provide for the protection of the individual's privacy. Today, there are several different provisions that entail the secrecy of personal data processed in research. However, the regulations are not easy to survey, which can create uncertainty.</p>
<p>The Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act contains a specific provision on statistical secrecy. Data collected for statistical purposes is protected by absolute secrecy. The preparatory works to the legislation invoke three reasons for statistical secrecy. The interest of public access to such data is considered to carry little weight. A compilation of data which is, in itself, innocuous can sometimes be sensitive with respect to privacy. And a respondent must feel confident that his or her information is not revealed. These reasons also speak in favour of a corresponding secrecy protection for data collected for research.</p>
<p>Against this background, a corresponding research secrecy is proposed. This entails that personal data collected for research is always protected by absolute secrecy. As is the case for data collected for statistical purposes, there should be a provision that overrides secrecy for this data collected for research purposes to the effect that it can be used for other research if certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>This secrecy also carries a duty of confidentiality for those handling the data.</p>
<p>It is not only important for personal data to be protected by secrecy, but also for it to be processed in accordance with existing rules and in technically secure systems. All major universities and most university colleges have personal data representatives, whose task is to ensure that the controller of personal data, i.e. the higher education institution, complies with existing rules. In many cases, personal data representatives do not appear to have the resources and status necessary to perform this task satisfactorily. It is the boards of the higher education institutions that have the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that this activity functions satisfactorily. I propose that the Government in its annual instructions to universities and university colleges should request them to give even more inportance to the protection and security of processing personal data, e.g. by strengthening the position of the personal data representatives, and report taken measures back to the Government.</p>
<p>Research databases</p>
<p>The committee's terms of reference give prominence to the difficulties under current law in creating research databases for definite, but relatively general, research purposes. The Data Inspection Board has taken a hesitant view towards research databases for general purposes. It has also questioned the legality of the consent given by individuals when supplying data to such databases. The Ethical Review Act only allows the granting of ethics approval to specific research projects. Disclosing agencies find themselves prevented from disclosing data to databases where the specific research questions are unknown. In other words, there are currently no legal prerequisites for such research databases.</p>
<p>The Government and the Riksdag have in some cases passed special enactments to make research databases possible. One example is the act governing the ‘IFAU database’ and another the act governing certain registers for research on the significance of heredity and environment for human health (the “LifeGene Act”). Statistics Sweden also has a couple of such databases that are partly used for research.</p>
<p>According to an inventory commissioned by the Swedish Research Council, there are about an additional fifty research databases in Sweden. These may, for example, have been created a long time ago, before the current regulations were in place, have been built around a specific research project or approved through a generous interpretation of the Ethical Review Act.</p>
<p>The introduction of a special act on research databases is proposed. The idea is that this will state some general rules for research databases, but that each database will be supplemented with a government ordinance to regulate what further details should apply, e.g. purpose and content. The purpose of the research databases is to create a basis for research and to disclose data for research projects. Disclosure will always require ethics approval.</p>
<p>A ‘research database’ is an infrastructure that will be capable of use in future research projects by several different researchers from different higher education institutions and within different disciplines. The projects are not known when the database is created.</p>
<p>It should be possible to create research databases at state universities, university colleges and other public agencies commissioned to do reserach. The Swedish Research Council should be commissioned to propose to the Government which research databases should</p>
<p>exist. The Swedish Research Council should also enter agreements with the host universities regarding funding, organisation and accessibility. Funding should be secured for eight years ahead. Research databases are to be evaluated every eight years, preferably by an international evaluation group.</p>
<p>The controller of personal data, i.e. the higher education institution or other agency concernded, shall restrict its employees' electronic access to personal data to what each one needs to carry out tasks relating to the database. Administration of the research database shall be performed by a special and distinct unit.</p>
<p>The data collected in the research database will be retrievable from various sources. Certain data can be collected directly from individuals; other data can be retrieved from existing registers. Ensuring that the agencies are able to submit data to the research databases requires provisions on the obligation to provide information with respect to these. The special ordinances that will be in force for each research database should govern which agencies will be obligated to disclose data and which data this obligation will cover.</p>
<p>Individuals will be able to submit data and give informed consent to its being processed for the purposes specified in the ordinance for the research database.</p>
<p>The data in a research database will be protected by absolute secrecy, but with certain exceptions. Individuals will have the right to obtain, upon request, an extract of identifiable data registered in the database.</p>
<p>National biobank register</p>
<p>The Swedish biobank register is today a regional system. The register is held at six regional biobank centres operated by regions and county councils. The existence of a national biobank register would facilitate the traceability of biobank specimens in a variety of contexts. A register of this kind was proposed a few years ago by the state Biobank Inquiry. Its proposals have, for various reasons, not resulted in legislation.</p>
<p>In light of this, the present inquiry proposes that the Swedish biobank register be remodelled into a national system for the registration of biobank specimens, the National biobank register. It is proposed that the National Board of Health and Welfare become the register's controller of personal data.</p>
<p>Processing of data in the register will be allowed in order to facilitate traceability in the care and treatment of the registered person, in research, quality assurement and the production of statistics and in the destruction or de-identification of tissue specimens when the registered person has withdrawn his or her consent.</p>
<p>The data that may be registered relates primarily to the donor's identity, the donor's position on the handling of the specimens (consent), the nature of the tissue specimens, the biobank in which they are held and data on diagnosis and analysis results.</p>
<p>Absolute secrecy applies to the data contained in the register, but with provisions that override secrecy for, e.g. research. It will also be possible to disclose data in matters concerning the individual's care and treatment.</p>
<p>Registration is based on consent, i.e., when the biological specimen is stored in a bank, the individual takes a position on how it may be processed. However, the specimens already held in biobanks may be registered without specific consent. It should be emphasised that the persons concerned have consented to the specimens being stored in the biobank and how they may be used. The absence of consent applies only to the actual registration in the national register. The opportunity to withdraw consent always exists and is facilitated by the increased traceability that comes with the central register.</p>
