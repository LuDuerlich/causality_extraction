<p>Our task</p>
<p>In its report entitled  Improved Contact via the Network (SOU 2008:13), the Grid Connection Inquiry proposed a form of network concession – a network concession for private power lines. However, the Inquiry made no comprehensive proposals in this context, but instead suggested that it be further analysed by the Energy Network Inquiry. We were subsequently commissioned, through a supplementary directive, to establish and provide an account of the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal for a change in the permit pursuant to the Electricity Act that concerns  so-called  private power lines, and to submit a proposal for the detailed design of such a permit.</p>
<p>In this report, we present our considerations and proposals in relation to this matter.</p>
<p>Network concession for private power lines</p>
<p>The proposal of the Grid Connection Inquiry means that it will be possible for an electricity generation company to build and operate a connection line from an electricity generation plant with the support of a form of network concession – a network concession for private power lines. The purpose of the proposal is to make it easier for an electricity producer to itself own and use the connection line without at the same time abolishing the demand for concession obligations.</p>
<p>It shall be possible to apply for a network concession for private power lines from the network authority. It shall also be possible for electricity network operations to be run by the same legal entity as the one that runs the electricity generation operation. As a result, the present principle of making a distinction between network operations</p>
<p>and activities that are run on the basis of competition is removed. Furthermore, relief shall be granted in comparison with a normal line concession as regards reporting to the network authority. The fact that the line is private also means that there is no obligation to connect. However, if the connection of new electricity plants becomes of interest in the area, the concession shall be reviewed.</p>
<p>As far as the obligation for distinction is concerned, the Energy Network Inquiry notes that the holder of a network concession for private power lines should not be subjected to the connection obligation, which means that the only plant connected to the connection line would be the electricity generation company’s own plant. There would thus be no risk of cross-subsidisation if a production company were to own and run a connection line with the support of a network concession for private power lines. The argument against making an exception from the basic requirement for a distinction to be made between electricity networks and electricity generation activities would appear in light of this to be weaker.</p>
<p>As regards the obligation to connect, we would like to point out that as a general rule, a concession holder is obliged to grant a connecting plant owner access to the electricity network unless there are specific reasons to the contrary. This connection obligation means that the entire electricity network shall be available for the transmission of electricity. It in turn requires that all sellers and buyers shall have access to the lines that are needed for the supplies.</p>
<p>The proposal of the Grid Connection Inquiry means that a network connection for private power lines shall be covered by a latent connection obligation. If new electricity plants in the area need to be connected to the line, the concession shall be reviewed. We conclude that the savings in cost and time that could be initially made by applying the regulations governing exemption from the obligation to connect could in time be neutralised or even reversed by the demands for a new concession application and concession review in conjunction with a new connection.</p>
<p>Legal practice from the EC courts has also emphasized the importance of connection obligation and third-party access as fundamental principles that can only be relinquished in certain specified situations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is doubtful in the opinion of the Inquiry whether the introduction of the proposed special type of concession would be of any significant financial importance for the electricity producers. It is believed that the specified objective of reducing the</p>
<p>costs for the connection line and the time from the application to operational start-up could above all be achieved by means of other measures. For example, it would be quite possible for the present electricity generation company to form a separate network company to be responsible for the transmission of electricity from the production plant to another network.</p>
<p>Consequently, we are of the opinion that the proposed departures from the demands for legal distinction and connection obligation are not likely to result in cost reductions and time savings that are significant enough to motivate departures from the basic principles. Quite the reverse, in fact – the proposal could lead to an increase in socio-economic expenditure.</p>
<p>It must be further emphasized that if the economic importance of relief from connection obligation were significant – i.e. if the obligation to connect other players involved substantially increased costs – the consequences of the voluntary nature of the relief from connection obligation must also entail a substantial financial risk for the company.</p>
<p>The Energy Network Inquiry thus finds that there are no important reasons to warrant introducing the network concession for private power lines proposed by the Grid Connection Inquiry.</p>
<p>Grid concession for production network</p>
<p>The Energy Network Inquiry has received a proposal from the wind power company Arise Elnät AB (Arise) concerning certain changes in regulations governing grid concessions with the aim of making it easier for electricity producers to feed electricity into the grid.</p>
<p>Arise proposes that a special type of concession, a network concession for production networks, be established for networks whose purpose it is to supply incoming electricity from electricity generation plants. A network concession for a production network shall be able to consist of both one or several areas and one or more lines. Furthermore, a player with a network concession for a production network shall be required, based on reasonable terms, to connect electrical plants for electricity generation, i.e. incoming supply customers.</p>
<p>To sum up, the Inquiry feels there is reason to further investigate the possibilities of introducing a new type of network con-</p>
<p>cession for a limited, clearly defined area with electricity generation plants. We feel, however, that the proposal from Arise on network concessions for production networks should in certain respects be revised and reworked.</p>
<p>The Inquiry thus feels that the regulations for a new network concession, which is introduced in order to facilitate the establishment of renewable electricity production, should as far as possible follow regulations that are already currently applied for one of the existing network concessions. The uniformity regarding regulation within an area that is covered by the network concession should also apply to the obligation to connect customers.</p>
<p>Exemption from concession obligation</p>
<p>The Government has recently decided to introduce a new exemption from the concession obligation based on a proposal from the Grid Connection Inquiry. According to new ordinance regulations, an internal network that links together two or more electricity generation plants, and which constitutes a single functional entity, may be constructed and used without a network concession.</p>
<p>The new regulation means that the internal power line network, not the area, shall be exempted from the concession obligation. It must therefore be regarded as an exception from the general rule that it is only one clearly demarcated area that should be exempted from the concession obligation.</p>
<p>To summarise, it is the opinion of the Inquiry that an exemption from concession requirements could lead to unnecessary and complicated demarcation problems between area concession holders and owners of the lines that are not subject to concession obligations. Uncertainties concerning, for example, which of the lines are subject to concession obligations could arise, and require timeconsuming review. Furthermore, the Inquiry wishes again to stress the importance of the connection obligation and third-party access for a well-functioning electricity market. Any departures from this obligation must be limited to minor, clearly demarcated areas.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Inquiry thus feels that there is no distinct justification for the proposed, and now adopted, exemption from concession obligation and departure from the connection obligation.</p>
<p>Network concession for production area and special requirements governing the supply of renewable electricity production</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>In the opinion of the Inquiry, there are a number of opportunities for introducing changes in the Electricity Act that entail alleviations and lower costs for the producers of renewable electricity and for customers in sparsely populated areas without at the same time having to make excessively extensive changes in the regulations for network concessions. We therefore submit a proposal for revised concession rules for power lines that are intended to carry the incoming supply of electricity from plants for renewable electricity generation, and propose relaxations in the requirements and lower demands in general to apply in connection with the incoming supply of electricity from renewable electricity production. Together, these proposals in our opinion constitute a clearer and less cost-demanding set of regulations than the other proposals with the same purpose as that considered by the Inquiry.</p>
<p>Network concession for production area</p>
<p>We propose that a new type of network concession, a network concession for production areas, be introduced for power lines within an electricity generation plant for renewable electricity. A concession of this type shall be intended for a network that connects two or more electricity generation plants and which constitute one functional entity. The area may also include a short connection to the overlying network.</p>
<p>Applications for network connections for production areas shall be submitted to the network authority. The production area shall be clearly demarcated. The networks in the production area shall be open to those producers who wish to make connections within the area.</p>
<p>The holder of the network concession within a certain production area shall be obliged on reasonable terms to connect electrical plants for electricity generation within the area. It shall also be possible, in exceptional cases, to connect an outgoing supply customer when it suits all parties for the customer to be connected to the network</p>
<p>in the production area instead of to the network that is run with the support of the network concession for the area.</p>
<p>In the case of network concessions for production areas, it is proposed that the power line network in the area shall be completed within a period of five years after the concession decision came into force.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the adoption of this proposal will create better preconditions for a clearer regulation of the connection obligation and a distinction between electricity network and power production companies. The proposal also guarantees that an independent network operator provides necessary production networks. The fact that the electricity network within a certain production area shall be subject to a concession obligation means that there will be a uniform regulation of the area and that the fundamental principle of connection obligation applies for the area concerned.</p>
<p>Exemptions from the requirements for network company reporting</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Government or, following the Government’s authorisation, the network authority should be able to prescribe exemptions from certain obligations to which a concession holder is subject according to the Electricity Act. Exemptions may be prescribed in the case of a concession holder for a power line or production area whose power lines only, or to a major extent, supply electricity from plants that generate renewable electricity. The exemption applies to the demand for an annual report on the network operations, the obligation to draw up a risk and vulnerability analysis regarding supply reliability in the electricity network, an action plan for how supply reliability in the network is to be improved, the obligation to provide information to electricity consumers on supply reliability etc., the obligation to report power failures to the network authority and the demand to prepare a monitoring schedule.</p>
<p>The network authority shall be able to provide binding advance notice as to whether a concession holder is covered by regulations on exemption. Furthermore, the authority, if there is special reason, shall give notification of an exemption from the obligation to rectify a failure in power supply within twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>The Grid Connection Inquiry proposed that it should be possible for an exemption to be made from certain requirements in the Electricity Act. Our proposal for exemption largely concerns the same requirements. We propose in certain cases, however, changes in relation to the Grid Connection Inquiry’s proposal. In addition, our proposal means that the demand for an application procedure has been replaced by a regulation to the effect that the exemption applies automatically provided the provisions of the regulations are met.</p>
<p>Metering, etc.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that it should be possible to a certain extent for integrated metering of electricity to be conducted from several plants for electricity generation. A precondition for integrated metering should be that the owner or owners of the production plants request integrated metering and that such metering is rational and suitable in the individual case in question. For example, it should be possible for integrated metering of the incoming supply from several production plants to the power line network in a wind power farm to be regarded as being both rational and suitable.</p>
<p>The integrated metering shall be carried out at one metering point and concern the flow at the metering point.</p>
<p>Compared with individual metering at each individual plant, certain transmission losses will occur in connection with transmission to the integrated metering point. The cost reduction that accompanies the integrated metering should, however, clearly outweigh the costs of the losses.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the proposed regulations, the Inquiry proposes a supplement to the definition of incoming supply point in the metering ordinance. Furthermore, we consider that no changes need to be made to the Electricity Certification Act as a consequence of the proposal for integrated metering. Neither is it necessary to make any form of amendment in the conditions governing network tariffs for small production plants in the Electricity Act as a consequence of the proposal.</p>
<p>The Grid Connection Inquiry proposed, among other things, a maximum transmission charge for production plants that are approved for an electricity certificate, as well as a restriction in the charges for overlying networks for a connection line of this type.</p>
<p>We suggest that the proposal should be changed so that consideration is given to our proposal for network concessions for production areas. Furthermore, we would like to point out that uncertainties still remain concerning the cost effects of the support proposals, and thus maintain that the potential impact should be further analysed before implementation is decided.</p>
<p>Simplified permit review</p>
<p>The Energy Network Inquiry is required, within the framework of its commission, to analyse the present division between area concessions and line concessions. The Inquiry hereby registers its intention, in the coming final report, to present its considerations concerning the demand to conduct environmental impact assessments prior to the development of the electricity network and concerning the possibility to decrease the demands and direct them towards the really serious cases.</p>
