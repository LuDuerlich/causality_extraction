<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Our assignment</h2>
<p>The Swedish Act (2010:1390) on the appointment of permanent judges (the Appointment Act) came into force on 1 January 2011. The reform introduced a public application procedure for all cases of permanent judges’ appointments. The same reform established the Judges Proposals Board. This Board prepares all cases concerning appointment of permanent judges ahead of government decisions, and also has other functions relating to matters including recruitment of permanent judges.</p>
<p>The commission of inquiry’s overall task has been to review the recruitment of permanent judges, to ensure that all courts throughout Sweden can, in the future as well, recruit judges from among those who are the most highly skilled and suited to the profession. The assignment has included surveying the recruitment situation and considering whether the special judges’ training or the system of co-opting external lawyers to courts of appeal and administrative courts of appeal should be changed. The assignment has also included surveying and analysing whether lawyers’ propensity to apply for judges’ positions is influenced by the openness of the application procedure and, if this is deemed to be so, deciding whether confidentiality should be introduced. Another task in the assignment has been to consider other measures to promote judges’ recruitment and improve the recruitment process. In part, this has involved considering how to clarify and develop the roles and functions of the courts, the Judges Proposals Board and the Swedish National Courts Administration in recruitment work.</p>
<h2>Recruitment situation</h2>
<p>Few applicants for permanent judges’ appointments</p>
<p>Over the past five years there have been only three or fewer applicants for many of the judges’ positions announced. In 2016, for more than 51 percent of the judges’ positions announced, there have been only three or fewer applicants. Appointment cases with few applicants occur in all courts, of all categories, nationwide.</p>
<p>A small number of applicants does not necessarily imply that the requirements of proficiency and suitability for the role must be reduced in a particular case. Where there are few applicants, the person(s) applying for the appointment may belong to the most skilled and suitable lawyers. Nevertheless, if there are only a few applicants there is a risk of the proficiency and suitability requirements having to be reduced. Conversely, a larger number of applicants and increased competition for appointments typically afford better prospects of the positions being filled with the most skilled and suitable candidates.</p>
<p>Applicants’ chances of getting permanent positions affected by their professional background</p>
<p>We have also analysed how applicants’ different occupational backgrounds have affected their opportunities of obtaining permanent judges’ appointments. We note that an applicant who has completed special training as a judge and subsequently gained further qualifications through other advanced legal work is roughly three times as likely to be appointed as a permanent judge as one who has become qualified solely by means other than serving as a judge. In our analysis, we have also seen that a lawyer who has mainly worked outside the courts, but has been a co-opted member of a superior court for some time, has considerably greater chances of getting a permanent judge’s appointment than one who has not been co-opted to a superior court.</p>
<p>Public nature of application process no explanation of why few lawyers seek permanent judges’ appointments</p>
<p>To analyse whether the propensity to apply for employment as a judge is affected by the application process being public, we conducted a questionnaire survey of 7,135 lawyers. The results provide limited support for the view that confidentiality might encourage a higher number of qualified applicants for permanent judges’ appointments.</p>
<p>Only 8 percent of the questionnaire respondents who had not applied for such appointments cited the public nature of the process as a reason for not applying. In addition, only 15 percent of the same group replied that they would be more inclined to apply for a judge’s appointment if confidentiality were introduced to some extent.</p>
<p>Courts part of the lawyers’ labour market</p>
<p>The courts’ needs and prospects of recruiting permanent judges must be seen in light of the developing labour market for lawyers. This market is growing steadily, which means that employers’ competition for lawyers is becoming stiffer. At the same time, labour mobility has increased. This means that lawyers, to a greater extent than before, are moving among various jobs with different employers in the public and private sectors. The labour-market situation for lawyers is such that state employers need, in our assessment, to make great efforts to get qualified applicants for positions and to retain qualified staff.</p>
<p>Number of qualified applicants for permanent judges’ posts must rise</p>
<p>Our assessment is that a higher number of skilled lawyers with varying backgrounds must apply for permanent judges’ appointments. Only then can there be any assurance that the most skilled lawyers who are best suited to the profession can be appointed. A stable longterm system for recruiting permanent judges must offer several different options for those who wish to apply for permanent positions as judges. The special judges’ training must be extended to enough young lawyers. At the same time, there must be an improvement in the scope for qualified, experienced lawyers with professional backgrounds other than working in courts to apply for and obtain appointments as permanent judges. This is a matter of how their credentials are assessed, but also of the need for qualified, experienced lawyers to be offered more opportunities to equip themselves for, apply for and obtain employment as permanent judges.</p>
<p>The roles of the Judges Proposals Board, the courts and the Swedish National Courts Administration in the recruitment of permanent judges differ. Good coordination is required among these agencies, to build up young lawyers’ interest in equipping themselves to become judges, and to attract proficient, experienced lawyers to the profession of judge. The fact that the Board is responsible for working actively and on a long-term basis to recruit permanent judges is made clear in the Appointment Act. Individual courts’ responsibility for recruiting permanent judges should be highlighted, and the variety of existing options for skilled lawyers wishing to become permanent judges should be made clearer to court managers. Other requirements are a good, stimulating work environment and scope for nonpermanent judges’ training. The Courts Administration is responsible for paving the way, in various ways, for implementation of public employment policy in the courts, so that sufficient numbers of proficient, suitable lawyers apply for permanent judges’ appointments.</p>
<p>What is needed is to give the courts opportunities to develop their activities in areas that make the courts attractive workplaces, not least through technological development.</p>
<p>What matters is to shape a stable and long-term system for recruiting permanent judges.</p>
<h2>General starting points for reform</h2>
<p>Ensuring that courts’ activities live up to high standards of legal security and quality is fundamental to the rule of law. Recruitment of permanent judges must be based on the criteria of high quality and continuity. At any given time, a well-functioning democracy requires the existence of a sufficient number of well-qualified judges. It is they who are responsible for ensuring that cases and matters in all courts and instances are settled in a way that meets stringent requirements of impartiality, independence, legal quality and effectiveness. This, in turn, requires there always to be enough highly qualified lawyers who are interested in applying for permanent judges’ positions in all kinds of courts throughout the country.</p>
<p>A reformed system of recruiting permanent judges must be based on the following starting points:  The courts’ constitutional role imposes stringent demands on judges. This is especially true because demands on courts and judges have increased, because of the advent of more international elements in judicial administration and the transfer of new types of task from political bodies to the courts’ sphere of responsibility.</p>
<p>Only highly skilled lawyers suited to the profession should therefore be considered for appointments as permanent judges. Accordingly, there must be a sufficient number of qualified lawyers applying for each available permanent judge’s position.  The identity of those who exercise the power of sentencing should be transparent. Information about who perform adjudication functions in the courts should therefore be explicit by law.  The courts must be attractive employers for lawyers who are at various stages of their careers.  The profession of judge must be accessible to skilled lawyers suited to the profession with varying backgrounds and experience. To recruit enough lawyers who meet high standards of skill and suitability, the profession needs to be an attractive option for wellqualified, experienced lawyers with various types of background, who contribute a varied range of knowledge to the courts.  The system of recruiting permanent judges must be  long-term and coordinated. The requirement of long-termism means that the system should be sustained over time and cater for lawyers at various stages of their careers. The requirement of coordination means that the Judges Proposals Board, the National Courts Administration and the courts jointly formulate and are bound by a coherent system for judges’ recruitment.  Assessment of whether confidentiality needs to be introduced, in order to expand the recruitment pool for permanent judges, must start with careful, reasonable balancing of the public’s need for transparency and the scope for boosting the number of applicants for permanent judges’ positions by introducing confidentiality.</p>
<h2>Service as co-opted judge to qualify for judges’ positions</h2>
<p>One starting point is that the profession of judge should continue to be accessible to highly skilled lawyers who are suited to the profession but lack previous experience of court work. It should be possible for proficient, suitable lawyers without a court background to be appointed as permanent judges. Nonetheless, our analysis shows that court service is often a good qualification for those seeking permanent judges’ appointments. We propose a new opportunity for qualified, experienced lawyers wishing to gain an understanding of court work to gain further qualifications for permanent judges’ appointments by serving as judges. We propose that such training should be offered to 50 lawyers per year.</p>
<p>The new system of becoming qualified as a judge should include the requirement of serving for at least six months in a superior court followed by at least six months in a lower court. This would represent an opportunity for lawyers to immerse themselves in new legal areas while gaining experience of adjudication in superior and inferior courts. It would also provide scope for references from two courts for a qualified and experienced lawyer who has obtained the required credentials to become a judge and who chooses to apply for a permanent judge’s position. The Judges Proposals</p>
<p>Board and the Government would thus receive more extensive documentation for assessing the applicant’s skill and suitability.</p>
<p>We recommend introducing a new judge’s position as ‘co-opted  judge ’ for those in the process of qualifying themselves. The content of the work should focus on branches of law and case types of which the co-opted judge has limited previous experience. This means more training in new legal areas and a reduced risk of situations involving conflict of interest. We also propose coordination of the qualification process for judges among the courts, and that the Judges Proposals Board should announce vacant positions for co-opted judges.</p>
<h2>Expanded special judges’ training</h2>
<p>Enable more people to complete special judges’ training</p>
<p>To ensure that permanent judges can be recruited from the most proficient and professionally suited lawyers, more applicants are generally required for permanent judges’ appointments. The system for recruiting permanent judges cannot be based on scope to recruit permanent judges solely from lawyers who are working outside the courts. Another requirement is for the courts to offer many more lawyers than today the opportunity to complete the special judges’ training. Not all those who undergo this training and become deputy judges stay in the courts. Many employers (such as the Swedish Government Offices, the Riksdag and the Parliamentary Ombudsmen) base their activities on trained deputy judges being available for recruitment. This also applies to other state employers. The special training for judges should therefore be offered to more skilled lawyers early in their careers. The courts have the capacity to train more judges, and lawyers training to become judges play an important part in the courts’ (both superior and lower courts’) activities.</p>
<p>We propose that another 50 lawyers should complete the special judges’ training each year.</p>
<p>Attractive special judges’ training that enables lawyers to get established in a location</p>
<p>The training should also be adapted to the needs of young lawyers to equip themselves to work as judges, and to remain and work in courts at various locations around Sweden. This is necessary if permanent judges are, in the future, to be recruited throughout the country. Those who undergo the special judges’ training and are appointed to work in a lower court for two years should be given the opportunity to find out, at an early stage, in which court their lowercourt service is to be carried out. We also recommend enabling those who have completed the special training and become deputy judges to be offered the opportunity of two years’ further service in a lower court. Lawyers who have undergone the judges’ training should therefore be able to obtain additional credentials to qualify for permanent judges’ appointments by continuing to work in courts, especially courts outside the metropolitan areas. This would improve these lawyers’ prospects of establishing themselves and working for extended periods in non-metropolitan locations. In the long run, this may help to boost numbers of applicants for permanent positions as judges in locations where recruitment of permanent judges may currently be difficult.</p>
<h2>Statutory rules on who exercises power to sentence</h2>
<p>Judges can be divided into two categories: permanent and nonpermanent. Permanent judges are appointed through proxy by the Government. The non-permanent judges include stand-ins for permanent judges and temporarily employed additional judges. There are also judges in training who are junior judges in lower or superior courts or co-opted members of superior courts. Stand-ins for permanent judges and temporary additional judges are, in some cases, employed through government decisions. Other non-permanent judges are employed by superior or lower courts.</p>
<p>Approximately a third of the judges are in non-permanent positions. Moreover, in the lower courts there are law clerks and drafting lawyers who have qualified as law clerks. These are allowed to judge and make decisions in simpler cases.</p>
<p>Today, which of the various permanent judges are allowed to adjudicate in the general and administrative courts is regulated by the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure and the Administrative Court Act (1971:289). There is no statutory provision whereby non-permanent judges may judge in the courts. For constitutional reasons, for public understanding of the courts’ activities and for confidence in the courts, it is important for the law to define who is authorised to exercise the power of sentencing. We therefore recommend making it clear in the provisions of the Code of Judicial Procedure and in the Administrative Court Act that there are stand-ins and additional judges, as well as judges who are employed for training purposes, in the courts.</p>
<p>The basic stages of work to recruit permanent judges should be laid down by law.</p>
<p>The Judges Proposals Board’s task of conducting active and longterm work to promote the recruitment of permanent judges should be regulated in the Appointment Act. It is important to emphasise that the permanent judges’ recruitment is based on cooperation and coordination among the Judges Proposals Board, the individual courts and the Swedish National Courts Administration. It is vital for the Board, based on the requirements imposed on judges and the courts, to continuously adapt the criteria used for assessing the skill and suitability of those applying for employment as permanent judges. We also consider that the Board should, to a greater extent than today, work to clarify the documentation provided by the referees in appointment cases. A more active recruitment procedure should include helping to improve scope for assessing the skill and suitability of applicants who have qualified for permanent judges’ appointments other than by serving in court. We consider that the Board should be given the capacity to recruit human resources expertise to a greater extent than today.</p>
<p>We also propose adding a provision to the Appointment Act whereby, when the recruitment does not concern a court manager’s appointment, the Judges Proposals Board should obtain an opinion from the manager of the court concerned in the case. We recommend allowing a representative of the National Courts Administration to attend and comment at the Board’s meeting on matters relating to a court manager’s appointment. We also propose allowing the Board, to enable it to evaluate the applicants’ skill and suitability, to engage a subject specialist to attend the Board’s meeting and express opinions.</p>
<p>A relevant case may, for example, concern employing a technical advisor when expert knowledge is needed to assess the requirements of a specific position and the skills of a particular applicant.</p>
<h2>Rule on confidentiality in initial stage of application procedure</h2>
<p>We have examined various ways of regulating confidentiality, to apply during the Judges Proposals Board’s proceedings, that would achieve an appropriate balance between the interest of transparency and that of protection for information about the applicants. Although there are particulars about the applicants that can be protected, the purpose of confidentiality rules is to boost the number of applicants for permanent judges’ appointments.</p>
<p>One possible way of regulating confidentiality that we have considered is a rule that applies to all data capable of providing any indications of the applicant’s identity. We have also analysed various forms of more restrictive confidentiality regulation. One way of achieving more restricted regulation of confidentiality that we have considered is to limit it to certain types of information about the applicants. Another way we have considered is to limit regulation of confidentiality to matters relating to appointment of judges in certain categories, such as court managers and Supreme Court Justices. Moreover, we have considered introducing rules that would entail an individual confidentiality review of reasons for and against the confidentiality of each individual applicant’s particulars. We have also analysed various ways of confining the confidentiality rule to a specific period of time during the Judges Proposals Board’s proceedings.</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that all the ways of delimiting confidentiality regulation that we have considered have distinct disadvantages. All forms of confidentiality rule restrict public access to information about the recruitment procedure, and it is doubtful how far regulating confidentiality could help to boost numbers of applicants for all types of permanent judges’ appointments. In the relevant part of the questionnaire survey we carried out, only 8 percent of the lawyers who had not applied for a permanent judges’ appointments replied that the public nature of the process was the reason they had not applied. Only 15 percent answered that they would be more inclined to apply for employment as judges if confidentiality were introduced. In our opinion, however, the disadvantages of confidentiality regulation outweigh the advantages.</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that, if confidentiality is deemed necessary to enable the most skilled and suitable lawyers to be recruited as permanent judges, a new rule should be introduced. Under this rule, confidentiality in cases of permanent judges’ appointments should apply to the Judges Proposals Board’s proceedings during the application period and the week after it ends. Applicants wishing to withdraw their applications after receiving information about who else has applied for the position could do so, and the information about them would then be protected by continued confidentiality. Information about those who choose to remain as applicants, on the other hand, would be public. In our view, this rule could boost the number of applicants to permanent judges’ positions. At the same time, the general public would gain access to information about all the applicants who are actually appraised by the Board. Thus, this kind of confidentiality regulation does not restrict public access to information about applicants who may be included in the Board’s proposals to the Government.</p>
<p>We propose that the confidentiality rule should specify that information among eligible applicants themselves is not subject to confidentiality. The parties involved should thus have a statutory entitlement to access information about one another. Furthermore, in light of the interest in the recruitment procedure being transparent, our assessment is that the main rule on ‘freedom to sound the alarm’ (whistleblowing) should be valid in application of the new confidentiality regulation. Accordingly, we do not propose making it punishable to disclose information protected by the confidentiality rule.</p>
<h2>Long-term, stable prospects of recruiting permanent judges</h2>
<p>Recruitment of permanent judges requires long-termism and stability. Various measures are needed to boost the number of applicants for permanent judges’ positions, and the work must be implemented with a multiannual approach. Steps to boost the number of qualified applicants could consist in offering qualified and experienced lawyers scope to qualify as judges; increasing the number of lawyers who undergo special judges’ training; or im- proving the scope for deputy judges to serve in lower courts.</p>
<p>For the process whereby qualified, experienced lawyers equip themselves to be judges, the special judges’ training and deputy judges’ service in lower courts to function smoothly, it is important for the budget for these activities to be used effectively. The various forms of judges’ training can then be offered to enough lawyers to meet the courts’ needs, i.e. corresponding to the number of permanent judges required in the long term. Current funding of the</p>
<p>special judges’ training is based on shared budget responsibility, which means that there are a certain number of openings for law clerks and that both the superior courts and the Swedish National Courts Administration have budget resources for the training. We point out that it often means better resource utilisation if, first, the entire budget can be used without being confined to particular openings and, second, if the budget is delegated to the part(s) of the work where tasks are carried out. It is the Swedish National Courts Administration that is responsible for allocating and delegating the budget to enable financial resources to be used efficiently. Our reasoning is based on the belief that it would be more efficient for the budget for the various forms of judges’ training to be delegated to the superior courts. Our assessment is that a regional budget for the co-opted, acting or temporary judges’ qualification process, and also the special judges’ training and the deputy judges’ service in lower courts would improve the conditions for efficient budget utilisation and afford coordination gains.</p>
<p>The scope of requisite training and other measures needed to promote recruitment of permanent judges in order to boost the number of qualified applicants for permanent judges’ posts must be based on advanced analyses performed by the Courts Administra- tion and the Judges Proposals Board.</p>
<p>Today, the Administration already performs analyses aimed at gauging future needs to recruit permanent judges. We consider it advisable to also benefit, when such analyses are made, from the stock of knowledge possessed by the Board and its offices regarding applicants for permanent judges’ appointments.</p>
<p>The Board has ample scope for analysing trends regarding the supply of qualified, suitable applicants in relation to the numbers of permanent judges’ appointments needed. We therefore propose that the Board should conduct an annual analysis of future prospects of recruiting permanent judges. This analysis should focus on the supply of qualified applicants, and supplement the information submitted by the Courts Administration to the Government. The Government would thus receive, from both the Swedish National Courts Administration and the Judges Proposals Board, comprehensive documentation for assessing which measures are needed to ensure that there enough qualified applicants for permanent judges’ posts.</p>
