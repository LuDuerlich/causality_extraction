<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Everyone’s desire and ability to work must be put to use in the labour market. Everyone who is not given opportunities to contribute their skills and ability to the labour market represents a loss to the society. People with disabilities and an impaired capacity to work participate in working life to a much less extent than people without a reduced work capacity, and women in these groups to a much less extent than men.</p>
<p>Measures to help more people with disabilities find and maintain employment are therefore an important part of the Government’s strategy for the implementation of the 2011–2016 disability policy. The national action plan focuses on society’s ability to remove obstacles to participation. In the area of labour market policy, this means that everyone who can and wants to work must be given the best possible opportunities to do so. The Inquiry presents its proposals in this report, entitled ‘Lower thresholds – higher ceiling’ .</p>
<h2>Remit of the Inquiry</h2>
<p>The terms of reference instruct the Inquiry to present a comprehensive proposal on how labour market policy measures should be designed to effectively contribute to improving the prospects for people with disabilities of finding and maintaining employment. The starting point is that measures must be accurately targeted, flexible and cost-effective. They must also be clear and simple, and work well with other measures. The Inquiry’s proposals should lead to measures that benefit those who are in greatest need and, as far as possible, be tailored to meet individual needs.</p>
<p>The individual in focus</p>
<p>One of the Inquiry’s principal points of departure is that the measures should be designed based on the individual’s needs. People with disabilities are not a homogeneous group. How disabilities affect the prospects for work and participation depends on how accessible the individual’s environment is. How the individual’s resources can be used to their full potential also depends on how well his or her abilities can be matched with the right job. With the individual in focus, the Inquiry has centred on identifying measures that can improve opportunities for development and thereby enhance the prospects of employment with or without support.</p>
<h2>Lower employment and higher unemployment</h2>
<p>Nine per cent of Sweden’s population aged 16–64 report having a disability that impairs their capacity to work. These people have lower employment and higher unemployment rates than people without disabilities. The differences have also increased over time. Almost half of the people who report having a disability that impairs their capacity to work are completely outside the labour market. The individual’s chances of employment are affected both by the level of education and the kind of disability they have. People with mental disabilities have the lowest employment rate.</p>
<p>In recent years, the number of people with disabilities looking for work through the Swedish Public Employment Service has increased significantly. One in four people, or 172 000 men and women, registered with the Public Employment Service currently has a documented disability. The main reason for this trend is the</p>
<p>Swedish Public Employment Service’s extended mandate to help people on sick leave and people who are no longer on sickness insurance to return to working life.</p>
<p>Initiatives differ for women and men</p>
<p>Women with disabilities that impair their capacity to work are employed to the same extent as men but more often work part-time. Women combine their part-time work with sickness benefit or sickness compensation (disability pension). Regarding the Public Employment Service initiatives, the Inquiry has found that women and men systematically take part in different programmes and measures. Women are overrepresented in preparatory measures, including vocational rehabilitation. Men are overrepresented in all the five forms of wage-subsidised employment. It is important that the Public Employment Service is aware of unconscious biases in their assessment of the choice of initiative.</p>
<h2>Longer periods of registered unemployment with the Public Employment Service</h2>
<p>People with disabilities are the group with the longest periods of registered unemployment with the Public Employment Service, about 60 per cent have been unemployed for more than two years. It also takes a long time, on average eight to nine months, for the Public Employment Service to establish whether the individual has a disability that impairs their capacity to work and is therefore entitled to special measures. It is a waste of resources if people who can and want to work do not receive the support they need.</p>
<p>To shorten the length of registered unemployment periods, the Public Employment Service has changed its working methods over the last few years and introduced a uniform supply of services, staff support and quality assurance methods. Despite this, vocational rehabilitation does not appear to be functioning satisfactorily. Employment officers are very committed to vocational rehabilitation, but feel they need more in-depth knowledge about what it means to have a disability. The Inquiry considers that the resources available for vocational rehabilitation should be concentrated so that individuals, right from the start, can meet employment officers who are able to assess the measures needed to ensure that the road to employment is free from unnecessary obstacles.</p>
<p>Other prerequisites for shorter periods of registered unemployment are a labour market that wants to employ people with disabilities, individuals who feel involved in the rehabilitation process, and available knowledge about the tools and methods that are most appropriate. To put in place strategies for carrying out effective vocational rehabilitation, research in this area is crucial.</p>
<p>Measures that work</p>
<p>A trend shift has taken place, both in Sweden and other countries, from sheltered activities to an inclusive working life in the regular labour market. Greater focus is also placed on new methods to help more people with disabilities find and maintain employment. Supported Employment  is a method that has received a great deal of attention in recent years both in Sweden and abroad, and experiences of it are favourable.</p>
<p>In labour market policy, measures for people with disabilities remain an unexplored area. However, the existing research on labour market policy initiatives shows that enhanced employment services and subsidised employment improve the individual’s chances of finding a job.</p>
<h2>Employers who dare to hire</h2>
<p>Employers who are prepared to employ people with disabilities that impair their capacity to work are a prerequisite for effective labour market policy measures. It is important that employers are informed about the support that the Public Employment Service can offer when a person has a reduced work capacity. Today, the main employers of people with subsidised wage are small private employers, every second person work in an enterprise with less than 20 employees. Particularly the public sector should be able to assume greater responsibility.</p>
<p>The possibility of finding people with the right skills and qualifications for the job is of the essence for employers. Measures that can help the jobseeker acquire the skills that match the demands of the labour market are therefore extremely important in increasing the individual’s chances of employment.</p>
<p>Employers want a higher ceiling and a support person</p>
<p>Employers report that the maximum qualifying income for employment with subsidised wages currently represents the greatest obstacle to employing people with disabilities. Also, employers often know too little about what having a disability means. They would therefore like support both before and during the employment period to enable them to take the step to employ a person with disabilities. This support should be provided by a support person or a special introduction and follow-up support (SIUS) consultant.</p>
<p>There has been an increase in employment of people with disabilities and reduced work capacity by work integration social enterprises. Although the number of employees in these enterprises is low, a great deal of evidence suggests that they are able to offer suitable tasks in an environment that is well adapted to employees with special needs.</p>
<h2>Young people with disabilities have a whole working life ahead of them</h2>
<p>Training initiatives important</p>
<p>The Inquiry pays special attention to young people with disabilities. These young people have a whole working life ahead of them. Young people with disabilities often lack work experience. This, coupled with the fact that they also have a shorter education than others in the same age group, makes finding a job very difficult for them. Skills development measures are therefore needed to improve their chances of finding employment.</p>
<p>The Public Employment Service has long offered young people without an upper secondary education the opportunity to attempt studies at folk high schools, which is an important measure for young people with disabilities. Other vocational training programmes offered within the framework of labour market policy should be implemented on the basis of the individual’s needs and be linked to employers who need to employ. The best results are achieved when industry representatives take part in the design of the programme and are available to arrange contacts with employers.</p>
<p>Lower thresholds for young people receiving activity compensation</p>
<p>More paths into the labour market are needed for young people receiving activity compensation (disability pension). The Inquiry considers that the Swedish Social Insurance Agency and the Public</p>
<p>Employment Service should conduct a joint assessment of the individual’s resources and work capacity with or without subsidised wages prior to an assessment of entitlement to activity compensation for reduced work capacity.</p>
<p>Today there are rules for dormant activity compensation that apply to those who attempt to work or study. As a complement to dormant activity compensation, the special rules that apply to people who were entitled to sickness compensation (disability pension) before July 2008 should also apply to people who are currently entitled to activity compensation for reduced work capacity. This would mean that people could work or study according to their ability without having their work capacity reassessed. This would probably lead to more young people than today taking the step to try out work or study.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals Two main aims – development and security</h2>
<p>In the Inquiry’s assessment, the regulatory framework for the current forms of support is perceived as difficult to grasp. The Inquiry therefore proposes that the rules for subsidised wages that apply to employing people with disabilities that impair the capacity to work be classified under two main aims only, namely development or security.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  subsidised wages for development when employing people who need tailored work and different types of development initiatives that increase their work capacity. Under the proposal, subsidised wages for development could be approved for a maximum of two years. While employees receive subsidised wages for development, they have a development employment position. This form of employment is not covered by the Employment Protection Act.</p>
<p>The long-term  need  for subsidised wages to compensate the employer for an individual’s reduced work capacity is included in the new scheme for subsidised wages for security . This form of employment is covered by the Employment Protection Act. It should be possible to assess the need for this type of subsidised wage both following a period of development employment and as an alternative to this type of employment if the needs are assessed as long-term.</p>
<p>The decisive factor in the choice between subsidised wages for development or security is the duration of the need for subsidised wages, not the degree of work incapacity. Subsidised wages for development may be the most appropriate choice even when work capacity is significantly reduced.</p>
<p>The purpose of subsidised wages is to develop the individual’s resources, always focusing on the individual’s ability to carry out their tasks. In the Inquiry’s assessment, development employment in the form of wage support for development should always be the first choice for young people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Development initiatives available to more people</p>
<p>Too few people have been offered opportunities for development despite the fact that many people with disabilities, especially young men and women, are in need of such measures. Wage subsidies have been the main measure taken to develop work capacity. For employees with current subsidised wages, there are no opportunities for special development measures in combination with work. Subsidised wages for development in combination with a development allowance would essentially replace today’s wage subsidies.</p>
<p>The development subsidy is only to be paid once the individual, the Public Employment Service and the employer have reached an agreement specifying the measures.</p>
<p>The development measures mean that significantly more people than today will be offered educational and social skills training to practise, test and, not least, develop their work capacity under suitable conditions at a workplace for a contractually agreed wage. The Inquiry estimates that each year around 55 000–60 000 women and men with disabilities will have the opportunity to develop their work capacity receiving subsidised wages for development. At present, about 5 000 people per year have a development employment position.</p>
<p>Long-term solutions for long-term needs</p>
<p>The current four-year wage subsidies programme has also been the main measure for people in need of long-term support. For men and women with long-term incapacity for work due to a disability, this need is safeguarded through subsidised wages for security. The long periods of subsidised wages for many people indicate that, for some of them, security employment would have been preferable from the outset. Security for these people increases when subsidised wages can be decided based on longer-term conditions.</p>
<p>Under the Inquiry’s proposal for higher provider allowances, people with significantly reduced work capacity whose needs involve specially organised work activities will have more choices of employer alongside Samhall AB.</p>
<p>Uniform wage subsidies – regardless of the employer that recruits</p>
<p>The model involving compensation to the employer in the form of individualised wage subsidies, based on the employee’s work capacity in relation to the task, has been in place for some time and has proved to function well. The Inquiry therefore proposes that the same principles also apply to Samhall AB. This means that the current lump sum compensation for additional costs paid to Samhall will be abolished and that the rules that apply to other employers will also apply to Samhall. The new scheme increases the traceability in the state’s compensation to Samhall and is well in line with the conditions the European Commission sets to ensure that support to employment of people with disabilities can be approved without distorting competition.</p>
<p>The compensation for Samhall AB for people currently employed should initially correspond to the average allowance for security employment. The Inquiry estimates that over a four-year period the Public Employment Service will have reviewed the level of subsidised wages for all Samhall employees based on each person’s work capacity in relation to their tasks.</p>
<h2>Individual’s work capacity and needs to determine the amount of support</h2>
<p>Increased and indexed ceiling for subsidised wages</p>
<p>One of the Inquiry’s starting points is that wage subsidies should compensate the employer for the individual’s reduced work capacity. Today, few employers are compensated for this in full. For Samhall AB, there has been no link between the compensation and the employees’ degree of reduced work capacity.</p>
<p>To increase the legitimacy of the special forms of subsidised wages among employers and to create credibility for the link between the individual’s degree of work incapacity and the size of the subsidy, the Inquiry proposes that the maximum qualifying income for employment with subsidised wages be increased and indexed to the general inflation rate in the economy. The Inquiry proposes that the maximum qualifying income for employment with subsidised wages amount to a gross salary of 0.45 price base amounts at the most. In 2012 this corresponds to SEK 19 800 per month. The current maximum qualifying income for employment with subsidised wages is SEK 16 700 per month.</p>
<p>Increased legitimacy for subsidised wages among employers will lead to more employers being prepared to employ and more people with disabilities being offered a job. It will also increase the individual’s security and ability to participate in the labour market on an equal basis with others. Indexing is of particular significance for people with a long-term need for subsidised employment.</p>
<p>Employers receive compensation for costs associated with employing a person with disabilities</p>
<p>Employers who employ people with disabilities receive compensation in the form of a wage subsidy. The Inquiry proposes that, in addition to this subsidy, the employer receive compensation for certain additional costs associated with employing a person with disabilities. – Standardised allowance. All employers that have employees earning subsidised wages for development and subsidised wages for security will receive SEK 50 per day per employee. This allowance is to cover work supervision and costs arising from adapting the organisation and the tasks. – Higher allowance.  Employers with a large proportion of employees earning subsidised wages for security will receive a further SEK 120 per day per employee. These include Samhall AB, work integration social enterprises or other employers where the primary purpose of their activities is to offer stimulating tasks to people with significantly reduced work capacity. The higher allowance is to cover costs for rehabilitation measures, etc. – Development allowance.  Employers who provide a development employment position may receive SEK 150 per day per employee to cover the costs of development measures. – Personal assistant.  The Inquiry considers that it should be possible to combine a personal assistant with the two new forms of wages subsidies. Support for a personal assistant would aim to provide the individual with the practical help of a person at the workplace; for example, an assistant could help with reading or writing, or moving around the premises.</p>
<p>Target group for subsidised wages expanded</p>
<p>At present, under the provisions of the Public Employment Service, it is not possible to obtain wage subsidies for employees who are close relatives, nor may wages subsidies be given to a current employer. The Inquiry considers that such provisions are restrictive and therefore proposes that subsidised wages for development and subsidised wages for security be made available to employees who are members of the employer’s family. The same requirements will apply to an employer belonging to an employee’s family as to other employers. The Inquiry also proposes that subsidised wages be made available to present employers who have met their rehabilitation obligations for an employee whose working capacity has deteriorated during the current employment period.</p>
<h2>Credibility and legitimacy require supervision and control</h2>
<p>The Public Employment Service has extensive funds at its disposal and every year it decides about large amounts that go to subsidised employment. It is therefore important that no flaws exist in the basis for these decisions, both to ensure the efficient use of resources and for credibility and legitimacy in relation to the employers. As the resources for subsidised employment are limited, it is also important that they are used appropriately to enable as many people as possible who need employment with subsidised wages for development and subsidised wages for security to be included in these initiatives. The Inquiry proposes that an independent agency be assigned to supervise the subsidised forms of employment.</p>
<h2>Better matching and enhanced individualised support</h2>
<p>Supported employment methods have long and successfully been used by the Public Employment Service through the special introduction and follow-up support programme (SIUS). More people should have access to SIUS. The Inquiry therefore proposes that it should be possible to procure and offer actors outside the Public Employment Service through a free choice system. These may be organisations with expertise in specific disabilities. It is a positive step to give the individual the opportunity to choose the actor that corresponds to his or her needs.</p>
<p>The individual’s needs must guide the efforts of the Public Employment Service to a greater extent than is now the case. It is therefore proposed that increased opportunities be given to combine programmes such as SIUS and personal assistants with subsidised wages for development, subsidised wages for security and new start jobs.</p>
<h2>Education initiatives improve job prospects</h2>
<p>As the demands for educational qualifications increase, it is ever more important that people with disabilities are able to take part in education and training programmes that improve their chances of competing for jobs on the same terms as everyone else.</p>
<p>Under the Inquiry’s proposals, more people with disabilities will be able to take part in training programmes. The proposed measures are particularly important for young men and women with disabilities. – Trainee programmes  are conducted in close cooperation with industry organisations and companies with recruitment needs. A project manager who coordinates the training programme by keeping in touch with the student, the employer offering work experience and the education provider will enable the success of these training programmes. –  Opportunities to try out courses at folk high schools  will be extended for young people with disabilities. This may encourage more people to return to previous studies or to try a new programme.</p>
<h2>Greater flexibility and more strategic management for Samhall AB</h2>
<p>Employment at Samhall AB is intended for people whose work capacity is so reduced that they are not able to get any other kind of work and whose needs cannot be catered for by other measures. Subsidised wages for security should therefore be the dominant form of support for Samhall employees.</p>
<p>However, employment with wage support for development may be a good complement to Samhall’s core mission. The Inquiry therefore proposes that Samhall AB be able to use the option of development employment, but in any given year recruitments in this category may not exceed the number of new recruitments with subsidised wages for security.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposal of a new compensation model means that today’s volume target in the form of a set minimum number of working hours per year has outlived its usefulness as an instrument for Samhall AB. In the Inquiry’s view, the management of Samhall’s core mission should be based on the scale of activities the owner wants the company to conduct in the long term. It is therefore proposed that the yearly agreement with Samhall AB be abolished and replaced with an owner directive that is more long-term and where the state specifies the number of new staff each year that the company must undertake to employ with subsidised wages for security.</p>
<h2>Vocational rehabilitation needs evaluating</h2>
<p>More knowledge is needed about how resources are used</p>
<p>The Public Employment Service uses extensive resources to conduct vocational rehabilitation and how the measures are implemented is important in reducing the time between when a person with disabilities is registered and when he or she finds work or starts a training programme. Little is know about how the resources are used and if they are used correctly. The need therefore exists for in-depth studies to determine whether the process from registration to work or training is appropriate. The Inquiry proposes that the Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy be instructed to evaluate how tools and methods are used for people with reduced working capacity.</p>
<p>More opportunities to arrange work trial placements</p>
<p>Access to preparatory measures in the form of work trial placements is fundamental in evaluating the individual’s work capacity.</p>
<p>In most cases, work trial in the real environment would be preferable, but in certain cases there may initially be a need for work trial in a sheltered environment. For this reason, the Inquiry proposes that the Public Employment Service be able to conclude agreements with municipalities on preparatory measures within the framework of vocational rehabilitation that aim to test the individual’s work capacity. Samhall AB, work integration social enterprises and other education providers can also be important actors in this area.</p>
<h2>Economic impact</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals involve increased state expenditure. In the first year, the higher ceiling is estimated to result in increased ex- penditure of SEK 566 million. Development allowance, educational initiatives, provider allowances and the expansion of SIUS are esti- mated to result in increased expenditure of SEK 314 million during the first year. The change in compensation to Samhall AB is estimated to result in an initial reduction in expenditure of SEK 182 million.</p>
<p>As a result of the Inquiry’s proposals, overall expenditure is ex- pected to increase by about SEK 700 million during the first year, SEK 1.8 billion during the second year and SEK 2.4 billion during the third year.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the existing scope within the budget be used to finance the proposals. In recent years, the Riksdag has allocated</p>
<p>more funds for measures for people with disabilities than have been able to be spent. Appropriation savings amounted to SEK 551 million in 2011 and SEK 716 million in 2010.</p>
<p>Changes to the sickness insurance system have had an im- portant bearing on the need for the Public Employment Service’s measures for people with disabilities. The level of ambition needs to be raised in labour market policy so that the work capacity of people with disabilities can be developed and put to use. In the long run, if no changes are made, costs could be high both for the individual and for society if more people leave the labour market and sickness insurance expenditures begin to rise again.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore considers that funds be transferred from expenditure area 10 (Financial security for the sick and disabled) to finance expenditure increases outside the scope of allocated funds for labour market policy measures.</p>
