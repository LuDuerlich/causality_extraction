<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Pursuant to the EC Water Framework Directive, Sweden and the other EU Member States have pledged to substantially increase our level of ambition with regard to the protection of our waters and aquatic ecosystems.</p>
<p>My proposals:</p>
<p>N  Sweden is to be divided into five water districts based around the connection of geographical areas with the sea basins of the Bay of Bothnia, Gulf of Bothnia, North Baltic Sea, South Baltic Sea and North Sea; nature and the environment will steer this division, rather than the old administrative boundaries.</p>
<p>N  Resources and competence as regards water issues will be concentrated so as to achieve high levels of cost effectiveness and a clear division of responsibilities.</p>
<p>N  In each of the five districts, a water authority will be established with the purpose of ensuring fulfilment of the environmental objectives for water. Initially the official responsibility will be assigned to a delegation at one of the district's county administrative boards.</p>
<p>N  The water authorities will be responsible for environmental objectives, programmes of action and administrative plans for their respective water districts and will ensure that watercourses are analysed and monitored.</p>
<p>N  At the local level, local bodies for cooperation will be established through the agency of the municipalities, and based in principle, on Sweden's main river basin areas. These bodies may also comprise organisations, water conservation associations etc. Their task will be the management of local water conservation activities.</p>
<p>N  Cooperative associations for water conservation should be set up in cases where there is a special need for protection</p>
<p>of individual watercourses or groundwater bodies. A new law is proposed for this purpose.</p>
<p>N  Agreements between water users with the aim of achieving improvements to water environments will be given official sanction so as to achieve less bureaucracy and greater legal security.</p>
<p>N  In order to create the necessary resources for the achievement of environmental objectives, we need a functioning system of charges. The Committee proposes a basic model for such a system of charges.</p>
<p>N  The water authorities will have a supervisory responsibility for contingency measures for water supply. One of the authorities will be responsible for national coordination of such supervision.</p>
<p>The EC framework directive means a higher level of ambition</p>
<p>Sweden will raise its level of ambition in efforts to protect its waters. This is a consequence of the framework directive for water adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in December 2000. The aim is to protect water quality and aquatic ecosystems and to secure long-term water supplies in the Community.</p>
<p>The framework directive applies to both surface water and groundwater. ”Good water status” shall be achieved by 2015. No deterioration in water quality will be accepted. Central tasks involve establishing environmental objectives for water and programmes of action. This work is to be completed by 2009. Authorities are to be established, and these should be based around natural river basins rather than existing administrative boundaries.</p>
<p>EC directives are binding for Member States, which means that each Member State is obliged to ensure that the directive is incorporated in national legislation.</p>
<p>Assignment – The Committee on Swedish Water Administration</p>
<p>In October 2001, the Government appointed a one-man committee to draw up a proposal on an organisation for the implementation of the EC framework directive in Sweden (Dir 2001:78). The committee took the name ”The Committee on Swedish Water</p>
<p>Administration”. Its assignment also included analysing the prospects of introducing water charges in Sweden, proposing forms for environmental cooperation on bodies of water and submitting a proposal regarding responsibility for supervision of contingency measures for water supply.</p>
<p>In parallel, the Committee on the Swedish Environmental Code was asked to prepare a proposal as to how to incorporate the material contents of the framework directive in Swedish legislation. The two committees have worked in close cooperation and our proposals are coordinated.</p>
<p>Our investigations have been undertaken by means of a broad and open process. Three hearings, each with some 80 participants, have been held.</p>
<p>Five water districts…</p>
<p>The country is to be divided into five water districts. These districts will be based on the river basins' connection with the major sea basins, i.e., the Bay of Bothnia, the Gulf of Bothnia, the North Baltic Sea, the South Baltic Sea and the North Sea (see map in appendix 2).</p>
<p>Some of the reasons for having a limited number of districts are the water authorities' focus on strategic issues, the need for special competence, and opportunities for improving the efficiency of activities in the field of water policy and limiting the need for new resources.</p>
<p>In the long term, coordination with potential amended routines for the consideration of permits under the Swedish Environmental Code may be possible. The Committee on the Swedish Environmental Code has proposed that this responsibility be transferred from the environmental courts to administrative authorities, and in this case it would be possible to transfer it to the same number of authorities, in the same localities, covering the same geographic areas as the water authorities.</p>
<p>… and five water authorities</p>
<p>A water authority will be established in each of the five water districts. This will serve to concentrate resources and competence</p>
<p>with the aim of achieving high levels of cost effectiveness and a clear division of responsibilities.</p>
<p>The rather limited timetable – completion by December 2003 – means that the authorities should initially be linked in the form of a delegation to a county administrative board in each water district.</p>
<p>The governing board of each authority (initially the delegation) should be appointed by the Government, which should also appoint the chairman of the board and director of the authority. The governing board should represent different aspects of society – the central government, local government, the business sector and environmental protection organisations. In addition to a head office, it should be possible for each authority to have local offices in different parts of the water district.</p>
<p>The responsibilities of the authorities – ensuring achievement of environmental objectives</p>
<p>The basic responsibility of the authorities will be to ensure achievement of the environmental objectives for water. These environmental objectives will be regulated in statutes and will thus have a special status in relation to other environmental objectives.</p>
<p>The most important decisions for the water authorities will concern these objectives and programmes of action. Their activities will be documented in an administrative plan. The plan should reflect the overall situation – the status of the water, objectives, measures and supervision – and become a key document for dialogue with citizens and organisations. As a basis for the objectives and programme of action, an analysis and report on the characteristics of water in the district etc. should be produced. Routines for supervision of water in the district should also be established.</p>
<p>The implementation of the programmes of action will affect a large number of national and regional authorities, municipalities, water conservation associations, companies, etc. Authorities and municipalities are to implement decided programmes of action.</p>
<p>Local cooperative bodies to be established</p>
<p>According to the framework directive, the organisation of activities in the field of water policy is to be based around natural river basins. This means that Sweden's 119 main river basins (see map in appendix 3) should be the point of departure for local activities.</p>
<p>The municipalities will develop local cooperative bodies based on the main river basin areas. Smaller river basin areas can perhaps be joined together and larger ones divided. How many there end up being – perhaps 70–90 – should be determined by means of a local and regional process. The cooperative body could also include companies, water conservation associations, organisations etc.</p>
<p>This body should help to carry out analyses, provide background documentation for environmental objectives, prepare proposals for measures and be active in the implementation process. Another important aspect is to provide consultation. In the final instance, the water authority will have the right to decide on the establishment of cooperative bodies.</p>
<p>Establishment of cooperative associations for water conservation</p>
<p>At the local level, there is also a ”super local” dimension. This may involve measures and cooperation to protect or improve a specific watercourse or groundwater body. The Committee proposes a new law on cooperative associations for water conservation.</p>
<p>On the basis of a programme of action for a specific water district it should be possible to set up a cooperative association with the purpose of taking water conservation measures. Since such programmes of action are general, the water authority may need to specify areas in which cooperation is needed. The task of the associations will be to implement measures. The cooperative associations will be formed by means of a special procedure. They can also be formed before a programme of action has been drawn up if the need is determined by means of a water authority’s decision.</p>
<p>It should be possible to use agreements for water conservation activities between water users to a greater extent than today. Agreements on measures can be reached, for example, between farmers and, in return, the competent authority could grant exemptions from certain rules or make other commitments vis-à-</p>
<p>vis the cooperating group. The agreement should be confirmed by means of an official decision.</p>
<p>A basic model for a system of charges</p>
<p>In order to create the necessary resources for achievement of environmental objectives for water, we need a functioning system of charges. The Committee proposes a basic model for such a system.</p>
<p>All water users that affect water physically, chemically or ecologically should assume financial responsibility for their actions. This should be done through payment of a charge or through compensatory measures.</p>
<p>Charges should primarily cover water conservation activities. The exercise of authority by the water authorities should not be financed through charges but by means of taxation.</p>
<p>Existing charges should be incorporated into a cohesive model in which impacts on water are linked to the levying of charges. Charges should be introduced in cases where costs are involved today but no charges are paid. The system of charges should primarily include priority hazardous substances. The charges may need to be regionally differentiated depending on the status of the recipient.</p>
<p>A system of charges should be introduced progressively, and a first stage could include nitrates and phosphates. Large emissions from diffuse sources in agriculture and forestry should be included in the model. The issue of taxes on fertilisers and biocides is currently being examined by another official government inquiry.</p>
<p>Responsibility for supervision of contingency measures</p>
<p>Protection of water supplies in the case of emergency is of decisive importance for society. Disruptions may occur, for example, through damage to sources of water supply and in distribution networks or through losses of electricity supply.</p>
<p>To ensure efficient management of contingency measures the responsibility, which at present lies with several different parties, must be clear and well-coordinated. The Committee proposes that the five water authorities be assigned responsibility for the overall</p>
<p>supervision of contingency measures. They should also cooperate with the relevant central government authorities. The water authority's competence and holistic approach in the field of water policy will serve as a strength in the field of contingency too. One of the authorities will be assigned national responsibility for reporting and coordination. The establishment of water authorities also provides new opportunities at the regional level to coordinate supervision of contingency measures.</p>
