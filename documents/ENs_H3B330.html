<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Inquiry has been instructed to analyse the need for new economic instruments in the area of chemicals, and if the need for such instruments is considered to exist, propose the type of economic instruments that have the best potential to be effective and cost efficient. The main objective of these economic instruments should be to reduce the incidence or risk of exposure to and spread of environmentally hazardous and harmful substances from various consumer goods.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has chosen to focus on proposals that reduce the presence of hazardous substances in people’s home environment. Studies have shown that common sources of hazardous substances in people’s home environment are flame retardants in electronic products and phthalates in flooring and other building materials containing polymers of vinyl chloride (PVC).</p>
<p>The Inquiry has proposed the introduction of two new excise duty regimes. One proposal is an excise duty on certain electronic products and the second proposal is an excise duty on PVC floor, wall and ceiling coverings.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes expanded market surveillance of electronic products, building materials, toys and other consumer goods to reduce the incidence of prohibited flame retardants, phthalates or other prohibited substances in people’s home environment.</p>
<h2>Excise duty on certain electronic products</h2>
<p>The proposed excise duty on certain electronic products has been designed to make goods that are often used in people’s home environment, and therefore cause a risk of certain hazardous substances being introduced into people’s home environment, subject to excise duty. The products subject to excise duty are defined using the tariff classification in the European Community’s Combined Nomenclature (CN codes). These include cookers, microwave ovens, refrigerators, freezers, dishwashers, washing machines, dryers, computers, laptops, tablets, vacuum cleaners, cell phones, regular phones, cordless phones, routers, wireless networks, CD players, DVD players, radios, TV sets, TV diodes, computer screens and game consoles.</p>
<p>The excise duty rate will be SEK 8 per kilogram for kitchen appliances and SEK 120 per kilogram for other electronic products. The maximum amount will, however, be limited to SEK 320 per item.</p>
<p>A deduction of 50 per cent of the excise duty should be allowed for electronic products that do not contain additive compounds of bromine, chlorine or phosphorus. For electronic products that contain neither these additive compounds nor reactive added bromine or chlorine compounds, a deduction of 75 per cent of the excise duty should instead be allowed. As all electronic products contain more or less hazardous chemicals, it will not be possible to deduct the full excise duty.</p>
<h2>Excise duty on PVC floor, wall and ceiling coverings</h2>
<p>The proposed excise duty on PVC floor, wall and ceiling coverings has been designed to make goods made of PVC that constitute a large part of the surface layer in a dwelling subject to excise duty. Such goods represent a high risk of exposure to hazardous substances in people’s everyday environment. The goods subject to excise duty are defined using the tariff classification in the</p>
<p>European Community’s Combined Nomenclature (CN codes). The excise duty will amount to SEK 10 per kilogram of excisable goods. A deduction of 50 per cent of the excise duty will be allowed for goods that do not contain phthalates included in the candidate list . A deduction of 75 per cent of the excise duty will be allowed for goods that do not contain phthalates included in the candidate list, or phthalates that are restricted in toys under the REACH Regulation . Since all goods falling within the scope of the excise duty contain more or less hazardous chemicals, it will not be possible to deduct the full tax.</p>
<h2>Increased market surveillance of consumer goods</h2>
<p>An additional SEK 15 million per year is proposed for the Swedish Chemicals Agency for use in expanding market surveillance of electronic products, toys and other consumer goods.</p>
<h2>Impact of excise duty on certain electronic products</h2>
<p>The expected revenue from the excise duty on certain electronic products is estimated at SEK 2.4 billion per year. The authorities’ administrative costs are expected to amount to SEK 14 million per year, while administrative costs for the trade are expected to amount to SEK 27 million per year.</p>
<p>The excise duty will contribute to achieving the national environmental objective ‘A Non-Toxic Environment’. The excise duty is expected to lead to positive health benefits such as a reduced risk of gene defects, endocrine disruption, disturbance of the nervous system and toxicity for reproduction.</p>
<p>The excise duty is expected to both decrease the sales of certain electronic products by 4.5 per cent per year and to substitution by electronic products containing less harmful flame retardants.</p>
<p>The excise duty is expected to lead to a transfer to untaxed international eCommerce of 0.4 percentage points of the total sales of certain electronic products.</p>
<h2>Impact of excise duty on PVC floor, wall and ceiling coverings</h2>
<p>The expected revenue from the excise duty on PVC floor, wall and ceiling coverings is SEK 38 million per year. The authorities’ administrative costs are expected to amount to SEK 760 000 per year, while administrative costs for the trade are expected to amount to SEK 480 000 per year.</p>
<p>The excise duty is expected to lead to positive health benefits such as reduced risk of asthma, allergies, reproductive disorders, birth defects and liver damage.</p>
<p>The excise duty is expected to lead both to decreased sales of PVC floor, wall and ceiling coverings by 9.2 per cent per year and to substitution by goods that contain less harmful plasticisers.</p>
<p>The excise duty is expected to lead to a transfer to untaxed international eCommerce of 0.11 percentage points of the total sales of PVC floor, wall and ceiling coverings.</p>
<h2>Impact of increased market surveillance</h2>
<p>More resources for the Swedish Chemicals Agency are expected to result in significantly expanded market surveillance of hazardous substances in products, both in terms of significantly more inspections carried out and in the form of many more products analysed. This is expected to significantly increase the number of prohibited substances discovered in products. This in turn is expected to reduce the occurrence of prohibited substances in consumer products.</p>
