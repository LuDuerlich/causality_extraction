<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>During the Swedish party leaders’ parliamentary debate in June 1997, Prime Minister Göran Persson promised to initiate an information campaign focusing on ”what happened in the Second World War, the attitudes and human perspectives that led to the Holocaust”.</p>
<p>At a meeting in Stockholm in May 1998, Sweden, the UK and the US took the initiative in launching an international project – the Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance and Research. A number of other countries have since joined, and today Germany, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, France and Italy are also a party to the project. As a contribution to this cooperative venture, Sweden is to host a conference in Stockholm on 26–28 January 2000: the Stockholm International Forum on the Holocaust.</p>
<p>What came to be termed the Living History project in Sweden was launched in the autumn of 1997. The aim was to spread awareness and information about the Holocaust and to use it as a starting point for a wide-ranging discussion of such issues as democracy, tolerance, compassion and the equal worth of all people. From the outset, there has been widespread public involvement in the Living History project. Activities have been started in many parts of the country, in municipally-sponsored programmes, in schools and in voluntary associations. The project is described and evaluated in Chapter 2.</p>
<p>At the end of 1999 a special committee was appointed by the Government to inquire into the establishment of a ”Forum for Living History”. The committee and its work are described in Chapter 1.</p>
<p>The committee’s terms of reference stated that the forum should deal with questions relating to democracy, tolerance and human rights, with the Holocaust (Swedish: ”Förintelsen”) as its point of departure. The committee’s duties were to include: presenting proposals in respect of an operational profile for the new forum, showing how the forum may cooperate with the educational system, children’s and youth organisations, voluntary associations, NGOs, religious communities, cultural institutions and other networks with a view to ensuring optimal nationwide accessibility, considering how the undertaking may be organised and where it should be located, providing a cost estimate for the undertaking proposing ways of funding the forum, and otherwise presenting any proposals and taking or preparing any measures that may arise from the task.</p>
<p>A basic premise was that the forum was to begin operating by the year 2003 at the latest.</p>
<p>The present report concludes the above assignment and was presented to the Government in January 2001.</p>
<p>The normal procedure when a Swedish Government-appointed committee of inquiry publishes its final report is that the document is circulated for comment to a relatively large number of organisations, which then have about 3–6 months to submit written opinions on the committee’s proposals. The Government then composes a bill and submits it to the Riksdag (Swedish parliament). In the case of the Living History Forum, for example, the Government may be expected to include a proposal in the September 2001 Budget Bill, which the Riksdag will debate and adopt in December. If the Riksdag approves the establishment of a Living History Forum, the Government can then be expected to appoint an ”organisational committee” whose task will be to prepare the launch of the new organisation in detail.</p>
<h2>Fundamental motives for a Living History Forum</h2>
<p>In this report, we propose the establishment of a new central government authority – the Living History Forum. The overall objective of this authority would be to strengthen the will of all citizens to work actively to promote equal rights for each and everyone, against the background of past crimes against humanity. The forum will deal with issues related to democracy, tolerance and human rights on the basis of the Holocaust (”Förintelsen”).</p>
<h2>A Forum is needed</h2>
<p>Swedish democracy is strong but democratic values must be constantly upheld. A broad range of activities is needed to this end. As described in Chapter 3, the Living History Forum we propose should be able to contribute to this task. In the course of our work, we have met with overwhelmingly positive reactions to the forum concept both from NGOs and from public authorities. Its proposed structure – a combined forum, meeting place and knowledge centre – has also elicited a positive response.</p>
<p>Today there are a number of organisations and institutions working with similar issues. The Forum’s unique purpose will be to promote activities, discussions and reflections on contemporary democracy, tolerance and human rights, based on historical perspectives from the Holocaust and Swedish 20 th  century history. It would also be the only institution specifically entrusted with presenting different interpretations of history as a basis for dialogue on the fundamental values of democracy.</p>
<p>We need a Living History Forum to promote awareness of how historical reference enables us to examine our own age from different perspectives, to facilitate the discussion of complex issues and to bring processes and concepts alive. With historical knowledge as a foundation, a Living History Forum can provide a distinctive reminder of the obligation of all citizens to seek to understand the consequences of eliminating democratic balance and the open society.</p>
<p>We need to increase the number of easily accessible meeting places where people with different backgrounds and experiences can openly discuss values while at the same stressing the importance of defending inalienable rights. An understanding of, and interest in, the development of human rights is an essential component in each citizen’s lifelong pursuit of knowledge.</p>
<p>History is a living process, since our interpretations of past events are constantly changing. People’s actions in other ages shaped the society we live in today. The way we view past events influences our own age and how we plan for tomorrow. It is our duty to make proper use of past events in a concerted effort to build a better future. History is full of good and bad examples, and it is people living here and now who choose what role these lessons will play in the development of modern society.</p>
<p>Learning about history is not just a matter of learning historical facts, but equally a matter of deepening historical awareness, i.e. people’s sense of the connections between their interpretation of the past, their understanding of the present and their perspectives on the future.</p>
<p>In this capital, we also discuss prejudice and racism, Nazism and extreme nationalism, political and racial crime, available information and fundamental values and the growing opposition of people in Sweden, Europe and the world to persecution and violence.</p>
<p>In our view, the Forum is also needed as a window on the extensive but often obscure work carried out by Swedish and international authorities and organisations seeking to promote democracy, tolerance and human rights, such as the many activities and initiatives taken by organisations like the EU, the Council of Europe and the UN, as well as in Sweden itself.</p>
<h2>”Democracy, tolerance and human rights…”</h2>
<p>Chapter 4 is based on the statement in the committee’s terms of reference that the Living History Forum shall be ”a national centre for issues concerning democracy, tolerance and human rights”, but shall also, an overall goal, seek to ”deepen and enhance awareness of the equal worth of all people.”</p>
<p>In our opinion, therefore, the Living History Forum should conduct a broad range of activities across a wider spectrum than has hitherto been evident in the Living History information campaign. Without in any way diverting attention from the Holocaust, the Forum should discuss problems and issues concerning democracy, tolerance and human rights, actual cases of genocide and the danger of further genocidal acts, historical perspectives and historical awareness, and fundamental human values.</p>
<p>We have noted in the course of our discussions that this approach enjoys widespread support. The task of the Forum is not to be a ’democracy institution’ in a constitutional or technical sense. Rather, democracy, tolerance and human rights would be the keywords in the endeavour to deepen and enhance awareness of the equal worth of all people.</p>
<p>As we see it, the Living History Forum must focus in particular on the likely consequences for Sweden of developments within the various subject fields that we feel should be covered by the Forum. The situation of officially recognised national minorities in Sweden must also be addressed.</p>
<p>The Forum should encourage and facilitate human rights education, but also make available a knowledge bank relating to these issues. An interdisciplinary approach is one of the methods proposed in this respect.</p>
<p>We also note that the overall goal of deepening and enhancing awareness of the equal worth of all people would necessitate the application of two key concepts in a future Forum – knowledge and values. As far as possible, the Forum must seek to reach people through human reaction, of the kind we refer to in everyday terms as ”hearts and minds, sense and sensibility”.</p>
<p>Nowadays, history as a subject occupies too little space in the Swedish compulsory and upper secondary school curricula – a shortcoming acknowledged by both teachers and politicians. One important task for a future Forum therefore will be to encourage greater historical awareness in schools, for example by showing how a historical perspective can be integrated into other school subjects.</p>
<h2>”…the Holocaust as a point of departure”</h2>
<p>The Living History Forum is to use the Holocaust as its point of departure. This approach is discussed in Chapter 5.</p>
<p>The Holocaust was in itself a barbaric act of industrial genocide, the memory of which must never be obscured by the passage of time or become blurred in the minds of future generations. The</p>
<p>Nazi regime practised systematic genocide on Jews and on Roma. Nazi extermination policy also extended to the mass murder of people with mental disabilities, homosexuals, Jehovah’s Witnesses and political dissidents. The latter group included many trade union activists.</p>
<p>On the basis of the Holocaust, discussions can be held on the causes and mechanisms of genocide. These discussions can be broadened to include other examples of genocide. The Holocaust can also provide a starting point for discussions about totalitarian systems in general, and Nazism can be compared with fascism and communism. Proceeding from the Holocaust, discussions can also focus on power relations and the difference between perpetrators, victims and those who stand by and watch. Further, the Holocaust could provide a basis for discussions on why certain historical events enter the public consciousness at certain specific times, i.e. on different ways of using history.</p>
<p>In addition to these motives, the Holocaust theme can provide a basis for discussion of the darker sides of contemporary society, while at the same time recalling the many examples of human dignity and creativity shown by the victims, even in the extremes of human plight.</p>
<p>This chapter also looks at concepts and theories concerning the Holocaust.</p>
<p>As stressed in Chapter 4 the Swedish perspective is important, also in relation to the Holocaust.</p>
<h2>The Forum as an engine and meeting place</h2>
<p>The Living History Forum will also take a proactive, dynamic and co-ordinating approach – serving as what we term an engine – and will create attractive meeting places for dialogue on democracy, tolerance and human rights. This is discussed in Chapter 6.</p>
<p>The Forum should play an active role by providing a general overview of activities currently in progress around Sweden and by co-ordinating projects, by initiating research, exhibitions, literature and debates, by bringing together different groups, by commissioning informational material and training packages from different ”producers” and by carrying out its own activities and programmes.</p>
<p>The Living History Forum should be an active part of a network of schools, universities and colleges, museums, libraries and archives.</p>
<p>As a meeting place, the Forum should attach particular weight to functions and events that promote lively discussion. NGOs that work with democracy, tolerance and human rights, the Holocaust and genocide should be given ample room to participate.</p>
<p>Issues relating to democracy, tolerance, human rights and the Holocaust are international. For this reason in particular, the Forum should collaborate extensively with the outside world, for example on educational issues.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we also note that as a result of its broad field of operation and varied range of activities, the Living History Forum will be confronted with a wide spectrum of target groups, comprising both individuals and organisations, etc. It will not be possible for all activities to be directed at all target groups.</p>
<h2>The Living History Forum – summary of activities</h2>
<p>In Chapter 7 we discuss how the Forum is to pursue its activities. In the summary below, we have integrated these proposals with the work tasks mentioned in other chapters in order to provide an overall picture of the Living History Forum’s operation.</p>
<p>We have noted that the Forum is to deal with questions concerning democracy, tolerance and human rights, on the basis of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>In the activities it undertakes, the Forum should proceed from a desire not only to enable people to develop their understanding of the facts but also to reflect on their own attitude and the attitudes of others to democracy, tolerance and human rights. They are thus to be given the chance to grow and develop as a result of the Forum’s activities. Other important tasks are to instil in people a critical approach and an awareness of the way history is used and abused. This leads to a greater degree of historical awareness.</p>
<p>Another task will be to place the issues under discussion in a Swedish context. This is important for bringing things home to people and showing them how matters that seem remote in both time and space may in fact have a considerable bearing on the society we inhabit here and now.</p>
<p>The Living History Forum is a completely new type of organisation – neither a museum, a school, a college, a library, an archive, a cinema, a culture centre nor an informational project but rather a fruitful combination of all these.</p>
<p>In seeking to achieve its fundamental goals, the Living History Forum is to pursue, inter alia, the following tasks:</p>
<p>The Forum shall continue to provide further training and in-service training for teachers extend these activities to other professional groups as well develop educational approaches for this work.</p>
<p>The Forum shall also conduct ongoing informational activities organise debates, conferences, seminars and symposia design, commission and display exhibitions offer an extensive range of film and theatre productions, art exhibitions and concerts.</p>
<p>In addition, the Forum shall impart and provide access to factual knowledge initiate public discourse on current issues stimulate dialogue by serving as a meeting place for different research disciplines, occupational groups, cultures and generations. develop cooperation with public authorities, organisations and institutions in other countries, and with international bodies.</p>
<p>Access to the Forum’s store of knowledge and experience shall be facilitated by the development of interactive methods, the use of different cultural forms of expression, providing access to services via a knowledge bank (including a library and a learning lab) providing an Internet website of such quality that it will be a guaranteed point of access to the Forum’s areas of work, international collaboration for the purpose of developing a search engine that only looks for information on pre-approved websites an interdisciplinary approach and work mode.</p>
<p>The Forum shall seek to ensure that existing knowledge and information is preserved by gathering, processing and storing testimony from people in Sweden with experience of genocide and situations of a genocidal nature, pursuing this work on an ongoing basis, initiating the collection of relevant artefacts, joining with other bodies in developing safe, secure and professional ways of managing testimony and artefacts, promoting the development of new knowledge in neglected areas, including the lives and experiences of the Roma.</p>
<p>The Forum shall also have a number of administrative tasks, including a Secretariat for Holocaust Remembrance Day, basic administrative duties and informational work at the forthcoming Stockholm conferences on ‘Conscience and Humanity’, whatever duties relating to the management of information about Raoul Wallenberg that may be decided in the course of further discussions.</p>
<p>In character, the Forum shall be an engine, a coordinator and a purchaser a meeting place.</p>
<p>All the tasks described above presuppose that the Forum establishes close cooperation with schools, universities and colleges, museums, archives, libraries, union organisations, NGOs and others.</p>
<h2>Accessibility and organisational structure</h2>
<p>Chapter 8 outlines the general nature of the Forum’s operations, its location and an estimate of the costs involved.</p>
<p>We proposed that the Living History Forum be located in Stockholm, with offices either in the old National Archives Building on the isle of Riddarholmen or in the ”East Mews” (Östra stallet) building in the Östermalm district.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Forum should expand its work in close collaboration with regional networks in southern (Lund and Malmö), western (Göteborg and Karlstad) and northern (Umeå) Sweden, so as to bring together expertise from different parts of the country and provide wider national access to the Forum’s activities. Training packages, exhibitions, conferences and film screenings are examples of activities that should be available in all regions.</p>
<p>All four regions have the potential to build up their own activities, which could be pursued in close collaboration with the national Forum for Living History that we propose in our report.</p>
<p>The Forum should be established as a separate public authority under the name Living History Forum (Forum för levande historia). It should build up its work in close collaboration with Södertorn University College (Institute of Contemporary History) or Stockholm University, with the Centre for Multiethnic Studies at Uppsala University (including its Programme for Holocaust and Genocide Studies) and with the National Historical Museums. All four of these organisations work actively to combat racism, and represent different traditions that we believe can be fruitfully and rapidly combined for the purpose of achieving a dynamic and widely endorsed programme offering a high level of collective expertise.</p>
<p>We propose that the new authority be granted a government appropriation for the year 2003 of SEK 58 million, with at least 10– 20 per cent of this being earmarked for the funding of activities outside the national Forum.</p>
