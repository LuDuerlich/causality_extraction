<p>Our assignment</p>
<p>The assignment of the Committee includes making an assessment as to whether further measures are necessary or appropriate having regard to three EC Directives on sex discrimination</p>
<p>– The Council Directive 76/207/EEC of 9 February 1976 on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions (the  so-called Equal Treatment Directive),</p>
<p>– The Council Directive 79/7/EEC of 19 December 1978 on the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security (Social Secu- rity Directive), and</p>
<p>– The Council Directive 86/613/EEC of 11 December 1986 on the application of the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity, including agriculture, in a  self-employed capacity, and on the protection of self-employed women during pregnancy and motherhood (Self-employment Directive).</p>
<p>The assignment of the Committee also includes monitoring the work within the European Union (EU) to review the Equal Treat- ment Directive. This work was concluded through the Directive</p>
<p>2002/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 September 2002 amending the Equal Treatment Directive.</p>
<p>The assignment of the Committee also includes deliberating on whether legislation against discrimination owing to sex should also be introduced into the other fields within the scope of the Council Directive 2000/43/EC besides the areas of working life and higher education. These areas include access to and supply of goods and services which are available to the public, including housing.</p>
<p>This preliminary report contains our proposals on how the Equal Treatment Directive, the Social Security Directive and the Self- employment Directive should be implemented in Sweden. We also now deal with sex discrimination regarding goods, services and housing.</p>
<p>The remaining parts of our assignment will be dealt with later – these include, among other things, the important issues of delibera- ting on joint legislation against discrimination covering all or most of the grounds for discrimination and areas of society and on deliberating on the coordination or merger of several or all of the Equal Opportunities Ombudsman, The Ombudsman against Ethnic Discrimination, The Ombudsman against Discrimination because of Sexual Orientation and the Disability Ombudsman. The delibe- rations concerning the Ombudsmen shall also include in relevant respects the Children’s Ombudsman. According to the Committee directives, our assignment shall be finally reported no later than on 1 July 2005.</p>
<p>Our proposals</p>
<p>Our proposals affect the Equal Opportunities Act (1991:433), the Equal Treatment of Students at Universities Act (2001:1286), and the Prohibition of Discrimination Act (2003:307).</p>
<p>The proposals have primarily two aims. One is to implement EC law in those respects where proposals are presented. The other aim is to improve protection against sex discrimination so that it will be</p>
<p>at the same level as the protection against discrimination connected to the grounds of discrimination ethnic background, religion or other religious faith, disability and sexual orientation, concerning which more extensive legal regulation currently exists than that which applies for sex discrimination. The amendments therefore basically correspond with the legislation that was implemented on 1 July 2003 regarding discrimination related to ethnic background, religion or other religious faith, disability or sexual orientation.</p>
<p>The proposals have in addition the express aim of supporting the efforts towards equality in society. It can also be assumed that they will have effect for this purpose. The legal framework to combat sex discrimination will essentially be equally robust as the current law regarding the other grounds of discrimination. We also antici- pate that the practical effect of the new regulations will contribute to the situation in working life and higher education continuing to approach the equality policy objective that men and women have the same opportunities, rights and obligations.</p>
<p>The Equal Opportunities Act</p>
<p>According to the Equal Opportunities Act, an employer is prohibited from discriminating against job applicants and employees owing to sex. We basically propose the following. Amendments should be made to the definitions of direct and indirect discrimination. An express prohibition against discrimination in the form of harassment owing to sex and sexual harassment should be introduced. Harass- ment owing to sex is defined as ”conduct that violates a job applicant’s or an employee’s dignity and which is related to sex”. Sexual harassment is defined as ”conduct of a sexual nature that violates a job applicant’s or an employee’s dignity”. An express prohibition against sex discrimination in the form of instructions to discriminate should be introduced. Exemptions from the discri- mination prohibition should be changed. According to the new rule, the prohibition against direct discrimination shall not apply to decisions concerning employment, promotion or training for promotion if a particular sex is necessary owing to the nature of the work or the context in which it is performed. The former exemption for ”an ideological or other special interest” shall be</p>
<p>removed from the Act. The current exemption for positive special treatment shall remain unamended in the Act.</p>
<p>The scope of application of the discrimination prohibitions will in material respects be extended to expressly cover working condi- tions. The scope of application of the discrimination prohibitions will in material respects also be extended to cover practical work experience (on-the-job-training), vocational guidance and other training than training for promotion that is provided by an employer for employees. The discrimination prohibition in relation to practical work experience and the prohibition against victimisation will be extended in personal respects to also cover those who, without being employed by the employer, seek or undertake practical work experience at a workplace. The prohibition against victimisation should also apply to rented or borrowed manpower such as personnel from staffing agencies.</p>
<p>The prohibition against victimisation is extended also to apply to complaints of discrimination or participation in an investigation under the Act and also to the situation where an employer exposes an employee to victimisation owing to he or she having reported or complained that the employer does not comply with a provision of the Act concerning active measures.</p>
<p>It should be possible for economic damages to be paid as a sanction for victimisation. It should be possible to adjust or declare invalid discriminatory rules of procedure or similar internal provi- sions at a workplace. It is proposed that the reference to the so- called ‘ceiling rule’ for economic damages contained in the Employment Protection Act (1982:80) be repealed. This amend- ment means that the ceiling rule for economic damages contained in the Employment Protection Act should no longer apply when a party brings proceedings concerning termination or dismissal under the Equal Opportunities Act.</p>
<p>A new, express rule on the burden of proof will be introduced. If anyone who considers that they have been discriminated against or exposed to victimisation adduces facts that give cause to assume that he or she has been discriminated against or exposed to victimisa- tion, it is the employer who should prove that discrimination or victimisation did not occur.</p>
<p>Equal Treatment of Students at Universities Act</p>
<p>According to the Equal Treatment of Students at Universities Act, a university is prohibited from discriminating students and applicants to university. The proposals relating to the Act correspond to a large extent to the proposals for amendments to the Equal Opportunities Act. The proposals entail among other things that the definition of sexual harassment is changed and that the concept of harassment is divided into harassment owing to sex and sexual harassment in the same way as in the Equal Opportunities Act. Harassment owing to sex is defined as ”conduct that violates a student’s or an applicant’s dignity in higher education studies and which is related to sex”. Sexual harassment is defined as ”conduct that violates a student’s or an applicant’s dignity in higher educa- tion studies and which is of a sexual nature”. Rules are also intro- duced concerning a discrimination prohibition relating to practical work experience and vocational guidance. The exemption from the discrimination prohibition for a so-called ‘special interest’ will be repealed. Instead an exemption should be introduced for positive special treatment owing to sex. It is proposed that the prohibition against direct discrimination should not apply if the treatment re- presents a step in the effort to promote equal opportunities for higher education studies irrespective of sex.</p>
<p>The prohibition against victimisation will be extended also to cover complaining of discrimination and the situation that a uni- versity exposes a student or an applicant to victimisation owing to he or she having reported or complained that the university does not comply with any of the provisions of the Act concerning active measures.</p>
<p>The Prohibition of Discrimination Act</p>
<p>The Act contains a discrimination prohibition for discrimination owing to ethnic background, religion or other religious faith, sexual orientation and disability in most areas of society outside working life and higher education. Our proposal is primarily that discrimi- nation owing to sex should be added to the prohibitions applicable regarding labour market policy operations, the start-up and opera- tion of business activities, practising professions, membership etc. of employee organisations or employer organisations and profes-</p>
<p>sional organisations, goods, services and housing, the social insurance and related benefits systems and the unemployment insurance system. Corresponding prohibitions already apply for other grounds of discrimination than sex. The discrimination protection will now be essentially the same for sex. As regards sex discrimination relating to services and housing, an exemption is proposed from the prohibition against discrimination. Exemptions are proposed first for services relating to exercise, health and fitness or the like and housing, provided the services or housing have been provided only for women, second for services relating to the grant of credit, counselling or similar measures to start-up or operate business activities, provided the services have been provided only for women as a step in the effort to promote equality between men and women.</p>
<p>The prohibition against sex discrimination regarding services covers, among other things, insurance services, for example questions concerning premium levels and indemnities provided. In that respect it is proposed that the prohibition only applies to insurance that is taken out or renewed after the Act entered into force.</p>
<p>In the Act, discrimination means direct discrimination, indirect discrimination, harassment and instructions to discriminate. The provisions are amended to the effect that sex is added as a new ground for discrimination in the definitions of direct discrimina- tion, indirect discrimination and harassment. The discrimination prohibition relating to instructions to discriminate is extended also to cover sex. A prohibition against discrimination in the form of sexual harassment is also added to the Act. Sexual harassment means ”conduct of a sexual nature that violates a person’s dignity”.</p>
<p>The rules of the Act concerning supervision and the procedural provisions are amended so that the Equal Opportunities Ombuds- man among other things shall ensure compliance with the prohibi- tion contained in the Act against sex discrimination and is em- powered to bring proceedings at court in cases concerning sex discriminations in the same way as the other ombudsmen are today regarding their respective grounds for discrimination.</p>
<p>Other proposals</p>
<p>It is proposed that the labour law discrimination legislation from 1999 – The Act (1999:130) on measures against discrimination in working life because of ethnic background, religion or other religious faith, Prohibition of Discrimination in Working Life of People because of Disability Act (1999:132), and The Act (1999:133) on a Ban against Discrimination in Working Life because of Sexual Orientation – are amended in certain respects to achieve harmony with the Equal Opportunities Act. In The Act on measures against discrimination in working life because of ethnic background, religion or other religious faith, the prohibition against victimisation is extended also to cover the situation that an employer exposes an employee to victimisation owing to he or she having reported or complained that the employer does not comply with any of the Act’s provisions on active measures.</p>
<p>The scope of application of the discrimination prohibitions in material respects will be extended in all three Acts also to expressly cover working conditions. It should be possible to adjust or declare invalid discriminatory rules of procedure or similar internal pro- visions at a workplace. It is proposed that the reference to the so- called ‘ceiling rule’ for economic damages contained in the Em- ployment Protection Act (1982:80) is repealed. This amendment means that the ceiling rule for economic damages contained in the Employment Protection Act should no longer apply when some- one brings proceedings concerning termination or dismissal under the 1999 legislation.</p>
<p>Consequential amendments are proposed to the Foreign Posting of Employees Act (1999:678) and the Secrecy Act (1980:100).</p>
<p>Finally, we consider that special information and training initia- tives should be implemented concerning the new legislation proposed by us.</p>
<p>Entry into force</p>
<p>It is proposed that these legislative amendments enter into force on 1 July 2005. The proposed date means that the changes contained in the Equal Treatment Directive will be implemented within the prescribed time; the changes contained in the Directive should be implemented no later than 5 October 2005.</p>
