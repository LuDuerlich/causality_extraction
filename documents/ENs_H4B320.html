<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Proposal in brief</h2>
<p>Our remit is to review the possibilities for a government minister to take leave in connection with the birth of a child or an adoption and for a subsequent period, with a view to exercising their parenthood. In the report we present three models that could be used as a basis for a minister’s absence to stay at home with their child. It is always ultimately the Prime Minister who decides whether such leave can be granted and what form it will take. The three models we propose are as follows:  The Prime Minister appoints a substitute from the list of alternates.  The Prime Minister appoints one or more substitutes via an ‘Article 5 order’.  The Prime Minister appoints a new government minister.</p>
<p>In all of these cases, the government minister’s political staff would, as a general rule, retain their positions during the minister’s absence. Under the latter two models, the minister’s remuneration would be reduced by ten per cent. In our assessment, these models fit within existing regulatory frameworks and could be applied immediately. Nonetheless, it is proposed that a provision on reductions of a minister’s remuneration be introduced to the Act on Remuneration for Government Ministers etc. (1991:359). In the case of models two or three, the Prime Minister would take a formal decision approving leave. The decision would be entered in the Prime Minister’s minutes.</p>
<p>The Parliamentary Committee on the Constitution has stated on several occasions that a government minister is, in principle, always expected to be on duty. Because a minister is not an employee in the labour law sense of the term, he or she does not, unlike employees covered by the Parental Leave Act (1995:584), have any formal right to parental leave. Nonetheless, ministers who were parents when they assumed office, or become parents in the course of their service, have to varying degrees tried to find solutions to enable them to reconcile their duties as minister with spending at least some time at home with their children. On those occasions, a minister who wanted to spend more time with their child has informally reduced the intensity of their work and been substituted at certain government meetings using the list of alternates. The minister’s state secretary has generally taken on additional responsibility for some of the minister’s duties.</p>
<p>Naturally, a government minister is at all times free to request to be relieved of office to enable them to take care of their child. However, we feel that a minister should not have to ask to be relieved of office in all such situations. Instead, there should be more explicit possibilities for a minister to take full-time or parttime leave for this purpose. It may be noted that for several years now, members of the Riksdag have had the possibility to take parental leave in accordance with the provisions of the Riksdag Act (2014:801). If we look to our Nordic neighbours, we also see that Norwegian government ministers have established procedures for parental leave, laid down via a royal resolution.</p>
<p>The duties of a government minister are very singular in nature. They must be prepared at all times to act on the issues for which they have main responsibility, and on issues concerning the</p>
<p>Government’s policy as a whole. As the Prime Minister has a more or less sovereign right to decide in matters of ministers’ service, it</p>
<p>is always ultimately the Prime Minister who decides whether a minister may be absent to any extent to take care of their child.</p>
<p>Given the nature of a minister’s duties, however, we feel it would be difficult for a minister to be absent for anything other than a short period of time. Some ministerial posts may even be of such a nature that they afford very little, if any, scope for absence to take care of children. Nor do we consider that there can be any question of a ‘right’ to parental leave corresponding to that of employees under the Parental Leave Act. Instead, we have identified three models for the form a minister’s absence to take care of their child could take. In our assessment, all of these models fit within existing regulatory frameworks. The model can be chosen based on the circumstances in the individual case. When designing the models, we sought to ensure that the conditions of remuneration for ministers would, as far as possible, be the same as those that apply to an employee on parental leave, with the proviso that the issue of remuneration should be regulated in the Act on Remuneration to Government Ministers etc. rather than through the regulations in the Social Insurance Code (2010:110). In brief, the models are as follows.</p>
<p>– The Prime Minister appoints a substitute from the list of alternates</p>
<p>A government minister who wants to temporarily reduce their workload and also abstain from attending certain government meetings so as to take care of their child can be substituted by another minister, primarily from the list of alternates. The minister in question is still a member of the Government and is thus accountable to the Riksdag in accordance with Chapter 1, Article 6 of the Instrument of Government. The substitute minister is constitutionally responsible for the decisions he or she prepares, or takes as part of the Government. The positions of state secretaries and political staff associated with the minister are not affected. Nor is the amount of the minister’s remuneration affected.</p>
<p>– The Prime Minister appoints one or more substitutes via an</p>
<p>‘Article 5 order’</p>
<p>A government minister who wishes to reduce their workload more than occasionally, as much as full-time or part-time, to take care of their child can be replaced by the Prime Minister</p>
<p>suspending their appointment as head of ministry (where applicable) and/or their Article 5 order and instead, where necessary, appointing another minister as head of ministry and appointing one or more substitutes via Article 5 orders. The minister in question is still a member of the Government and is thus accountable to the Riksdag in accordance with Chapter 1, Article 6 of the Instrument of Government. The minister or ministers substituting for him or her are constitutionally responsible for the decisions they prepare, or take as part of the Government. As a general rule, the state secretary associated with the minister in question retains his or her position, but works for the minister’s substitute during their absence. The same applies to other members of their political staff. The remuneration paid to the absent minister is reduced such that they receive 90 per cent of their ordinary remuneration during their absence. Any pay supplements and compensation for accommodation costs are not reduced.</p>
<p>– The Prime Minister appoints a new government minister</p>
<p>A government minister who wishes to reduce their workload full-time to take care of their child may, if the Prime Minister does not feel that they should be relieved of office, be replaced through the appointment of a new minister by the Prime Minister. In this context, the new minister can be appointed alongside the absent minister and present matters and take decisions in their stead. It is also possible that the Prime Minister may wish, temporarily or otherwise, to reallocate the ministers’ areas of responsibility. The new minister can then instead take over another existing minister’s area of responsibility and present matters and take decisions in their stead, while the other existing minister takes over the absent minister’s area of responsibility and presents matters and takes decisions in their stead. If the absent minister is head of a ministry, the Prime Minister may appoint another head of ministry. This may also be necessary if another existing minister, who is also head of a ministry, takes over the absent minister’s area of responsibility. The absent minister is still a member of the Government and is thus accountable to the Riksdag in accordance with Chapter 1, Article 6 of the Instrument of Government. The new minister is constitutionally responsible for the decisions he or she prepares,</p>
<p>or takes part in. As a general rule, all of the state secretaries concerned retain their positions. The same applies to other members of political staff. The remuneration paid to the absent minister is reduced such that they receive 90 per cent of their ordinary remuneration during their absence. Any pay supplements and compensation for accommodation costs are not reduced. The substitute minister should normally be relieved of office when the absent minister returns from leave. However, this is a matter for the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>In all cases it is thus the Prime Minister who decides whether a government minister is allowed to take leave or reduce their workload to take care of their child and, if so, what form this will take. It is also up to the Prime Minister to decide on any practical issues that may arise. We believe that the model whereby the Prime Minister appoints a substitute from the list of alternates is the one that will be used most. This is also how ministers’ absence to take care of their children seems to have been dealt with up to now. We do not believe that the model whereby the Prime Minister appoints one or more substitutes via Article 5 orders will be used particularly frequently. The model whereby the Prime Minister appoints a new minister will, in our estimation, be used even less frequently, if at all. In the event that a minister seeks leave from the work of government for longer than a brief period, the Prime Minister would probably have to choose to relieve the minister in question of office.</p>
