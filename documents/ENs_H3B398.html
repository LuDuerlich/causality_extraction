<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The goal of the Inquiry is to propose ways of improving highly specialised care in terms of equality, access and quality assurance. Our proposal aims at enabling progress by means of greater coordination at the national level. This report presents new statistics demonstrating that hundreds of lives would be saved every year if the highly specialised care were more centralised.</p>
<h2>Starting with the best interests of the patients in mind</h2>
<p>Our Inquiry and proposals are based on the provisions of the Health and Medical Services Act to the effect that patients are entitled to top-quality highly specialised care regardless of where in the country they live.</p>
<p>If it had been up to patients, a much larger percentage of highly specialised care would already be consolidated at a smaller number of hospitals and units than is currently the case. Patients emphasise, however, that the entire chain of care must be taken into consideration. They feel that consolidation is essential if high-quality, safe and equal access to care is to be maintained throughout the system. Both questionnaires and meetings with patient representatives have made this clear.</p>
<p>We do not see any contradiction between adopting a system of national providers in the area of highly specialised care and coordinating the chain of care such that as many services as possible are provided either regionally or locally. The absence of a structure that assumes full responsibility for a patient’s interactions with the healthcare system at all levels is the Achilles heel of the services available in Sweden. Structuring highly specialised care at the national level can set the stage for putting together national programmes and standardised pathways for patients. Multiprofessional conferences, online diagnosis and treatment, and other telemedicine approaches are additional tools that should be used to a greater extent in order to simplify a patient’s ongoing relationship with the healthcare system.</p>
<h2>Greater consolidation will boost quality and patient safety</h2>
<p>Progress is slow, despite the general consensus about the benefits and necessity of more fully structuring highly specialised care at the national and regional levels. According to analyses performed by the Inquiry, there has been little consolidation of highly specialised care over the past 14 years. For example, 14.6 per cent of complicated operations in 2000 were performed at hospitals with a caseload of fewer than 20 per year. The 2013 figure was 13 per cent. In other words, not much has changed in terms of the number of hospitals that performed only a few such procedures.</p>
<p>Our perception is that the county councils are looking for persuasive arguments in favour of greater consolidation, as well as help in prioritising and moving in that direction. The Inquiry would like to state the following reasons that highly specialised care needs to be more clearly structured at the national and regional levels.</p>
<p>• Quality and safety improve when the number of patients increases per hospital and care provider. Both systematic reviews of the scientific literature and our analyses of data on the Swedish healthcare system point to that conclusion.</p>
<p>• Practice makes perfect, and both doctors and other professionals need to maintain their skills if patients are to experience the best possible outcomes. Only if hospitals and providers can treat larger numbers of patients than the current structure of the Swedish healthcare system permits, will such a state of affairs come about.</p>
<p>• Our statistical analyses indicate that at least 500 deaths could be avoided every year, the number of complications decrease and wait times reduced if there were an increase to at least 100 of a particular type of procedure at Swedish hospitals. Given that the situation has been more or less static over the past decade, thousands of avoidable deaths have demonstrably occurred. For that reason, the Inquiry suggests that hospitals at least perform 50–100 procedures and that key professionals perform at least 30 procedures every year.</p>
<p>• The quality of clinical research will also improve when hospitals and care providers treat larger numbers of patients. A stimulating setting is dependent on a critical mass of healthcare professionals who are interested in research, as well as other skilled academicians and scientists – hospitals that perform fewer procedures do not always have access to that kind of expertise.</p>
<h2>Main proposal: A new national knowledge and decision-making structure is required</h2>
<p>We are proposing a new knowledge and decision-making structure for highly specialised care at the national level. Such structuring would involve conscious sharing of responsibility among various hospitals and clinics for the various contributions to the care process.</p>
<p>The idea is for our proposal to replace the current National Specialised Medical Care (Rikssjukvården) system and the national structure for consolidate cancer care. The drafting and decisionmaking process for National Specialised Medical Care has been timeconsuming and inefficient in relation to the number of approved authorisations. The lack of a comprehensive perspective has exacerbated this inefficiency. National coordination of cancer care has also turned out to be limited and relatively slow in the absence of a joint decision-making body for the county councils. From a management perspective, it is unfortunate that National Specialised Medical Care and coordination of cancer care have evolved along two separate tracks.</p>
<p>Defining highly specialised care</p>
<p>A key aspect of the new proposal is the definition of highly specialised care suggested by the Inquiry.</p>
<p>Highly specialised care is complex or infrequent health care provided by county councils and requiring both a certain number of procedures and interdisciplinary expertise, as well as major investment or substantial expense, in order to maintain quality, patient safety and knowledge acquisition while ensuring that resources are used in an efficient manner. Highly specialised care can be broken down to the national and regional levels.</p>
<p>National highly specialised care is to be provided nationwide but not in each of the six healthcare region. Our estimates show that the national level of highly specialised care may include 4–5 per cent of all inpatient services.</p>
<p>Regional highly specialised care, which may include 10–15 per cent of inpatient services, is to be provided in each healthcare region but at a limited number of hospitals and units.</p>
<p>We have included the regional level in our definition based on the assessment that not only the most complicated health care would benefit from consolidation and the consequent coordination and management.</p>
<p>Give the National Board of Health and Welfare responsibility for the knowledge and decision-making structure</p>
<p>We propose that the National Board of Health and Welfare be assigned more specific responsibility for advocacy, coordination and decision-making when it comes to the type of services that need to be consolidated. Greater consolidation of highly specialised care requires a national body entrusted with coordinating and proactive decision-making authority.</p>
<p>Many of the representatives of county councils, hospitals, patients and healthcare professionals whom we met with during the course of the Inquiry share our analysis.</p>
<p>Appoint a number of expert panels to analyse and propose the parameters of highly specialised care</p>
<p>The initial analytical phase is decisive to the extent to which highly specialised care can be structured at the national and regional levels. Such data will concern the types of services that need to be consolidated. A systematic review of all specialised health care will set the stage for developing a comprehensive view of healthcare services. The result will be better coordination of care chains and more efficient use of professional and financial resources.</p>
<p>Representatives of patients and healthcare professionals are best positioned to identify the types of services that need to be consolidated. We propose the appointment of expert panels consisting of representatives of patients and healthcare professionals. During a specific period, they will review all specialised health care and determine the types of care that need to be consolidated at the national and regional levels. They will proceed from the above definition of highly specialised care.</p>
<p>Allow the National Board of Health and Welfare to assume responsibility for national scope and monitoring while the county councils are in charge of regional allocation</p>
<p>We propose that the National Board of Health and Welfare be assigned the responsibility of determining the types of services that are to be regarded as national highly specialised care. The Board will then be in charge of the ongoing consolidation process for national highly specialised care by inviting the county councils to apply for providing it.</p>
<p>The Board’s Committee for National Highly Specialised Care will make the decision as to the hospitals that are authorised to provide national highly specialised care. The Committee will consist of representatives of the county councils.</p>
<p>The Board will turn the data collected by the expert panels concerning regional highly specialised care over to the county councils in the form of recommendations. The recommendations will discuss the numbers of procedures and the types of expertise that are required for the services that need to be consolidated in each healthcare region. The county councils will be responsible for structuring highly specialised care at the regional level and the manner in which the recommendations are to be implemented both locally and regionally.</p>
<p>The Board will also be in charge of monitoring national and regional highly specialised care. One basic tool will be feedback and publication of quality data for highly specialised care on a joint website.</p>
<p>We suggest that our main proposal will be implemented by amending the Health and Medical Services Act, adopting a new ordinance concerning highly specialized care and amending the ordinance of instructions for the National Board of Health and Welfare, all of which should enter into force on 1 January 2018.</p>
<h2>Structuring of highly specialised care at the national and regional levels will improve services</h2>
<p>Structuring of highly specialised care at the national and regional levels should not be regarded as an isolated measure but rather as integral to management by knowledge and a facilitator of redistribution of regions, county councils and other organisational structures.</p>
<p>The initial review of all specialised health care to be conducted by expert panels, will pave the way for providing better, safer and more cohesive services. The allocation of responsibility among providers and care levels will be more clear-cut and the data can form the basis of national care programmes.</p>
<p>Our definition of highly specialised care highlights the need for robust healthcare regions or larger and fewer organisations that can provide regional services. Greater consolidation of highly specialised care also creates incentive and potential to overhaul current structures at other care levels, emergency services in particular.</p>
<h2>Other proposals of the Inquiry</h2>
<p>In addition to our main proposal of a new national knowledge and decision-making structure for highly specialised care, we have identified a number of measures that would simplify consolidation of these services and improve coordination of the chain of care available to a patient. Following are some of our proposals.</p>
<p>• Fewer providers in terms of larger regions will facilitate structuring of highly specialised care at the regional level.  The current review committee is working on proposing redistribution of regions and county councils that can promote structuring of highly specialised health care at the regional level and enable organisations to provide these services on their own.</p>
<p>• Quality data should be available to the general public.  Transparent presentation of the number of procedures that are being performed and medical quality data for highly specialised care should be quickly developed such that patients, other citizens and professionals have access to information about performance and efficiency. Data concerning the number of procedures or treatments provided per hospital or unit should always be presented. Information about the number of particular types of procedures that have been performed by each provider should be added to patient administration systems or quality registers. Heads of departments should have the ability to monitor results in the quality registers with respect to mortality and complications for all providers at the individual level.</p>
<p>• Highly specialised care requires national pricing agreements.  The county councils should coordinate pricing for highly specialised care in order to ensure that consolidation works and benefits patients. The current payment systems and regional pricing agreements are meeting the needs of neither the purchasing nor billing county council and are obstructing the effort to structure highly specialised care and patient mobility across county councils such that they have less access to the best possible services.</p>
<p>• An inquiry is needed concerning structuring of emergency services at the regional level.  A special inquiry is needed in order to review needs and propose ways of restructuring emergency services at the regional level. Highly specialised care must be structured such that emergency services can also be provided in a qualitative, safe and efficient manner. Greater consolidation of highly specialised care, particularly at the regional level, will impact emergency services as well. When individual hospitals no longer offer certain procedures due to structuring of highly specialised care at the national and regional levels, they will lose some of their expertise. Depending on the extent to which the services</p>
<p>offered by a local hospital change, it will be differently positioned to treat patients in its emergency room. It may be difficult to ensure quality emergency services if they are not taken into consideration when highly specialised care is structured at the regional level. Such a dynamic mechanism may pose an obstacle to greater consolidation of highly specialised care. The scientific literature makes it clear that emergency services also require a critical mass of patients if they are to be provided in a manner that guarantees safety, efficiency and high quality.</p>
<p>• National standards and other requirements are needed in order to improve the kinds of technical solutions that support telemedicine tools . Implementation of the electronic health committee’s proposal for enforcing national standards and other requirements designed to improve technical communication solutions is also crucial. Telemedicine tools such as videoconferencing and online diagnosis and treatment will permit the provision of sophisticated care on a remote basis without requiring either the patient or team of specialists to travel while maintaining sufficient numbers of procedures. The full benefits of telemedicine cannot manifest in the absence of a fair and equitable technical infrastructure that enables communication among providers and among county councils. The county councils currently use various technical applications, which makes any attempt to communicate among themselves that much more difficult.</p>
