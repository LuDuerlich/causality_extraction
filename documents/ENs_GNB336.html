<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In this interim report the Company Law Committee examines two matters, namely companies which do not have a board of directors and the solvent liquidation of companies.</p>
<p>Companies which do not have a Board Of Directors</p>
<p>Clearly, a company without a board of directors to represent it creates significant problems for the company’s creditors. The government has instructed the Committee to consider what measures are needed in order to deal with such problems. So far as concerns companies which have no registered board of directors whatsoever, the Committee was instructed to consider reinforcing the provisions of the Companies Act relating to solvent liquidation by reducing the relevant time limits stipulated therein. The Committee was also instructed to consider the adoption of provisions making it possible for companies which have existed without a board for an extended period to be placed into solvent liquidation, notwithstanding that the company appoints a board once liquidation proceedings have been commenced. The Committee is at liberty to consider other alternatives.</p>
<h2>Can the periods of time in the liquidation process be reduced?</h2>
<p>Notice procedure</p>
<p>Where a company, according to the Companies Register, has not had a board of directors for an extended period, the Companies Registrar ( Patent- och registreringsverket ) initiates its procedure with a formal notice issued by ordinary mail stating that the company’s board does not meet the requirements of the Companies Act and that the company should give notice of the appointment of sufficient new board members such that the board is once again quorate. The six week period usually stipulated by the Companies Registrar in such a notice is not especially long and has been chosen on the basis of the period of time required to convene and hold a meeting of the shareholders. As a result, the period cannot realistically be made any shorter. The notice procedure is reasonably effective taking account of the limited burden it places on the public administration. In 60% of cases the notice is sufficient to get the company to take remedial action. The Committee does not, therefore, regard it as necessary to change the present notice procedure.</p>
<p>Order to show cause</p>
<p>If a company, having received a notice requiring remedial action, fails to file notice of the appointment of a quorate board within the time specified, the Companies Registrar goes a step further and issues an order requiring the company and its shareholders and creditors, within a specified time, to file a statement showing cause as to why the company should not be placed into solvent liquidation. The period of time is determined by the Companies Registrar with reference to the requirement that the order be gazetted in the Government Gazette ( Post- och Inrikes Tidningar ) not less than two and not more than four months prior to expiry of the specified time. The minimum time for the filing of the statement is thus just over two months. According to the Companies Registrar’s practice, the time is as a rule fixed at two and a half months, which together with the notice period of six weeks means that a company without a quorate board is normally placed into solvent liquidation a little more than four months after the commencement of the procedure by the Companies Registrar.</p>
<p>The procedure to place a company into solvent liquidation for a matter as serious as not having a quorate board of directors should not, in the Committee’s view, take as long as it does under the present legislation and according to the Companies Registrar’s current practises.</p>
<p>The Committee therefore suggests that the time for filing the statement specified in the Act should be fixed at a maximum of one month. A company which does not have a board could then be placed into solvent liquidation after six weeks plus one month, i.e. just over two months from the commencement of the procedure. This involves a fifty per cent reduction of the period presently required.</p>
<p>Gazetting of the order</p>
<p>The minimum time for the order stipulated in the Companies Act is determined with reference to the day of gazetting in the Government Gazette. An issue arises as to whether it is possible to abolish the gazetting procedure.</p>
<p>The Committee’s response to this question is in the negative. The risk of a company being placed into solvent liquidation can have a significant impact on the company’s shareholders and creditors. These parties must be afforded an opportunity of ensuring that the company is not liquidated without their knowledge. Such knowledge can be acquired through reading the Government Gazette. In the absence of the gazetting procedure, there is no other equally simple and cheap method to facilitate this supervision. The abolition of the gazetting procedure is, accordingly, not realistic.</p>
<p>Service of the order</p>
<p>It has not been established that the current practices relating to service of the order give rise to any significant problems. It is also clearly reasonable that an order in such an important matter as the involuntary solvent liquidation of the company be served on the company. Accordingly, the Committee does not suggest any changes relating to the obligation to serve the order on the company or the manner in which service is effected.</p>
<h2>The involuntary solvent liquidation of the company should be capable of being carried to conclusion irrespective of the fact that the company appoints a new board</h2>
<p>According to the Companies Register, companies sometimes exist during an extended period without having a board of directors. When the Companies Registrar initiates solvent liquidation proceedings against such a company, the company will file notice of appointment of a quorate board for registration, whereupon the Companies Registrar discontinues and terminates the liquidation proceedings. As soon as the decision has been adopted to terminate the proceedings, the new board resigns and the company files a notice to this effect, so that the company once again is without a board of directors. The Companies Registrar commences new solvent liquidation proceedings at the risk of the matter concluding in the same manner. It is in light of this practise that the Committee has been instructed to examine whether it should be possible in such circumstances to carry the liquidation proceedings to conclusion, notwithstanding that the company files notice of appointment of a new board.</p>
<p>The available statistical evidence indicates, however, that there are only a very few companies, amounting to less than one per cent of all companies, which exist without a board for an extended period. There is also evidence supporting an assumption that companies without a board, or with a non-quorate board, only rarely are associated with corporate piracy or other forms of economic crime. In most cases, there is a natural explanation for registered companies not having a quorate board, namely death.</p>
<p>The Companies Registrar regularly receives information on deaths from SPAR and deregisters individuals who have passed away. There are approximately 200,000 companies where the board consists of a single member and a single deputy. Where one of these individuals dies, a new member or deputy must be appointed to the board and notice of such appointment filed with the Companies Registrar for registration. It is not safe to assume that deputies or the beneficiaries of the deceased always are aware of this and, under prevailing circumstances, immediately take the steps prescribed by the Companies Act. It is worth noting in this context that the application for probate does not need to be made immediately, but only within three months from the date of death. A provision to the effect that a company which, according the Companies Register, has not had a board of directors for three consecutive months must be placed into solvent liquidation irrespective of the fact that notice of appointment of a new board is filed during the course of the insolvency proceedings would, in the Committee’s opinion, have a disproportionately severe impact on sole traders and closely held companies.</p>
<p>On the basis of the above, the Committee does not submit a proposal for solvent liquidation of companies which according to the Companies Register have existed without a board for an extended period.</p>
<h2>The issue of registered board members who dishonestly assert that they have resigned</h2>
<p>A report from the Office of the Public Prosecutor submitted to the government asserts that it is common for individuals who are recorded in the Companies Register as directors allege that they in fact resigned prior to a specified critical point in time and that they cannot, as a result, be held liable for actions taken thereafter in the company’s name. On occasion, falsified minutes of a shareholders’ meeting or a board meeting are tendered in support of the allegation. In order to rectify the problem the Office of the Public Prosecutor submitted that changes in the composition of the board should first take effect upon registration of the changes with the Companies Registrar. The</p>
<p>Committee has been instructed to examine whether there are any problems associated with the proposed solution.</p>
<p>The Companies Act contains provisions on the legal effects of registration. The purpose of these provisions is to protect third parties which enter into relations with a company and must be able to assume that individuals who are registered as representatives of the company are also authorised to bind the company. The provisions were, in other words, designed to facilitate day-to-day business and are silent as to any sanctions that might be imposed on a negligent or criminal representative.</p>
<p>That an individual is registered as a member of the board at the time a particular action is taken on behalf of the company constitutes, in the Committee’s opinion, a matter which supports the individual being responsible for the action, but the burden falls upon the party prosecuting the action for damages or the imposition of a criminal sanction to establish that such is in fact the case. The evidential value of registration should not, in the Committee’s view, be overemphasised. Other evidence, in the form of minutes of board meetings, contractual and other documents indicating which individual or individuals participated in adopting the disputed decision or in taking the action in question, should be decisive.</p>
<p>A system whereby responsibility as a board member starts and finishes with registration in the Companies Register would undoubtedly be inclined to create certainty as to how the board was composed from time to time, but would in the Committee’s view give rise to a number of practical difficulties.</p>
<p>Thus, all companies would be required immediately in conjunction with the election of board members to file notice of which members had been elected and which had resigned. Late notice would give rise to problems in conjunction with decisions adopted by the new board, since the old board would remain registered and in a legal sense competent to adopt decisions in the company’s name. More or less every company would experience these problems given that directors are normally elected at the annual shareholders’ meeting and, by tradition, the new board will convene for its constitutive meeting immediately after the conclusion of the shareholders’ meeting. Obviously, if the constitutive board meeting is held so soon after the election of the directors, the Companies Registrar will not have time to register the new board before the meeting is closed.</p>
<p>The most significant problem arises however, where a member of the board resigns prematurely. Currently the appointment terminates immediately upon notice of resignation being tendered to the board. The company is responsible for filing notice of resignation and the outgoing director is entitled him or herself to file notice. According to the proposed rule, the director would remain responsible until such time as notice of the resignation was registered in the Companies Register. This would have consequences for the individual wishing to resign. Assume that a member of the board during a board meeting decides that he or she does not wish to remain on the board since the majority is prepared to adopt a decision with respect to a matter which he or she regards as directly contrary to the law. The dissenting director forthwith gives notice of resignation during the course of meeting and thereafter leaves the meeting. The director files notice of his or her resignation to the Companies Registrar and the change is registered some weeks later.</p>
<p>Clearly it should be impossible for the resigning director in this example to be held criminally liable for the decision adopted by the board after he left the room. Nor should he or she be liable in damages for the same decision pursuant to the Companies Act. The resigning director should not be burdened with liability for either intentional nor negligent conduct. But what of the director’s liability if the board after his or her departure from the room adopts a decision not to pay preliminary tax on the prescribed date and that date falls prior to registration of the director’s resignation? And what if the remaining directors breach the provisions of Chapter 13, Section 2 of the Companies Act which prescribes the actions necessary in the event the company lacks the required capital adequacy for its share capital? Or fails to file the company’s annual report within the prescribed time?</p>
<p>So far as the Committee is concerned, it is clear that if provisions are to be introduced according to which an appointment as director starts and finishes with registration, a mechanism must be established linking these to responsibility for the company’s future liability in the event of breaches of the type referred to. Such responsibility exists today, but the responsibility must be refined somewhat if the new provisions are to function properly. Obviously it must remain possible for a member of the board to resign and absolve him or herself from further liability through immediately filing notice of resignation with the Companies Registrar. If, however, both the director and the company fail to file such notice, the director together with the remaining members of the board must be responsible for the company’s pending responsibilities. Clearly the results of this can be perceived as unfair in specific cases.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, the Committee is of the view that the benefits of the proposed solution do not outweigh the disadvantages. The Committee therefore does not submit any proposal to the effect that changes in the composition of the board should first take effect upon filing of notice or registration of the changes with the Companies Registrar.</p>
<p>Solvent liquidation</p>
<p>A company can be wound up, inter alia, through solvent liquidation. This can take the form either of voluntary or involuntary solvent liquidation.</p>
<h2>Voluntary solvent liquidation</h2>
<p>That the shareholders should be able to wind up the affairs of the company if they so wish is self evident. A decision to place the company into voluntary solvent liquidation is adopted under the current legislation by a simple majority of the shareholders’ meeting. The Committee does not suggest any changes to this procedure.</p>
<p>The current legislation does not prescribe what material should be available when the shareholders are considering a motion to place the company into voluntary solvent liquidation. The Committee suggests amendments in this regard applying the model used in the provisions relating to increases and reductions of share capital.</p>
<h2>Involuntary solvent liquidation as a result of capital inadequacy</h2>
<p>An important element of the liquidation provisions contained in the Companies Act relates to involuntary solvent liquidation as a result of capital inadequacy. In brief, the provisions provide that the board, as soon as there is reason to believe that the company’s shareholder’s equity is less than half of the registered share capital must immediately prepare a special balance sheet and as soon as possible submit a question to the shareholders’ meeting as to whether the company should be placed into involuntary solvent liquidation. If the shareholders’ meeting resolves that the company should continue to trade, the shareholders must, within eight months from its resolution to this effect, contribute additional capital to cover the shortfall. If the shareholders’ meeting fails within this period to establish through the preparation of a further special balance sheet that the shareholders’ equity covers the full amount of the registered share capital, the company is obliged to go into involuntary solvent liquidation. If the shareholders’ meeting does not resolve to place the company into liquidation, the board is obliged to file an application for liquidation with the court. Such an application can also be filed by a single member of the board, the managing director, auditor or a shareholder. Members of the board who fail to comply with the act are personally liable for the obligations of the company accruing after such failure. The same applies to shareholders who, despite being aware of the obligation to place the company into liquidation participate in a decision to the effect that the company is to continue trading.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s view it remains highly desirable, in the interests of the company’s creditors, to fix a threshold defining how low the shareholders’ equity should be permitted to fall before the company will be forced to cease trading and be placed into liquidation. The Committee therefore suggests that the Companies Act continue to contain provisions relating to involuntary solvent liquidation as a result of capital inadequacy. Certain minor amendments should however be made with respect to the provisions concerning the special balance sheet and personal liability for payments.</p>
<p>So far as concerns the special balance sheet, the Committee suggests that the Companies Act prescribe that the balance sheet should be prepared on the basis of applicable law relating to the preparation of annual reports and that the following adjustments be made relating to the valuation of items taken up in the balance sheet: 1. Assets may be valued at their disposal value or, so far as concerns plant and equipment which are subject to normal depreciation, at their acquisition value reduced by necessary depreciation and any amount to be  written-down. 2. Debts relating to government subsidies with respect to which the liability to repay is dependent upon the company’s financial wherewithal may be excluded from the special balance sheet, provided that the subsidy – in the event the company is placed into insolvent liquidation (U.S. bankruptcy) or solvent liquidation – is subordinated to the other debts of the company, i.e. is to be repaid first when the other debts of the company have been repaid. 3. Debts relating to payment of future tax may be taken up at current value. 4. Untaxed reserves shall be split up into equity capital and debts relating to payment of future tax. 5. Pension liabilities which, according to generally accepted accounting practices, could have been excluded from the annual report but which are taken up as a debt in the balance sheet, need not be taken up in the special balance sheet. This does not apply, however, to liabilities reported under the heading ”Allocated to pensions” and which may not be reduced according to Section 7 of the Pension Obligation Guarantee Act (SFS 1967:531).</p>
<p>The list is intended to be exhaustive. The sanctions which may be imposed in the event of a failure to prepare the special balance sheet and a failure to place the company into involuntary solvent liquidation in the event of capital inadequacy are far reaching and accordingly require clear and simple rules in order to avoid any legal uncertainty.</p>
<p>If the members of the board fail to comply with the obligations relating to involuntary solvent liquidation imposed on them in the event of capital inadequacy, they are jointly and severally liable for any obligations of the company, irrespective of whether the company’s creditors have suffered any loss as a result of this failure. The Committee suggests that the Companies Act explicitly indicate which instances of failure are intended in this context, namely: that  the board fails, notwithstanding that the relevant criteria have been met, to prepare a special balance sheet in the manner prescribed; that  the board fails to convene the first extraordinary meeting of the shareholders, despite the fact that the special balance sheet discloses that the shareholders’ equity is less that half the registered share capital; that  the board fails to convene the second extraordinary meeting of the shareholders within the prescribed time of eight months; and, that  the board fails to apply to the court for an order that the company be placed into involuntary solvent liquidation, notwithstanding that the second extraordinary meeting of the shareholders has not approved a special balance sheet confirming that the shareholders’ equity is fully covered.</p>
<p>In accordance with the practice of the Supreme Court, the Committee further suggests that the text of the act be expressed in such a way that it clearly states that personal liability only arises if the company’s shareholders’ equity at the relevant point in time in fact has fallen below the critical threshold.</p>
<p>So far as concerns the issue of when the personal liability of the members of the board ceases, the current text stipulates that personal liability does not extend to obligations arising once the issue of involuntary solvent liquidation has been submitted to the court for a decision or once a special balance sheet, showing that the company’s shareholders’ equity corresponds to the registered share capital, has been examined by the auditors and approved by the shareholders’ meeting. Other events may also serve to terminate the period of liability. If the company is placed into liquidation, the obligations of the company arising thereafter should not burden members of the board who have left their post in favour of the liquidators. The Committee suggests that this be expressed in the act.</p>
<p>According to current law, not only members of the board but also ”third parties” acting on behalf of the company can be held personally liable. On a strict interpretation of the act, liability could be imposed not only on the managing director, but also on an external authorised signatory of the company. The Committee suggests that in this regard there should be correlation between the group of individuals who may be held personally liable and those individuals who are able to absolve themselves of liability by themselves applying for involuntary solvent liquidation. The Committee therefore suggests that, apart from members of the board, only the managing director as representative for the company be subject to personal liability.</p>
<h2>Involuntary solvent liquidation as a result of abuse of power by the shareholders</h2>
<p>The Companies Act also contains provisions concerning involuntary solvent liquidation as a result of shareholders’ abuse of power. As an alternative to liquidation the act prescribes the compulsory purchase of the minority shareholders’ shares. The Committee is of the view that these provisions, designed to protect the interests of minority shareholders, should also be taken up in the new act. On the basis of experience from the so called ”Trustor affair” the Committee suggests that these provisions be supplemented with an opportunity for the court, under certain circumstances to be stipulated in the act, to be able immediately to appoint a trustee to run the affairs of the company until the issue of liquidation has been finally resolved.</p>
<h2>Other grounds for involuntary solvent liquidation</h2>
<p>The act also contains provisions dealing with other circumstances where the company must be placed into liquidation, not as a result of a decision of the shareholders’ meeting, but pursuant to an order of the court or of the Companies Registrar.</p>
<p>Among those circumstances which may lead to the involuntary solvent liquidation of the company pursuant to an order of the Companies Registrar, attention is drawn to the situation where the company lacks a quorate board, or a duly appointed managing director or auditor. The Committee suggests that these provisions be expanded to embrace the situation where the company lacks an officer who can accept service of process and other documents, which is now a requirement where the company does not have an authorised representative domiciled in Sweden.</p>
<h2>Dissolution through expungement from the Companies Register</h2>
<p>The Companies Act presently contains a provision on dissolution through expungement from the Companies Register. The provision presupposes that no notices relating to the company have been filed with the Companies Registrar during the last ten years. Given that the Companies Registrar is now obliged to monitor whether or not companies file annual reports each year and to commence proceedings for the solvent liquidation of companies in the event that this obligation is not complied with, the provision relating to expungement hardly bears practical relevance any longer. The Committee therefore suggests that this provision be deleted from the Companies Act.</p>
<h2>Dissolution following insolvent liquidation (U.S. Bankruptcy)</h2>
<p>The Companies Act contains certain provision relating to the dissolution of companies after insolvent liquidation.</p>
<p>A company shall be deemed to have been dissolved if insolvent liquidation proceedings have taken place and concluded without a surplus, so called deficit insolvent liquidation . The result is that the company, after the completion of the insolvent liquidation, has no legal capacity. The relevant practice in the area has, however, given rise to various exceptions from this general rule so far as concerns legal acts which are necessary to complete the winding up of the company and other specific matters. The Committee has not regarded it as the Committee’s task to examine the extent to which this practise should result in legislation. It is, in the Committee’s view, a matter that should be resolved in a litigious context rather than through a review of the Companies Act.</p>
<p>Another problem in the context of deficit insolvent liquidations is that there may, after conclusion of the insolvent liquidation proceedings, remain assets which were not covered by the insolvent liquidation. Such a situation can arise for example where the estate of the company in liquidation has not exercised its right to assume the debtor’s cause of action in pending litigious proceedings, relating to property which belongs to the estate in liquidation or claims which can be asserted in the liquidation. The situation is in many respects comparable to a surplus insolvent liquidation, which itself constitutes grounds for solvent liquidation. The Committee suggests that the same mechanism be adopted in the event that assets which are not covered</p>
<p>by an insolvent liquidation are disposed of following the dissolution of the company through insolvent liquidation.</p>
<p>The Companies Act’s starting point with respect to surplus insolvent liquidation is that the company should be dissolved after conclusion of the insolvent liquidation proceedings. According to current law, the shareholders’ meeting must decide within one month from the conclusion of the insolvent liquidation proceedings whether the company is to be placed into solvent liquidation. In the event the shareholders’ meeting fails to adopt such a decision, the Companies Registrar is obliged to order that the company be placed into involuntary solvent liquidation. The Committee suggests that the prevailing general rule be retained, but that an option be provided in the act for the shareholders’ meeting to decide in this situation that the liquidation shall be terminated, always subject to the auditor certifying that the company’s shareholders’ equity corresponds to the registered share capital and that no distribution has yet taken place.</p>
