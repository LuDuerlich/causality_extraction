<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Under Chapter 7, Article 3, first paragraph of the Instrument of Government, government business shall be settled by the Government at government meetings. Government business relating to the implementation within the armed forces of statutes or special government decisions may, however, under the Article’s second paragraph, be approved by the head of the ministry responsible for such matters, under the supervision of the Prime Minister and to the extent laid down in law. The Act on the processing of certain government business (1974:613), also called the Act on special government business, specifies the matters for which this may be done. Such matters, which thus are settled by only one minister, have also been designated as ‘military command matters’. Decisions taken under the Act on special government business are known as ‘special government business decisions’ (in Swedish called ‘SRÄ’ and hereafter ‘special decisions’).</p>
<p>The system of collective decision-making is based on the basic principle in our parliamentary system that all decisions taken by the Government are to be expressions of values embodied by the Government as a whole. It was primarily the demand for speed that called for military command matters being able to be decided through a simpler procedure than other government business. The significance of rapid processing was accentuated in a crisis situation in the country.</p>
<p>The Act on special government business lists eight points for which special decisions may be taken in this way. They include regulations concerning mobilisation of the Swedish Armed Forces, personnel-related matters within the Swedish Armed Forces, access to protected military objects, naval visits abroad and training flights abroad, as well as access to Swedish territory. As these matters fall under the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence, the Minister for Defence alone decides on them.</p>
<p>At present, only matters on access to Swedish territory under point 7 are in practice decided under the Act on special government business. In view of other, more recent legal regulations, the extent to which other points can be applied is also uncertain. The terms of reference mention the Protection Act (2010:305) and the Protection Ordinance (2010:523), as well as the Ordinance on support for civil activities by the Swedish Armed Forces (2002:375) as examples of regulations through which responsibility is delegated to public authorities.</p>
<p>We have been tasked with reviewing how the Act on special government business relates to other legal regulations and to consider how legislation should be formulated to best meet the current needs of being able to process government business through this special procedure.</p>
<p>The review of other legal regulations has taken place based on the restriction entailed in Chapter 7, Article 3, second paragraph of the Instrument of Government. The formulation of the regulation excludes the use of this decision-making procedure in government business that is not linked to military activities. Accordingly, there is no option to introduce this form of decision-making in other government business which demands rapid decision-making processes.</p>
<p>We have come to the conclusion that the demand for special grounds that emerges in the preparatory work to the law cannot be fulfilled solely by the fact that a matter requires prompt processing. Business of considerable importance should be settled by the Government as a collective. For a decision to be able to be taken as a special decision, it should therefore be necessary that the business is both urgent and that the decision-making procedure, considering what the business involves or for other reasons, is not inappropriate. These fundamental prerequisites should be stated directly in the wording of the Act. We have also noted that the need for quick decisions can vary depending on the actual business concerned and the prevailing security policy situation. As these matters concern military activities, a heightened security policy situation would obviously involve an increased need for quick decisions.</p>
<p>Under the first point in the Act on special government business, the decision-making procedure may be used in business relating to regulations concerning mobilisation of the Armed Forces. Considering the more widespread nature of the regulations, business that relates to regulations can more rarely be seen to fulfil the funda-</p>
<p>mental prerequisites for this decision-making procedure. The dividing line between what can be taken in the form of a regulation or as an administrative decision is not completely clear. Our view, however, is that it should be possible for an administrative decision to be formulated in a sufficiently comprehensive way so that an acute situation could be managed. In addition, in a mobilisation situation, the Government will need to take a number of significant decisions that lie outside the framework indicated by Chapter 7, Article 3, second paragraph of the Instrument of Government. It can therefore be presumed that government meetings will need to be held considerably more often than in a normal situation. In light of this, we do not consider that, specifically in mobilisation situations, there is a need to retain the option of issuing regulations such as special decisions. Nor has the review we have conducted of other types of business illustrated a need for this form of provision.</p>
<p>After our review, we can state that there is a need to be able to take decisions as special decisions in government business in matters concerning the Armed Forces’ war organisation and mobilisation, the call-up and service of total defence conscripts in the Armed Forces, Swedish naval visits abroad and flights abroad using Swedish military aircraft. Corresponding regulations are currently in place, partly in points 1, 4 and 6.</p>
<p>Regarding the need to be able to take decisions as special decisions in government business in matters concerning access to Swedish territory (point 7), our view is that certain changes should be made. The option of taking decisions as special decisions should also cover foreign military vehicles as well as visits by foreign state vessels in Swedish territory. With respect to government business regarding temporary exercises conducted by the military forces of a foreign state in Swedish territory, we consider that there may be a need for this decision-making procedure for minor adjustments of decisions previously taken and within the framework of larger decisions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we can state that there is no need to be able to take decisions as special decisions in matters concerning the call up and service of reserve officers in the Armed Forces, participation by the Armed Forces in official ceremonies and in activities for public benefit, employment, posting and stationing of personnel in military activities, leaves of absence for personnel at military facilities and protected objects. Our review has had a wider perspective than the current regulations in the Act on special government business.</p>
<p>Parts of these matters are currently regulated in points 4, 8, 2, 3 and 5.</p>
<p>As regards other possible types of matters, our conclusion is that in most cases, these matters are not suited to decisions as special decisions, including such matters as materiel issues and defence intelligence operations.</p>
<p>There is, however, one other instance in which we can envisage the need to take decisions as special decisions, i.e. in government business concerning training activities abroad under the Act on training for peace and security operations (1994:588). In general, decisions in these kinds of government matters are very detailed. We therefore consider that there may be the need of this decisionmaking procedure for minor adjustments of decisions previously taken.</p>
<p>Since the proposed amendments are extensive, they should not be made in the Act on special government business; instead, a new act should be introduced. We propose that the act be entitled the Act on decisions in special cases in government business concerning military activities. Just as in the current Act, the list in the Act of government business in which decisions may be taken as special decisions must be exhaustive.</p>
<p>No specific date is proposed concerning the entry into force of the Act and other legislative amendments. There is no need for any transitional provisions.</p>
<p>The proposals will not have any financial or other consequences such as those stated in Sections 14, 15 and 15 a of the Committees Ordinance (1998:1474).</p>
