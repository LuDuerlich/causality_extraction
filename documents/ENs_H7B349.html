<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry was tasked with conducting a systematic review of the criminal anti-terrorism legislation with the aim of achieving fit-forpurpose, effective and clear regulations that are also compatible with the effective protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. Under the terms of reference, the regulations proposed should be brought together in a single regulatory framework and they should be able to stand the test of time.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the overall remit to conduct a review, the Inquiry was instructed to pay particular attention to the scope of application of a ‘terrorist offence’, the regulations on particularly serious crime, the scales of penalties, the qualifying criteria for gross offences, exemptions from criminal responsibility, basic conditions for the application of offences, jurisdiction and consequential amendments to other statutes.</p>
<h2>Terrorism</h2>
<p>People, who for different purposes, use force to try to influence developments in society is not a new phenomenon; terrorism has a long history. Each year, many terrorist attacks are carried out in the world. In recent years, the worst affected region has been the Middle East and North Africa, but a number of terrorist attacks have also been committed in Europe and the United States. Some of these attacks were well planned and involved the use of heavy weaponry and explosives, whereas others were carried out with simpler means by people acting alone. Examples of more advanced attacks include those in Paris in 2015 against a magazine office and a rock concert. Examples of attacks carried out by lone individuals include the lorry attacks in Nice and Berlin in 2016, and the attack on Drottninggatan in Stockholm in 2017. Several terrorist attacks took place in the United Kingdom in the same year. Terrorist attacks have also been carried out in Brussels and Barcelona, as well as in several cities in the United States, including New York, Miami and Boston. According to a list compiled by Europol, some 130 terrorist attacks were carried out and/or thwarted in the European Union in 2018.</p>
<p>From a historical perspective, terrorism has not been a significant problem in Sweden. However, several offences were committed in the 1970s with links to foreign terrorism. In the 2000s, a number of people were convicted by Swedish courts of terrorist offences, preparation to commit a terrorist offence, financing of terrorism and other offences. These offences were committed both in Sweden and abroad. During the period 2012–2016, some 300 people left Sweden to join violent extremist Islamist groups in Syria or Iraq. On 7 April 2017, a terrorist attack was also carried out in Stockholm. Five people were killed and a number were seriously injured in the attack, in which a lorry was used to run over people on Drottninggatan. The perpetrator was sentenced to life imprisonment for a terrorist offence.</p>
<h2>Applicable law</h2>
<p>Criminal anti-terrorism legislation is mainly contained in the Act on Criminal Responsibility for Terrorist Offences (2003:148), the Act on Criminal Responsibility for Public Provocation, Recruitment and Training concerning Terrorist Offences and other Particularly Serious Crime (2010:299) (the Recruitment Act), and the Act on Criminal Responsibility for the Financing of Particularly Serious Crime in Certain Cases (2002:444) (the Financing Act). These acts were drafted separately and for the main purpose of implementing various international obligations within the framework of the United Nations (UN), the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Council of Europe and the European Union (EU).</p>
<p>The Act on Criminal Responsibility for Terrorist Offences contains provisions on criminal responsibility for terrorist offences. A person is guilty of a terrorist offence if they commit an act referred to in the Act, such as murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, sabotage and hijacking, if the act could seriously damage a state or an intergovernmental organisation (the ‘objective criterion’). Moreover, for criminal responsibility to be established, it is necessary for the perpetrator to have had a certain intent in committing the act, for example to seriously intimidate a population or a population group (one of the three ‘subjective criteria’). Together with the objective criterion, these are the ‘qualifying criteria’ that form the basis of the scope of application of a ‘terrorist offence’. The Act also contains a rule on more severe penalties for certain offences committed with intent to promote a terrorist offence. There are also specific rules on confiscation. Rules on jurisdiction are contained in Chapter 2 of the Swedish Criminal Code, which stipulates universal jurisdiction for terrorist offences and attempting, preparation or conspiracy to commit such offences.</p>
<p>The Recruitment Act regulates the criminal responsibility of a person who publicly urges others to commit a terrorist offence or other particularly serious crime, recruits people for such crime, gives or receives training concerning such criminal activities, or travels abroad for the purpose of committing or preparing such criminal activities, or giving or receiving training concerning such criminal activities. ‘Particularly serious crime’ means, apart from terrorist offences, criminal activities within the meaning of certain specified international agreements. The Act also contains provisions on jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The Financing Act regulates criminal responsibility for the financing of terrorist offences or other particularly serious crime, or of a person or association of persons who commit such criminal activities. The Act also contains provisions on jurisdiction, confiscation and seizure of money.</p>
<h2>The need for a reform and general starting points</h2>
<p>Terrorism is a threat to conditions such as society being characterised by openness and respect for human rights, and fundamental democratic values. People must be able, in a safe and secure manner, to move freely, participate in gatherings and express their opinions without fear of being subjected to threats or violence. Terrorist crime covers more than just planning and carrying out attacks. It can also manifest itself in urging others to commit terrorist acts, collecting money or other support for terrorist organisations, recruitment for the purpose of carrying out an attack and training in special techniques to carry out attacks. To effectively prevent, pre-empt and prosecute terrorist offences, it is important to have in place comprehensive, fitfor-purpose and effective criminal legislation. However, effective anti-terrorism requires several other repressive and preventive measures that can complement each other. The criminal law regulations are therefore just one of many important tools for combating terrorism.</p>
<p>Criminal legislation in the area of terrorism has been built up over a long period of time. As early as the 1970s, accession to various UN conventions in the area of terrorism resulted in new offences being introduced to the Swedish Criminal Code, such as hijacking and aviation sabotage, which came to be known as the terrorism provisions of the Swedish Criminal Code. Subsequently, the Financing Act, the Act on Criminal Responsibility for Terrorist Offences and the Recruitment Act were introduced on separate occasions, mainly to implement various international obligations. The current system, with several different acts, makes it difficult to maintain an overview of the criminalised area. Moreover, criminal responsibility under the abovementioned acts has gradually been expanded. This has further increased the complexity of the regulations, which must currently be said to be lacking in clarity. It is clear that there is a need to review the legislation. The starting points for such a review are that the legislation should be consolidated in a simplified regulatory framework that is comprehensive, fit for purpose, effective and sustainable over time. The legislation must fulfil international commitments and fundamental rights and freedoms, and it must comply with the principle of legality. The scales of penalties must reflect the seriousness of the offences.</p>
<h2>Introduction of a new act</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the existing Act on Criminal Responsibility for Terrorist Offences, the Financing Act and the Recruitment Act be replaced by a single new act that regulates criminal responsibility for terrorist offences, collaboration with a terrorist organisation, financing of terrorism, public provocation to commit a terrorist act, recruitment for terrorism, training for terrorism and travel for the purpose of terrorism. It is also proposed that it contain definitions of what is meant in the act by ‘particularly serious crime’ and ‘terrorist organisations’, and provisions on aggravating circumstances, confiscation and seizure of money. The jurisdiction of Swedish courts to rule on offences under the proposed act should be regulated in the Swedish Criminal Code.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the new act be called the Terrorist Offences Act.</p>
<h2>A fit-for-purpose and simplified classification of a ‘terrorist offence’</h2>
<p>The classification ‘terrorist offence’ should continue to be based on the EU Terrorism Directive. It must be fit for purpose and able to stand the test of time. It is clear from the history of the legislation that attacks on the foundation of our form of government and legal system, and fundamental rights and freedoms are included in the scope of application of a terrorist offence. Other aspects that must also be safeguarded are also covered by the term ‘terrorist offence’ – such as the functioning of public administration, key societal functions and supply systems, and our open and safe society. There is no case-law to suggest that the current scope of application of the offence is anything other than what essentially can be considered intended, appropriate or fit for purpose. Nonetheless, the Inquiry has carefully considered the possibility of increasing the detail in the objective criterion for a terrorist offence (the requirement that the act could have seriously damaged a state) in light of the predictability and clarity required under the principle of legality; on overall assessment, however, the Inquiry has not presented any proposals for a more precise description of the criterion in the legislative text.</p>
<p>However, the Inquiry proposes several other changes to the term ‘terrorist offence’:</p>
<p>• In the objective criterion, the reference to serious damage to  a state  should be changed to refer to such damage to a country.  This change underlines the fact that terrorist offences often target society in a broad sense and not just state structures and public authorities. It also better adapts the definition of ‘terrorist offence’ to the form of terrorism that takes place in countries with deficient or non-existent state structures.</p>
<p>• One of the subjective criteria should be changed to cover acts committed with the intent to seriously intimidate a population or  a section of a population ; the latter term has been changed from the previously used term population group.  ‘A section of a population’ means both a large heterogeneous part of the population and a more limited circle or group of people in the population, such as an ethnic minority, a people, individuals with foreign backgrounds, LGBTQ people, individuals with a particular religious affiliation or other sections of the population. The threat of terrorism in the form of acts targeting the civilian population in a society is diverse in terms of its target group, and all sections of the population have an equal interest in the open and safe society that the anti-terrorism legislation is intended to protect. However, it should be stressed that the anti-terrorism legislation – unlike the hate crime legislation in the Swedish Criminal Code – is not intended to give certain particularly vulnerable and collectively determined groups, or individuals belonging to such groups, special protection under criminal law. In cases where serious politically or otherwise ideologically motivated crime is not considered to constitute a terrorist offence, the acts committed can result in penalties for other offences, such as murder or devastation endangering the public. Under Chapter 29, Section 2, point 7 of the Swedish Criminal Code, one of the circumstances that can be considered aggravating when setting a penalty is that a motive for the offence was to abuse a person, a population group or another such group of individuals on grounds of race, colour, national or ethnic origin, religious belief, sexual orientation, transgender identity or expression, or other similar circumstance.</p>
<p>• In the provision on terrorist offences there would no longer be a list of what offences can be considered terrorist offences. Instead, it should be possible to consider any offence under Swedish law a terrorist offence, provided the objective and any of the subjective criteria are met. Reforming the term ‘terrorist offence’ in this way would simplify the regulation considerably and contribute to more  fit-for-purpose and enduring legislation. The terrorist threat varies from one period to another, and the targets and methods used vary over time. This change would also better adapt the offence to the examination that should be carried out for terrorist offences regarding whether an attack that is concentrated in time and location – which can include a considerable number of injured parties and various criminal acts – was, in its entirety, intended to seriously damage a country or an intergovernmental organisation.</p>
<h2>The offences of financing, public provocation, recruitment, training and travel should be simplified and expanded</h2>
<p>The offences of financing, public provocation, recruitment, training and travel should be kept in the new act and termed financing of terrorism, public provocation to commit a terrorist act, recruitment for terrorism, training for terrorism and travel for the purpose of terrorism. These provisions are necessary to fulfil international commitments and help ensure that acts linked to terrorism that are worthy of penalties are criminalised in a credible and effective way. However, parts of the regulation seem to overlap and lack clarity and should therefore be simplified. In certain respects, the legislation should also be expanded. In these areas, the Inquiry proposes the following:</p>
<p>• The criminalisation of financing and recruitment for the purposes of committing or otherwise assisting in attempting, preparation or conspiracy to commit a terrorist offence should be removed from the legislation. With the new act that the Inquiry is proposing – which includes the offence of collaboration with a terrorist organisation – there is no longer a need for such a regulation to fulfil international commitments. Retaining it would also lead to a lack of clarity. There are also further reasons behind this consideration. A similar change should be made regarding the offence of travel for the purpose of terrorism.</p>
<p>• Criminal responsibility for public provocation to commit a terrorist act should also cover provocation to commit the offences of recruitment for terrorism, training for terrorism and travel for the purpose of terrorism. Broadening the scope in this way would help to more comprehensively encompass messages and propaganda of such a nature that offers general support for terrorism, such as provocations to obtain training in techniques associated with weapons and explosives so as to commit a terrorist offence.</p>
<p>For the offence of public provocation to commit a terrorist act, a more severe scale of penalties should apply than if the criminal provision on inciting rebellion contained in the Swedish Criminal Code were the only provision applicable.</p>
<p>• The training offence should be broadened to also cover those who issue instructions to someone with the intention that these will be used for a terrorist offence. The current legislation requires that the person providing the training is aware that the person receiving the training has terrorist intentions. Moreover, the specific instrumentalities currently specified in the training offence should be replaced with a more general regulation. Developments in recent years have shown that terrorist attacks can be carried out using aeroplanes or motor vehicles, for example. In addition to this, an increased dependence on electronic communications and digital information and management systems has opened the door to other forms of  well-planned terrorist attacks against key societal functions and supply systems. In such attacks, knowledge about the production and use of computer viruses or other software could be crucial to carrying out the offence. Taking the offence of preparation in the Swedish Criminal Code as the model, criminal responsibility should therefore refer to instrumentalities  that are particularly liable to be used in a terrorist offence. Such a provision is better suited to the current realities of terrorist crime, and it can also cover instructions for such instrumentalities that may emerge in the future.</p>
<h2>The scales of penalties should be more severe for some offences</h2>
<p>The interests that the criminal anti-terrorism legislation is intended to protect are of great importance, and this should be reflected in the scales of penalties for the various types of offences. The scales of penalties for the offences of financing of terrorism, public provocation to commit a terrorist act, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism have remained unchanged since the introduction of the Financing Act and the Recruitment Act. Since then, recruitment to terrorist organisations, financing of terrorism and public provocation to commit a terrorist act have, in general, developed and taken on new forms. In certain cases, recruitment for or financing of terrorism may be of particular importance to the possibility of conducting terrorist activities, such as more organised and well-planned terrorist acts within terrorist organisations that participate in armed conflicts abroad. The same applies to attacks that have taken place or could take place in Sweden and other parts of Europe or the world. According to the law enforcement authorities, in Sweden there are now more potential lone actors and expanding networks of actors with intentions to commit a terrorist offence, including with international ramifications. Overall, developments over time have been such that there is reason to take a more serious view of terrorist offences than previously. This applies not least to terrorist offences that, from a criminal law perspective, often correspond to preparation or planning under the rules contained in Chapter 23 of the Swedish Criminal Code. The Inquiry also has an explicit remit, under the terms of reference, to effect more severe penalties for offences covered by the criminal anti-terrorism legislation. However, there have been a limited number of convictions, and a certain degree of caution is therefore necessary when making changes to the existing scales of penalties.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the maximum penalties for regular offences and the minimum penalties for gross offences be increased for all offences included in the proposed act, apart from terrorist offences and the travel offence. An increase in the maximum penalty for regular offences may offer greater scope for the courts to impose more nuanced penalties in each individual case. An increase in the minimum penalties for gross offences would better reflect the seriousness of this type of offence and would also mean upgrading the gross offences that have a penal value that exceeds the minimum penalty. The aim is not to raise the bar for what offences should be considered gross.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes the following scales of penalties:</p>
<p>• The penalty for a terrorist offence should be imprisonment for a fixed term, at least four years and at most eighteen years, or for life. If the offence is less serious, the penalty should be imprisonment for at least two and at most six years.</p>
<p>• The penalty for collaboration with a terrorist organisation should be imprisonment for at most four years. If the offence is gross, the penalty should be imprisonment for at least one year and six months and at most seven years.</p>
<p>• The penalty for the offences of financing of terrorism, public provocation to commit a terrorist act, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism should be imprisonment for at most three years. If the offence is gross, the penalty should be imprisonment for at least one year and at most six years.</p>
<p>• The penalty for the offence of travel for the purpose of terrorism should be imprisonment for at most two years.</p>
<p>Under the proposed act, these offences should be considered to be of such a nature that the penalty should be imprisonment, even if the penal value in itself or previous offences do not call for this.</p>
<h2>A general rule on more severe penalties should be introduced</h2>
<p>The current rule on more severe penalties in the Act on Criminal Responsibility for Terrorist Offences is complex and only covers certain offences, such as theft, extortion and falsification of documents, that are committed with the intent to promote a terrorist offence. In the Inquiry’s view, such a provision has no place in concerted legislation that is intended to be clear, orderly and logical. Offences with a link to terrorism may also mean acts of other kinds, for example breach of data security, firearms offences or other offences, such as trafficking in human beings and narcotics offences, which, at least in an international context, are committed to promote terrorist activities. A general rule on more severe penalties should therefore be introduced in the proposed act to cover all offences committed with the intention of promoting a terrorist offence or other offences covered by the proposed act. This would help to further strengthen protection against terrorism under criminal law.</p>
<h2>The regulations on particularly serious crime cannot be removed, but should refer to offences under Swedish law</h2>
<p>The current regulations on particularly serious crime were designed to ensure that criminal responsibility for the offences of financing of terrorism, public provocation to commit a terrorist act, recruitment for terrorism, training for terrorism and travel for the purpose of terrorism is applicable in relation to what constitutes a terrorist offence under the EU Terrorism Directive, the UN’s International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism and the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism. The EU Directive contains its own definition of what constitutes a terrorist offence, which in Swedish law corresponds to a terrorist offence under the Act on Criminal Responsibility for Terrorist Offences. Under the UN Convention and the Council of Europe Convention, however, terrorist offences are all offences that are covered by approximately ten UN agreements in the area of terrorism, including the International Convention against the Taking of Hostages. Partly as a consequence of these different definitions, the regulations on particularly serious crime are complex, with references both to specified offences under Swedish law – such as terrorist offences, hijacking, shipping or aviation sabotage, and airport sabotage – and to offences under various international instruments, such as the abovementioned International Convention against the Taking of Hostages, and combinations of them.</p>
<p>As is pointed out in the Inquiry’s terms of reference, the regulations on particularly serious crime mean that the legislation is lacking in clarity, and the Inquiry has considered several different ways to remove or simplify them. One alternative would be to make the offences of financing of terrorism and public provocation to commit a terrorist act, etc. only applicable in relation to a terrorist offence. There would be good reason to assert that this would mean a reasonable delimitation of criminal responsibility in the area of antiterrorism that would also be compatible with the overall purpose of the international regulations. However, the solution would probably not be fully compatible with the more detailed commitments under the UN Convention and the Council of Europe Convention, as has been made clear in various ways in certain viewpoints in previous legislative matters. This is because several of the specified UN agreements are not restricted in their application to acts committed with the specific terrorist intent stated in the provisions on terrorist offences.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has therefore made the assessment that the regulations on particularly serious crime cannot be left out of the legislation. However, they should be simplified as much as possible and should mainly refer to offences under Swedish law, including kidnapping or unlawful deprivation of liberty (if the intention behind the offence is to force someone to take or refrain from taking a measure), arson, devastation endangering the public (gross offence), gross sabotage, hijacking, shipping or aviation sabotage, airport sabotage, and spreading poison or infection (gross offence). Such a solution would make the criminalised area more predictable and clear, and the regulatory framework more user-friendly.</p>
<h2>The term ‘terrorist organisation’ should be defined</h2>
<p>As the proposed act will contain provisions on collaboration with a terrorist organisation, as well as financing, public provocation, recruitment and travel with regard to collaboration with such an organisation, reasons of legal certainty and the requirement of predictability call for a clear definition in the legislation of what is meant by a ‘terrorist organisation’. It is proposed that the definition be linked to the carrying out of criminal acts, and that it cover associations of individuals who commit a terrorist offence or particularly serious crime as defined in the proposed act.</p>
<h2>Universal jurisdiction for all offences under the proposed act</h2>
<p>The jurisdiction rules that currently apply for terrorist crime were introduced in different contexts and they differ between the regulations. Whereas terrorist offences fall within Swedish jurisdiction irrespective of where the act was committed and by whom (universal jurisdiction), this does not apply to offences under the Financing Act or the Recruitment Act. In these acts, separate provisions on jurisdiction have been introduced specifying restrictions, for example depending on who committed the offence. The Inquiry proposes that the jurisdiction rules be brought together in the general provisions on jurisdiction in Chapter 2 of the Swedish Criminal Code, and that universal jurisdiction be prescribed for all offences in the proposed act. Regulation of this kind is justified as there is a relatively broad international and regional consensus that offences under the proposed act should be punishable. The offences of financing of terrorism and travel for the purpose of terrorism are based on international regulations within the framework of the UN, the FATF, the Council of Europe and the EU. Regarding the offences of public provocation to commit a terrorist act, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism, the regulations are based on provisions contained in international instruments primarily within the Council of Europe and the EU.</p>
<h2>Secret coercive measures</h2>
<p>It should be possible to use secret interception of electronic communications, secret surveillance of electronic communications and secret camera surveillance in preliminary investigations of offences under the proposed act. The Act on measures to prevent certain particularly serious offences (2007:979) and the Act on collecting information about electronic communication in the law enforcement agencies’ intelligence activities (2012:278) should be applicable to terrorist offences and gross offences under the proposed act. The proposals reflect the existing regulation on the use of secret coercive measures in the event of a terrorist offence.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the legislative amendments enter into force on 1 July 2021.</p>
