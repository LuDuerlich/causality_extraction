<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Swedish education policy has a long tradition of promoting equality of opportunity. Under the Swedish Education Act, all pupils are entitled to an education of the same standard and to be given the opportunity to develop their full potential. Schools are required to adjust to pupils’ needs and should compensate for differences in social background (Chapter 1, Section 4, second paragraph of the Education Act  (2010:800).</p>
<p>This report studies equity in Swedish compulsory and upper secondary schools. The main focus is on quantitative analyses of differences between schools and pupils, which contribute to our understanding of the school system’s compensatory role, in particular when it comes to equalizing achievement differences by family background.</p>
<p>Differences in outcomes between pupils and between schools, and how they evolve over time, may be explained in part by pupil characteristics, such as parental education, country of birth and age at immigration, and in part by school resources and education quality. A school’s academic performance can thus be related to the composition of the pupils, but also to access to and allocation of resources and teachers’ skills, and to the school’s ability to manage its teaching resources and equalize the opportunities between different groups of pupils. We call these two factors – pupils’ family background and school resources – a school’s input factors . The report first analyses these input factors from an equity perspective. Next, the report turns to the school’s output factors  in terms of academic achievement and education quality. These analyses focus on educational attainment and quality differences between schools, how school quality varies between pupils from different family backgrounds and describes trends in the impact of family background on pupils’ academic outcomes.</p>
<h2>Family background and pupil sorting in compulsory school</h2>
<p>In recent decades, Swedish schools have become increasingly segregated, both socially and ethnically. The introduction of school choice in 1992 and the subsequent growing fraction of pupils attending independent schools have contributed to the increased school segregation, since it is primarily pupils from advantaged backgrounds who attend independent schools. However, most of the rise in school segregation since the early 1990s can be attributed to the increase in residential segregation. The trend of increasing school segregation has, however, recently been broken in one respect: increased immigration implies that a larger proportion of schools have pupils with migration background today than 20 years ago. Accordingly, the increase in school segregation with respect to migration background has levelled off.</p>
<h2>Compensatory resource allocation in compulsory school</h2>
<p>Compensatory resource allocation is one of the cornerstones of a school system that strives to counterbalance differences in pupils’ initial circumstances. This report analyses how teaching resources are allocated between municipalities and schools with different pupil characteristics. Schools whose pupils come from less advantaged family backgrounds have higher teacher-pupil ratios compared to schools whose pupils come from more advantaged backgrounds. As such, the allocation of teacher resources is clearly compensatory. This compensatory element also appears to have increased slightly over time, which is positive from an equity perspective. Teacher skills are, however, not allocated such that schools with many weak pupils are compensated. Instead the allocation enhances initial differences in pupils’ opportunities. Municipal schools with pupils from less advantaged backgrounds employ less skilled teachers than municipal schools with pupils from more advantaged backgrounds. It is also the case that teacher turnover is higher at schools with pupils from less advantaged backgrounds, as teachers tend to work at these schools for a shorter period of time.</p>
<p>The report also studies whether teacher salaries differ between schools depending on pupils’ family background. Teacher salaries appear not to differ by the pupil composition, which indicates that higher salaries are not used to attract the most highly skilled teachers to schools with disadvantaged pupils. Resource allocation within schools, as measured by access to individually targeted special education, however appears to be compensatory throughout compulsory school; socially disadvantaged pupils are more likely to receive individually targeted special education.</p>
<h2>Attainment differences between pupils and schools in the compulsory school system</h2>
<p>A compensatory school system aims to produce small quality differences between schools, and for existing quality differences to reduce rather than enhance the importance of family background for educational achievement. However, there is a strong correlation between family background, such as parental education and migration status, and pupils’ school performance. School segregation in terms of pupils’ family background may therefore give rise to attainment differences between schools even in a system with small variations in school quality.</p>
<p>This report shows that attainment differences between schools have increased steadily since the early 1990s. This increase is due primarily to increased school segregation and not to increasing quality differences between schools. However, we do find that attainment differences have increased slightly over the past decade also when pupils’ family background differences are accounted for. This increase can be explained by a growing proportion of pupils attending independent schools, in combination with the fact that independent schools have a somewhat greater impact on pupil outcomes. Nonetheless, schools’ impact on pupil achievement is very limited: around 2 per cent of the variation in pupils’ test scores and GPA can be explained by which school the pupil attends, once pupils’ background is accounted for. This implies that differences in outcomes between pupils is largely explained by out-of-school factors.</p>
<p>Family background is strongly correlated with pupils’ school performance. The extent to which it is possible to equalize outcomes between pupils with different backgrounds remains an open question, however. Even in a highly compensatory school system, it is not possible, perhaps not even desirable, to fully eliminate differences between children. For this reason, research in this area does not assume that the goal is full equalization; rather it focuses on whether the school system has improved or weakened in its compensatory role by examining whether the impact of family background has changed over time.</p>
<p>The impact of family background is analysed using sibling correlations’, which measure the family’s impact in a broad sense (the measure captures parental education and immigration background, as well as factors that are more difficult to measure such as attitudes to education, home environment and parenting). For pupils born in Sweden, the importance of family background for pupils’ educational attainment has been constant over a period of 30 years. However, for the pupil population as a whole, the impact of family background has increased. This increase is linked to a growing proportion of foreignborn pupils, and to the fact that a larger proportion of these pupils immigrated after school-starting age. As such, the family plays a more prominent role in determining outcomes.</p>
<h2>Differences in school quality between compulsory schools</h2>
<p>One of the report’s contributions has been to measure, for the first time, the value-added of Swedish compulsory schools. The school’s value-added is a performance-based measure of quality, which measures how much a school improves pupil outcomes after taking pupils’ family background and previous educational achievement into account. The measure is derived by measuring how much a school contributes to improving test scores between school years 6 and 9. This measure of school quality includes the school’s contribution to skill development (for example through the quality of teaching), as well as the potential effects that run through the pupil composition at the school. If learning benefits from having peers from advantageous backgrounds, for example by improving the classroom working environment or by making it easier to recruit skilled teachers, the measure of quality will also capture this dimension.</p>
<p>The measure of the school’s value-added is used to assess the quality differences between Swedish compulsory schools, and to examine how school quality differences are distributed across different groups of pupils and school providers. The findings show that there is considerable variation in the measured quality of compulsory schools, and that there are opportunities to improve (or adversely impact) the outcomes for pupils who change schools. These quality differences indicate that schools differ in how well they succeed in their teaching and that there is scope for considerable improvement in quality at some schools. The analyses show that pupils from advantaged backgrounds more often attend schools of higher quality than pupils from less advantaged backgrounds. However, the impact of sorting by quality is small in relation to the total variation in quality.</p>
<p>Next, the report examines how school-level input factors correlate with school quality. Teacher-pupil ratios and teacher skills are only weakly related to measured quality. Instead, the analysis shows that there are large differences in quality between municipalities. Schools in metropolitan municipalities have higher valueadded than rural schools. These differences have also increased over time, which has widened the gap in scholastic attainment between rural and urban schools. In addition, independent schools have on average higher value-added than municipal schools. However, the higher added value of metropolitan schools and independent schools should be interpreted as school quality given the pupil composition present at these schools. In other words, we cannot assess what these quality differences would look like if the differences in pupil characteristics between urban and rural areas, or between independent and municipal schools, were to change. Nor can we rule out the possibility that the estimated quality differences in general, and the differences between school providers in particular, have been overestimated as a result of pupil sorting on unobservable pupil characteristics, which cannot be accounted for in the analysis. This would be the case, for instance, if particularly motivated students choose to attend independent schools.</p>
<p>The quality differences between school providers may be considered an equity problem, because it stands in conflict with the Education Act’s objective that education must have the same standard regardless of a school’s geographic location and because access to independent schools is not the same for all pupils.</p>
<h2>Equity in upper secondary school</h2>
<p>The equity goals formulated in the Education Act also apply to upper secondary school. Equity is however more difficult to define in upper secondary school, which is voluntary, where pupils choose specializations and admission is competitive based on GPA. Nevertheless, the vast majority of pupils attend upper secondary education which is important for equipping them with the skills needed to enter working life and required for tertiary education. This motivates an analysis of equity in upper secondary school and the transition to working life.</p>
<p>A first observation is that equity in upper secondary school has declined due to a number of reforms that have limited access to regular upper secondary school programmes by introducing stricter entry requirements, primarily affecting academically weak pupils. However, upper secondary school performance differences between different groups of pupils have remained stable for a long time. While the success in transitioning from upper secondary school to further studies or work continues to vary considerably between pupils of different socioeconomic backgrounds, there is, however, no clear indication that the labour market performance of academically weak pupils deteriorated as the fraction of pupils with incomplete final upper secondary school grades increased sharply in the mid-1990s. Nor does the past decade’s improvement in the fraction of pupils completing upper secondary school seem to have had much impact on the transition to further studies or the entry into the labour market.</p>
<h2>Testing and assessment systems</h2>
<p>This report studies school performance based on indicators – test scores and grades – that to varying degrees are associated with problems resulting from schools having incentives to be generous in both marking national tests and grading. These shortcomings in adequately measuring pupils’ skill development and comparing the quality of schools are in themselves a challenge to equity in the Swedish school system. For pupils, this means there is inequality in assessment, which is particularly problematic given that grades are used for selection to upper secondary school and higher education. For the school system as a whole, this makes it more difficult to fairly assess school quality and performance, as well as to evaluate the effects of different education policy initiatives.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Overall, this report shows that equity in the Swedish compulsory school system has been rather stable in recent decades. Compensatory resource allocation has not been weakened; rather it has been strengthened. And among pupils born in Sweden, the impact of family background on outcomes has remained unchanged for a long time. It is nevertheless clear that the school system’s compensatory role has increased in complexity due to large groups of immigrant pupils coming to Sweden after school-starting age. The increase in school segregation is also problematic from an equity perspective since it is in conflict with schools’ role in fostering democratic values and civic responsibility. The difference in quality between schools also means that all pupils do not have the same access to good schools.</p>
<p>In terms of equity, the Swedish school system has many strengths, but there is also potential for improvement and scope for reform. The strengths include the fact that teacher-pupil ratios are to some degree allocated according to pupils’ needs; that the school system appears to rapidly respond and increase resources in schools receiving many newly arrived immigrants; that individual special education is targeted to the weakest pupils within schools; and that the impact of family background on pupil achievement has remained relatively constant, at least for Swedish-born pupils, for a long</p>
<p>period of time – a period marked by increasing overall inequality in society. The report identifies the following challenges to equity in the Swedish school system: (1) the lack of compensatory allocation of teachers’ skills (an issue that will become more pressing in a future with expected teacher shortages); (2) the differences in measured school quality between independent and municipal schools, and between urban and rural schools; (3) the growing school segregation and the unequal access to schools of high quality; (4) the grading and admissions system which acts as a barrier to upper secondary school for pupils with weak academic background; (5) the shortcomings in the testing and grading systems that hamper fair assessment and provide poor opportunities to analyse and promote a positive development of the school system; and (6) the lack of a national strategy to promote evidence-based education policy and more specifically a strategy for identifying policy measures that have a causal impact on pupils’ academic outcomes and that may improve equity in the education system.</p>
<p>In these six areas there is scope for improvements with the aim to equalize pupils’ life chances and give all pupils, regardless of their background, equal opportunities in the school system.</p>
