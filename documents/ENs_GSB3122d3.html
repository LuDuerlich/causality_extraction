<p>The task and the bases for our work</p>
<p>The system of sanctions for young offenders was changed most recently by a reform that came into effect on 1 January 1999. One of the aims of the reform was to strengthen the penal law principles of proportionality, predictability and consequence. The sanction of being handed over to the care of the social services was clarified and made more stringent. Furthermore, custodial youth care was introduced as a sanction involving deprivation of liberty for young offenders who committed crimes before the age of 18.</p>
<p>The task of the Commission included following up and further developing the 1999 sanctions reform. This task, concerning young offenders aged between 15 and 20, has been very extensive and involved both the decision on sanction and enforcement of the different sanctions. We have accordingly had to give particular consideration to the possibilities of further development of sanctions and creating new sanction alternatives.</p>
<p>According to the Government’s terms of reference, the basic principles presented in connection with the changes in 1999 were to guide our work as well. This means that the system of sanctions for young offenders was to continue to be based on the principle that children and young people who commit crimes were in the first place to be handed over for measures to be taken by the social services.</p>
<p>The intention of the task has been, while maintaining the above penal law principles, to make further progress with the work of developing a system of sanctions for juveniles with a clear educational content and, based on the young person’s needs, to improve the prospects for a return to a socially well-adapted life and in this way to bring about a change for the better.</p>
<p>The Government has not intended to bring about any general increase in the stringency of punishments for young offenders.</p>
<p>Instead, it was stated that one objective must be to reduce the use of sanctions involving deprivation of liberty, in particular short sanctions of this kind.</p>
<p>The task has also entailed analysing how to meet the need for a national coordination of expertise and development of methods and the dissemination of general information and knowledge about juvenile crime and the intervention of public authority in response.</p>
<p>The National Council for Crime Prevention, the National Board of Health and Welfare and the National Board of Institutional Care have evaluated the 1999 sanctions reform for young offenders at the request of the Government. The agencies reported on their work in November 2002. This evaluation has been a valuable basis of knowledge for the work of the Commission.</p>
<p>The evaluation of the 1999 sanctions reform</p>
<p>The recently mentioned evaluation of the 1999 sanctions reform showed, with respect to the sanction of handing over to the care of the social services, that the reform had had certain effects although it was evident that it had not been realised to the full. With respect to custodial youth care, it emerged, among other things, that enforcement needed to be improved and that the continued treatment of the young person after enforcement either did not take place or ceased very soon after release despite a continuing need for care.</p>
<p>The work of the social services with children and young people who commit crimes</p>
<p>There is an increased need for measures by the social services in care of children and young people. Furthermore, the ambitions of the social services and the results expected by society have continued to increase. This together has entailed that the demands on the work of the social services with children and young people have increased considerably.</p>
<p>The ability of the social services to carry out successful work with children and young people, not least with respect to the target group of the Commission, are, however, limited due to organisational, staffing, expertise-related and administrative problems, among others. In the light of this, the Commission has found it appropriate that the state work for greater uniformity in the activities of the municipalities relating to young offenders. We recommend that it shall be explicitly stated by law that the National Board of Health and Welfare is entitled to issue regulations in this sphere. We have drawn attention to the importance of collaboration between local authorities in this sphere in order to reduce the difference in the range and quality of support and treatment measures etc. available from municipality to municipality.</p>
<p>Handling of juvenile cases in the judicial system</p>
<p>The Commission was not specifically instructed to investigate issues relating the handling of juvenile cases. However, we have drawn the conclusion that a review of the actions taken by public authority in youth crime cannot be excluded from the presentation. This has led to us making some recommendations in this area.</p>
<p>We consider that the specialisation in handling juvenile cases has been very important for the young person who comes into contact with the judicial system. We have therefore emphasised that the police, the prosecution service and the courts should regard it as important to develop the specialisation previously decided upon by the legislator with respect to the handling of juvenile cases by public authorities.</p>
<p>We have furthermore found that there are reasons to introduce a special requirement of aptitude for the attorney-at-law appointed as public counsel for a suspect under the age of 18. We consider that, in the first place, an attorney-at-law shall be appointed, who, due to his or her knowledge and experience and personal characteristics, is particularly suitable for the appointment. However, this shall not lead to a restriction on the ability of the suspect to have an influence on who is appointed as defence counsel. We consider that it shall be taken into account, when determining remuneration to defence counsel, that these cases can require special contributions by the defence counsel in cases where the accused is aged between 15 and 17.</p>
<p>Our proposals also focus on the requirement for swiftness in section 4 of the Young Offenders (Special Provisions) Act (1964:167) (LUL) which apply to preliminary investigation against persons under the age of 18. We take the view that this requirement for swiftness is to be expanded to apply to crimes that include imprisonment in the range of penalties, because it is important that society reacts quickly to all crimes committed by young people. We consider that the practical difficulties that this can entail are manageable.</p>
<p>We also recommend that the obligation in LUL to notify, among others, the person with custody if a prosecution is instituted and of the date of main proceedings shall explicitly apply to all courts. Furthermore, we recommend that certain provisions in LUL on court proceedings are to apply correspondingly to the court’s handling of cases after the prosecutor has instituted proceedings for a new consideration of the issue of sanction.</p>
<p>With respect to the handling of suspected crimes by children under the age of 15, we have found, in investigations under section 31 of LUL, that the court should be able to appoint a legal representative for the young person. This possibility should be used restrictively. It may be appropriate, for instance, when the crime investigation concerns serious crimes or can lead to large claims for damages being made against the young person.</p>
<p>We consider that it is justified in other contexts to review the ability to use coercive measures against crime suspects under the age of 15. However, we have concluded that it should be possible to take photographs and fingerprints of suspects under the age of criminal responsibility. We have also suggested certain clarifications in LUL with respect to the ability of the police to detain a person under the age of 15.</p>
<p>Waiver of prosecution – Formal caution</p>
<p>We consider that greater use of the possibility of waiver of prosecution under LUL should be made than at present. Consideration should therefore be given to the measures that can be taken with a view to reinforcing waiver of prosecution in LUL and thus contributing to it being applied to the extent intended by the legislator.</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that the term waiver from prosecution in LUL be replaced by formal caution for educational reasons and by way of clarification. For the same reasons, waiver of prosecutions under the Code of Judicial Procedure for crimes committed by a person under the age of 18 should be replaced by a formal caution. The reasons stated in Chapter 20, section 7, of the Code of Judicial Procedure (RB) shall thus serve as a basis for the prosecutor to decide on a formal caution under LUL.</p>
<p>We also recommend that the prosecutor take a final position on whether a formal caution is to be notified to the young person first at a personal meeting with him or her. Personal attendance of the young person at the meeting with the prosecutor shall in principle be a prerequisite for being able to decide on a formal caution.</p>
<p>In the view of the Commission, it shall also be possible for the court to notify a decision on a formal caution if it finds that the young person is guilty of the crime. However, the ability of the court in this respect is to be limited to cases where there are special reasons and when the deed has been committed due to mischief or rashness.</p>
<p>We consider that the collaboration between the prosecutor and the social services should be reinforced and therefore suggest that the social services should be obliged to report back to the prosecutor in those cases where the measure assumed by the prosecutor in the decision on a formal caution does not take place. We consider that the National Board of Health and Welfare should provide guidance to the social services in the municipalities on the obligation to report in these cases.</p>
<p>The Office of the Prosecutor-General should issue new general guidelines about the detailed application to achieve a uniform and predictable application of the legal provisions on formal caution. In our view, the new guidelines should be based on certain general principles. They should be designed in such a way as to increase the use of formal cautions at the expense of the imposition of penalties and court hearings.</p>
<p>With a view to motivating the young person to refrain from reoffending, we recommend that information relating to the decision on a formal caution be removed from the criminal register three years after the decision provided that no new entry has been made during this period, i.e. that the young person has not been charged with any other crime during the three-year period.</p>
<p>Handing over to care by the social services – the social service sanction</p>
<p>The sanction of being handed over to care by the social services can either mean voluntary or coercive care. The content of this sanction can consist of a lot of different measures on the part of the social services – everything from less extensive to very intrusive measures. Less intrusive measures might be, for instance, counseling with a social welfare officer and the appointment of a contact person. Examples of considerably more intrusive measures are participation in structured open care, for instance, multisystemic therapy, MST, and custodial placements.</p>
<p>The Commission has found the sanction of handing over to the care of the social services should only be used when the young person after skilled assessment has been found to run the risk of continued criminal behaviour and is therefore in need of strong measures by the social services.</p>
<p>Moreover, we take the view that the name of the sanction should be changed for pedagogical reasons and for clarification. Our proposed new name is social service sanction.</p>
<p>To clarify the role of the social services in the judicial system, we recommend that a contract should be drawn up based on a care plan, a youth contract in the case of a social service sanction which entails that measures are to be taken with the consent of the young person and his or her custodian, i.e. when it entails care under the Social Services Act (2001:453) (SoL). The youth contract is to be signed by the parties concerned and attached to the judgment. The court is to make a direction in the judgment that the young person is obliged to comply with his or her part of the contract. In the case of a social service sanction where coercive measures are to be taken pursuant to the Care of Young Persons (Special Provisions) Act (1990:52) (LVU), the care plan drawn up is to be attached to the judgment.</p>
<p>We have also made recommendations on procedural matters and enforcement. This part of our recommendations entails, among other things, that the obligation of the prosecutor to obtain a statement is brought forward to the time when he finds that there is a reasonable suspicion of crime, that the prosecutor is to be able to notify a caution to the young person if the latter’s conduct is unsatisfactory during enforcement of the sanction and that the court, if the prosecutor has instituted proceedings for a sanction to be varied, shall be able instead to make changes in the content of the ongoing social service sanction.</p>
<p>We have also drawn attention to the importance of the social welfare caseworkers having the necessary knowledge of what the statements and care plans are to contain as well as an understanding of the purpose of the documents at the prosecutor and court. To facilitate the work of the social services, we consider that the Prosecutor-General and the National Board of Health and Welfare should produce a form for a statement under section 11 LUL and for reporting to the prosecutor when a sanction is not working properly.</p>
<p>We also recommend that relatively extensive training be carried out within the social services on the sanction system for juvenile offenders.</p>
<p>Attention has previously drawn in various contexts to the added value that good collaboration between the social services and the judicial system can create. The evaluation of the 1999 sanctions reform indicates, however, that the hopes raised for such increased collaboration and co-operation have not been met, but that a lot remains to be done on this issue. We therefore consider that it should be made sure that procedures are created that result in collaboration being established in Sweden between the participants involved in interventions against juvenile crime. We recommend that the social services endeavour for social welfare officers and representatives of the judicial system to regularly share information and experiences at the general level.</p>
<p>Fines</p>
<p>We have found that the disadvantages associated with the penalty of fines for young offenders are so evident that it should be endeavoured to reduce use of the punishment of fines in the form of day-fines for this group of offenders.</p>
<p>As stated above, the Commission is proposing a new arrangement for waiver of prosecution. The proposal is designed in such a way that the number of decisions on a formal caution will increase in relation to the number of waivers of prosecution at present. If the proposal leads to legislation, the need to use fines will therefore decrease.</p>
<p>As is developed in more detail in the following section, the Commission recommends that youth service be made into a separate sanction. One reason for introducing a sanction alternative of this kind for juvenile offenders is that it is preferable in many respects for young people than fines and other sanctions. In particular, it can replace in particular fines to a great extent. We also consider that it appears fit for the purpose to increase use of youth service at the expense of fines when there is a need to combine the social service sanction with an additional sanction.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that payment and collection procedures should be designed in such a way as to counteract the negative consequences that can ensue from the punishment of fines today for young people under the age of 21. We recommend that it be made possible for young people who have been sentenced to fines to contact the agency already at the time they are imposed with a view to reaching agreement on a timetable for payment. An alternative proposal that we are presenting is for it to be made possible for young offenders to have an extended period of time to pay fines. We recommend that the National Police Board be instructed to investigate how this could be designed, after consultation with the Tax Agency.</p>
<p>Youth service</p>
<p>The sanctions reform in 1999 led to the introduction of youth service as an additional sanction to the sanction of being handed over to the care of the social services. The task of administering youth service was placed on the municipalities, although no formal obligation was imposed on them to do this. In its evaluation of the reform in autumn 2001, the National Crime Prevention Council found that only just over half of the municipalities were able to arrange youth service.</p>
<p>Our review of the sanction system has shown that there is a need for additional sanction alternatives for young offenders. It is important that there are alternatives that, to the greatest possible extent, can replace the use of fines and shorter periods of deprivation of liberty. This need is particularly pressing for the age group 15 to 17. In this connection, we have found that youth service, correctly designed, can be a clear and educational sanction for young people. Youth service can also be considered as being compatible with the penal law principles of proportionality, predictability and consequence. We therefore recommend that youth service be introduced as a separate sanction for young offenders. We further recommend that it should be made mandatory for the municipalities to administer youth service. The present arrangements conflict with the principle of everyone’s equality before the law and cannot be considered as being compatible with Article 2 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
<p>Youth service cannot be ranked in order of severity in relation to the other sanctions. Our view is that the court should instead have the greatest possible ability to apply the sanction that is most appropriate in the individual case. However, the use of youth service should be restricted to other cases than those where only fines are stipulated for the crime in question. Although youth service as a separate sanction can be used for young offenders up to the age of 21, limited use should be made of it for young offenders aged between 18 and 20.</p>
<p>Youth service is to consist of unpaid work that includes components that clarify the conditions of youth service for the young person and enable the young person to reflect on his or her life situation and discuss the crime he or she has committed. Youth service is also to consist of a concluding element where young people are given feedback as to how they have performed during enforcement of the sanction. The components that do not consist of work are to take up a small amount of the youth service hours in the sentenced. The National Board of Health and Welfare is to be empowered to issue regulations for the detailed design and management of youth service. The number of hours of youth service as a separate sanction shall be at least 20 and at most 150.</p>
<p>The court shall also in future regard the young person as suitable for youth service in order to be able to sentence to this sanction. However, in the view of the Commission, the level for which a person shall come into question for youth service should not be set particularly high. A further prerequisite for the court being able to sentence to youth service is that the accused has consented to it.</p>
<p>The social services are to draw up an individual work plan for each young person sentenced to youth service. A supervisor for the young offender sentenced to youth service is to be appointed at each workplace where the youth service is to be performed. Both the supervisor at the workplace and the social services are to check that the work plan is complied with.</p>
<p>Poor conduct of a more serious kind is to lead to the prosecutor instituting court proceedings for variation of the youth service. When justified, the prosecutor or court may issue a caution to the young person. We recommend that the National Board of Health and Welfare issue regulations and general guidelines on the measures to be taken by the social services in situations where the conduct of the young person sentenced to youth service is unsatisfactory in various ways.</p>
<p>In cases when major changes are required in an existing work plan, the matter should also normally be considered by the court. We consider that the National Board of Health and Welfare should also provide guidance in these situations.</p>
<p>The social service sanction in combination with youth service or fines</p>
<p>There are strong reasons of public benefit to use to the greatest possible extent the sanction that can be considered to be most effective for preventing the young person from re-offending. It is also important to avoid sanctions involving deprivation of liberty as far as possible. The scope for using the social service sanction should in the light of this be as extensive as possible. It should therefore continue to be possible for the court to combine the social service sanction either with youth service or fines if there is a need for this taking into consideration the principle of proportionality.</p>
<p>When the social service sanction is to be combined with an additional sanction, we recommend that it should be combined with youth service in the first place. Fines should in principle be used only when the young person is not regarded as suitable or does not consent to youth service.</p>
<p>We recommend that the National Board of Health and Welfare should design youth service as an additional sanction through implementing regulations.</p>
<p>The “rucksack” – various forms of support and supervison</p>
<p>As a component in strengthening the co-operation between the agencies, care providers and schools involved, the Commission was instructed to make proposals on a model where a person is appointed to be specially responsible for the young person by supervision and follow-up, and co-ordination of the measures and actions taken by society, a so-called “rucksack”.</p>
<p>In Sweden, the appointment of a contact person according to SoL is one of the most frequently used measures for children and young people. In the view of the Commission, an effective contact person, both according to SoL and LVU, can very well perform the intended “rucksack” role. The appointment of contact persons as a measure is therefore to continue to be available as to date.</p>
<p>The persons who are contact persons for young offenders who risk establishing a criminal lifestyle need special expertise and supervision to be able to perform good work. We therefore propose that the measure of appointment of a contact person be developed into a more advanced form of support when necessary. We consider that this measure should have a special name to indicate that the trained contact persons are to engage in a more skilled form of contact activity. We propose the name mentor. The National Board of Health and Welfare should provide guidance to the social services in the municipalities on the demands that should be placed on contact persons and mentors and on the social services.</p>
<p>We regard it as very important that the need for a mentor always be considered for persons under the age of 15 who commit crimes, in particular the very youngest. In the case of a social service sanction, it should be possible for the measure to be included in the youth contract or to be a part of LVU care. We recommend that the social services in the statement pursuant to section 11, LUL, shall give an account of their deliberations in this respect.</p>
<p>The intended “rucksack” is to adopt a holistic approach to the young person and his or her situation. Family, school, friends and the immediate environment are of key importance for the young person. It is therefore close at hand to draw parallels between the “rucksack” and the use of structured non-custodial care programmes. We can see that programmes of this kind can in many cases be a suitable measure for children and young people who commit crimes.</p>
<p>Mediation</p>
<p>We have been instructed to consider, among other things, the position in the judicial process that mediation should have. In this connection, we have concluded that there are no convincing reasons to introduce mediation as a sanction in the system of punishment. Neither are there solid reasons to introduce a system with conditional formal cautions. There are not either sufficient reasons to recommend that the circumstance that the young person takes part in mediation is to be a separate ground for a caution. The Commission has also rejected the idea of amending the rules in section 29 of the Penal Code with a view to getting the courts to take greater consideration to the fact that mediation has taken place when sentencing and deciding on a sanction.</p>
<p>However, we do consider that different possibilities should be made use of to increase the prerequisites for use of mediation. Although there is insufficient knowledge to be able to make any more definite statement on the rehabilitating effect of mediation on young offenders, the experiences of mediation to date must be considered to be good. It is therefore justified to assume that it would be positive if greater use were made of mediation in future. In the light of this, the Commission recommends that it shall be stated in the provision on a formal caution in section 17 of LUL that, when making an assessment of whether such a decision is to be made, special consideration shall be given to the willingness of the young person to participate in mediation pursuant to the Mediation Act. We therefore also recommend that the period of time for a decision in the issue of prosecution be extended in the cases when mediation can come into question.</p>
<p>With respect to how mediation should be organised, we have considered it most suitable that it take place within the municipal social services. In our view, there are not at present sufficient reasons to justify making mediation mandatory for municipalities. We recommend that the National Board of Health and Welfare be the co-ordinating national body in this area and that the Board be instructed to be responsible for providing continued support to mediation activities in Sweden.</p>
<p>Custodial youth care</p>
<p>Initiatives for young offenders are to be viewed in a holistic perspective where the social services have overall responsibility for long-term planning. The social services thus retain the main responsibility for the person sentenced for crimes and enforce the sanction of closed institutional juvenile care under the Enforcement of Custodial Youth Care Act (1998:603) (LSU).</p>
<p>However, the evaluation of the sanction shows that the statutory collaboration between the National Board of Institutional Care (SiS) and the social services has often not worked well. Among other things, there has been a lack of continuity and a long-term approach in assessments, planning and measures for those sentenced under LSU. The Commission considers that the deficiencies noted are a cause for concern. The findings of the Commission under this heading have also given the Commission reason to consider whether co-operation would benefit from different arrangements for enforcement of custodial youth care.</p>
<p>The persons sentenced to LSU almost always need some form of continued treatment and support after custodial care. We use the term “post-custodial care” as an overall term for these measures for those sentenced under LSU It was noted in the evaluation that there were serious deficiencies in the work of the social services in post-custodial care. Treatment measures were as a rule lacking or ceased soon after discharge. With a view to rectifying these deficiencies, the Commission proposes that post-custodial care be made part of the enforcement of custodial youth care and that SiS be made responsible for post-custodial care arrangements. SiS’s responsibility during post-custodial care is to be limited to the treatment measures that are justified due to the young person’s criminality. SiS’s work in enforcement is thus always to be related to the criminal conduct.</p>
<p>The recommendation for a new form of enforcement means that the court determines the tariff culpability of the crime in the ordinary way, i.e. the culpability measured in the number of months/years of custodial youth care, and sentences the young person to this sanction. If the time the sentenced person has to serve is at least four months – after taking into consideration the provisions on crediting of periods of deprivation of liberty and combination with other sentences – six months’ post-custodial care will be included in enforcement as a main rule. In these cases, the period of custodial care is to be reduced by two months.</p>
<p>Since there are situations when it is not appropriate to provide the young person with post-custodial care, SiS shall be able to make exceptions from the rule on post-custodial care. If the young person’s conduct is not satisfactory during the period of postcustodial care, it shall be possible for SiS to apply sanctions against him that entail either a caution or a return to custody.</p>
<p>The measures in connection with preparation for release from custody and after a period in custody are to be planned at an early stage of enforcement of the LSU sentence. The plan is to be confirmed by SiS in consultation with the social services.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we have found that the person sentenced to custodial youth care and who is not in custody shall be able to obtain a respite with enforcement if there are exceptional reasons for so doing. The Commission also recommends that it be made possible for the sentenced person to obtain a respite with enforcement if he or she has applied for clemency to the Government.</p>
<p>We have further found that the possibility for enforcing custodial youth care when detained should be expanded. We therefore propose that a person sentenced to custodial youth care who is detained for new crimes before enforcement of the sentence has begun, shall be able to be detained and undergo custodial youth care at the same time.</p>
<p>According to the existing arrangements, enforcement of a sentence of custodial youth care always starts at a locked facility. We consider that an exception from this requirement should be introduced.</p>
<p>The evaluation showed that there are serious deficiencies in the drawing up of treatment plans for those in custodial care. The requirement that the treatment plan is to be drawn up by SiS in consultation with the social services is not always complied with either. We draw attention to the importance of compliance with the existing rules in this area.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the deficiencies noted in the evaluation with respect to the mental health of young people sentenced under LSU are serious. It is important that these deficiencies are rectified as soon as possible. However, many concrete proposals have been made over the years without these having led to any legislative measures or other decisions with a direct practical importance for the ability to rectify the deficiencies that have existed for a long time. We have therefore considered it less meaningful to make additional proposals in this area. We want instead to emphasise the importance of the measures already taken, in combination with the recommendations made previously and those which will be placed on the participants in question, leading to the persons sentenced under LSU having their needs for trained psychiatric help met.</p>
<p>The sanction combination probation and prison</p>
<p>Our task also included considering whether there is reason to retain the sanction combination of probation and prison for young offenders. We consider that there are not sufficient reasons to replace the sanction combination probation and prison for young offenders by any other sanction combination. We have not otherwise found sufficient reasons to abolish this sanction combination. It should accordingly continue to be possible in exceptional cases to sentence offenders aged between 15 and 17 to probation in combination with prison.</p>
<p>Detention and other supervision of young persons sentenced for offences</p>
<p>It is not possible to refrain from use of personal coercive measures against young people. However, it is important to find forms for such supervision that entail a reasonable balance to be struck between the contradictory interests involved.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the existing rules on when young people may be detained are designed in such a way as to entail that a reasonable balance is struck between the interests concerned.</p>
<p>With respect to the alternatives to detention in the Code of Judicial Procedure (RB), it is in our view difficult to see what measures that could conceivably increase the applicability of supervision pursuant to Chapter 24, section 4, RB within its existing framework. However, we recommend that Chapter 25, section 1, RB, be amended to clarify that the section contains three separate cases where a travel prohibition and obligation to report can replace detention. To increase the ability to use this section, the obligation to report could also be complied with at designated social services facilities. The Commission further recommends that clarification be made in Chapter 25, section 2, RB to draw attention to the ability of the court to combine a decision on an obligation to report with necessary conditions.</p>
<p>Immediate coercive taking into custody under LVU can also be an alternative to detention of the young person. However, we have found that the current provisions on coercive taking into custody in LVU are sufficiently far-reaching, provided that the social services make use of the opportunities offered by the system of rules. There is thus no reason to increase the ability to take into custody. However, the National Board of Health and Welfare should in its regulations and general guidelines better clarify than at present the responsibility of the social welfare committee in this respect.</p>
<p>We recommend that the prosecutor shall notify the social welfare committee when a person under the age of 21 is detained. The committee is to be obliged to make a written statement to the prosecutor within a set period on its position with respect to the measures in the social services that can be applied as an alternative to detention. An arrangement of this kind should be able to counteract young people being detained despite there being prerequisites for alternative measures within the social services or that the young person after the detention decision has to remain in detention for a longer period than necessary.</p>
<p>To shorten the period of detention for young offenders who are in remand prison pending sentence to custodial youth care attaining legal force, it is proposed that the court shall be able to order that the judgment be enforced immediately.</p>
<p>The Commission has considered whether a new alternative to detention should be introduced. An alternative form of supervision could be a new arrangement for deprivation of liberty of young people with their being placed at a special home for young persons. However, we have found that the disadvantages attached to making an arrangement of this kind are so substantial, in relation to the possible benefits, that no recommendation should be made to this effect. Another alternative form of supervision to detention could be for the young person to be confined to their home with intensive supervision in the form of electronic supervision (IÖV), so-called tagging. We have, however, considered for various reasons that it is not suitable to introduce such an arrangement.</p>
<p>The Commission has also considered the possibility of placing detained young people at special homes for young people to avoid their being placed in a general remand prison. However, in an overall assessment, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages that placement at SiS could entail. The Commission has therefore not found reason to make any recommendations to this effect.</p>
<p>It is thus not possible to do without young detained persons being placed in general remand prisons. However, we consider that there are good possibilities to improve conditions for young people in remand prisons. The work of the Prison and Probation Service with young detainees should continue and be developed. The special responsibility of agencies for the age group is to be shown by legislation on treatment of those detained in remand prisons. It shall be stated there that conditions for young people under the age of 18 are to be adapted to the special needs of young people and that the young persons are to be the subject of special measures during their stay in remand prison with a view to easing their situation.</p>
<p>Crediting of time for deprivation of liberty for crimes</p>
<p>We recommend that it be made possible for a person sentenced to imprisonment or custodial youth care to be credited in certain cases with the time that he has been taken into custody under LVU. A requirement for this is that the deprivation of liberty took place due to suspected crime that has then been tried through the judgment. It shall further be required for crediting that the deprivation of liberty has been of such a kind as to be equivalent to detention or arrest. The question of whether crediting is to take place should be considered by the court when the case is being decided. It should be stipulated in a new provision in Chapter 33 of the Penal Code that the court may credit time for the deprivation of liberty in question to the extent that it is equitable taking into consideration the circumstances.</p>
<p>Co-ordination of expertise and method development and spreading of general information and knowledge</p>
<p>Expertise on care and treatment of young people with behavioural problems is spread among many different actors. A lot of funds and resources are invested in research and development in many quarters.</p>
<p>It is of the greatest importance that the measures taken for children and young people with asocial behaviour are based on science or confirmed experience. It is therefore important to find an arrangement that leads to the results of research and the investments made being disseminated so that they come to the knowledge of those who can apply these results in their activities, for instance, the social services in the municipalities. There is a need for an actor with a holistic vision and with responsibility for monitoring the research carried out and ongoing activity. This actor should also be able to spread such information and knowledge. Since this concerns measures for children and young people, the National Board of Health and Welfare would seem, in the view of the Commission, to be the natural choice for this task.</p>
<p>The Commission thus recommends that the National Board of Health and Welfare be made responsible for co-ordinating the development of expertise and method and for spreading general information and knowledge on juvenile crime and public intervention to the social services.</p>
<p>Damages due to crime</p>
<p>According to the evaluation, a survey showed that young people sentenced to custodial youth care were also ordered to pay damages to a great extent. The evaluation referred to also stated that joint and several liability for payment was associated with a number of negative effects. The financial demands were perceived by the young people as impossible to overview and unfair. The demands contribute to making more difficult re-adaptation to a normal life without black work and crime. Moreover, joint damages link together young people in a destructive way. Although this issue was not mentioned in the terms of reference of the Commission, we have, in the light of this, taken the view that there is reason to consider whether the present arrangements for joint and several liability for young offenders are designed in an appropriate way.</p>
<p>The main rule is that the person is responsible for damage shall compensate for it, i.e. pay full compensation for it. Certain exceptions have been made, however, in the Tort Liability Act (1972:207). The amount of damages can in certain cases be reduced after an assessment of equitability, for instance, if the person liable to pay damages is under the age of 18 (Chapter 2, section 4). We consider that the area of application for the adjustment rule in Chapter 2, section 4, of the Tort Liability Act should be expanded to include the age group from 18 to 20. However, we refrain from recommending generally increased opportunities for adjustment of liability to damages resting on young offenders.</p>
<p>If several persons are liable for damages for the same damage, they are jointly and severally liable under Chapter 6, section 4. The main rule on joint and several liability does not apply, however, when the liability for damages is limited for any of those involved. In the view of the Commission, there is reason to consider whether there should be increased opportunity to depart from joint and several liability and whether the current exemption from joint and several liability should instead be the main rule for young offenders. However, the issue is of general and principled importance and more complex than what is contained within the terms of reference of the Commission. We have therefore decided not to make any recommendations on amendment of the rules in Chapter 6, section 4. However, we consider that the issue of joint and several liability for damages for young people who have committed crimes is important and that it should be subject to further consideration in a more appropriate context.</p>
<p>We have found that there are reasons to consider the measures that can be taken with respect to the administrative procedures on payment of damages with a view to counteracting unnecessary payment arrears at the Enforcement Service. However, we refrain from making any recommendations in this area since the matter of deficiencies is in collection of damages is being currently considered by the Government Offices.</p>
<p>Financial consequences of the Commission’s proposals</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposals entail a considerable improvement in the intervention of public authority in juvenile crime. The Commission considers that it should be possible to finance a number of the proposals within the existing financial limits by changing priorities within existing resources. However, all recommendations cannot be implemented without additional costs for both the central and local government sector.</p>
