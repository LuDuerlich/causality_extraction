<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Inquiry’s recommendation</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s recommendation is that continued work towards the final report should focus on switching to a single flat tax rate. On a provisional estimate, this flat tax rate would be 21.7 per cent.</p>
<h2>Background of the Inquiry</h2>
<p>It is evident from the report of the Parliamentary Committee on Taxation, 2001/2002:SkU18, that the Committee had received several motions proposing that the value added tax rates should be overhauled. The motions demanded that new categories of goods and services should be taxed at a reduced rate or that the dividing lines in low tax areas should be reconsidered.</p>
<p>In its report, the Committee on Taxation described the substance of the motions that had been submitted and the background to the current regulations. As described by the Committee, the system had become increasingly complicated and difficult to understand and in some cases the distinction between what should be taxable at a reduced rate or exempted from taxation appeared puzzling and unfair. When a closely related and comparable area was taxed at a higher rate, the question of where lines were drawn between the areas sometimes gave rise to sensitive and protracted arguments about fairness.</p>
<p>The Committee also described how the Swedish Tax Administration was obliged to make delicate decisions on whether goods and activities should be classified in one category or another and how business operators sometimes devoted considerable effort and expense to obtaining more advantageous value added taxation for the specific goods and services that they produced.</p>
<p>In light of all this, the Committee considered that the Government should look over the issue. The Riksdag (Swedish Parliament) endorsed the proposal of the Committee on Taxation and therefore notified the Government that an inquiry should be appointed (Parliamentary Communication 2001/02:199). The Government issued terms of reference for the inquiry on 28 November 2002 (dir. 2002:141). Supplementary terms of reference were issued on 11 November 2004 (dir. 2004:154).</p>
<p>Terms of reference</p>
<p>The terms of reference issued to the Value Added Tax Rate Inquiry instruct it to identify the demarcation problems associated with the current regulations on reduced tax rates and exemptions from taxation. The purpose of the Inquiry is to limit these demarcation problems. The review is also required to include an analysis of the tax rate structure from legal, administrative, economic, distribution policy and budgetary points of view. The Inquiry is to shed light on the impact on competitiveness and take international aspects into account. The Inquiry is also directed to submit proposals for necessary changes. One special task for the Inquiry is to look at the effects that the value added tax legislation passed in 1996 and 1997 has had in the cultural sector.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s terms of reference envisage a two-stage process. The aim of this first stage is to present the survey and analysis of the current situation. This report is also expected to describe possible alternative tax rate structures and their general effects. This interim report should also explain the advantages and disadvantages of the different alternatives and assess their appropriateness.</p>
<p>Following circulation of this report for comments, the Inquiry will present proposals in a final report no later than 1 October 2006.</p>
<h2>Current regulations</h2>
<p>Sweden has a standard value added tax rate (25 %) and two reduced tax rates (6 and 12 %). In addition, in a few cases a zero tax rate applies (pharmaceuticals dispensed on prescription and production of certain magazines). Finally, there are regulations on exemptions from taxation (exemptions without any right to deduct input VAT).</p>
<p>The system is constructed so that the standard tax rate applies except in cases where there are special regulations directing that a reduced tax rate or tax exemption shall apply. The following lists show the main cases in which a reduced tax rate applies in Sweden today.</p>
<p>The 12 per cent tax rate applies to:</p>
<p>• letting of rooms and camping</p>
<p>• sale of works of art owned by the artist or the artist’s estate</p>
<p>• import of works of art, collectors’ items and antiques</p>
<p>• foodstuffs.</p>
<p>The 6 per cent tax rate applies to:</p>
<p>• books, newspapers, magazines, etc.</p>
<p>• entrance fees to concerts, circuses, cinemas, theatres, opera and ballet performances, zoos and commercial sports events</p>
<p>• granting or transfer of rights associated with the field of culture</p>
<p>• sporting activities in cases where the services are not provided by the state, a municipality or a  non-profit association</p>
<p>• passenger transport.</p>
<p>Apart from these regulations on reduced tax rates there are also regulations on tax exemptions. These regulations follow current EC provisions and apply, for example, to medical care, education and some cultural services.</p>
<h2>Points of departure</h2>
<p>The intention has been to compare the present system and its three different tax rates with other alternatives. The possible alternatives for the sake of comparison are a value added tax system based on a flat tax rate, or an arrangement with a standard tax rate plus a single reduced rate of tax. The analysis is intended to lead to conclusions about the positive and negative effects that may result in the event of a change in the regulations on tax rates. Under the Inquiry’s terms of reference, the review should aim to limit the demarcation problems.</p>
<p>Proposals for changes in the value added tax system that have cost consequences must be accompanied by proposals for financing within the value added tax system. This implies that the alternative tax rate structures and tax rate changes that are analysed must be designed so that lower value added tax receipts for certain types of consumption are wholly counterbalanced by higher receipts from other types of consumption.</p>
<h2>Demarcation problems</h2>
<p>The report contains a thorough survey of the demarcation problems associated with the application of reduced tax rates in different areas. The survey shows clearly that there are substantial demarcation problems in most of the areas where a reduced tax rate is applicable. Even if the legislator has tried carefully to describe the sales of goods and services that are intended to fall within the scope of a reduced tax rate, in practice it appears that demarcation problems very often arise.</p>
<p>The problems lie in determining whether the sale of a good or service belongs in the low-tax or in the full-tax area. Decisions of this kind are made by the Swedish Tax Agency or by courts. Questions frequently arise.</p>
<p>In a system involving differentiated tax rates, it is businesses that use different tax rates that have most difficulty applying the correct rate. These businesses need to be able to decide which tax rate is applicable before selling a good or service. In certain cases they can do this without any great difficulty. However, different VAT rates can also considerably complicate application of the rules. This is the case, for example, when the business is new, when it changes direction, when the types of sales are not easy to define, or when rules or practices have changed. Examples of situations that have often proved very difficult to assess are where to draw the line between food (12 %) and restaurant service (25 %), what constitutes sport (6 %) and what does not (25 %), and where to draw the line between different sales in the cultural area (6, 12 or 25 %, or tax-exempt).</p>
<p>Difficulties in assessing which tax rate to apply can also have troublesome financial consequences for business operators if they misinterpret the regulations. In such cases the business may face a retroactive liability to report to the Swedish Tax Agency the amounts corresponding to taxation at the correct rate, and may also be liable for any additional taxes due. In these cases it is obviously difficult for the business operator to turn to the original customer, long after the transaction has been completed, to request payment of a corresponding amount.</p>
<p>Differentiated VAT rates also lead to demarcation and application problems of a slightly different nature. These concern cases where goods and services are supplied together, often for a single payment. These situations are very common in practice. One example is when a visitor pays an entrance fee to an amusement park and the entrance ticket is also valid for a concert in the park. If different VAT rates are applicable, as in this case, problems of assessment and valuation arise that are not easy to deal with. Other examples are services supplied at hotel and health establishments (lodging 12 %, breakfast 25 %, some preventive health activities that are classified as sport for VAT purposes 6 %, health care, which is VAT-exempt, etc.), services associated with passenger transport (transport 6 %, cabin 12 %, restaurant service 25 %), and various goods that are supplied along with books and magazines (books and magazines 6 %, CDs 25 %, various gift items 25 %). Since the circumstances are never exactly the same from case to case, the issues are of a nature that prevents their ever being fully resolved by case-law. If there were no differentiated VAT rates or no VAT exemptions, this type of problem of application would not arise at all.</p>
<p>A number of proposals have been made for extending the VAT rate for culture to goods and services that are now taxed at 25 per cent. In these cases it has been claimed that on grounds of demarcation, fairness or competition there is reason to place these goods and services on the same footing as goods and services in the cultural area that are now taxed at 6 per cent. Goods and services that are more or less clearly linked to cultural life are currently taxed variously at 6, 12 or 25 per cent, or in some cases are VAT-exempt.</p>
<p>If any such extension of the low-VAT area is undertaken, this will automatically lead to a need to adjudicate new demarcation problems, at least for a transitional period. It is a moot question whether new provisions of this type will reduce demarcation and other problems in the long term. There is a risk that they will have the opposite effect.</p>
<p>However, more extensive work than has been possible when producing this interim report is required to allow a detailed assessment of the feasibility of dealing with the new demarcation problems that would arise from an extension of the area in which a reduced tax rate applies. A more in-depth analysis of this kind may be warranted if, after receiving consultation comments on this interim report, the Inquiry works in its final report on the assumption that the way to achieve necessary simplification is not, as now advocated, to introduce a flat tax rate but instead to modify the present regulations.</p>
<h2>Administrative costs and compliance costs</h2>
<p>From the point of view of demarcation, as from the perspective of competition and fairness, it is obvious that a transition to a single flat rate of VAT is preferable. There are considerable simplification gains to be made from applying a single tax rate. The size of the sums to be gained from simplification can be estimated on the basis of the account of administrative costs to the authorities and compliance costs to companies.</p>
<p>It should be emphasised, above all, that simplification is significant for companies. Even if complicated tax regulations always entail increased costs for the authorities concerned, the consequences are considerably greater for the companies that have to apply the regulations. In view of the large number of companies that are liable for VAT, regulatory simplification has a significant impact. Another aspect is that companies that are currently actually allowed to apply a reduced rate of VAT may feel that the direct financial benefits of the reduced rate are greater than the difficulties caused by the differentiation as such. This is presumably also the reason why various industries would like to be allowed to begin to apply a reduced tax rate in their business.</p>
<p>In order to obtain an idea of the scale of the costs involved, the Inquiry has made a comparison with the costs that would arise if only one tax rate were used (retaining the present exemptions from taxation).</p>
<p>A switch to a flat rate of VAT would enable authorities and taxable persons to save costs. The sum arrived at by the Inquiry, with the assistance of the head office of the Swedish Tax Agency and a survey at the Tax Agency in Växjö, indicates a cost to the authorities of around SEK 164 million per year. For taxable persons, compliance costs for VAT attributable to the need to apply more than one tax rate have been estimated to amount to approximately SEK 600-700 million per year.</p>
<h2>Competition aspects</h2>
<p>The point of the proposals that have been put forward in different connections that new sectors should be allowed to apply a reduced tax rate is not always to solve real demarcation problems. The intention is instead to increase the fairness of taxation, in the view of those making such proposals.</p>
<p>Differentiation of VAT rates and regulations granting exemptions from VAT affect the conditions for competition between different companies. VAT differentiation means that producers of different goods and services are treated differently. Production goes down in more highly taxed areas, while production in areas with lower taxes is affected positively. If there is a high degree of substitutability between goods and services with different tax rates, this situation can be described as a direct distortion of competition.</p>
<p>Clearly, the lower VAT rates have often come about so as to specially influence the consumption of certain goods and services, which in turn affects economic conditions for the companies that produce those particular goods or services. A reduced rate of VAT, which is a means of increasing consumer demand for a good or service, can be said to entail a form of subsidy for the business that produces the good or service.</p>
<p>European Community law contains certain requirements for equal treatment of similar or competing products. However, this obviously does not prevent the Member States from using differentiated VAT rates, it merely means there are certain restrictions in view of the risk of distorting competition. It is difficult to know exactly where to draw the line. While there is no reason to suppose that present Swedish differentiations are not permissible under Community law, this does not mean they are unproblematic from a competition point of view in economic and practical terms.</p>
<p>It is obvious that a value added tax differentiation aimed at favouring a certain type of consumption or production should always be questioned from the standpoint of competition. It may seem surprising that such aspects have not been more influential when decisions have been taken on reduced VAT rates. The arguments for such changes have mainly focused on potential positive effects that it may be supposed will arise for the industry receiving the tax reduction. Little consideration has generally been given to the impact on other actors, which it must often be assumed will be of a negative nature.</p>
<p>Different VAT rates therefore affect conditions for competition. Criticisms concerning inequities often stem from a feeling among business operators who sell goods or services for which the lower VAT rates are not applicable that they are at a competitive disadvantage. They can also originate from a more general argument about fairness that is not related to a concrete competitive situation. Nonetheless, criticisms of the present system show that competition aspects should be taken seriously. The Inquiry also believes it is impossible in principle to design a system based on differentiated tax rates that everyone will consider fair.</p>
<p>Developments also show that any differentiation automatically leads to pressure for a further increase in the use of differentiated VAT rates.</p>
<h2>Internationalisation</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s terms of reference indicate that international competition issues are a factor that must be taken into account when determining a suitable structure for tax rates. The increasing internationalisation of trade in goods and services can affect not only what total levy of indirect taxes, such as value added tax, is appropriate and practicable. The tax rate structure chosen can also be more or less optimal from the point of view of internationalisation.</p>
<p>The Tax Base Inquiry (Swedish Government Official Reports 2002:47) gave as its opinion that the standard Swedish tax rate is high compared with the level applied in other EU countries and that the differences therefore have a one-sided effect to Sweden’s disadvantage. The Tax Base Inquiry advocates a reorganisation of taxes so as to replace the present differentiated system with a lower general VAT rate.</p>
<p>The Value Added Tax Rate Inquiry notes that very little attention has been paid to internationalisation aspects when determining the present Swedish VAT rate structure. The standard tax rate of 25 per cent has been in existence for many years. Before the work of the Tax Base Inquiry, probably no very close thought was given to the question of how well judged the standard tax rate is from the point of view of internationalisation.</p>
<p>We have found that there are areas where a VAT rate of 25 per cent is problematic in view of internationalisation. This is true, for example, of trade by private persons across internal EU borders, primarily in capital goods (such as second-hand cars). With respect to trade in capital goods, the Inquiry learned from a visit to Copenhagen that such trade is extensive. There it mainly involves Danish nationals taking advantage of the lower tax rate in Germany for purchases of capital goods.</p>
<p>A problem that is potentially even more significant is the crossborder trade in various services. This includes Internet shopping, but also telecommunications and radio and television services. Community regulations on taxation of these services mean that if there is a substantial difference between the Swedish VAT level and the VAT level in other EU countries, Swedish companies could be driven out of business by the competition or, in the long run, forced to move their business abroad. On the other hand we have established that the areas in which Sweden currently applies the lower VAT rates are in the main not exposed to any decisive international competition. The Community regulations are designed so as in principle only to allow the use of reduced tax rates in cases where this cannot lead to competition problems for other countries in the internal market. The fact that other EU countries also have lower VAT rates on many of the goods and services on which we currently apply reduced tax rates will therefore broadly speaking not necessarily mean competition problems for Sweden if we introduce a single flat rate of value added tax.</p>
<h2>The economy and differentiated value added tax</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has estimated the different costs to the Swedish economy of different VAT rate structures. The costs have then been expressed as the loss of consumer utility that can be presumed to occur as a result of the tax being levied. The estimates are based on the assumption that in the long run and given perfect competition, a change in the VAT levied will be fully reflected in consumer prices. Assuming that consumption does not give rise to external effects, the change in consumer utility can then be measured on the basis of the price elasticity of demand.</p>
<p>The connection between price sensitivity and, on the one hand, the level of the VAT rate and, on the other hand, consumer utility has sometimes been advanced as a reason for different VAT rate structures. The Inquiry concludes, however, that the potential impact of budget-neutral VAT changes on total consumption and consumer utility is limited and uncertain. This can therefore not be made the basis on which to build a new system of VAT rates. An analysis of consumer utility can, however, provide one among several valuable inputs when undertaking an overall assessment of the structure of VAT rates.</p>
<p>According to the Inquiry’s estimates, a switch to a flat rate of VAT on the goods and services that are presently included in the VAT system would be weakly positive for total household consumer utility. This means that the new production structure that would result from such a change in the VAT rate structure would overall be at least as rational as the current structure of production.</p>
<p>The present differentiation of tax rates is the result of political considerations, often based on the desire to control consumption patterns or purchasing power by influencing relative prices. In recent years, value added tax has increasingly been used as a political policy lever of this type.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s review of value added tax as a policy lever shows that in many cases it is questionable how effective the reduced rate of VAT has been in terms of the intended effect on consumption patterns or purchasing power. There is therefore reason to investigate whether methods other than reduced VAT might be available if politicians want to move consumption, production or household purchasing power in a certain direction in the future. Value added tax could then be made a pure financing instrument.</p>
<p>A budget-neutral switch to a new VAT rate structure will not affect general government sector finances. This means that overall company and household finances will also be unaffected.</p>
<p>Budget neutrality in connection with a switch to a new VAT rate structure will not apply to every individual household. Since households consume different goods, those households that consume relatively large amounts of the goods on which the VAT rate is reduced will win relative to the households that consume relatively large amounts of the goods on which the VAT rate is increased.</p>
<p>If a switch is made to a flat-rate value added tax, the VAT system will become somewhat less progressive. Households with lower economic standards will pay more VAT while households with higher standards will pay less VAT, in relative terms. The change in economic standard associated with a switch to a flat VAT structure is limited and will amount to at most ± 0.5 per cent per year between different types of household.</p>
<p>The introduction of a VAT rate structure with a standard tax rate and only one reduced rate could have economic effects similar to those that would result from the introduction of a flat rate of VAT. These effects would, however, be less extensive and would depend on which goods and services were still taxable at the reduced rate.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s recommendation is that continued work towards the final report should focus on switching to a single flat tax rate. On a provisional estimate, this flat tax rate would be 21.7 per cent. The exact percentage rate depends partly on whether certain sales that now have zero VAT can be taxed at the flat rate. This applies in the pharmaceuticals sector in particular.</p>
<p>The reasons on which we base our recommendation that a flat rate of value added tax should be chosen are essentially as follows.</p>
<p>The present differentiation of VAT into three different levels – 6, 12 and 25 per cent – causes demarcation problems. It is quite simply often unclear which tax rate is applicable. The analysis has shown that these demarcation problems can scarcely be remedied effectively by, for example, modifying the text of the law.</p>
<p>These demarcation problems become a direct cost for the authorities and business operators responsible for applying value added tax.</p>
<p>A system with the standard tax rate and just one reduced tax rate may work better than the current structure with its three different</p>
<p>tax rates, though this depends on which goods and services qualify for the reduced tax rate. In principle, however, the nature of the problems remains the same, no matter whether one or two reduced tax rates are to apply. A single flat rate of tax would completely eliminate these demarcation problems.</p>
<p>The existence of differentiated tax rates leads to concrete distortions of competition on a more or less serious scale. Demarcations can also result in certain actors considering that they are being treated unfairly, as their operations ought to be comparable, for one reason or another, to operations that are allowed to apply a reduced tax rate. It is difficult to draw the line between areas with different tax rates so as to prevent such inequities arising. It is therefore also difficult to design a system with differentiated VAT rates so as to ensure that the system can win general acceptance. As a result, a system with differentiated VAT rates tends to be unstable. The business operators who feel they are placed at a disadvantage by the advantageous tax rates granted to other operators press for broader reductions. This is presumably one of the factors behind developments so far. A flat rate, on the other hand, is easier to defend against different special interests. Consequently, a flatrate VAT is also a more stable source of financing for public sector undertakings. This was one of the major reasons for the principle of a flat-rate value added tax that was advanced in the 1990/91 Swedish tax reform.</p>
<p>Differentiated value added taxes are used as a means to favour certain types of business or certain groups of consumers. However, any differentiation also has a reverse effect. The goods and services that do not share in the lower VAT rate must instead be taxed at a higher rate than would have been the case without differentiation. This is an aspect that is not commented on when differentiations are proposed. In addition, a subsidy in the form of VAT differentiation becomes a permanent arrangement. It is not continuously reviewed to see whether it is still necessary. In contrast, subsidies that are paid more directly, by means of a grant, are generally subject to continuous follow-up.</p>
<p>VAT differentiation enables the political system to control consumer prices so as to lead consumer demand in a certain direction. In itself, this possibility of using VAT as a policy lever in support of cultural policy, distribution policy or other objectives may be assumed to have some value. However, one essential question in this context is whether VAT is the most appropriate measure for</p>
<p>exercising this type of control. The effects of a subsidy in the form of reduced VAT can often be difficult to judge in advance and hard to follow up after implementation. A VAT reduction can have different effects in the short and long term, and these effects can vary depending on the price elasticity of goods or services and other factors.</p>
<p>A subsidy in the form of reduced VAT is often expensive from the point of view of government finances. This is evident in the present situation. The lowering of the tax rate just on food, which leads to a redistribution of purchasing power from households with higher incomes to households with lower incomes of less than SEK 1 billion per year, means that in 2005, VAT on goods taxed at the standard rate has to be raised by nearly SEK 18 billion. In order to finance a subsidy in the form of low VAT in some selected sectors, the VAT level in the many unsubsidised sectors has to be set at the present rate of 25 per cent, instead of the 21.7 per cent that would otherwise have been possible.</p>
<p>A flat rate of VAT will therefore allow a substantial reduction in the tax level that applies for most goods and services. This is significant from the point of view of internationalisation. Goods and services that are exposed to international competition are now usually taxed at 25 per cent, even though the EU average is about 19.6 per cent. Value added tax at a flat rate of 21.7 per cent is a step towards levelling such differences, which are or may become troublesome from the point of view of competition. Meanwhile, on our assessment, there are no substantial problems of international competition associated with removing the lower tax rates that Sweden has at present.</p>
<p>It can therefore be concluded that a flat value added tax will reduce both the risk of a future erosion of the tax base as a result of the broader reductions for reasons of fairness or other reasons that can otherwise be feared, and the risk of the tax base being undermined by foreign competition.</p>
<p>As regards the impact on the national economy of a switch from a differentiated to a flat tax rate, it has become apparent that the effects are limited. It can be assumed that there will be only a limited positive impact on the effectiveness of the economy, measured in consumer utility. The reorganisation may therefore be considered largely neutral on average as far as consumers are concerned.</p>
<p>Reorganising VAT to produce a flat tax rate does nonetheless have certain effects for redistribution, in that the outcome will on average be slightly worse for households with lower incomes than for households with high incomes. These effects are due mainly to a slight reduction in the progressiveness of the VAT levy as a result of VAT on food being raised to the new general level of 21.7 per cent. However, the distributional effects are not large, being mostly in the order of SEK 100 or less per month per household. These effects should therefore, in our opinion, not stand in the way of a simplification of the VAT system that is otherwise desirable. Naturally, the possibility can be considered of correcting these distributional effects by other measures outside the framework of the VAT system. For example, minor adjustments in the income tax regulations or measures taking the form of limited changes in transfers to certain households could be relevant options, perhaps combined with other alterations in such systems. If this is done, of course, it is important that the measures are carried out in a way that prevents any negative administrative effects arising. In its work so far, the Inquiry has not given any detailed thought to ways of designing any such compensatory measures. It may be appropriate to study the issue further if the aim is to correct for the effects mentioned above.</p>
<p>A switch to a flat-rate value added tax will naturally affect all taxable persons and all consumers to a greater or lesser degree. The simplifications of the tax system are to everyone’s advantage. For most companies, the lower level of value added tax will also be an advantage in economic terms because of the resulting impact on prices and demand. Naturally, companies that now sell goods or services that qualify for reduced VAT may, on the other hand, experience negative economic effects in the form of lower demand. Nonetheless, overall a switch to a flat value added tax has such general advantages that the Inquiry considers this the right way to go. The Inquiry’s recommendation to undertake such a simplification would also mean a return to the important principles that lay behind the 1990/91 Swedish tax reform, which was based on the ideas of simplicity and consistency.</p>
