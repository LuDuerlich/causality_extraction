<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Inquiry on certain issues concerning corporate fines was tasked with conducting a broad review of corporate fine regulations and proposing necessary legislative amendments. Under the Inquiry’s terms of reference, the aim of the review was to ensure that the criminal law regulatory framework for legal persons is efficient, effective and modern, and that it is adapted to Sweden’s obligations under EU law and other international commitments. The remit included:</p>
<p>• considering whether corporate fines should be designed as a punishment or as a special legal consequence of a criminal act;</p>
<p>• considering whether the limitation to crimes committed in the exercise of business activities is effective, or whether the scope of application should be changed;</p>
<p>• considering and proposing an increase in the maximum amount for corporate fines;</p>
<p>• reviewing the basis for calculating the size of corporate fines;</p>
<p>• reviewing the relation between corporate fines and individual criminal liability, and taking a position on how issues concerning the accumulation of sanctions should be resolved; and</p>
<p>• analysing whether there is a need for additional legislative measures so that Sweden can live up to its commitments  vis-à-vis the OECD.</p>
<p>Below is a summary of the most important proposals and assessments in the report.</p>
<h2>Punishment or special legal consequence of a criminal act (chapter 8)</h2>
<p>Corporate fines are currently a special legal consequence of a criminal act.  We have considered whether there are reasons to instead allow corporate fines to constitute a punishment.</p>
<p>We consider that it is not of decisive importance for the deterrent effect of corporate fines whether or not they are labelled a special legal consequence of a criminal act or a punishment. Nor, in our view, is there any other circumstance which, on its own or combined with other circumstances, clearly indicates that corporate fines should be labelled a punishment. In this context, it is worth mentioning that Sweden’s international commitments do not require that corporate fines be labelled punishments and it is hardly likely that this will be the case in the future.</p>
<p>In Swedish law, there is currently a fundamental link between crime and punishment, and only the person having committed a crime can be sentenced to punishment. This link would be broken if corporate fines were labelled a punishment in future.</p>
<p>According to our assessment, therefore, a transition to labelling corporate fines a punishment should only be considered if there are clear advantages. We do not consider that such advantages exist. We therefore recommend that corporate fines continue to be designed as a special legal consequence of a criminal act.</p>
<h2>Scope of application of corporate fines (chapter 9)</h2>
<p>We propose that the scope of application of corporate fines be expanded so that they can also be imposed – as well as for crimes committed in the exercise of business activities – for crimes committed in the exercise of:</p>
<p>• public sector activities that can be equated with business activities; and</p>
<p>• other activities conducted by a legal person if the illegal act or, where relevant, failure to act, was intended to bring the legal person financial benefit.</p>
<p>Sweden’s commitments in the EU and internationally</p>
<p>We consider that the restriction to crimes committed in the exercise of business activities means that legal persons cannot always be held to account in the situations required by our commitments in the EU, for example. This alone is reason to expand the scope of application of corporate fines so that they also to a certain extent cover crimes in other activities.</p>
<p>Purposes of the regulations on corporate fines</p>
<p>Corporate fines can currently be imposed for crimes committed by sole traders, e.g. in independent schools. Yet the regulations do not cover crimes committed in corresponding municipal activities, which are not commercial in character, such as municipal schools. This difference does not seem justified. In our view, there are therefore reasons to expand the scope of application of corporate fines to also cover crimes committed in the exercise of public sector activities that can be equated with business activities.</p>
<p>Corporate fines are intended, among other things, to counter the profit motives that may be behind crimes in business activities. In non-profit activities, for example, there are rarely any explicit profit motives. However, there may be an interest in keeping costs down in operations, for example, and thus also an interest in committing or allowing crimes to be committed in these activities. In our view, this is also an argument in favour of expanding the scope of application for the provisions on corporate fines.</p>
<p>Our proposal for an expanded scope of application</p>
<p>We consider that removing entirely the restriction to business activities would result in less predictability and thus also less effectiveness and legal certainty. The current restriction to crimes committed in the exercise of business activities should therefore remain unchanged. Instead, the scope of application should be expanded through supplementary provisions that can be applied in certain stated cases.</p>
<p>Our proposal that it should be possible to impose corporate fines for crimes committed in public sector activities that can be equated with business activities means that it will be possible to impose corporate fines for work environment crimes, for example, committed in state, county council or municipal activities that could also have been run by a private body. We consider that the provision will have particular significance in health, social care and school activities.</p>
<p>Through our second proposal – that it should be possible to impose corporate fines on a legal person for crimes committed in activities that neither constitute nor can be equated with business activities, if the crime was intended to bring the legal person financial benefit – we want to ensure that Sweden fulfils its commitments in the EU and internationally. This provision should be applied when someone commits a crime, e.g. benefit fraud, with the aim of bringing about a revenue or a saving for the legal person. But it should also be possible to apply it when a representative of an association neglects to acquire necessary safety equipment – with the result that the association avoids an expense – and is thus ultimately guilty of a work environment offence.</p>
<h2>Size of corporate fines (chapter 10)</h2>
<p>We propose:</p>
<p>• that changes be made to the basis for determining the size of corporate fines;</p>
<p>• that the financial position of large companies be considered when determining the size of corporate fines for particularly reprehensible crimes; and</p>
<p>• that in such cases, it should be possible to impose corporate fines of up to SEK 100 million (‘increased corporate fine’).</p>
<p>Maximum amount for corporate fines</p>
<p>According to our assessment, there is no general need to raise the level of repression for companies. However, it is not difficult to imagine – as the OECD has pointed out – situations in which it is obvious that the current maximum level – SEK 10 million – seems much too low an amount to be a sufficiently tangible sanction. The fact that the equivalent maximum amount in several other European countries is considerably higher also indicates that the Swedish maximum amount is too low. Our conclusion is therefore that the current maximum level of corporate fines is not sufficiently high.</p>
<p>Neither Norwegian nor Danish law have an upper limit to the amount of the fines that can be imposed on legal persons. However, we consider that there are overwhelming reasons in favour of retaining an upper limit to the size of corporate fines. This has to do with the fact that corporate fines are a repressive sanction of economic character that serve the same purpose as a punishment, which places special demands in terms of predictability, for example.</p>
<p>Our proposal on determining corporate fines (see below) will mean that corporate fines of SEK 5 000 at the lowest and SEK 100 million at the highest can be imposed. According to our assessment, an increase of the maximum amount to SEK 100 million is sufficient to ensure that corporate fines represent a sufficiently intrusive sanction, also in relation to serious crimes committed in the exercise of large companies’ activities.</p>
<p>Corporate fines should be determined on the basis of the penalty for the crime ...</p>
<p>We consider that the basis for determining the size of corporate fines should be made clearer. We therefore propose that the legislative text state that corporate fines be determined on the basis of the penalty for the crime – the meaning of this term is stated more clearly in Chapter 29, Section 1 of the Swedish Penal Code. ... special consideration should also be given to the relation of the crime to the activities ...</p>
<p>Corporate fines should, in our view, be proportionate to the blame the company deserves as a result of the crime. The level of blame is not based on the crime’s penalty alone; it is a product in part of the penalty and the company’s link to the crime. This approach is expressed in the current legislative text in that special consideration is to be given to ‘the relation of the crime to the activities’. In our view, a new legislative text should also contain this wording. ... and to the harm or danger caused by the crime to life, health or the environment</p>
<p>The institution of corporate fines probably has a tangible practical significance concerning the prosecution of work environment and environmental crimes. To provide scope to continue imposing tangible corporate fines in the event of such crime, we propose that special consideration should be given when determining fines to ‘the harm or danger caused by the crime to life, health or the environment.’</p>
<p>We also propose that there be scope, as before, to consider whether a company has previously been required to pay corporate fines.</p>
<p>In the event of multiple crimes, a joint corporate fine should be imposed to cover all crimes</p>
<p>It is likely that the legislator’s intention was that a joint corporate fine for all crimes should – or at least should be able to – be imposed in the event of multiple crimes within a company. In our view, there are no reasons to make any changes in this regard. We propose that the principle of a joint corporate fine be set out in the legislative text. This kind of joint corporate fine should be determined in accordance with the same principles that apply when determining the penalty for multiple crimes, known as the ‘totality principle’.</p>
<p>For large companies, the company’s financial position should be considered when determining corporate fines for particularly reprehensible crimes</p>
<p>A system in which a company’s financial conditions have a direct impact on the corporate fines, e.g. some form of ‘day-fine’ system, does seem appealing in principle. However, if consideration must always be given to a company’s financial position when determining corporate fines, this can lead to major application problems and result in the law enforcement authorities having to invest considerable investigation resources into issues concerning the company’s economic situation. This leads us to the conclusion that the company’s financial position should not be considered in the event of a crime that should entail only a lower corporate fine. This means that no system should be introduced that is purely based on day fines. However, in the case of particularly reprehensible crimes, the need for sufficiently tangible sanctions is so great that this justifies a system whereby some weight can be given to the financial position of large companies.</p>
<p>We therefore propose a system that differentiates between small and large companies. Small companies should, as is currently the case, receive corporate fines of between SEK 5 000 and SEK 10 million. These amounts should, as a starting point, also apply to large companies. However, in the event of particularly reprehensible crimes, it should be possible to impose an ‘increased corporate fine’ on large companies. This should be determined while taking account of the company’s financial position and it should be possible to impose a fine of up to SEK 100 million.</p>
<p>Our proposal on how to determine the size of the corporate fine</p>
<p>We propose a solution whereby the size of the corporate fine is determined in three stages.</p>
<p>In the first stage,  a sanction value of at least SEK 5 000 and at most SEK 10 million should be established for the totality of the crimes that should result in a corporate fine. The sanction value – which is intended to reflect the blame the company deserves as a result of the crime – is determined on the basis of the penalty for the crime and giving particular consideration to the crime’s relation to the activities and the harm or danger that crime caused to life, health or the environment. There must also be scope to give reasonable consideration to whether the company has previously received corporate fines. Our proposal on how to determine the sanction value will probably lead in most cases to the same amount as the corporate fine is set at in accordance with the existing regulation.</p>
<p>The second stage  is applied only in cases where the sanction level established amounts to a minimum of SEK 500 000 (particularly reprehensible crime) and the company is a large company. According to our proposal, when these conditions have been met it will be possible to increase the size of the corporate fine to an amount that is up to ten times higher than the sanction value (‘increased corporate fine’). Large companies refers to individual business operators and legal persons that fulfil the criteria for large companies under Chapter 1, Section 3, first paragraph, point 4 of the Annual Accounts Act (1995:1554); in simplified terms, this means companies that exceed at least two of three threshold values: a balance sheet total of SEK 40 million, net turnover of SEK 80 million and 50 employees.</p>
<p>Under our proposal, central government, municipalities and county councils should not be covered by the provisions on increased corporate fines.</p>
<p>In the third stage , it should be examined – as is currently the case – whether there are reasons to reduce or waive the corporate fine.</p>
<h2>Relation between corporate fines and individual criminal liability (chapter 11)</h2>
<p>We have considered how to coordinate a criminal penalty and a corporate fine that affect one and the same person (‘accumulation of sanctions’).</p>
<p>Special rule on assessing whether prosecution proceedings can be initiated</p>
<p>The special rule contained in Chapter 36, Section 10 a of the Swedish Penal Code on assessing whether prosecution proceedings can be initiated means that a corporate fine is the primary criminal sanction for crimes that may warrant proceedings on a corporate fine and have been committed through negligence and cannot be assumed to warrant any penalty other than a fine. In these cases in particular, there are good reasons to normally allow just the company and not the individual to bear criminal liability for the crime. Experiences of this special rule have also been positive. We therefore recommend that the provision be retained.</p>
<p>The accumulation of sanctions should primarily be considered when corporate fines are determined</p>
<p>We consider that there are overwhelming reasons in favour of the coordination of a penalty and a corporate fine primarily taking place when the corporate fine is determined. This means returning to the provisions that applied before 2006.</p>
<p>It should be possible to reduce or waive corporate fines in certain cases when a company owner is sentenced to a penalty for a crime</p>
<p>It is fairly common for people directly or indirectly affected by corporate fine proceedings to be prosecuted for the crime in question. Sometimes, the prosecution and proceedings on corporate fines target one and the same person; this is often the case when the crime has been committed in activities conducted by a sole trader. In other cases, the person prosecuted and convicted of the crime is still indirectly affected by a corporate fine that is imposed. One typical situation of this kind is when a partner is convicted of crimes committed within the framework of a trading partnership’s activities: the partner is then liable for payment, in a spirit of solidarity, of the corporate fine the trading partnership is required to pay.</p>
<p>In individual situations of this kind, the total effect on the individual of a penalty and a corporate fine may be disproportionately harsh. Provisions are therefore needed that provide an opportunity to coordinate both sanctions – in addition to the abovementioned special rule on assessing whether criminal proceedings can be initiated. The need for coordination is particularly great when it comes to crimes committed by sole traders, but it is also relevant with regard to crimes committed within the framework of legal persons. In our view, provisions regulating how coordination between a penalty and a corporate fine is to be achieved should not be limited to any particular form of company.</p>
<p>Against this background, we propose a special provision stating that it should be possible to adjust or waive a corporate fine if the total reaction to the crime would otherwise be disproportionately harsh. It should be possible to apply this provision even when the activities have been conducted by a legal person. However, one prerequisite should be that the person sentenced to a penalty for the crime owns the legal person entirely or partially.</p>
<h2>The need for additional legislative measures so that Sweden can live up to its commitments vis-à-vis the OECD (chapter 12)</h2>
<p>We propose that proceedings on corporate fines for certain bribery offences committed outside Sweden be examined in accordance with Swedish law and before a Swedish court of law, even if jurisdiction does not exist under the provisions in Chapter 2, Sections 2, 3 or 3 a of the Swedish Penal Code.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Through the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions (hereinafter the OECD Convention), the States Parties commit to making bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions (hereinafter ‘international bribery offences’) a criminal offence and introducing provisions on the liability of legal persons. In a report from 2012, the OECD recommends that Sweden: 1. amend the corporate fine regulations so that legal persons can be held to account in practice too for international bribery offences without a connection to prosecution or conviction of the natural person who has committed the crime; 2. amend the corporate fine regulations so that legal persons can be held to account in practice for international bribery offences committed by  lower-level employees, intermediaries, subsidiaries or independent contractors in all cases where this is required under the Convention and the guidelines for the Convention’s application; and 3. quickly take measures so that Swedish legal persons can have sanctions imposed on them for international bribery offences committed on their behalf abroad, even if the crime is committed by an intermediary who is not a Swedish citizen.</p>
<p>General comments about the liability of legal persons</p>
<p>The OECD Convention and the related recommendations state that it should be possible to hold legal persons to account for international bribery offences in the following three principal situations. 1. When a person in the legal person’s management offers, promises or gives a bribe to a foreign public official. 2. When a person in the legal person’s management instructs or allows someone else within the legal person to offer, promise or give a bribe to a foreign public official. 3. When a person in the legal person’s management neglects to stop someone else within the legal person from offering, promising or giving a bribe to a foreign public official.</p>
<p>We consider that legal persons can be held to account to a reasonable extent under the corporate fine regulations in all of these situations.</p>
<p>According to the OECD, the Swedish corporate fine regulations allow companies to avoid liability for international bribery offences by using intermediaries, subsidiaries or employees who are not Swedish citizens. However, our assessment – following a review of the entirety of Sweden’s regulations – is that the risk of this is very small and that it does not essentially require any legislative amendments (see below, however, on the subject of the jurisdiction of Swedish courts). The fact that it can be difficult in individual cases to prove that a person has acted on behalf of a company – and that the company, as a result of this, cannot be given a corporate fine – does not in our view constitute grounds to amend the Swedish regulations.</p>
<p>Swedish jurisdiction in relation to legal persons with regard to international bribery offences committed abroad</p>
<p>The OECD has pointed out that the lack of jurisdiction in accordance with the ‘active personality principle’ for legal persons poses a problem in Sweden; if a foreign citizen commits an international bribery offence outside Sweden on behalf of a Swedish company, the Swedish court does not have jurisdiction (under the condition that jurisdiction cannot be shown in accordance with the ‘territoriality principle’).</p>
<p>We agree with this part of the OECD’s assessment. The fact that Swedish law does not have jurisdiction provisions for legal persons also means that Sweden does not fully live up to the requirements in the OECD Convention that States Parties must have national legislation that is effective in combating international bribery offences. Irrespective of the Convention, there is of course a strong general interest in preventing corruption of this kind.</p>
<p>We therefore propose that corporate fine proceedings arising from certain bribery offences – primarily the offering of bribes – should always be examined in accordance with Swedish law and before a Swedish court of law, if the offence was committed outside Sweden during the exercise of a Swedish company’s business activities. However, it should only be possible to initiate such proceedings if the act is not free of liability under the law in the location where it was committed, and only if the Government or the person authorised by the Government has recommended this.</p>
<h2>Corporate fines through the summary imposition of a fine (chapter 13)</h2>
<p>When the provisions on corporate fines were introduced in 1986, a corporate fine could only be imposed following examination by a court of law. After the reform of the corporate fine regulations in 2006, it became possible to impose corporate fines through the summary imposition of a fine in cases where the corporate fine did not exceed SEK 500 000. We have considered whether this threshold should be raised or removed completely.</p>
<p>We have noted that the system of summary imposition of a fine entails a faster process than proceedings in a court of law. It is also an efficient and resource-saving form of processing. However, there are also circumstances that indicate that the existing threshold rule should not be removed or amended. For example, the fact that several cases are adjudicated following court proceedings should contribute to the development of clear and unambiguous practice in the area.</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that it is does indeed seem reasonable to expand the opportunities for imposing corporate fines through the summary imposition of a fine. However, the restriction should not be removed completely until experience has been gained from the proposed new provisions on the size of corporate fines and a certain level of practice has been established. We therefore propose that, in future too, there should be a ceiling amount, but that the ceiling should be raised from SEK 500 000 to SEK 3 million.</p>
<h2>Registration of corporate fines (chapter 13)</h2>
<p>We have considered whether some form of register of all corporate fines imposed should be introduced. However, we consider that the need for such a register is not so great as to justify the costs associated with the establishment and running of such a register.</p>
<h2>The need for preparatory investigative measures, etc. (chapter 13)</h2>
<p>As is clear from the above, we propose that corporate fines should in some cases be increased taking account of the company’s financial position, known as ‘increased corporate fines’. An assessment of the company’s financial position should then be based on the latest information available at the time of the judgment or the summary imposition of a fine. This means that circumstances that emerge at a late stage during the processing of the matter may also be significant. The fact that relevant circumstances can sometimes become known late in the process may make it difficult for the parties to prepare their cases and may result in the main hearing that has already begun having to be cancelled or postponed. Therefore, measures should be taken during the preparation of the case so that circumstances that are significant when establishing the size of the corporate fine become documents in the case at an early stage.</p>
<p>The prosecutor should state the reasons for calculating the size of the corporate fine in a summons application, etc.</p>
<p>Corporate fines can only be imposed following a motion from a public prosecutor. In the summons application, the prosecutor is to submit information concerning the illegal act and the evidence to which they will refer. It is probably also clear that the prosecutor should, in cases on corporate fines, present a motion stating the amount set and that the prosecutor should state the reason for imposing a corporate fine.</p>
<p>If the prosecutor states the reasons for calculating the size of the corporate fine at an early stage, this increases the predictability of the process and improves the conditions for clarifying the parties’ standpoints. We therefore consider that a prosecutor initiating proceedings on corporate fines should briefly state the reasons for calculating the size of the corporate fine in the summons application. We have considered whether the routines we recommend here should be confirmed by law, but we do not believe this is necessary.</p>
<p>We also recommend that the court regularly consider ordering the person against whom the proceedings have been initiated to present their opinion in writing before the main hearing and, if ambiguities remain following the written processing, that it call the parties to a preparatory meeting. However, we do not propose any legislative amendments in this regard either.</p>
<p>The prosecutor should not be able to make a motion on a corporate fine tougher before the court of appeal or the Supreme Court</p>
<p>According to our assessment, a prosecutor who has had complete success with their motion is prevented from appealing and claiming a higher corporate fine before the court of appeal than they claimed before the district court. It follows from this that a prosecutor can never claim a higher amount before the court of appeal or the Supreme Court than they claimed before the district court. We have considered whether this is a satisfactory system. Our conclusion is that there are not sufficient reasons to introduce the possibility for the prosecutor to make a motion that has been presented to the district court tougher before the court of appeal or the Supreme Court.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions (chapter 15)</h2>
<p>We propose that the legislative amendments enter into force on 1 July 2018. No transitional provisions are needed.</p>
