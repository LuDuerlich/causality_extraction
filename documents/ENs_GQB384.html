<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The assignment</h2>
<p>The assignment for the Commission was to investigate the legal preconditions for Swedish and Finnish municipalities being able to collaborate in joint public law cooperating bodies, which as far as possible correspond to local government associations in accordance with the Local Government Act (1991:900). This also included deliberating upon what powers a joint cooperating body should have. Furthermore, it was a task for the Commission to investigate how decisions should be made within a cooperating body, how the insight by citizens into the operations of the cooperating bodies should be governed, what legislation shall apply to the operation, how supervision should be conducted and what should apply in connection with appeals against decisions, how the cooperating body’s operation should be financed and also the municipal financial advantages and disadvantages with the proposed form of cooperation. The assignment also included preparing proposals for an international agreement, if the Commission should conclude that the cooperating body must be established through such an agreement.</p>
<h2>Existing law</h2>
<p>The Swedish municipalities and county councils are, according to current legislation, empowered to cooperate with foreign municipalities, county councils and similar local or regional entities through various private law forms, such as for example corporations and foundations. However, there is no similar possibility for collaboration within the public law field through a cooperating body resembling a Swedish local government association.</p>
<h2>Deliberations and proposals</h2>
<p>The deliberations and proposals of the Commission are the result of, first, the Commission’s own work, second, work together with the parallel working group in Finland, which is dealing with the same issues. References to municipalities below means both primary municipalities and county council municipalities.</p>
<p>An international local government association</p>
<p>A public law body for cooperation between Swedish and Finnish municipalities may be structured in different ways depending upon the requirements that are imposed on it. By giving the cooperating body the form of a legal entity, several advantages are achieved, such as it being given an opportunity to apply for EU funds. A public law cooperating body in the form of an international local government association satisfies this requirement. It will not be a local government association according to national legislation but an international institution or association. However, by making national legislation regarding the structure and working forms of the local government association applicable to such international local government association, one can create a cooperating body that also provides good conditions for political decision-making and demands on accountability in democratic forms.</p>
<p>In order to be able to form an international local government association, it is required, having regard to the rules contained in Chapter 10 of the Instrument of Government (Regeringsformen – RF) and principles of international law, that this is done through an international agreement. For the same considerations, it also follows that the powers of the local government association should be prescribed in the agreement. This means that a new international agreement is required every time that a new international local government association should be formed. If such an agreement is concluded between the States, the municipalities to which the agreement refers can commence cooperation in an international local government association - if they wish to do so.</p>
<p>The Municipality of Haparanda in Sweden and the City of Torneå in Finland have indicated their desire to be able to enter into an international local government association. The Commission therefore proposes that an international agreement be concluded between Sweden and Finland, with the aim of forming an international local government association between the Municipality of Haparanda and the City of Torneå. The Commission has prepared a proposal for such an agreement. This may also be a model for later agreements regarding international local government associations between other municipalities.</p>
<p>An international agreement regarding local government cooperation across national borders</p>
<p>The provisions contained in Chapter 10, RF regarding transfer of public law functions to other States or international organisations and the principles of international law mean that several issues regarding the international local government association must be governed by the international agreement.</p>
<p>The international local government association’s powers must be stated in the international agreement. Taking into account the views on appropriate areas of cooperation submitted by the Municipality of Haparanda, the Commission proposes that the international local government association between Haparanda and Torneå should be responsible for municipal affairs within the following areas: social planning, culture and leisure activities, education and training together with visiting activities, day activities, rehabilitative work, care of drug and alcohol abusers, family advise services and on-call service within the Social Services. The rescue services have not been included, as the formal decisionmaking powers of the municipalities, as regards cooperation in this area, are limited. How far the cooperation between Haparanda and Torneå may extend within the framework of the association is generally decided by the respective national legislation in Sweden and Finland. According to the principle of the least common denominator, the limit for cooperation between the various areas is set by the legislation of the country that is most restrictive in relation to the municipal powers for the sector in question.</p>
<p>An international local government association must have a decision-making assembly. Having regard to the respective country’s demands for sovereignty, it is important that the municipalities have equal numbers of members and deputies in such an assembly and also that these people are elected in accordance with the respective country’s local government mandate period. The Commission proposes that this is laid down in the international agreement.</p>
<p>The international local government association must have a place of its principal seat in one of the member municipalities. The Commission proposed that the municipalities themselves may decide in which country and in which district the association should have its seat.</p>
<p>The fundamental freedoms and rights, the protection of the law and other requirements relating to official administration, according to the constitutional law of Sweden and Finland, should be observed by the international local government association and its member municipalities. Furthermore, the right for members of the municipalities, in their contacts with the association, to use the Swedish, Finnish or Meänkieli languages should be clearly protected. A requirement for unchanged rights for the members of the municipalities included in the association should be laid down in the international agreement. Through this, it will be ensured that the members of the municipalities will not be in a weaker situation because an international local government association has been formed with responsibilities for certain operations.</p>
<p>Decisions that are made by the international local government association will normally, according to both Swedish and Finnish legislation, be determined by a simple majority. In the event that the association should make a decision that adversely affects the fundamental freedoms and rights of an individual and can thereby be said to involve the exercise of substantial official power, the Finnish working group has indicated its desire that such a decision should be made by two-thirds majority. The concept of substantial official power essentially corresponds with the Swedish concept of exercise of official power. As it is important not to limit the opportunities of the international association for cooperation, this rule should be incorporated into the international local government agreement. It would thus be a matter for the international local government association to ensure that the rule is applied in each individual case.</p>
<p>The international agreement should contain rules regarding which legislation should be applied to the international local government association’s operations – both internally and externally. The Commission has endeavoured to formulate these rules as a choice of law so that they give clear information on which law should be applied, take into account the interests of the members of the municipalities to retain their rights and take into account the interests of Swedish and Finnish sovereignty.</p>
<p>As regards the internal operation of the local government association, i.e. the organisation of its administration, its internal work, audit and review of management and finances, funding, status of personnel, official responsibility of officers together with issues related thereto, the Commission opted for the proposal that the law in the country where the seat is located should be applied. As the Swedish and Finnish legislation regarding local government associations is largely uniform, the result of this solution is that the rules regarding the association’s inner operations would in broad terms be the same, irrespective of whether the association has its seat in Sweden or Finland.</p>
<p>As regards the external operation of the local government association, i.e. decisions and measures that apply to the provisions of facilities and services, etc., and which are orientated towards the members in the municipalities included in the association, the Commission makes the assessment that such an operation should to the largest extent possible be governed by Swedish law as regards members of Swedish municipalities and Finnish laws as regard members of Finnish municipalities. In order to achieve this object, the Commission proposes that the law in the country where the person who is affected by the decision or the measure is resident or located should be applied to such operations of the association as are orientated towards individual members of the municipalities.</p>
<p>When choosing which court is competent to consider appeals of the international local government association’s decision, the Commission considers that the most important solution is to allow the applicant’s residence or seat to determine where this should be done. This basically means that members of Swedish municipalities appeal against decisions of the association to Swedish courts, which apply Swedish law, while members of Finnish municipalities appeal against decisions to Finnish courts, which apply Finnish law.</p>
<p>As regards the right of access to official documents held by the international local government association, the Commission proposes that the main rule should be that Swedish and Finnish legislation on access to official documents should apply for Swedish and Finnish nationals respectively.</p>
<p>In those cases when a person who is affected by an association decision is neither resident nor seated in Sweden or Finland, the Commission proposes that the association and respective courts should apply Swedish law if the person in question is temporarily staying or has stayed in Sweden and Finnish law if the person is temporarily staying or has stayed in Finland.</p>
<p>Having regard to that the international local government association will conduct operations according to both Swedish and Finnish legislation, the Commission considers that the respective country’s supervisory authority should be entitled to exercise supervision of the association’s operations irrespective of where it is conducted. The Swedish supervisory authorities shall exercise supervision of the association operations that are conducted according to Swedish law and Finnish supervisory authorities exercise supervision of the Finnish part of the operation.</p>
<p>A Local Government Border Cooperation Act</p>
<p>In order for the international local government association to be able to commence its operations, the rules contained in Chapters 8 and 10 of RF require that the competence of a Swedish municipality to enter into and operate within the international local government association should be governed by law. The Commission therefore proposes an act containing details of the applicable international agreement, the municipalities that are parties of the international local government association, and the areas for collaboration in which the association may cooperate. In order to facilitate the formation of future international local government associations, the Commission proposes that a law is passed which facilitates border municipal cooperation in public law form between Swedish municipalities or county councils and the municipalities of a foreign power or similar local or regional entity and that the scope of the individual cooperation is stated in an appendix to the act.</p>

<p>Den nordiska samarbetsöverenskommelsen</p>
<p>Den europeiska ramkonventionen that territorial communities or authorities must comply with the procedures or other rules laid down by the national law of the State to which they belong when concluding and implementing their agreements .</p>
<p>However, Article 4 (paragraph 2, b and c) places an important restriction on the transfrontier co-operation body’s ability to take action in that it prohibits it from taking acts which are inherent in the sovereignty and which belong exclusively to the territorial communities or authorities. Such a body therefore cannot: [...] b) take decisions capable of affecting the rights and freedoms of individuals or of the territorial communities or authorities party to the agreement (compulsory-purchase decisions, or decisions to levy user fees, for instance)</p>
<p>Enligt den förklarande rapporten är syftet inte heller att ett samarbetsorgan enligt artikel 4 skall kunna ges allmän behörighet. Enligt rapporten följer detta av uttrycket ”fullgöra de uppgifter som det tilldelats” i punkt 2: ”Article 4 requires that such functions be ‘assigned’ and therefore specific. There is thus no question of the body’s having generel responsibilities” (paragraf 26).</p>
<p>Article 5 allows the Contracting Parties to set up public law transfrontier co-operation bodies “taking action”  (kurs. här) under public law in the territory of all territorial communities or authorities party to the agreement.</p>
<p>Articles 4 and 5 present two different concepts of the functioning of the co-operation body endowed with legal personality. The operative provisions of Article 4 follow a ”double” legal logic, since the transfrontier co-operation body is governed solely by the national law of the State where it has its headquarters. On the other hand, the operative provisions of Article 5 follow a logic of legal pluralism, laying down that the body’s measures have the same legal validity, wherever they are applied. (Paragraf 23) [...]</p>
<p>Articles 4 and 5 provide for two different types of transfrontier cooperation bodies which can co-exist in a country or be alternative. For this purpose, Article 8 provides for Contracting Parties to declare, when signing the Protocol or when depositing its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval, that they can accept the two types or only that provided for in Article 4 or in Article 5. (Paragraf 30) [...]</p>
<p>Articles 4 and 5 make it possible to set up transfrontier cooperation bodies accordning to two different kinds of logic, and the Protocol does not oblige States to adopt both formulae. Article 8, in contrast, provides that each Contracting Party shall be free to indicate which formula it adopts. (Paragraf 37)</p>
