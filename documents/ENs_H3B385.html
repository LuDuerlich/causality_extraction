<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>How are future housing needs for the elderly to be met? What barriers exist? What opportunities do municipalities have to meet the demand for housing from an ageing population? These have been the main questions for this Inquiry and the measures proposed in this report are intended to make it easier for elderly people to retain or acquire suitable housing and improve the opportunities for municipalities to meet the housing needs of a growing number of older people.</p>
<h2>Increasing number of elderly, while number of young people decreasing</h2>
<p>The growing housing shortage has had a severe impact on today’s younger generation and there is a pent-up need for housing so that young people can become established in the housing market. In addition, there has been a wave of newly arrived immigrants with immediate housing needs. The older generation’s housing needs are usually not as urgent – they already have somewhere to live. But soon, the number of young people will decrease  each year – in absolute figures as well – while the 65+ age group will increase by more than 30 000 individuals each year. In 2030, there will be nearly half a million more people over the age of 65 – but a thousand less between the ages of 20–29. The increase in the number of elderly people will continue long into the future and, as a result of the lack of available housing stock, many elderly people may find their housing situation gradually becoming untenable.</p>
<h2>Focus must be given to accessibility issues ...</h2>
<p>In light of the fact that a considerable share of the population is directly in need of better accessibility to housing and housing environments and the fact that this would benefit most of us, it is surprising that there is such limited interest in these issues. Besides the fact that one in four people between the age of 75–84 has reduced mobility, younger people are also affected by temporary or permanent impairments, which cause problems if the home and surrounding environment are not accessible. And this also affects the person’s relatives. Now that the challenges of the housing market are greater than ever, with major needs for both renovation of existing housing and a dramatic increase of housing construction, it is vital that more focus be given to accessibility issues.</p>
<h2>... and solitude and social isolation combated</h2>
<p>Sweden has the healthiest pensioners in the EU and tomorrow’s elderly will probably be even more active and mobile than today’s.</p>
<p>They can also be expected to live as couples later in life – which, in addition to a given social identity also provides better financial conditions to seek adequate housing. But even if this occurs later in life, most people will eventually be affected by such infirmities as reduced mobility, heart problems and impaired eyesight or hearing, which makes maintaining a social network more difficult. Many people will also outlive their partner. It can be expected that the risk of problems in connection with solitude and social isolation will continue to increase with age, and along with solitude comes both physical and mental ill-health. There is therefore every reason to promote and support housing forms that allow everyday contact and a meaningful context in the home. If use can also be made of the power of initiative, knowledge and overall resources that tomorrow’s elderly possess and seniors are allowed to share in the responsibility of designing such forms of housing, much can be gained.</p>
<h2>Particular difficulties in weak housing markets</h2>
<p>The combination of high risk and low property values makes new production in areas outside of growth areas difficult or impossible. In reality, a very large proportion of municipalities are considered weak housing markets. Even in the growth regions there are often communities or areas where it is impossible to get a loan to build housing. This is a general problem, but is particularly true of small depopulating municipalities with a rapidly ageing population. The Inquiry calls for deeper dialogue between relevant parties on risk assessment and financing of housing projects in what are considered weak markets. This should be accompanied by greater openness and preparedness for initiatives from groups that stand for a small but well-defined area of demand.</p>
<h2>Not everyone is financially strong</h2>
<p>The financial situation of pensioners has gradually improved and many seniors can be expected to enjoy good finances in the years to come. But pensions do not fully follow general income growth, and most people’s pensions gradually decrease. One clear deterioration often occurs at around the age of 70, followed by a successive tapering off. And all the while rents and fees are increasing from year to year. Although most people have the financial conditions to cope with this, there is a smaller group of pensioners with extremely limited incomes who feel a justified concern about future rent increases and who encounter problems the day they can no longer live at home.</p>
<h2>Measures in four areas</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a package of measures in four areas, with the aim of: 1. improving accessibility in the existing housing stock; 2. obtaining more housing for elderly people, including in weak markets, with focus on housing forms with opportunities for social interaction; 3. making it easier for seniors to move to – or remain in – housing suitable for those growing older; and 4. promoting research and other knowledge development on accessibility issues and social interaction in housing.</p>
<p>In all, the package encompasses SEK 525 million per year over a five-year period, which means a total of just over SEK 2.6 billion. But to ensure that use is actually made of the proposed funds, the measures must be combined with an overall initiative on information and knowledge dissemination. Certain proposals of this kind are presented in connection with the proposed measures, but the Inquiry would also like to see that during this period, housing policy is characterised by an interest in accessibility issues, along with a special focus on different forms of housing that offer greater opportunities for everyday contact than the traditional housing forms. The growing number of older people will want to have attractive housing that meets the need for security, accessibility and social interaction. What is needed is a varied selection of housing forms that can persuade seniors – with varying levels of financial resources – to move in good time to housing that is suitable to grow old in while freeing up housing that is attractive to younger households. 1. Improving accessibility in existing homes  Continued central government support to municipal inventories of accessibility in areas with  multi-dwelling blocks. All property owners will be invited to participate.  New central government support for the installation of lifts in existing  multi-dwelling blocks, consisting of 50 per cent of the installation costs, although no more than SEK 650 000 per lift. One condition for receiving the support will be that the municipality has made an accessibility inventory and that the relevant property is in an area prioritised by the municipality to increase access to housing for people with reduced mobility. Another requirement will be that, in connection with installing a lift, the property owner must ensure that the entrance and stairwell are accessible up to the door of the apartment.  The current requirement in the Planning and Building Act on removing easily eliminated obstacles in public premises and public places is to be expanded to cover obstacles in, or adjacent to, entrances and stairwells in  multi-dwelling blocks.  The Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning should be instructed to devise a national system for accessibility labelling of  multi-dwelling blocks – if and when the real estate sector or housing market stakeholder organisations state that they are prepared to administer a system of this kind. 2. More housing for the elderly  Investment support to sheltered housing for people over 70 years of age, with a set square metre amount of SEK 2 800 for newly produced housing and SEK 2 200 for renovation projects that result in additional sheltered housing. This support will be given for a maximum of 60 square metres per residential apartment and a maximum of 20 square metres per apartment for communal areas for meals, social interaction, hobbies and recreation. In the case of newly produced housing, stricter requirements on accessibility should apply to bathrooms and bedrooms, while normal levels are sufficient regarding renovations. The apartments are to be let as rented tenancy or cooperative tenancy, and the recipient of the support must undertake to use the accommodation as sheltered housing for at least ten years.  A new ‘start grant for joint building ventures’ of up to SEK 300 000 to associations formed for the purpose of jointly planning, building and moving into a residential property. The apartments can be let as rented tenancy, cooperative tenancy or tenant ownership and do not need to be reserved for older people. The support is intended for initial project costs until construction loans can be granted, for example to engage a project coordinator. The association’s members are themselves to have invested at least SEK 5 000 each and there must be a land allocation or similar agreement with a property owner. The Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning should be tasked with disseminating information on joint building ventures, the functions they may have in housing provision, and how municipalities and housing companies can work together to promote such initiatives.  The Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning is to be instructed to develop a central government guarantee for repayment of the security deposit in cooperative tenancy. This includes considering different methods of risk assessment with the aim of keeping the fee for the guarantee down. This is combined with instructions to SBAB to draw up procedures for handling loans for security deposits that are linked to a repayment guarantee.  A special initiative by the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning to disseminate knowledge and experience of strategic planning of housing provision for the elderly. Within the framework of this initiative, a national network should be initiated for exchange of experience between municipalities. Methodological support should also be developed for better assessment of costs and revenue associated with different alternative courses of action regarding housing for the elderly.  An amendment to the Housing Management Act:  “The Social</p>
<p>Welfare Committee is to take part in planning of housing provision and provide knowledge and experience of living conditions in the municipality.” 3. Facilitate moving – and remaining at home  Increased housing expenditure ceiling in the housing supplement from SEK 5 000 to SEK 7 300 per month. This will allow pensioners with low incomes to seek available housing – regardless of whether this means being able to keep their housing after a renovation or moving to newly built housing.  Tax deduction for professional help with household work in connection with a move for people over the age of 75. The move itself should also provide eligibility for this tax deduction.  A clarification in the Housing Management Act concerning municipal responsibility:  “The municipality must offer  up-to-date  and easily accessible information on current and planned supply of housing in the various parts of the municipality, particularly as regards housing with good accessibility for people with impairments and housing forms intended for particular groups.”  Support in law for simplified processing of decisions on homehelp service regarding housework and social support for persons over the age of 75. 4. Evaluation, research and development  SEK 20 million per year during  2017–2021 from Forte (the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare) and Formas (the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning) for research on housing and housing environments from an accessibility perspective. This research is to provide data for a review of accessibility requirements in construction and work environment legislation.  A broad evaluation of sheltered housing as a housing form, aimed at providing data for continuous development of the concept and for strategies and support measures. In this context, existing knowledge should be compiled on what role common premises can have for creating a social context in housing.  The Swedish Work Environment Authority, in consultation with the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and the Swedish Agency for Participation, is to be instructed to investigate the opportunities for improving the design of waste storage rooms and refuse bins, and developing technical solutions for waste management that alleviate the situation for people with disabilities.</p>
<h2>Financing</h2>
<p>The Inquiry considers that most of these measures should be financed through reprioritisation in expenditure area 18. This would supplement the Government’s housing package to stimulate increased housing construction:</p>
<p> Initiatives in energy measures in connection with renovation of the ‘million homes programme’ will be combined with making the existing housing stock more  ‘accessibility-friendly’.</p>
<p> Investment support for construction of small,  climate-friendly rented tenancy in regions with high immigration will be supplemented by investment support to safe and accessibility- friendly housing for elderly people, particularly in regions with weak growth and an ageing population.</p>
<p> The start grant for joint building ventures will promote a limited yet growing interest from several age groups for housing forms based on individual commitment and shared responsibility.</p>
<p> In connection with a repayment guarantee for the security deposit in cooperative tenancy, the start grant could provide the stimulus that allows small, supplementary housing projects in municipalities with a small but  well-defined area of demand.</p>
