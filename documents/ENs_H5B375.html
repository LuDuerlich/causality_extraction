<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Commission’s mandate and work</h2>
<p>The interpretation of EU law by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in its Tele2 judgment has necessitated reform of the Swedish rules on data retention, regarding both retention and access. This Commissions mandate has been to make these Swedish rules compatible with EU law. This mandate has included considerations in an area that is highly complex, both legally and technically. It has also been carried out with great promptness owing to the urgency of putting in place regulation consistent with the CJEU’s statements in the Tele2 judgment. Experts from Swedish law enforcement and supervisory agencies, Sweden’s courts, the Swedish Bar Association, Uppsala University and the Swedish Government Offices have served as experts in the Commission.</p>
<h2>Fundamental rights</h2>
<p>Fundamental rights that are guaranteed to individuals are laid down in Sweden’s Instrument of Government (part of the Constitution), the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. Individuals’ fundamental rights are twofold: first, their right to be protected from violations by the state, and, second, the state’s duty to ensure – by, for example, a crime investigation – individuals’ protection against violations by other individuals. It is incumbent on the state to establish a framework that is reconcilable with these partially competing principles.</p>
<p>The rights that are of primary interest for the mandate are the right to private life, the right to protection of personal data and the right to freedom of expression. All these rights are guaranteed by</p>
<p>Sweden’s Instrument of Government, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU.</p>
<h2>Privacy protection in electronic communications</h2>
<p>To ensure full respect for the right to private life and the right to protection of personal data in the electronic communications sector, the EU adopted Directive 2002/58. This Directive requires member states to, for example, ensure confidentiality in electronic communications and associated traffic data. Data that are no longer needed must, under the Directive, be destroyed or de-identified. However, the member states may make exceptions to these obligations if it is necessary for e.g. crime fighting activities. The Directive has been implemented in Swedish law mainly through provisions in the Electronic Communications Act (2003:389).</p>
<h2>Crime fighting</h2>
<p>Crime fighting activities consist of two main parts: intelligence and investigative work. Intelligence activities focus mainly on revealing whether particular crimes, not specified in detail, have taken or are taking place, or may be expected to be committed. One overall goal of intelligence work is to supply law enforcement agencies with knowledge that can be brought to bear in their operations. Investigative activity, in contrast, is based on an event that has already occurred. The agency’s task is to find out, often in a preliminary investigation, whether crimes have been committed and, if so, who may be reasonably suspected of committing them, and to obtain enough material to assess the question of whether to prosecute.</p>
<p>In both criminal investigation and intelligence work, secret coercive measures are used. One such measure relevant to the issue of data retention is secret monitoring of electronic communications, which is regulated by the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure. In addition, there are coercive measures under the Act (1991:572) concerning Special Controls in Respect of Aliens and the Act (2007:979) on the Use of Measures to Prevent Certain Serious Crimes that are applicable in intelligence activities. Data retrieval under the Act (2012:278) on Acquiring Information about Electronic</p>
<p>Communications in the Law Enforcement Agencies’ Intelligence Activities also constitutes a secret coercive measure. However, collection of subscription data under the Electronic Communications Act (2003:389) is not a secret coercive measure.</p>
<h2>Data on electronic communication in crime fighting</h2>
<p>Data on electronic communications are divided into various categories. Subscription data comprise, for example, subscribers’ numbers, names, titles and addresses. Such data are also usually deemed to include information about contracts and billing, for example. Moreover, this category includes information on which fixed or dynamic ip address a subscriber has used or IMSI numbers (those are associated with subscribers’ SIM cards and thus telephone numbers), and several other particulars. The exact boundary is difficult to draw. Traffic data refers in this context, simply expressed, to the data needed to convey an electronic message in an electronic communications network, or to invoice for such a message. Besides the concept of ‘traffic data’, the expression location data is also used, to denote data associated with the location of a communication device. It may, for example, be about the cell (base station antenna) to which the equipment is connected.</p>
<h2>Current regulation of data retention</h2>
<p>Data on electronic communications are very important for crime fighting. There are therefore rules in the Electronic Communications Act (2003:389) to ensure that public agencies can access such data. To this end, the Electronic Communications Act prescribes a retention obligation for those providing electronic communications services. This obligation includes certain listed data generated or processed by the provider. The obligation to retain includes telephony (fixed and mobile), messaging and Internet access.</p>
<h2>Current regulation of data access</h2>
<p>How public agencies can access the data covered by the obligation to retain – and other data processed in their work, for example owing to billing requirements – depends on what type of information is involved and the purpose for which access is requested. For traffic and location data, access is regulated in the Code of Judicial Procedure and the Act (2012:278) on Gathering of Data relating to Electronic Communications as Part of Intelligence Gathering by Law Enforcement Authorities. In addition, there are the Act (1991:572) concerning Special Controls in Respect of Aliens and the Act (2007:979) on Measures to Prevent Certain Particularly Serious Crimes, which refer to the provisions of the Code of Judicial Procedure. Access to subscription data has not been considered to be a secret coercive measure, and is regulated directly in the Electronic Communications Act (2003:389).</p>
<p>Access to traffic and location data in the criminal investigative process requires court decisions and is possible only in cases of serious crime. In intelligence activities, access to traffic data is more limited but, as a main rule, does not require court decisions. Access to subscription data does not require any court decision; the decision is taken by the law enforcement agency itself. Nor is the crime required to be of a particular degree of seriousness.</p>
<p>To protect individuals’ data privacy and maintain a high level of legal certainty, the regulations governing public agencies’ access to electronic communications data contain a number of control mechanisms and guarantees of legal certainty.</p>
<p>For all use of coercive measures, the principles of purpose, need and proportionality apply. Consequently, the coercive measures may be used only for the purpose specified in the legislation, if there is an obvious need and a smaller intervention measure is insufficient. In addition, the measure must be in reasonable proportion to both the benefit resulting from, and the intrusion or harm entailed by, the measure.</p>
<h2>Benefit of and need for electronic communication data in crime fighting</h2>
<p>To combat crime, there is an obvious need for data on electronic communications, and these data are immensely useful to law enforcement agencies. This applies to all data to be retained pursuant to the Electronic Communications Ordinance (2003:396). However, benefit and need are not the same for all data, nor constant over time, since behaviour patterns and technology are constantly changing. Examples are the decline of fixed telephony, growing Internet access in mobile phones and increased use of IP telephony through mobile apps.</p>
<h2>Impact of EU law on data retention rules</h2>
<p>The EU Data Retention Directive (2006/24/EC) was annulled by the CJEU on 8 April 2014 (the Digital Rights judgment) and, for this reason, the head of the Ministry of Justice tasked an investigator with analysing the implications for Swedish legislation (Ministry Publication Series, Ds 2014:23). To follow up the analysis in the departmental memorandum, the Government instructed a special investigator to consider further measures to boost legal certainty and data privacy for such rules as those on retention of data concerning electronic communication (Swedish Government Official Report, SOU 2015:31). In both analyses, the Swedish legislation was judged to be compatible with EU law, although some reform proposals were presented.</p>
<h2>The Tele2 judgment and the Administrative Court of Appeal in Stockholm judgment</h2>
<p>The Administrative Court of Appeal in Stockholm requested a preliminary ruling by the CJEU on an injunction, which had been appealed, from the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority against a company obliged to retain data about storing data on electronic communication. The CJEU’s response to the request was the Tele2 judgment. The CJEU considered Directive 2002/58 to be applicable to the Swedish rules on data retention, with respect to data access as well. According to the CJEU, Article 15.1 of the Directive, which to some extent allows data retention, should be interpreted strictly and in light of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Swedish rules on data retention were judged to constitute restrictions on the rights under Articles 7, 8 and 11. According to the CJEU, restrictions on rights may be imposed only under certain conditions, including their being proportionate and strictly necessary. The CJEU further stated that general and indiscriminate retention can never be strictly necessary – not even to fight serious crime. Regarding access to data, the Court states that precise requirements must be prescribed, that access may be given only for the purpose of fighting serious crime and that access may, in principle, relate only to people involved in some way in serious crime. According to the Court, access should, as a main rule, be granted only after prior judicial review by a court or other independent agency, and the people concerned should be informed as soon as this is no longer detrimental to the agency’s investigations. In addition, the Court states that providers of electronic communications services must guarantee a particularly high level of protection and security through appropriate technical and organisational measures; that the data must be destroyed when the retention period expires; and that the data must be stored in the EU. The CJEU’s conclusions are that EU law precludes (1) national legislation which, for the purpose of fighting crime, provides for general and indiscriminate retention of all traffic and location data of all subscribers and registered users relating to all means of electronic communication and (2) national legislation that does not restrict access to traffic and location data solely to fighting serious crime, where access is not subject to prior review by a court or an independent administrative authority, and where there is no requirement that the data concerned should be retained within the European Union.</p>
<p>With reference to the CJEU’s judgment, the Administrative Court of Appeal suspended the injunction from the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority.</p>
<h2>International outlook</h2>
<p>Several countries have started analysing the Tele2 judgment. The Commission’s report gives an account of current law and reform under way in Denmark, Finland, Germany, Belgium, Austria and Portugal. It is worth noting that these reviews have not yet led to legislation in any country.</p>
<h2>The Commission’s considerations EU law</h2>
<p>The Tele2 judgment shows that the CJEU has deemed its own legal competence to include retention of and access to electronically retained data for the purpose of preventing crime, and also vital interests such as national security and defence (pp. 65–81 and 119 of the judgment). The conclusion may thus be drawn that, regardless of the purpose for which the data are used, the operators’ retention of and the agencies’ access to these data are subject to the rules pursuant to EU law. This means that, irrespective of whether the crime fighting is pursued by the Police Authority, Swedish Customs, the Swedish Economic Crime Authority or the Swedish Security Service, the issue of data retention is subject to the same EU legal framework, although the CJEU allows slightly more leeway for national rules regarding access to data in the Security Service’s area of operations (p. 119 of the judgment).</p>
<h2>Subscription data excluded from judgment but covered by EU law</h2>
<p>The CJEU’s decision does not concern processing of subscriber data, but only traffic and location data. The fact that the Court does not touch on subscription data is natural since they are not dealt with in the articles of the Directive (2002/58) that the Court interprets. The Court’s more general statements on, for example, limitations on protection of personal data are, on the other hand, also relevant to processing of subscription data. In the Commission, the question has been raised of whether IP addresses should nevertheless be regarded as covered by the judgment. If so, it would mean that the provisions in the judgment concerning prior review by a court or an independent administrative authority when there is access to information on who has used an IP address, for example, would be applicable. The rules that access might be made available to law enforcement agencies only in cases of serious crime would also need to be considered. As stated above, however, the Commission’s view is that neither IP addresses nor any other subscription data are covered by the judgment.</p>
<h2>Necessity of Swedish legislative reform</h2>
<p>The CJEU imposes more stringent requirements than Swedish law on data retention and access to electronically retained data. The Swedish rules must therefore be reformed. However, certain opposed interests must be considered. First, it must be taken into account that the interest of law enforcement calls for effective legislation on data retention. Otherwise, there would be a risk of complete impunity in practice for certain crimes with the Internet as their arena. Second, our international commitments must be taken into account. Every single resident in Sweden is entitled to demand effective measures by the state to protect his or her safety. Accordingly, the state must strive to ensure that crime is prevented and investigated, and that perpetrators are held accountable for their criminal acts. The state thus has an obligation to protect individuals’ private life and data privacy against intrusions by other individuals and, in the event of intrusions, ensure that these crimes are investigated. Failing to enable law enforcement agencies to effectively collect evidence in the electronic environment would not be compatible with Sweden’s commitments.</p>
<h2>No general and indiscriminate retention as at present</h2>
<p>The CJEU has stated that the EU law constitutes an obstacle to national legislation that, for crime fighting purposes, prescribes general and indiscriminate retention of all traffic and location data concerning all subscribers and registered users, and for all electronic means of communication. It is also clear from the grounds for the judgment that the scope for generally prescribing retention is limited.</p>
<p>The question is then how limited this scope is. The CJEU sets out its reasoning on this issue in two sections.</p>
<p>The first section of the reasoning is about general retention. Here, in considering Swedish legislation on data retention, the CJEU takes the view that existing legislation provides for general and indiscriminate retention of all traffic and location data of all subscribers and registered users relating to all means of electronic communication and that it imposes on providers of electronic communications services an obligation to retain that data systematically and continuously, with no exceptions. The Court’s conclusion, at the end of the first section of its reasoning, is that Swedish retention exceeds the limit of what is strictly necessary and therefore contravenes Article 15.1 of the Directive, compared with Articles 7, 8, 11 and 52.1 in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Court has now stated all the grounds required for its ruling in this section.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Court continues its considerations in a second section of the reasoning. This second part has no connection with the ruling; instead, it may almost be seen as an obiter dictum  (i.e. an incidental expression of opinion outside the scope of the case). Here, the reasoning is about targeted data retention as an example of a retention compatible with the EU-law. In this part, the Court presents arguments on the possible nature of such data retention. Among the requirements for a targeted retention, the fact that the circle of individuals concerned must be limited is especially notable.</p>
<p>The Commission’s assessment is that scope for a limited retention obligation remains, but that the obligation must be made less extensive than today and adapted to what is strictly necessary.</p>
<h2>Various retention models</h2>
<p>A limited and differentiated retention should be prescribed. The other possible retention models (targeted data retention, data preservation, retention of the latest activity and continued data retention with encryption or anonymization) entail such weaknesses that it is not reasonable to prescribe any of them instead.</p>
<h2>Limited retention obligation</h2>
<p>The Commission’s proposal involves a radical reform of the current model for the retention obligation for telephony, messaging and, to a certain extent, Internet access. Owing to the proposed changes, the obligation will no longer be general; much of the traffic data, as well as all location data that are not traffic data, will not be subject to the obligation. Retention will thus become the exception, not the rule (Tele2 judgment p. 104). In addition, the obligation to retain data will be differentiated by being adapted to cover only data that are strictly necessary to retain for fighting serious crime, taking usefulness, needs, data privacy and proportionality into account (Tele2 judgment p. 105). At the same time, retention periods will be differentiated on the basis of divergent needs and differing sensitivity in terms of privacy.</p>
<p>The proposal means that the infringement on subscribers’ privacy would be reduced, but that scope for obstructing, preventing and investigating crime may also, in some cases, be impaired.</p>
<p>Editorial changes and technology neutrality</p>
<p>The Commission recommends dividing the retention obligation into two parts: (1) telephony and messaging and (2) Internet access. The rules should be made technology-neutral. One implication of that is that operators’ use of NAT technology (which allows subscribers to share the same public IP address) would not affect the scope for identifying subscriber.</p>
<p>Telephony and messaging</p>
<p>For telephony and messaging, the proposal is that only data on communications via a mobile network access point should be retained. This means that no data would be retained on telephony or messaging that takes place in the fixed-line (landline) telephone network or through fixed Internet access. On the other hand, information will be retained if one of the parties communicates via a mobile network access point, but only at that party’s service provider.</p>
<p>Traffic data will still be retained; but the obligation to retain will be limited to data on who contacted whom (number and subscriber, and for telephony also subscription and equipment numbers) and at what time. Data on IP addresses should not be retained for telephony and messaging. The same applies to data on which service has been used, time of logging into and out of the service and data identifying the equipment where the communication with IP telephony is finally separated to the subscriber (see below on Internet access, however). Location data at the beginning and end of a call will still be retained but, as before, no other location data will be retained. For prepaid anonymous services (i.e. unregistered prepaid phone cards), information about communication equipment and initial activation will still be retained. The retention obligation should still include missed (such as unanswered) calls, but not those that fail to get connected.</p>
<p>Internet access</p>
<p>For Internet access, the Commission proposes that the retention obligation should include data that make it possible to identify the subscriber or registered user. Accordingly, the following data should be retained: IP address and other technical data necessary to identify the subscriber or registered user, time data for logging in and out of the service providing Internet access, subscriber information, and data identifying the equipment where the communication is finally separated to the subscriber. However, the Commission suggests that there should no longer be any obligation to retain connection capacity data.</p>
<p>No exception for people bound by professional secrecy</p>
<p>No exceptions to retention should be introduced for people obliged to follow professional secrecy rules. The Data Retention Commission’s proposal to impose an obligation to destroy data subject to professional secrecy rules should be considered.</p>
<h2>Limits of retention obligation to be clarified by law</h2>
<p>The outer limits of the retention obligation should be made clear by law and the more detailed regulations in an ordinance by the Government. To some extent, the Government should be able to delegate the power to issue the necessary ordinance.</p>
<h2>Differentiated retention periods</h2>
<p>It should be specified in law that the data subject to the retention obligation should be stored for the period prescribed by the Government, but not exceeding ten months from the date when the communication ended. The Government shall prescribe the following. Location data for calls should be stored for two months. Data on Internet access, except for data identifying the equipment where the communication is finally separated to the subscriber, should be retained for ten months. Other data should be retained for six months.</p>
<h2>Access to traffic and location data</h2>
<p>Only for prevention of serious crime</p>
<p>Access to retained traffic and location data should be given only for prevention of serious crime. ‘Serious crime’ refers to the same categories of crime for which secret surveillance of electronic communications is currently permitted and also for retrieval of data on electronic communications in the law enforcement agencies’ intelligence activities. Swedish law is thus compatible with EU law in this respect.</p>
<p>Access only to data on people involved in some way in crime – as a main rule</p>
<p>Access to retained data may in principle, according to the Court, be granted only for data on people suspected of planning, committing or having committed a serious crime or being implicated in one way or another in such a crime. In some cases, access may also be granted for data on other people. The Swedish rules on access to data comply with EU legal requirements in this respect.</p>
<p>Prior review by a court or by an independent administrative body</p>
<p>EU law requires that access by law enforcement agencies to retained data, except in justified urgent cases, be preceded by a prior review by a court or by an independent administrative body. The Swedish regulations meet this requirement except for access to retained data in intelligence activities. The Commission therefore proposes that prosecutors shall be appointed as an independent administrative body to decide on such access following an application by the Police Authority, Security Service or Customs.</p>
<p>Information for those concerned</p>
<p>The CJEU states that EU law requires the public agencies that have been granted access to retained data, according to applicable national regulations, to inform the people affected about this as soon as there is no longer a risk of such information being detrimental to the agencies’ investigations. The Swedish rules on information for those concerned meet the requirements of EU law in this respect.</p>
<p>Access to include data stored for operators’ own purposes</p>
<p>Law enforcement agencies’ access to data on electronic communications should continue to include not only the data retained under data retention rules, but also information stored for the operators’ own purposes, such as information needed for billing.</p>
<h2>Access to subscription data</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, the Tele2 judgment does not cover processing of subscription data. With the broad scope of privacy protection, access to subscription data may nonetheless be thought to involve an interference with the protection under the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It is therefore essential for access to be limited to what is strictly necessary and proportionate in a democratic society. Overall, the Commission’s view is that neither the CJEU’s judgment nor Sweden’s international commitments provide any reason to change the requirements for the law enforcement agencies’ access to subscription data.</p>
<h2>Protection and security levels, retention in Sweden and destruction</h2>
<p>The data subject to the retention obligation should not be allowed to be stored outside Sweden. The CJEU states only that national legislation must prescribe that electronic data storage may not take place outside the EU. However, confining the retention to Sweden would enable more effective supervision while improving protection of both individuals’ confidentiality and national security. Since the matter now in question concerns crucial state interests, there are no EU legal barriers to prescribing that storage takes place only in Sweden.</p>
<p>The rules on protection and security levels, and also those on data destruction, comply with the requirements of EU law.</p>
<h2>Impact and implementation</h2>
<p>The proposals for a reformed retention obligation, prohibition of retention outside Sweden and advance review of decisions pursuant to the Act (2012:278) on Acquiring Information about Electronic Communication in the Law Enforcement Agencies’ Intelligence Activities will strengthen protection for privacy and personal data. The recommended reform of the retention obligation may possibly mean that the law enforcement agencies’ capacity for crime fighting is impaired to some extent, but should not mean that crime will increase. The environment will not be affected by the proposals. The proposal on prior review of decisions pursuant to the Act (2012:278) on Acquiring Information about Electronic Communication in the Law Enforcement Agencies’ Intelligence Activities means that the Swedish Prosecution Authority will need a larger annual appropriation (SEK 1 million) and a lump sum (SEK 3 million) that should be financed by reducing appropriations for the Police Authority</p>
<p>(SEK 500,000 for the current framework increase and SEK 1.5 million for the lump sum), the Security Service (SEK 200,000 for the current framework increase and SEK 600,000 for the lump sum) and Customs (SEK 300,000 for the current framework increase and SEK 900,000 for the lump sum). Those who are obliged to retain data should bear the cost increases they incur – for retention, security and adaptation – themselves.</p>
<p>The proposals in the Commission’s report should enter into force on 1 December 2018.</p>
