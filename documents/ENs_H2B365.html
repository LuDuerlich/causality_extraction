<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>Under the terms of reference, my remit has been to analyse the needs of the Swedish Armed Forces regarding air navigation services, with the aim of providing data on the volume of stateorganised air traffic services necessary to guarantee, within the framework of civil-military integration, military needs of air navigation services.</p>
<h2>My starting points</h2>
<p>The main focus of my inquiry has been to present proposals that safeguard the Armed Forces’ need of air navigation services while also ensuring that airport administrations can provide effective local air traffic services. In addition to its terms of reference, the inquiry has also taken account of the Defence Commission’s proposal concerning a new focus for the military ( Report Ds 2014:20, The defence of Sweden; stronger defence for uncertain times ) and the re-regulation implemented on 15 August 2014 that meant that the possibility of opening local air traffic services to competition only covered regional airports not owned or run by the State or by a legal entity in which the State has a controlling interest. Consequently, it is no longer possible for Swedavia AB to procure local air traffic services in competition.</p>
<p>The design and performance of air traffic services is largely a result of international agreements and decisions within the EU. Air traffic services are essential to society and a public responsibility. In my work, I have therefore assumed that the Swedish Transport</p>
<p>Agency and the LFV Group will continue to have responsibility for the overall provision of air traffic services.</p>
<p>Since 1978, Sweden has had joint civil-military airspace which, under the LFV Group’s management, is used by civil and military flights. The joint airspace creates considerable added value for society, not least in that both civil and military flights can optimise their flight paths and thereby reduce the environmental and cost burden. In the course of the inquiry, I have determined that the current arrangements are of such great value that their preservation is a natural premise for my work.</p>
<h2>The Swedish Armed Forces’ need of air navigation services and airports</h2>
<p>The Swedish Armed Forces’ need of air navigation services is closely linked to the need of being able to operate in airspace in both peacetime and heightened alert. The Armed Forces’ prioritised geographic areas are the northernmost areas of Sweden, the Baltic Sea region around Gotland and the metropolitan areas. They are essentially the same areas covered by the national basic airport infrastructure.</p>
<p>Together, the Armed Forces’ own airports and Swedavia AB’s airports cover the geographical area that the Armed Forces currently considers must be covered in order to control airspace that is strategically important to crisis and conflict management in our part of the world. At the same time, this also provides scope for risk diversification and the flexibility necessary to cope with a change in defence orientation. The re-regulation that has occurred regarding the competitive potential for local air traffic services means that the Armed Forces’ needs are covered.</p>
<p>The Armed Forces currently makes use of a limited number of military airports, and planning is based on being able to supplement these with Swedavia AB’s airports as necessary. Swedavia AB is a company, admittedly owned by the Swedish State, but must operate in accordance to the requirements and commitments incumbent on companies. At present, the Armed Forces does not have a self-evident right to use these airports in the event of heightened alert. For example, the environmental permit is not adjusted to this.</p>
<p>To guarantee the Armed Forces’ access to, and the flexibility of, airports in peacetime, crisis and heightened alert, I propose that the Armed Forces be instructed to enter into agreements, over a transitional period of four years, primarily with Swedavia AB but also with the owners of those regional airports considered as being important to the Armed Forces over time. The additional costs that may arise from this should naturally be paid for by the Armed Forces.</p>
<p>In my work, I have not received any clear background material that describes the Armed Forces’ need of resources for air navigation services during various levels of alert and in wartime. However, both the Armed Forces and the LFV Group are working to produce such material. It is expected that this material, related to the new approach for the military proposed by the Defence Commission, can be available within 3 to 5 years. The closest assessment currently available is the indication from the Armed Forces that the re-regulation of 15 August 2014, which meant that the LFV Group is responsible for local air traffic services at all</p>
<p>Swedavia AB’s airports, satisfies the Armed Forces’ needs in a long-term perspective.</p>
<p>As regards the part of air navigation services comprised of the local air traffic services, it can be noted that regulations exist aimed at ensuring that activities comply with flight safety requirements, follow international and Swedish regulations, that it is clear which airspace the service is responsible for and that account is taken of the Armed Forces’ needs. The Swedish Transport Agency takes decisions on appointing suppliers of air traffic services with sole rights in special airspace blocks close to an airport. This means that there is a regulation so designed that it should be possible to guarantee the Armed Forces’ needs.</p>
<p>There are two possible future alternatives. Either the reregulation decided upon should be retained, or local air traffic services should be open to competition. To satisfy the Armed Forces’ current needs as well as the need of improved local air traffic services, I propose that the Armed Forces and the Swedish Transport Agency be instructed to enter into agreements, over a transitional period of four years, and adapt their regulations so that the Armed Forces’ long-term need of air navigation services can be guaranteed regardless of supplier.</p>
<p>During the same period, the LFV Group should develop its professionalism and competitiveness. The Swedish Transport</p>
<p>Agency’s mandate should then be expanded to monitor expenses and efficiency measures within the framework of the compensation system for air navigation services.</p>
<p>After measures are taken, it is my assessment that the conditions should be such as to allow considering opening local air traffic services to competition, including at all of Swedavia AB’s airports.</p>
<h2>The Armed Forces’ need of contingency planning</h2>
<p>At present, there is no coordinated contingency planning of civil defence. This has also been pointed out by the Defence Commission. There is no planning concerning the total defence system. The current arrangement is based on civil society assisting the Armed Forces in times of crisis and heightened alert.</p>
<p>The Armed Forces’ need of contingency planning regarding air navigation services is currently handled by the LFV Group. This is an efficient and rational arrangement. I propose that both the LFV</p>
<p>Group’s responsibilities and the Swedish Transport Agency’s participation in contingency planning be strengthened by introducing supplementary provisions on this in the Aviation Ordinance and in the instructions to the Swedish Transport Agency, and that all designated suppliers of air traffic services be obliged to cooperate with the LFV Group in contingency planning. In this way, the LFV Group can also include all actors in air navigation services in its contingency planning and thereby offer the Armed Forces the assurance it needs to operate in all phases of alert.</p>
<p>The prospects for successful contingency planning are based on cooperation with civil society. Neither staff nor companies currently have wartime postings; instead, they are expected to continue their regular activities as far as possible. To strengthen the</p>
<p>Armed Forces’ flexibility and capacity, I propose that the Armed Forces be instructed to review the requirements placed on suppliers of local air traffic services regarding management of military air traffic in the certification process and when being granted sole rights for airspace close to an airport.</p>
<h2>Air navigation services must become more efficient</h2>
<p>Civil aviation is under cost pressure. Airports and air navigation services must become more efficient for Sweden to be an attractive destination for airlines. The opening of local air traffic services to competition that has taken place at the regional airports shows that it is possible to reduce costs for these services.</p>
<p>I believe that any potential cost savings must be utilised regardless of whether or not, in a number of years, it becomes possible to open the local air traffic services at Swedavia AB’s airports to competition.</p>
<p>To ensure that efficiency efforts continue, I propose that the LFV Group be instructed to prepare a cohesive description of measures implemented or planned to develop the Group’s ability to make its activities more efficient, taking particular aim at developing business strategies, refining the Group’s products and services, and adapting the services it offers to what customers want.</p>
<p>In addition, I propose that the Swedish Transport Agency be instructed to regularly follow up and ensure that efficiency measures take place within the framework of the route charges system, and not merely check that data is comprised of approved cost types.</p>
