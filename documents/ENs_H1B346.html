<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit of the Inquiry</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has been instructed to produce a legislative proposal concerning the introduction of a system for net debiting that also includes offsetting of energy tax and value added tax. Under the</p>
<p>Inquiry’s terms of reference, net debiting refers to a system where the amount of renewable electricity that private individuals or businesses with micro-production produce and feed into the electricity network is set off against the amount of electricity they receive from the electricity network. The remit includes assessing the conditions covered by EU law that apply to the introduction of such a system. The basic premise is that net debiting is to be administered within the energy tax and value added tax systems. The Inquiry is, however, to examine and propose other alternative ways to administer this tax relief.</p>
<p>The Inquiry is also to analyse and present legislative proposals concerning who should be liable to energy tax on electricity. Tax liability for electricity is to be examined independently of the part of the remit concerning net debiting, and it should be possible to implement a proposal regardless of the conclusions on, or the implementation of, a system on net debiting. The design of the regulations on exemption from energy tax on electricity for different forms of renewable electricity production is also to be examined.</p>
<p>The analyses are to be conducted from the following perspectives: legal, economic and public finances, environmental and administrative.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals Tax reduction for micro-production of renewable electricity</h2>
<p>The Government wants to make it easier for individuals who wish to set up micro-production facilities and whose primary aim is to make use of the electricity they produce. This will be accomplished by augmenting the opportunities for these individuals to sell their surplus electricity, or alternatively to enter into net debiting agreements.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s view, a net debiting system would conflict with the Value Added Tax Directive. In addition, the Inquiry does not see any way to make use of any of the exemptions listed in the Value Added Tax Directive in this kind of system. Our conclusion therefore is that a net debiting system should not be introduced.</p>
<p>Instead, the Inquiry proposes that micro-producers be given a tax reduction that corresponds approximately to the amount the producer would have earned in a net debiting system. A tax reduction would not contravene the Value Added Tax Directive. The reduction would, however, be a financial compensation for the electricity these producers often feed into the electricity system without remuneration. It could also both encourage microproducers and act as an incentive for electricity trading companies or electricity network companies to give micro-producers remuneration for the green electricity they produce. In addition, policy work in the sector can help encourage electricity trading companies and electricity network companies to enter into agreements with micro-producers on remuneration for electricity that is fed into the system.</p>
<p>A tax reduction will be given to micro-producers of renewable electricity with a fuse of at most 63 amperes. This threshold has been chosen so as to include as many as possible of those who merely supplement their electricity use with their own electricity production. At the same time, it will not include those who in principle are exclusively electricity producers. The tax reduction is based on the electricity that has been fed into the electricity network, if a corresponding amount of electricity has been bought back. The tax reduction will roughly correspond to electricity tax and value added tax. Based on the 2013 tax rates on electricity, this would mean about 60 öre per kilowatt hour. No more than 10 000 kilowatt hours per year is to be eligible for a tax reduction.</p>
<p>This means that at most, a micro-producer can get back about SEK 6 000 per year.</p>
<p>Both private individuals and businesses will be eligible for a tax reduction. When the tax reduction is given to a business, it is a form of state aid. The Inquiry considers that the proposal should be reported to the European Commission, and is of the opinion that the Commission will approve it.</p>
<h2>Tax liability for energy tax on electricity</h2>
<p>Deregulation of the electricity market has changed the conditions in the market. One example of this is increased opportunities for customers to choose an electricity trading company. Another result of the deregulated market is that electricity trading companies, which are currently liable to electricity tax, increasingly have less local knowledge of their customer’s operations. The opportunities of electricity trading companies to supervise and follow their customers have deteriorated. To all intents and purposes, they must rely on the information provided by electricity network companies when reporting the electricity tax.</p>
<p>There are a number of other reasons for placing the tax liability on the electricity network company. Those who choose to have their electricity supplied by an actor outside Sweden will themselves be liable to tax. The consequences this has for foreign actors is avoided if electricity network companies are instead liable to tax. There are also linguistic grounds as to why the person liable to electricity tax should be in the country where the tax is levied. Giving tax liability to electricity network companies also means a more limited number of entities liable to tax. Electricity trading companies are not subject to suitability assessments. Electricity network companies, on the other hand, are subject to a form of suitability assessment, which should serve as a guarantee that the state receives its tax revenues. In light of this in particular, the Inquiry proposes that liability to electricity tax, in situations where electricity trading companies are currently liable to tax, instead be assumed by electricity network companies.</p>
<h2>Taxation of renewable electricity</h2>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes changes regarding energy tax so as to reduce distortions of competition caused by the current interpretation of the regulations. In certain cases, electricity production in wind power plants is taxed differently than other forms of renewable electricity production. This contravenes the principles behind the electricity certificate system and in some cases also obstructs the proposals on energy efficiency presented by the Government in the 2009 climate bill.</p>
<p>The proposal means that the current general tax exemption for electricity from wind power plants produced by non-professional suppliers will be abolished.</p>
<p>Today, electricity produced at a facility with an installed generator output of less than 100 kilowatts is not liable to tax. The Inquiry does not propose any changes to this basic rule. A hydroelectric power plant with a corresponding output produces about 400 000 kWh per year. To achieve equivalent energy production from wind and wave energy requires a generator output of 250 kilowatts, and solar energy requires a 450 kilowatt peak. The Inquiry proposes that the provision be designed on the basis of these conditions.</p>
<h2>Implications of the Inquiry’s proposals Personal financial incentive</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has calculated on the effects of a tax reduction of SEK 1 450 per year. There is currently no personal financial incentive for potential micro-producers to invest in solar cells even with such a tax reduction. For small-scale wind power plants, there is no incentive without a tax reduction, but with a tax reduction this can be a profitable alternative.</p>
<h2>Production potential and consequences in the electricity market</h2>
<p>The financial potential considered most realistic to achieve is 10.5 gigawatt hours per micro-production, primarily from facilities using solar cells. There may be an increase in the number of smallscale wind power plants. However, it is difficult to estimate how many, since it is primarily agricultural and other business operators who can build wind power plants without undue disturbance to the surroundings.</p>
<p>If the financial potential is realised, i.e. if the demand for electricity is reduced by 10.5 gigawatt hours, it will only produce a marginal change in the price of electricity.</p>
<h2>Socio-economic consequences</h2>
<p>The additional work that the tax reduction will lead to in the private sector mainly applies to network companies. If there is a large number of micro-producers, the cost per micro-producer is reduced, since procedures that make processing more efficient will be developed and implemented. If there is a very large number of micro-producers, there is an incentive to a develop a customised IT system support within the industry. This would involve a higher one-off cost, but at the same time reduce manual processing and thus the cost per micro-producer.</p>
<p>The energy sector and the Swedish Tax Agency estimate the total annual cost for increased administrative burden to SEK 1 630 000. In addition, there is also a one-off cost totalling some SEK 4 500 000. A estimate of possible environmental benefits comes to about SEK 700 000. Based on these figures, it is difficult to motivate the introduction of a tax reduction for microproducers from a socio-economic perspective.</p>
<h2>Public finance consequences</h2>
<p>The tax reduction system will produce a public finance cost in the form of reduced tax revenues of about SEK 3.6 million in 2014 and about SEK 5.2 million in 2015.</p>
<p>Abolishing the special tax exemption for wind power plants will increase public finance gross earnings by about SEK 141 million per year, which corresponds to an annual public finance net revenue of about SEK 110 million.</p>
<h2>Impact for the Swedish Tax Agency</h2>
<p>The proposal of a tax reduction for micro-production of renewable electricity will entail increased administrative costs for the Swedish Tax Agency. When introduced, the Tax Agency must adapt and reconstruct existing data processing systems, and these systems must be updated annually. Annual income statements and information in brochures and on the web must also be dealt with. The costs to the Swedish Tax Agency for the first year are estimated at SEK 3.5 million. The subsequent annual administrative costs for the Tax Agency will be SEK 1 million.</p>
<h2>Effects on the production of wind power</h2>
<p>The reduction of the possibility of tax exempt use of electricity from wind power for producers may lead to a somewhat slower rate of development of wind power. The proposal will however not affect the possibilities of reaching the objective concerning renewable electricity. This is ensured by the system of electricity certificates.</p>
<h2>When can new regulations enter into force?</h2>
<p>Electricity network companies must build up systems to deal with the situation of having become liable to tax. The regulations on their assuming the tax liability should therefore enter into force on 1 January 2015. The date for entry into force of the other proposals has been set to 1 January 2014.</p>
