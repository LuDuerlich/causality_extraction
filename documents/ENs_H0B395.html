<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The task of the Inquiry has been to analyse whether the current legislation in Chapter 19 of the Penal Code is adapted to its purpose and provides adequate protection from the intelligence activities of a foreign power. The remit included analysing whether the harm requisite in the provision concerning espionage is suitably designed, expressing an opinion on whether the protection against industrial and political espionage conducted by a foreign power needs to be enhanced, and clarifying whether there is a need to change the penal law regulations concerning the hidden intelligence activities of a foreign power conducted by means of secret and conspiratorial methods. Our remit has also included presenting full legislative proposals where legislation is deemed appropriate.</p>
<h2>Background information to the remit</h2>
<p>The Swedish Security Service has pointed out a need for enhanced protection of the state when foreign powers conduct unauthorised intelligence activities against Sweden. This need is based in part on a change in the security policy situation in regions close to Sweden, and that intelligence activities by foreign powers have to some degree changed focus to increasingly target circumstances pertaining to research and development in civil sectors. Another important change is Sweden’s increasing cooperation with other countries.</p>
<p>One manifestation of this is that the Swedish Armed Forces currently conducts a large part of its activities through missions abroad. Society has also changed in other ways, including advances in technology, and become more complex. Altogether, the abovementioned circumstances show that there is reason to review the penalty provisions in Chapter 19 of the Penal Code, which are intended to protect the security of the realm against intelligence activities of foreign powers.</p>
<h2>Provision on espionage</h2>
<p>Under the current wording of the provision on espionage, a requirement for criminal liability is that the harm requisite is met. This means that the field of application only includes information which, if disclosed to a foreign power, can cause harm to the security of the realm.</p>
<p>We do not propose any extensive changes to the provision on espionage. The penalty provision is suitably designed and the field of application is well defined. The provision on espionage is intended to protect the security of the realm, i.e. Sweden. The term ‘security of the realm’ refers to protecting the independence and continued existence of the state. We consider that the field of application of the provision on espionage should continue to be reserved for such acts that typically can entail the risk of a significant negative impact on the security of the realm in the sense now stated. The circumstances that are important to the security of the realm, what can threaten the security of the realm and what is necessary to avert threats can vary over time. What the harm requisite covers, and thus also the field of application of the provision on espionage, must therefore be determined with consideration to developments in society and taking account of the circumstances at the time the crime was committed.</p>
<p>The changes to the provision on espionage that we propose are primarily of a linguistic nature, aimed at making the legislation clearer and more modern. For example, we propose replacing the term ‘security of the realm’ with ‘Sweden’s security’. In addition, it is proposed that the current exemplification of sensitive information, as well as the term ‘total defence’, be removed from the text of the Code. These changes are intended to clarify that the espionage provision is to be generally applied and that it is irrelevant which sector of society is targeted by the intelligence activity as long as the harm requisite is met.</p>
<p>Our terms of reference specifically mention the applicability of the harm requisite regarding intelligence activities targeting industrial or political interests. These kinds of intelligence activities can also be covered by the provision on espionage if the information concerns circumstances that, in the hands of a foreign power, can harm the security of the realm. We have not found sufficient reason to propose any changes in the current penal law.</p>
<p>In line with what is stated in the terms of reference, we have also considered whether there is need to change the requirements for assessing the harm requisite in the provision on espionage. We have found no reason to present proposals for changes of the current system in this regard either.</p>
<h2>A new penal provision on foreign espionage</h2>
<p>Developments in society have meant that, to a greater extent, Sweden cooperates with other countries in the area of security and defence policy. In different contexts, the Government has asserted that the country’s security cannot only be safeguarded at our border, and that increased cooperation with other countries means better opportunities to deal with challenges and threats before they reach our own territory. It is felt that promoting international security and defence cooperation is in Sweden’s interest, since it creates confidence between states and lays the foundation for common security.</p>
<p>As a part of this development, a significant amount of the Swedish Armed Forces’ activities are carried out abroad and in cooperation with other countries, including through participation in international military operations. Under the Act on Swedish Armed Forces personnel in international military operations (2010:449), an international military operation refers to activities conducted by the Armed Forces in a deployment area abroad aimed at averting the risk of armed conflict, stopping an ongoing armed conflict, supervising peace and ceasefire agreements or creating the conditions for lasting peace and security through humanitarian work in connection with an armed conflict.</p>
<p>Information on the circumstances concerning an international military operation can be of a sensitive nature and of great importance to the operation and to Sweden, even if the harm requisite in the provision on espionage is not met. Despite this, espionagelike acts targeting such circumstances are in principle outside the penal area. In our view, this entails a shortcoming in the current legislation.</p>
<p>We therefore propose that a new penal provision be introduced in Chapter 19 of the Penal Code that classifies foreign espionage and that imposes penal sanctions on espionage regarding information whose disclosure to a foreign power or association can cause serious harm to an international operation that Sweden participates in. The concept ‘foreign association’ refers to a group that occupies a position of power and represents an opposing interest – usually by in some way being affected by the conflict that serves as a reason for carrying out the operation – but which is not covered by the term ‘foreign power’.</p>
<p>If the circumstances are of such importance to Sweden’s security that the harm requisite in the provision on espionage is met, the penal provision is instead to be applied.</p>
<p>The crime is to entail an applicable scale of penalties that prescribes imprisonment for at most four years or, if the crime is serious, imprisonment for at least two and at most eight years. When assessing whether a crime is gross, special attention is to be given to whether the act concerned matters of major importance or entailed danger to people’s lives or health, or whether the perpetrator disclosed information entrusted to him or her by reason of their position in public or private service.</p>
<p>We propose that criminal liability for foreign espionage is to require direct intent, i.e. that the penal provision is only to cover acts directly aimed at aiding a foreign power or association. However, we also propose that equivalent acts that are carried out with intent but for a different purpose, or through gross carelessness, are to be punishable if they pertain to information concerning circumstances of a secret nature. It is proposed that such acts be criminalised by means of changes to the penal provisions for unauthorised dealing with secret information and carelessness with secret information.</p>
<h2>A new penal provision on unlawful intelligence activities against Sweden</h2>
<p>It is quite common for foreign powers to conduct prohibited intelligence activities in Sweden and that the activities are associated with secret or conspiratorial methods that make them difficult to detect and counteract. The phrase ‘conspiratorial methods’ refers to measures taken to conceal and facilitate a prohibited intelligence activity. It includes measures taken while observing special precautionary measures and by using fraudulent means.</p>
<p>The penal provisions can be considered to represent a protection zone that aim to prevent damage to a specific interest worthy of protection. In general, an important interest worthy of protection can justify a broader protection zone, i.e. more extensive criminalisation. The penal law regulations currently in question are intended to protect Sweden’s security, which is obviously of great importance.</p>
<p>Prohibited intelligence activities conducted by a foreign power which are carried out using conspiratorial methods represent a threat to Sweden’s security. We consider that the current penal law regulations do not provide protection against such intelligence activities that is sufficient and adapted to its purpose. This is partly due to the fact that activities are designed in a way that makes it difficult for law enforcement agencies to gather sufficient evidence against a perpetrator. Another factor is that the penal area is too limited to cover certain punishable activities that occur prior to and in connection with a crime involving espionage. All in all, we consider that there is reason to expand the penal area.</p>
<p>We propose that a new penal provision be introduced into Chapter 19 of the Penal Code with the aim of enhancing the protection of Sweden’s security. The proposal is intended to provide more effective and accurate legislation, and greater opportunities to intervene in a chain of events at an earlier stage and thus prevent damage. The new crime will be classified as ‘unlawful intelligence activities against Sweden’ and will cover activities conducted secretly or by fraudulent means in order to acquire information described in the provision on espionage. The provision is modelled on the currently applicable crime of unlawful intelligence activities in Chapter 19, Section 10, first paragraph of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>As is the case with espionage, criminal liability will require that the perpetrator has direct intent to aid a foreign power. Application of the penal provision does not require being able to prove exactly which information was the intended target of the act or even if any information has been obtained. Accordingly, there is no need to make an assessment of harm. The proposed scale of penalties is imprisonment for at most two years. If the crime is serious, it should be possible to result in a sentence of imprisonment for at least six months and at most four years. Even a person who lends more than occasional assistance to the crime may be subject to criminal liability.</p>
<h2>A new form of carelessness with secret information</h2>
<p>The penal provision for carelessness with secret information covers acts that involve a person who, through gross carelessness, discloses information concerning a matter that meets the harm requisite in the provision on espionage and that is of a secret nature. According to practice, a disclosure is considered to have occurred when information has become available to an unauthorised person under such circumstances that it must be expected that the unauthorised person will have access to it.</p>
<p>Developments in society have brought about more methods of communication and more accessible information in various forms. If, for example, sensitive information is communicated openly over the internet, it is easy for unauthorised persons to access it without leaving any trace. Under the current arrangement, it is likely that the penal area does not cover a case of this kind. We consider that this represents a shortcoming in the legislation and means that punishable activities can be conducted without the risk of criminal liability.</p>
<p>We therefore propose that, to meet the requirements for criminal liability for carelessness with secret information, it should be sufficient for an act to entail a danger of an unauthorised person being able to access sensitive information. In this way, the penal area is expanded to also include careless actions that are typically associated with an imminent risk of information being disclosed to an unauthorised person.</p>
<p>At present, the punishment in peacetime for carelessness with secret information is a fine or imprisonment for at most six months. In our view, the developments in society mentioned above have changed the conditions for the crime currently under consideration and mean that the penal provision can cover acts of a more serious nature than before. An act can pertain to larger quantities of information of a more sensitive nature and entail more serious consequences for Sweden’s safety. We consider that the current scale of penalties is not sufficiently broad for it to always be possible to impose a sentence that corresponds to the seriousness of the crime. We therefore propose that the maximum penalty be increased to one year. However, it is not our intention to bring about a general increase in the severity of punishments for crimes of the kind now under consideration.</p>
<h2>Unlawful intelligence activities against foreign powers and against individuals</h2>
<p>At present, two forms of unlawful intelligence activities are regulated in the same paragraph – both unlawful intelligence activities conducted by a foreign power in Sweden and which can damage the safety of another foreign power, and what is commonly referred to as refugee espionage. In both cases, the crime is classified as unlawful intelligence activity. We propose that these two types of crime instead be regulated in different paragraphs and assigned their own criminal classifications: unlawful intelligence activities against foreign powers and unlawful intelligence activities against individuals. This will help clarify the legislation.</p>
<p>Regarding unlawful intelligence activities against individuals, our proposal also involves expanding the penal area and a more stringent scale of penalties. Under the current wording, the penal provision covers activities conducted secretly or by using fraudulent means. This means that activities aimed at procuring personal data that occurs openly but with the aid of improper pressure, such as implied threats or promises, are not covered by the penal provision. In our view, this represents a shortcoming in the current regulations. We therefore propose that the penal provision also cover activities conducted using improper means.</p>
<p>Under the present scale of penalties for unlawful intelligence activities against individuals, fines or imprisonment for at most one year can be imposed. We consider that the scale of penalties does not correspond to the seriousness with which this type of crime should be viewed, taking account of such matters as the violation of personal privacy of the individual that the crime may entail. We therefore propose removing fines from the scale of penalties.</p>
<p>Finally, we propose that the requirement of special authorisation by the Government regarding prosecution for unlawful intelligence activity against individuals be abolished.</p>
<h2>An option to use coercive measures</h2>
<p>Our proposals include the introduction of two new penal provisions in Chapter 19 of the Penal Code (see above). In both cases, the acts targeted by the penal provisions are, by their nature, difficult to investigate. Considering the importance of the interests that the penal provisions are intended to protect – the security of the realm and an international military operation that Sweden participates in – and the requirement of effective penal legislation, we consider it both reasonable and appropriate that good options are available for using secret coercive measures if a crime is suspected. In our view, the regulations should correspond to that which applies regarding other comparable crimes under Chapter 19 of the Penal Code. We therefore propose making certain changes to the Act on measures to prevent certain particularly serious offences (2007:979) and the Act on measures to investigate certain crimes that are threats to society (2008:854).</p>
<h2>Freedom of the press and of expression</h2>
<p>Some of our proposals can be considered to encroach on freedom of expression and information, which are protected by the constitution and entail a restriction of these freedoms. This applies particularly to the proposal on a new penal provision regarding foreign espionage. We have found that these consequences can be accepted in light of the compelling reasons that justify criminalising these acts and to the restrictions in the penal area.</p>
<p>We also propose certain changes to the Freedom of the Press Act and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression. These are motivated by the fact that the changes we propose will be implemented in the existing provisions of Chapter 19 of the Penal Code. We propose inserting foreign espionage as a crime against freedom of the press in Chapter 7, Article 4 of the Freedom of the Press Act and be included in the list in Chapter 7, Article 3 of the same Act. The latter means that a perpetrator cannot escape criminal liability by referring to freedom of source or procurement. We consider that there are strong arguments in favour of an arrangement of this kind, and that it is logical and consistent.</p>
