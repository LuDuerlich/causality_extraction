<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Inquiry’s terms of reference</h2>
<p>The Inquiry is to present proposals for a clearer regulatory framework on dam safety to supplement the general provisions given in the Swedish Environmental Code and elsewhere. The regulatory framework is to support enhanced work on dam safety on the part of dam owners, coordinated emergency preparedness planning for dam failure, and augmented supervision of dam safety, particularly with respect to dams where a failure, apart from endangering the life and health of many people, could cause serious disruptions to vital public services.</p>
<p>Among other things, the Inquiry is to:  present proposals on the design of a mandatory classification system for all dam facilities, based on the potential consequences of a dam failure;  present proposals on legislation and other measures needed to enable dam owners to submit systematic reports to the supervisory authorities, the scope of which will be adapted according to the category to which the dams belong;  investigate whether the supervisory guidance for dam safety and measures to promote dam safety in Sweden is of sufficient scope and is appropriately organised or whether it should be brought under the organisation of some other government agency.</p>
<h2>Current situation</h2>
<p>There are an estimated 10 000 dams in Sweden, of varying size and age. Of these, 190 are hydropower dams classified internationally as large dams, which means they are more than 15 m high. Apart from the 190 large hydropower dams, about 15 tailings dams are more than 15 m high. The dams are largely located on regulated rivers. Most were built between 1940 and 1970, though some dams are older.</p>
<p>A dam failure in a dam holding a large dammed up volume can have very grave consequences. Lives may be lost and important public services such as roads, railways, electricity, telecommunications, water and waste water systems can be destroyed or seriously disrupted. In the case of more than 500 dams in Sweden, a dam failure would entail far-reaching consequences for society and the area surrounding the dam.</p>
<p>A common cause of dam failure is overtopping of the dam crest. Other causes include leakage or inadequate stability.</p>
<p>Sweden has no special law on dam safety. There are regulations on dam safety in several regulatory frameworks, the most central of which are the Environmental Code and the Civil Protection Act. Under these regulations, the operator is required to obtain the necessary knowledge, investigate and assess the risks involved in the operations from environmental and health perspectives, draw up and follow routines for self-regulation and otherwise take requisite measures and be prepared to prevent damage. However, because the regulatory frameworks are of a relatively general nature, the application of the provisions varies.</p>
<p>Tailings dams are covered by the provisions of the Extractive Waste Ordinance (2008:722). This Ordinance already makes the operator subject to explicit requirements, including establishing a safety management system and an internal emergency plan.</p>
<p>Dam safety is a part of the ‘water activities’ supervisory area in the Environmental Code, for which the county administrative board is the supervisory authority. The county administrative boards have exercised limited supervision of dam safety, with very little or no time for self-initiated supervision.</p>
<p>Since 1998, Svenska kraftnät (The Swedish National Grid) has been responsible for promoting dam safety in Sweden, which includes providing supervisory guidance to the county administrative boards.</p>
<h2>Proposed system of dam safety classification</h2>
<p>It is important for society to be aware of objects that may pose a risk to the surrounding area or society at large. In the event of a failure, dam facilities may pose such a risk, leading to major consequences for society. To identify these dams, the Inquiry has proposed the introduction into the Environmental Code of provisions on a classification system for dams. The classification system should be based on the following guiding principles regarding dams where dam failure could cause consequences for society, i.e. more than minor local consequences:  The probability of a dam failure shall be kept at the lowest reasonable level taking existing knowledge and available technology into account.  As far as possible, the consequences of a dam failure shall be reduced or prevented.</p>
<p>The principles are to be applied differently depending on the potential consequences of a dam failure. In addition to providing a basis for the classification system, the application of the principles will enable differentiation of both the dam owner’s safety measures and reporting routines, and the supervision by authorities that is proposed.</p>
<p>The classification will be based on an assessment of the combined consequences of a dam failure. Consequences for the surrounding community are taken to include loss of human lives, destruction of homes, cultural sites and buildings, destruction of or disruptions to vital public services and infrastructure, such as the electricity supply, dam facilities, water and waste water facilities, bridges, roads, railways, telecommunications, etc., and environmental and economic damage.</p>
<p>The system will comprise three dam safety classes, A to C, with class A consisting of the dams estimated to have the largest consequences in the event of a dam failure. Dam facilities where a dam failure is not estimated to have more than minor local consequences will not be classified and will not be subject to any special dam safety requirements.</p>
<p>Water installations that retain or keep out water, mixtures of water and other materials, e.g. tailings, will be covered by the proposed classification system. Hydropower dams, regulating dams, tailings dams, locks and levees are examples of structures that will be covered by the classification system. The classification system will include both new and existing installations.</p>
<p>The dam owner will be required to produce a consequence study with an account of the assessment of the combined consequences in the event of a dam failure. Based on the study, the owner is to submit a proposal to the supervisory authority on the class to which the dam should be considered to belong. The supervisory authority will then take a decision on the dam safety class. Only the owner will be entitled to appeal against the decision.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the classification process be conducted as a special project at the supervisory authority over a period of three years, with the dams that have the largest volumes of water that could be released in the event of a dam failure being classified first. Under the proposal, Svenska kraftnät will be authorised to issue more detailed regulations concerning the contents of the consequence study.</p>
<h2>Proposed routines for self-regulation and reporting</h2>
<p>Effective self-regulation by the operator is vital to compliance with the Environmental Code. The supervisory authority is to monitor compliance by checking that the self-regulation is appropriately designed and calling attention to deficiencies in the operations, if necessary. The Inquiry proposes the introduction of a requirement for operators of dam facilities with dams in safety class A, B or C to establish and work in accordance with a safety management system. The system is to describe the division of operational responsibilities, serious risks that can lead to dam failure, operation, conditions monitoring and maintenance routines, routines for managing changes, planning for emergency situations and how the safety management system is to be revised. The proposal also includes a requirement that the owner conduct a safety review of the dam facility concerned and submit an annual dam safety report to the supervisory authority. Under the proposal, failure to submit the dam safety report within the specified time will entail an environmental sanction charge. The purpose of the more detailed requirements is to provide better transparency into the owners’ dam safety work for the supervisory authority, but also to strengthen owners’ self-regulation.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, tailings dams are regulated by the Extractive Waste Ordinance, which contains certain requirements concerning operators’ safety work. To avoid double regulation of tailings dams, an owner of tailings dams that constitute a hazardous activity under the Ordinance will only be required to carry out a safety review of the dam facility at certain intervals and to submit an annual dam safety report to the supervisory authority.</p>
<p>It is proposed that Svenska kraftnät be authorised to issue regulations on the more detailed contents of the safety management system and the contents and frequency of the safety review and reports.</p>
<h2>Proposal on supervision of dam safety</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has found that the supervision of dam safety exercised by the county administrative boards has been inadequate. This has been due to the limited resources available to the county administrative boards for supervision of water activities in general and dam safety in particular. The supervision of dam safety that has been exercised has been unable to adequately ensure that dam owners, through their self-regulation, discover and correct serious weaknesses and deficiencies. The Inquiry has therefore concluded that supervision of dam safety needs to be strengthened in terms of both resources and skills.</p>
<p>Under the Inquiry’s proposals, the county administrative board will continue to be the supervisory authority for dam safety. With regard to dams, the tasks of the county administrative boards include supervision of water activities, which includes supervision of dam safety. In addition to this, the county administrative board has a broad responsibility for coordinating emergency preparedness in the county. The board is in a good position to coordinate the various areas of responsibility. In the Inquiry’s opinion, there is a greater potential for trade-offs between these areas of responsibility if the supervision of dam safety remains the responsibility of the county administrative board.</p>
<p>Under the Inquiry’s proposals, counties where there is a dam in safety class A should have a dam safety officer working exclusively on dam safety supervision and other matters related to dam safety. This will probably concern the counties of Norrbotten, Västerbotten, Västernorrland, Jämtland, Dalarna, Värmland and Västra Götaland. In addition to the dam facilities with dams in safety class A, more than 70 per cent of the dam facilities with dams in safety classes B and C are also located in these counties.</p>
<p>Even though there are probably no dams in safety class A in the county of Gävleborg, the county administrative board there should also be reinforced with a dam safety officer. There are many class B and C dams in the county. The county of Gävleborg lies on the lower reaches of the River Ljusnan. If the Gävleborg County Administrative Board is also reinforced with a dam safety officer, the ten large hydropower rivers will lie in counties whose county administrative boards possess special dam safety skills. This will be an advantage for the implementation and follow-up of coordinated emergency preparedness planning for dam failures that is conducted on a river-by-river basis in the major regulated rivers.</p>
<p>In the other 13 counties, the supervision of dam safety for dam facilities with class B and C dams can be conducted by water officers who are also responsible for supervising water activities at the facilities. These county administrative boards can receive advice and support from the dam safety officers at the eight designated county administrative boards or at Svenska kraftnät.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that a special code for supervision of dam safety be introduced in the county administrative boards’ time reporting systems. The availability of such a code will facilitate the planning and monitoring of dam safety supervision.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that a network of dam safety officers be established, consisting of the officers at the county administrative boards in the eight counties specified above and the officers at the central unit for dam safety at Svenska kraftnät. The network’s role will be to promote increased coordination and further development of dam safety supervision. A network of officers will make it possible to develop equivalent supervisory methods and assessments, which is a prerequisite for effective and equivalent supervision.</p>
<p>A total of seven to nine annual full-year equivalent positions are required for ongoing operational dam safety supervision of facilities with dams in safety classes A, B and C throughout the country.</p>
<p>It will be appropriate to base the supervision on the annual dam safety reports proposed by the Inquiry. The Inquiry proposes that in the future, the supervision of dams with particularly far-reaching consequences in the event of a failure should be guided by ongoing development work within the framework of Svenska kraftnät’s government assignment to provide supervisory guidance concerning these dams.</p>
<p>To ensure that this supervision follows consistent lines, is sufficiently extensive and complies with regulatory frameworks and regulations, the supervision conducted must be followed up. The Inquiry proposes that the county administrative boards draw up annual reports on the supervision of dam safety that has been carried out. The reports will be submitted to Svenska kraftnät.</p>
<p>Dam safety officers need skills primarily in dam design and construction and dam safety management. In addition, an officer needs skills in supervision methods and law.</p>
<h2>Proposals on supervisory guidance and promotion of dam safety</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has also found that the supervisory guidance provided for dam safety has been inadequate. Access to electricity preparedness appropriations has enabled Svenska kraftnät to make positive contributions to dam safety in Sweden by supporting research and development projects. On the other hand, the Inquiry considers that the authority has devoted insufficient resources to supervisory guidance.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s view, Svenska kraftnät should retain responsibility for promoting dam safety, including the role of providing guidance on the supervision of dam safety. The Inquiry has not found any decisive grounds for transferring the responsibility for promoting dam safety and providing supervisory guidance to another authority at the present time.</p>
<p>A body organised as a cohesive entity responsible for safety and preparedness in the electricity area has distinct advantages. As an organisation, Svenska kraftnät can take responsibility for and focus on all the tasks that the central unit for dam safety ought to pursue. The Inquiry sees this as an essential condition for favourable developments in the area. Svenska kraftnät is considered likely to be able to recruit people with dam safety skills.</p>
<p>The financing provided from electricity preparedness appropriations has been highly significant for the development of the central unit for dam safety at Svenska kraftnät. It is also a prerequisite for the continued development of dam safety promotion. Consequently, it is positive for dam safety that the issues are handled in close association with the electricity preparedness authority at Svenska kraftnät.</p>
<p>As the central unit for dam safety, Svenska kraftnät should continue to carry out the tasks of supervisory guidance and promotion that it currently performs in accordance with its instructions. The instructions for Svenska kraftnät should be adjusted to clarify coordination with county administrative boards to achieve effective supervision.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the central unit for dam safety at Svenska kraftnät be tasked with examining the conditions for a dam safety database containing the information about dams needed for good supervision of dam safety, and with developing and administering such a database. In time, the dam safety database should contain all dams in Sweden for which a dam safety class has been determined. The database should be designed so as to allow the dam owners themselves to report directly in the database and view information about their dams. The internet-based database should also furnish material for the supervision exercised by the county administrative boards. Each county administrative board should be able to view information about the dams in its county and to report supervisory measures carried out. The Inquiry is of the opinion that a dam safety database is a prerequisite for effective dam safety supervision, since it simplifies the submission process for annual reports, makes it easier for county administrative boards to plan and follow up supervisory measures and makes it easier for Svenska kraftnät to monitor reports submitted and supervision conducted.</p>
<p>In view of the increased duties, the total workload for the central unit for dam safety at Svenska kraftnät should amount to six annual full-year equivalents.</p>
<p>Like equivalent officers at the county administrative boards, dam safety officers at Svenska kraftnät need skills in dam design and construction and dam safety management. In addition, officers need skills in supervision methods and law.</p>
<h2>Financing of supervision and supervisory guidance</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that owners of dams in safety classes A–C should pay a standard annual fee for supervision. The standard fee will constitute a basic fee for the supervision of dam safety that the county administrative board is required to conduct on the basis of the requirements of the Environmental Code and the clarified regulations proposed by the Inquiry. The size of the fee will correspond to the supervision of dam safety conducted by the county administrative board. This makes it important to monitor the supervision carried out.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the annual supervision fee be set at SEK 96 000 for a dam in safety class A, SEK 32 000 for a dam in safety class B and SEK 6 400 for a dam in safety class C. If the supervisory authority needs to take supervisory measures beyond the basic necessary supervision, the possibility should be allowed of charging an additional fee at an hourly rate. If a dam facility has more than one dam the supervision fee should be adjusted.</p>
<p>The supervisory guidance for dam safety should be financed by a separate appropriation. The appropriation for supervisory guidance and development of methods for supervision and self-regulation should amount to SEK 10 million.</p>
<p>The promotion of dam safety should continue to be financed out of the appropriation for electricity preparedness. This appropriation should amount to SEK 10–12 million.</p>
<p>Until the dams concerned have been classified, there will be no system for defining the fee-paying group. Consequently, it is impossible to begin charging supervision fees based on the class to which the dam concerned belongs before a decision on classification has been taken. The Inquiry therefore proposes that the county administrative boards conduct the classification within the framework of the budget for supervisory guidance for dam safety. This means that the above-mentioned annual appropriation of SEK 10 million for supervisory guidance will also be required to pay for the work of the county administrative boards on classification. During the three years that the Inquiry estimates the classification process will take, Svenska kraftnät will distribute funds to the county administrative boards in accordance with a distribution key. The key should be based on the number of dam facilities for which consequence studies are required in each county.</p>
<h2>Emergency preparedness planning for dam failures</h2>
<p>In the Inquiry’s opinion, emergency preparedness planning for dam failures should be conducted on a river-by-river basis. The Inquiry therefore finds that the coordinated emergency preparedness planning that is in progress or is planned for all major regulated rivers should be completed. Current regulations make it clear that the county administrative board is responsible for coordinating and developing emergency preparedness planning for dam failures in the county. The Inquiry considers that the county administrative board is an appropriate actor to take continued responsibility for such coordination and its further development with regard to dam failures.</p>
<p>Both municipalities and county administrative boards are required to plan their rescue services and emergency organisation to enable effective rescue operations in the event of a dam failure. For the sake of their own planning, all actors concerned are to communicate with one another. The river groups are a suitable forum for this and their importance should therefore be underlined. The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, in coordination with Svenska kraftnät, should develop guidance and highlight best practice concerning preparedness for dam failures.</p>
<p>The owner or operator of a facility where operations have been assessed as hazardous under Chapter 2, Section 4 of the Civil Protection Act is required to analyse the risks involved in the operations. Based on this analysis, the owner or operator is to hold a dialogue with the municipality on how the municipality’s emergency preparedness can be supplemented. A system for public warning is an appropriate and reasonable preparedness measure that could be paid for by the dam owner. However, other measures may also be appropriate.</p>
<p>In order to require supplementary emergency preparedness measures, the facility concerned must come under Chapter 2, Section 4 of the Civil Protection Act. It is therefore important that the county administrative boards decide at which dams in their county operations are to be considered hazardous within the meaning of this Section. Dam facilities with class A and B dams should come under the provision on hazardous activities.</p>
<h2>Protection, security and electricity preparedness</h2>
<p>The energy sector is vulnerable and antagonistic actions towards it can cause a great or very great impact with limited means. The current threat picture is not static; it varies in view of changes inside and outside Sweden’s borders. The security of the electric power supply includes dams. The requirement of the Electricity Preparedness Act that operators conduct risk and vulnerability analyses concerning the security of their own operations and provide</p>
<p>information about disruptions to the electric power supply provides an opportunity for the state to obtain greater insight into the security of the electric power supply. Particular attention should be paid to dams in the regulations that are established.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that there is a need to identify which dam facilities should be protected objects under the Protection Act. In the opinion of the Inquiry, a dam facility in the proposed dam safety class A should be a protected object.</p>
<p>There is also a need to clarify which dam facilities should come under the requirements of the Protective Security Act. In the</p>
<p>Inquiry’s opinion, a dam failure in a facility with a dam in safety class</p>
<p>A could have such an impact on national security and on the surrounding area generally that the company that owns the facility should come under the relevant requirements of the Protective Security Act.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that guidance and best practice on the design of security protection for dams should be made available by Svenska kraftnät in consultation with the industry. The Inquiry does, however, not consider it appropriate to specify it in regulations.</p>
