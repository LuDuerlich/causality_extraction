<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Committee’s remit</h2>
<p>The 2018 All-Party Committee of Inquiry on Freedom of the Press and Freedom of Expression has been tasked with reviewing, with the existing legal framework for freedom of the press and freedom of expression as its starting point, the constitutional provisions in this area in a number of respects.</p>
<p>One of the tasks entrusted to the Committee has been to analyse how the possibility of imposing liability under the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression (FLFE) relates to the provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (the European Convention) in the case of satellite transmissions emanating from outside Sweden.</p>
<p>In addition, the Committee’s remit has included considering whether there is reason to propose amendments to fundamental (constitutional) or other laws in order to be able to uphold a prohibition on the making of images under the Installations Protection Act (2010:305), even when such images are procured for publication in media enjoying constitutional protection.</p>
<p>The Committee has also been tasked with carrying out a review and analysis of the “internet transmission rule”, and with analysing and reaching a position on the need to limit constitutional protection for collections of data relating to criminal offences.</p>
<p>Further tasks have been to consider whether packaging should be excluded from the scope of the Freedom of the Press Act (FPA) and whether constitutional amendments are needed to be able to impose a “must carry” obligation with respect to complementary services for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>As regards public service broadcasting, the Committee’s remit has included, on the one hand, analysing whether its independence needs to be strengthened and, if so, whether this should be achieved by constitutional amendments; and on the other, considering whether it should be possible to lay down conditions for transmissions and services provided in this sector, regardless of the technology used.</p>
<p>The Committee has also been asked to consider whether authors can and should be primarily liable for digital books not based on a printed original.</p>
<h2>Constitutional protection for certain transmissions of programmes by satellite</h2>
<p>Under the main rule on transmissions, the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression is applicable to transmissions of programmes that are directed to the general public and intended for reception using technical aids (Chapter 1, Article 3, first paragraph of the FLFE). An addition to this main rule has extended the application of the Fundamental Law to programmes made available by satellite transmission emanating from Sweden, even though these transmissions are not considered to be directed to the general public (Chapter 1, Article 3, third paragraph of the FLFE). If the satellite transmission does not emanate from Sweden, the basic premise is that the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression is not applicable.</p>
<p>What decides the question of where a satellite transmission emanates from is where the programme content transmitted is determined, and not where a programme is in fact produced or how it is technically transported (Supreme Court, NJA 2002, p. 314). If programming activities are located abroad, in other words, the satellite transmission is considered to emanate from there. If the programmes are retransmitted simultaneously and unmodified in Sweden, however, certain provisions of the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression are nonetheless applicable, including the rules on freedom to communicate and procure information (Chapter 11, Article 1 of the FLFE).</p>
<p>In such cases, though, the freedom to communicate information is not counterbalanced by sole liability under the liability provisions of the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression. The consequence of this is that individuals taking part in such a programme may be covered by the freedom to communicate information, without there being anyone who is liable for the content of the programme under the Fundamental Law.</p>
<p>In its judgment of 1 March 2016 in the case of Arlewin v. Sweden, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) made the assessment that it had not been possible to hold anybody in Sweden liable for a statement in a programme on TV3 – which is considered to emanate from the United Kingdom – when the person who made the statements had the freedom to communicate information. The Court took the view that Sweden consequently did not meet the European Convention’s requirement of effective access to a court. The fact that the applicant’s claim could possibly have been examined by a court in the United Kingdom was not considered to compensate for this deficiency.</p>
<p>The Committee has analysed the basic premises of the case tried by the ECHR and made the assessment that it is not, as such, possible to conclude with certainty that Mr Arlewin was completely without legal remedy in the situation that arose, as it cannot be ruled out that it would have been possible to institute proceedings under ordinary law. Equally, however, it is not possible to say with certainty that Mr Arlewin would have been able to secure his right to effective access to a court in that way.</p>
<p>The Committee considers it reasonable that a person who believes that they have suffered defamation, for example, in a programme with such strong connections to Sweden as the one in question should not need to have recourse to a foreign court for a determination of their claim. The Committee has therefore considered various options, including limiting the freedom to communicate information in the case of programmes emanating from abroad, but retransmitted in Sweden. Such a limitation, however, has been regarded as too great an encroachment on one of the cornerstones of freedom of the press and freedom of expression.</p>
<p>Instead, the Committee proposes that the scope of application of the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression should be extended to include certain satellite transmissions that are currently considered to emanate from abroad. The freedom to communicate information will then be counterbalanced by sole liability. This extension will be limited to transmissions that have a particularly strong connection to Sweden and that in many respects can be perceived to be Swedish. This means that only programmes that are retransmitted here and are mainly intended to be received here will be covered. For the last-mentioned criterion to be met, it will not be sufficient for the transmission of a programme to be directed to Sweden in a purely technical sense; other factors that might be taken into account include whether the programme is in Swedish, whether it is aimed at a Swedish audience and whether it is recorded or produced here.</p>
<p>However, since – despite the strong Swedish connection of such programmes – it will in reality be a matter of programming activities carried on abroad, it may be difficult to hold anyone liable if the provisions on appointing an editor are not followed. The Committee therefore proposes that, in such cases, the chain of liability should be supplemented to include liability for the owner of the enterprise operating the transmission activities. Liability will pass to the owner in cases where the operator of the transmission activities had no known domicile in Sweden at the time of the offence and, in addition, cannot be reached here during the court proceedings.</p>
<h2>Constitutional protection for the making of images, descriptions and measurements of protected objects</h2>
<p>The purpose of the Installations Protection Act is to give certain buildings, areas, installations and other objects enhanced protection, inter alia against sabotage, terrorist offences and espionage. The range of facilities and sites that can be designated as protected objects is set out in the Act. A decision to designate, for example, a building or an area as a protected object means that access to it is prohibited. This prohibition of access can be supplemented with, or replaced by, a prohibition on the making of images, which includes the making of images, measurements or descriptions of or within the protected object. Violations of such a prohibition constitute a criminal offence.</p>
<p>It used to be the view that a prohibition on the making of images under the Installations Protection Act could also be upheld in cases where it was a matter of procuring information for publication in media covered by the Freedom of the Press Act or the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression. In the case reported in NJA 2015, p. 298, however, the Supreme Court made it clear that a prohibition on making images under the Installations Protection Act does not take aim at the manner in which the information is procured, but at what is depicted. A violation of such a prohibition therefore cannot be equated with the methods of procuring information that are excluded from constitutional protection in Chapter 1, Article 12, point 6 of the FPA and Chapter 1, Article 18 of the FLFE. It is thus not possible to uphold a prohibition on the making of images when it is a matter of procuring information for publication in media with constitutional protection.</p>
<p>With the case cited as a starting point, the Committee notes that the application of a prohibition on making images comes into conflict with the freedom to procure information when such images are procured for purposes of publication, and that, for example, seizure and other coercive measures taken in conjunction with an intervention could constitute inadmissible obstructive measures. On the other hand, it is the Committee’s assessment that these provisions do not, as such, conflict with the prohibition of censorship, i.e. the prohibition of prior scrutiny.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s assessment, moreover, the fact that a prohibition on the making of images cannot be upheld when those images are made for purposes of publication entails a risk of information about a protected object being obtained and disseminated and, for example, possibly coming to the knowledge of a foreign power. In the Committee’s view, it is fundamental to Sweden’s security that the critical assets of the total defence system can be safeguarded. The provisions of the Installations Protection Act are an important element in achieving this, and it has never been the intention that the freedom to procure information should take precedence in this context. The Committee considers that there is reason to limit the freedom to procure information when it comes to the making of images, descriptions and measurements of protected objects, to enable these critical assets to be safeguarded in the manner intended.</p>
<p>The Committee has considered various options, including amendments to the Installations Protection Act, but has concluded that a delegation provision should be introduced in the fundamental laws, creating scope for ordinary legislation prohibiting the making of images of and within protected objects.</p>
<h2>Constitutional protection for internet transmissions</h2>
<p>The main rule on transmissions in Chapter 1, Article 3, first paragraph of the FLFE means that traditional linear transmissions of television and radio programmes automatically enjoy constitutional protection under the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression. The second paragraph contains the “internet transmission rule”, which covers transmissions via the internet that are either broadcast live or consist of pre-recorded material that is played back without the receiver himor herself being able to influence the starting time. These transmissions also fall within the scope of automatic constitutional protection.</p>
<p>The internet transmission rule was originally intended to apply chiefly to traditional television broadcasts that are simultaneously transmitted over the internet. With advances in technology, however, the rule has come to be applied much more broadly. The Committee has commissioned a survey of the kinds of material now available in terms of recordings of sounds and images, and of the platforms that exist for internet transmissions. The survey shows that the range of material available is extensive and that basically anyone can easily start a transmission, e.g. on Facebook, YouTube or Instagram, that could be covered by the internet transmission rule.</p>
<p>The Committee believes there is reason to assume that internet transmissions occur on a large scale and vary widely in character. Many of those who transmit via the internet are neither aware of nor interested in the protections of the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression, nor do they comply with its rules and obligations. With this in mind, the Committee is of the opinion that the internet transmission rule can no longer be regarded as serving its intended purpose and striking the right balance. The Committee has therefore considered whether the rule should be abolished, but has made the assessment that protection for certain internet transmissions should remain in place. The scope of the rule should therefore instead be limited to actors covered by the “database rule”, i.e. actors that enjoy automatic constitutional protection or constitutional protection on the basis of a certificate of no legal impediment to publication (a “publishing certificate”). With such an approach, protection will remain in place for the internet transmissions of the traditional media, among others, regardless of what platform those transmissions occur on. Protection will also remain for internet transmissions provided by the holder of a publishing certificate.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s assessment, a consequence of someone transmitting a programme via the internet is that they also secure automatic constitutional protection for the other content of their databases. In many cases, that consequence is unwarranted. The Committee therefore proposes an amendment to the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression, to the effect that the editorial offices responsible for internet transmissions are no longer given automatic constitutional protection for their databases. However, this will not rule out the possibility of someone who transmits via the internet having constitutional protection for their databases on some other ground, for example as the editorial office of a radio or television programme, or based on a publishing certificate.</p>
<p>In connection with this, the Committee also proposes that the reference to the internet transmission rule in the last paragraph of the database rule should be deleted. This is not intended to change the legal position, however.</p>
<h2>Constitutional protection for certain search services</h2>
<p>The Freedom of the Press Act and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression provide a degree of protection for the personal privacy of individuals through their lists of offences constituting freedom of the press and freedom of expression offences. Apart from that, there is very limited scope to safeguard personal privacy in the areas covered by these two fundamental laws. Data protection provisions, for example, are not applied in cases where they are incompatible with the fundamental laws.</p>
<p>The basic position, therefore, is that actors that enjoy automatic or voluntary constitutional protection are able to freely publish personal data relating to criminal offences. This has paved the way for the emergence of a number of what are purely search services on the internet publishing such data. By searching by name or address for example, users of these services can find out whether a given individual has been convicted of an offence. This is despite the fact that such data have been given special protection under the EU’s</p>
<p>General Data Protection Regulation on account of their sensitive nature.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s view, making information about the criminal activities of private individuals freely available on the internet creates a risk of serious invasions of their personal privacy. While there may in certain cases be legitimate reasons for gaining access to this type of information, the need for services of this kind to be fully protected by the basic principles of freedom of the press and freedom of expression would seem to be limited.</p>
<p>The Committee therefore proposes that the existing delegation provisions concerning sensitive personal data should be amended by adding personal data relating to criminal offences to the list of categories of personal data that can be regulated by ordinary law.</p>
<p>However, to strike a reasonable balance between freedom of expression and the protection of individuals’ personal privacy, the scope of the delegation provisions should be limited. As is currently the case, one condition for the provisions to apply should be that the personal data in question form part of a collection of data that is searchable or collatable. The delegation provisions should only apply if, in view of the character of the collection of data published, it is clear that there is a particular risk of improper invasion of the personal privacy of individuals. In borderline cases or situations that are difficult to assess, it is important to apply a significant margin in favour of the interest in wide freedom of expression. When in doubt, the interest in freedom of expression should carry most weight.</p>
<h2>Constitutional protection for packaging</h2>
<p>The formal scope of application of the Freedom of the Press Act and of the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression is determined on the basis of the technology used to convey the utterances in question. One consequence of this is that printed packaging is covered by the Freedom of the Press Act, as it is produced using printing technology. According to the Committee’s terms of reference, however, it is open to question whether packaging should be covered by the special constitutional protection afforded by the Freedom of the Press Act. Therefore, the Committee has been asked to consider if it is needed and appropriate to exclude packaging from the scope of application of the Freedom of the Press Act. The Committee has weighed up the reasons for and against this.</p>
<p>One reason that could support the exclusion of packaging from the Freedom of the Press Act is the issues arising in EU cooperation on regulation of the design of packaging. In negotiations on this subject, Sweden puts considerable effort into ensuring that the requirements placed on packaging are compatible with the Freedom of the Press Act, even when those requirements can be regarded as justified in other respects. The emphasis on regulation in this area being compatible with the Freedom of the Press Act may also mean that lower priority has to be given to other important issues. In addition, there may be less acceptance among other countries for our fundamental laws if they are invoked too often. Confidence in the fundamental laws may also be undermined in a domestic context if they cover phenomena that are far removed from their core areas.</p>
<p>The material exceptions to the scope of application that already exist, however, mean that this is less of a problem than it would otherwise have been. First, there are express delegation provisions that may come into play when it comes to the design of packaging; and second, there are exceptions that have emerged in case law through an interpretation of the purposes of the Freedom of the Press Act. As a result, it is for example possible to regulate certain product information and pure advertising on packaging. It is not possible, however, to require prior scrutiny of such information, for instance, nor is it possible to regulate the entire surface of the packaging. Some space must be left for business operators to provide with text of their own.</p>
<p>The Committee’s view is that text on packaging most commonly has other purposes than those referred to in the Freedom of the Press Act. However, such text may also include utterances that fall within the purposes of the Act. An exception for packaging would mean that purely opinion-forming utterances in that context, for example, would also lose their protection under the Freedom of the Press Act. The protection afforded by the Instrument of Government is admittedly more flexible and adaptable, but the downside is that that protection is not as strong. In the Committee’s assessment, excluding packaging from the protection of the Freedom of the Press Act could result in less carefully considered regulation of such packaging information as can be considered to fall within the purposes of the Act. It could also have spillover effects. In addition, an exception for packaging would mean that, from the standpoint of freedom of expression, it would be treated differently from other printed matter, which means that utterances could be assessed in different ways depending on whether they are printed on packaging or, say, in a brochure. The Committee is not convinced that this is a desirable consequence.</p>
<p>The Committee’s overall assessment is that, in certain respects, it may be considered problematic that packaging is covered by the Freedom of the Press Act, but that there are not sufficiently strong reasons for separate regulation of this type of printed matter by excluding it from the protection afforded by the Freedom of the Press Act. The Committee therefore does not propose any change in this regard.</p>
<h2>The “must carry” obligation for complementary services</h2>
<p>The “must carry” obligation is designed to ensure that a person who receives television through a cable or IP network has access to linear public service television broadcasts in the same way as if they had had access to television through the terrestrial network. This is achieved by provisions of the Radio and Television Act (2010:696) requiring the retransmission of certain television broadcasts. Currently, SVT1, SVT2, Kunskapskanalen and Barnkanalen/SVT24 are retransmitted by virtue of the provisions of that Act.</p>
<p>The “must carry” obligation represents a departure from the principle of freedom of establishment for transmissions by landline (i.e. cable, fibre etc.). Support for this is found in a delegation provision in Chapter 3, Article 2, point 1 of the FLFE. The provision is expressed in terms of programmes.</p>
<p>There has been some uncertainty about whether complementary services of the kind needed to make television content accessible to people with disabilities – such as subtitling, interpretation and spoken subtitles – fall within the “programme” concept of the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression, and whether a “must carry” obligation can be imposed with respect to such services.</p>
<p>The Committee’s analysis of the programme concept leads it to conclude that the balance of arguments supports the position that accessibility services of the kind described can be regarded as programmes in the sense of the Fundamental Law on Freedom of</p>
<p>Expression. This means that the Fundamental Law permits a “must carry” obligation to be imposed by law with respect to such services, provided that they meet the other requirements of the delegation provision.</p>
<p>Given the uncertainty that has existed regarding the scope of the programme concept, however, a clarification in the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression is proposed, to the effect that a “must carry” obligation with respect to accessibility services may be imposed by law. For this to apply, the accessibility service must be related to a programme that is already subject to a “must carry” obligation.</p>
<p>The Committee’s remit has also included an analysis of the programme concept in relation to other complementary services. In that context, the Committee has identified services that permit the activation of content available via the public internet. With such services, a person watching linear television on a smart television with an internet connection is made aware that certain content is available. That content may, for example, consist of subtitling, interpretation or spoken subtitles.</p>
<p>The Committee’s assessment is that activation services of this type are not to be regarded as programmes in the sense of the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression. That means that they do not fall within the scope currently provided for a “must carry” obligetion. Such an obligation therefore cannot be imposed.</p>
<p>In the view of the Committee, however, the constitutional provisions should be platform-neutral, in the sense that it should be possible to impose a “must carry” obligation not only with respect to services corresponding in content terms to the programme concept of the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression, but also with respect to services which technically facilitate the user’s access to accessibility services. The Committee considers it important that constitutional provisions should not unnecessarily stand in the way of technical advances in terms of enabling people with disabilities to gain access to programme content. The Committee therefore proposes an amendment to the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression, to the effect that a “must carry” obligation may be imposed with respect also to services that facilitate access to accessibility services.</p>
<p>As regards other complementary services, it is not possible to predict what types of services could arise from technical advances and to what extent they may need to be retransmitted.</p>
<h2>Public service broadcasting and landline transmissions</h2>
<p>The mission of the public service companies in the service of the general public is primarily defined by conditions in their broadcasting licences. Those conditions include, for example, a requirement to offer a diverse range of programmes, reflecting conditions across the whole of the country; to ensure that programming as a whole is informed by educational ambitions; to provide news services in such a way that a diversity of news items, analysis and commentary finds expression; to offer a varied range of programmes for children and involving children and young people; to take the needs of people with disabilities into account; and to offer a certain proportion of programming in minority languages. The range of programmes offered must meet the requirements of objectivity and impartiality. Public service broadcasting also plays an important part in Sweden’s total defence, a point made clear for instance by conditions relating to contingency planning.</p>
<p>At present, these conditions only apply to public service companies’ broadcasts on the terrestrial network. For services provided by landline, the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression does not permit corresponding conditions. A large proportion of the programming activities undertaken on the internet, for example through the companies’ catch-up services and apps, are to be regarded as transmissions and services provided by landline.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression does not permit scrutiny of content transmitted by landline. This means that a person who considers that the content of a television or radio programme provided exclusively through a public service company’s catch-up services is not objective or impartial, for instance, has no means of having a complaint investigated.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s view, it is to be regarded as unsatisfactory that a large and, moreover, growing proportion of the public service companies’ activities fall outside the scope of the conditions underpinning public service broadcasting. In that context, the Committee notes in particular that, under the existing regulatory framework, public funding allocated to public service broadcasting is being used for activities that are virtually unregulated. In the long run, there is danger that this could erode public confidence in public service broadcasting, which could jeopardise its legitimacy. This is a powerful argument for amending the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression so as to permit conditions regarding content also to be imposed on services which the public service companies provide by landline.</p>
<p>Such an amendment represents a limitation of the freedom of establishment for transmissions and services provided by landline in relation to the public service companies. The Committee notes however that, in the case of public service broadcasting, freedom of establishment is more of a departure from what has been the basis for such operations – a mission in the service of the public – than a starting point for them.</p>
<p>In view of this, an exception to the freedom of establishment for landline transmissions is proposed, permitting provisions to be laid down in law concerning conditions for the transmission of programmes by operations run with a mission to broadcast radio or television in the public service, provided that that mission is publicly funded.</p>
<p>To allow in a corresponding manner for scrutiny of public service broadcasters’ activities on the internet, an amendment to the provision of the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression concerning subsequent scrutiny of content is proposed. This amendment would remove the limitation to transmissions by other means than landline. To the extent that conditions have been laid down also for landline transmissions, these transmissions can be scrutinized by the same commission that currently scrutinizes transmissions in the ether.</p>
<h2>The independence of public service broadcasting</h2>
<p>The ability of the public service companies to maintain their integrity and editorial independence, so that their activities can be carried on independently of economic and political interests in society, has been emphasised repeatedly as a basic condition for public service broadcasting. It has also been stressed that, from a civic and democratic point of view, it is important that there are those who scrutinise the various spheres of power in society, public and private, corporate and voluntary. In that context, independent news services have been regarded as a cornerstone of the democratic system.</p>
<p>In the preparatory work for the legislation regarding the new funding system for public service broadcasting, the fact that the public service companies’ operations are informed by independence and a high degree of integrity is described as fundamental to this sector of broadcasting.</p>
<p>An earlier committee, the Cross-Party Committee of Inquiry on Public Service Broadcasting, presented a number of proposals aimed at strengthening the independence of the public service companies. Even with those proposals, however, that committee took the view that the question whether the independence of public service broadcasting could be strengthened in the constitution needed to be considered in another context.</p>
<p>In this regard, the remit of the 2018 All-Party Committee of Inquiry on Freedom of the Press and Freedom of Expression has been to analyse whether the current provisions of the fundamental laws and the ordinary law are sufficient to guarantee the independence of the public service companies and, if not, to consider whether their independence can and should be further strengthened by amendments to the constitution.</p>
<p>The Committee notes that there are several different dimensions to the question of the independence of public service broadcasting and that it can be approached from different angles. It can be argued that the sector’s independence should be strengthened by amending the constitution, but it can also be argued that the existing protection is sufficient. Furthermore, there are both advantages and disadvantages to the various approaches to a possible strengthening of independence through the constitution which the Committee has found reason to consider more closely.</p>
<p>When a fundamental law is to be passed or amended, the greatest possible political agreement is normally sought. It has therefore been a basic starting point for the Committee that the proposals put forward should enjoy broad parliamentary support.</p>
<p>The Committee has carefully considered the different arguments and regulatory approaches, but has been unable to gather sufficiently broad support for any one course of action.</p>
<p>Given that a proposal to amend the constitution should have broad parliamentary support, and that such support has not been achieved, the Committee has decided not to propose any constitutional amendments to strengthen the independence of public service broadcasting. One consideration in making this assessment has been that the public service companies’ independence is unlikely to be promoted by major reforms being pushed through with the backing of only limited parliamentary majorities.</p>
<h2>Liability for the content of digital books</h2>
<p>Audiobooks and eBooks supplied from a database belonging to a publishing company can enjoy constitutional protection under the database rule. In such cases, an editor appointed by the publishing company is liable for the content.</p>
<p>This differs from the liability position for printed books, since under the Freedom of the Press Act, primary liability for the content of printed matter that is not a periodical rests with the author.</p>
<p>To ensure that the same person will be liable when one and the same book is published both in print and in digital form, a “supplement rule” has applied under the Freedom of the Press Act since 1 January 2019. This means that a digital publication that is supplied with the same content as a printed original will, on certain conditions, be regarded as a supplement to the printed publication. Consequently, the same person – primarily the author – will be liable for the content of both the printed and the digital publication. For the supplement rule to be applicable, the content of the printed original must be reproduced unaltered and it must be stated that the content constitutes a supplement under the supplement rule.</p>
<p>However, for audiobooks or eBooks which are admittedly supplied in such a way that the database rule is applicable, but for which there is no printed original or to which the supplement rule does not apply for some other reason, liability as provided in the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression still applies, i.e. with the editor first in the chain of liability.</p>
<p>The Committee considers it problematic that developments in the publishing of digital books have resulted in a shift in criminal liability away from the author. In the Committee’s view, this is, in</p>
<p>itself, an argument for introducing a system whereby, as far as possible, the same liability position would apply to the content of books, regardless of whether they are printed or published only digitally.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is no escaping the fact that the provisions of the Freedom of the Press Act and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression build on partly different basic premises and needs. For liability rules corresponding to those of the Freedom of the Press Act also to apply in the area of application of the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression, in other words, it would need to be possible to give such provisions an appropriate design without at the same time breaching any of the basic principles on which the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression rests.</p>
<p>In that respect, the Committee’s assessment is that liability for the author under the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression would admittedly be legally achievable, but that the provisions required would be complex and would need to build on many different and mutually independent requirements. There is a clear risk that such provisions would be difficult to apply.</p>
<p>There are also several considerations that mean that the benefits of such a regulatory arrangement can be questioned. It is an open question, for example, how many digital books it would in practice apply to. In addition, liability for the author would need to be combined with rules about appointing an editor if the author dies. That means that, even with liability for the author provided for in the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression, publishing companies and authors would need to reckon with the risk of criminal liability reverting to the publishing company in the event of the author dying.</p>
<p>To sum up, the Committee’s assessment is that good reasons can admittedly be advanced for also introducing liability for the author under the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression. Such an arrangement, however, would require radical and far-reaching changes to the current liability rules. In the Committee’s view, for such changes to be warranted, the benefits of the new arrangement would have to be beyond question. In that regard, the Committee is not convinced. The Committee therefore makes no proposal on the matter.</p>
