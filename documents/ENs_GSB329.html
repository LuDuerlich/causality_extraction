<p>Introduction</p>
<p>This Commission was set up to review the existing regulatory system and submit proposals for new rules governing admission to undergraduate education. This is being done in the light of the Swedish Government’s stated education policy goals to increase direct transition to higher education, change how the efforts of upper secondary school students are currently rewarded, reduce the incentive to retake grades in order to increase one’s competitiveness and help to broaden recruitment. The Commission was set up as the result of a government decision on 27 March 2003.</p>
<p>From its inception, the Commission on Higher Education Admission has endeavoured to be as transparent as possible and to meet many different groups and individuals who have both knowledge about and an interest in higher education admission rules. The Commission has also held two large-scale events of its own: a research seminar on 17 September 2003 and a public hearing on 16 October 2003.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Admission rules – an unpopular regulatory system</p>
<p>Admission rules have few if any friends. Almost everyone is dissatisfied with them almost all of the time. This is mostly due to the fact that we place so very many, often incompatible requirements on what they are supposed to achieve. Admission rules are supposed to forecast educational success, highlight desirable behaviour, help achieve education policy goals, be straightforward, comprehensible, stable, fair, legally secure, cost-effective and legitimate – requirements which an administrative system of rules cannot possibly</p>
<p>meet simultaneously. Neither do reforms always have the desired effect since all too often we skip the what questions and go straight to the how questions.</p>
<p>Neither can admission rules be considered in isolation. They are closely associated with how the higher education system is dimensioned and organised and how resources are allocated. We can say that admission and dimensioning issues are basically two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>Regarding who decides on admission issues, I feel the best way forward is a kind of “power-sharing”, whereby the Government formulates clear and realistic objectives as regards what the rules should achieve, whilst the universities and university colleges are afforded greater influence over how these objectives are to be met. It is important that admission rules work both in theory and in practice. The current void between general education policy goals and technical admission details should therefore be filled with something we might call higher education admission policy.</p>
<p>Student and school strategies – how the system is outwitted</p>
<p>People always adapt to regulatory frameworks. Upper-secondary school students quickly decode higher education admission rules and do their own “effort versus yield analysis”. A number of clear student and school strategies have emerged since the advent of the current regulatory system in 1997. The Commission has christened these “student and school strategies” because most of them presuppose an “alliance” between student and teacher/school head.</p>
<p>We can basically distinguish six clear strategies, all of which are aimed at optimising students’ comparative statistics – not at obtaining the relevant knowledge for higher education – and which are allowed and sometimes even encouraged by the regulatory framework.</p>
<p>This allows students to opt out of, say, a language or physics B and read some local courses instead.</p>
<p>This allows students to drop demanding courses equivalent to 10 per cent of what is required for a final grade without losing any credits.</p>
<p>This should basically be something positive, but is often used to manipulate the comparative statistics.</p>
<p>This allows students to continue to study in adult secondary education and drop certain core subjects.</p>
<p>This ‘supplementation’ is tantamount to a fourth uppersecondary year.</p>
<p>Higher education admission rules place the same premium on a course in mushroom-picking than on one in mathematics or a foreign language.</p>
<p>Can we forecast educational success?</p>
<p>Educational success is a multi-dimensional concept, to which many different meanings can be attached. When, in the context of admissions, we talk of educational success, we generally mean that the student should succeed in his/her studies, i.e. gain credits when she/he is supposed to. But, as far as content is concerned, many more complex meanings can be attached to the term educational success.</p>
<p>I believe there are at least four different prerequisites that must be met before a student can successfully complete a programme of higher education: Good previous knowledge, a high level of motivation, a good social situation in which to study and the will and capability of the university/college to receive and take care of the student.</p>
<p>The “psychometric paradigm” is based on being able to describe a small number of a person’s properties using relatively simple</p>
<p>instruments and then using this description to forecast future educational success with the help of statistics, often in the form of a simple linear regression analysis. Basically all the research studies performed in this field – and there are a considerable number of them – indicate that we can explain and understand 25 per cent of an individual’s future educational success using his/her results from university attitude tests or knowledge of his/her grades. We do not know what the rest – i.e. 75 per cent – of this success depends on and subsequently are unable to predict it.</p>
<p>In general, however, grades and university aptitude tests provide the best forecast, even though their value is not particularly high. The value of other selection instruments, such as interviews and personality tests, is much less, whilst some of them are not based on psychometric properties at all but on completely different factors such as order of priority and work experience.</p>
<p>Applicants and successful applicants – a complicated picture</p>
<p>The popular image of higher education applicants, those who are successful and those who study does not tally too well with reality. For example, over 300,000 individuals applied to higher education prior to the autumn term of 2003, but as many 65 per cent of these already studied – or had studied previously – in higher education. About 62 per cent of all applications were for single-subject courses and the majority of them were hence dealt with directly by universities and university colleges. Fifty-five per cent of all applicants are over 24 years old, and a relatively large proportion already have at least one academic qualification.</p>
<p>The number of registered students in higher education was nearly 330,000 in the autumn term of 2002. Half of all these were over 25. Women make up 61 per cent of all higher education students but this varies between 19 and 89 per cent depending on the subject area.</p>
<p>Seventy-three per cent of all new higher education entrants in 2001/02 had a Swedish upper-secondary education. The rest had a different educational background, such as an overseas education, Swedish folk high school, etc. Half of all new entrants had studied in adult secondary education prior to entering higher education.</p>
<p>Are our students (too) old?</p>
<p>One of the starting-points for the Commission is that direct transition from upper-secondary school to higher education should increase. Looking at higher education transition more closely, we can see that direct transition varies substantially between the sexes, from one county to the next and above all among different uppersecondary school programmes.</p>
<p>Among the traditional higher education preparatory programmes</p>
<p>– Natural Science and Social Science – direct transition within three years is about 70 per cent. For other national programmes, it is a mere 14 per cent.</p>
<p>If we examine the age structure of various higher educational programmes, we can see that some are dominated by young people while others are populated by older people. In some way, we can describe higher education as a two-track system – one for younger and one for older people. This also means that any general young persons’ quota will not work particularly well, since its potential for success varies dramatically from one educational programme to the next.</p>
<p>It is important to identify the factors that influence when an individual starts studying, but it is possibly even more meaningful to identify the factors that unnecessarily prolong his/her period of study, since what we are really interested in is at what age an individual leaves higher education and tries to establish him/herself on the labour market. The Commission on Higher Education Admission attempts to list both types of factors.</p>
<p>If the aim is to increase direct transition, the potential for this lies not among upper-secondary natural science and social science students but among students on the other 14 national programmes. If we manage to increase direct transition from these programmes, we will also have succeeded in broadening recruitment at the same time.</p>
<p>The “20.0 problem” – regrettable but expected</p>
<p>The 20.0 problem refers to the situation that arises when an applicant is not accepted but loses out by lottery despite having the highest possible aggregate comparative grade: 20.0. This situation is not new but is now far more widespread than ever before. Prior</p>
<p>to the autumn term of 2003, 262 people with an aggregate grade of 20.0 lost out by lottery and this figure is increasing dramatically every term. So far, this problem seems to mainly centre on medical and veterinary educational programmes.</p>
<p>There are three factors that explain the 20.0 problem: demand exceeding supply, the grading system itself and the option of being able to retake later to improve one’s grades. The most important explanation lies in demand far exceeding supply in terms of places available at medical school, for example. The second explanation can be found in the goal-related grading assessment system, the basic premise of which is that everyone should be able to reach the goals, including those set for the highest grade. The third explanation lies in the opportunity people have to retake their grades to improve their competitiveness.</p>
<p>To come to grips with the 20.0 problem, we will probably have to implement measures in all three of these areas. Within the framework of the admissions system, it is a question of both reducing the incentive for retaking grades later on and of finding alternative ways of differentiating between applicants other than drawing lots. The best instrument available in the short term to differentiate between applicants is the national university aptitude test, which unlike school grades, has good ranking properties. In the longer term, a number of “subject area tests” could be developed to improve selection.</p>
<p>Can admission rules help broaden recruitment?</p>
<p>We currently have a situation where many applicants do not obtain a place and where many places do not have any applicants – at one and the same time! This means we basically have ‘two higher education systems in one’: one that is selective and one that serves recruitment purposes, which strengthens the hypothesis that admission rules can never be considered separately from dimensioning issues.</p>
<p>If we want to successfully achieve our aim of broadening recruitment, we must realise that it is a question of long-term, systematic efforts involving a wide range of concerted measures. It is a question of cooperation and alliances with schools, municipalities, adult education associations, etc., information and marketing, study guidance, the range of education available, forms of distribution, the</p>
<p>admissions system, assessment of real proficiency, reception and induction, support measures, in-service training for teachers and the development of teaching methodology.</p>
<p>Admission rules can certainly help to broaden recruitment, but there is reason to question the way they have been used over the last 30 years, i.e. trying to achieve broadening and diversity by utilising general and quantifiable elements of the regulatory framework (quota-based intake, general supplementary credits, etc.) We are more likely to achieve such aims by using more selective, “goalseeking” measures, a fact confirmed by several research studies. In short, universities and university colleges must be allowed to exert greater influence on how to achieve clear national recruitment goals. One incentive in the long term might be coupling some of the funding for undergraduate education to how well universities and university colleges live up to their own aims in this area.</p>
<p>The essential components of the admission rules</p>
<p>The main objectives – to provide information and manage selection</p>
<p>We propose that the objectives of the admission rules be defined as follows:</p>
<p>1. to provide true, relevant and comprehensible information on the requirements of a higher educational programme  and</p>
<p>2. in those cases where not all competent applicants can be accepted on a particular programme, to select from these in a legitimate, comprehensible and lawful way.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we should consider whether the admission rules should also aim to:</p>
<p>3. through their design encourage relevant  in-depth subject study and/or broader subject studies at upper-secondary school and</p>
<p>4. actively help to broaden recruitment with regard to gender, social and ethnic background and disability.</p>
<p>Basic eligibility should constitute the broad link between uppersecondary level and higher education and be the lowest common denominator, so to speak. Special eligibility requirements should be</p>
<p>designed so as to provide the aspiring student with comprehensible and educationally sound information. My main proposal for the design of special eligibility requirements is hence a revamped system of standard eligibility requirements, which we call subject area eligibility requirements .</p>
<p>Regarding selection criteria, the Commission describes the three proposed parallel routes to higher education: grades, aptitude tests and a third selection criterion determined by the individual university/college. The basic idea behind having three – to a certain extent equal – routes into higher education is that all selection instruments generally have rather limited forecasting properties and are as a rule also marred by other weaknesses. A mix of selection methods should therefore be the aim, in line with the old adage of “not putting all one’s eggs in the same basket”.</p>
<p>The selection criterion determined by the individual university/ college could consist of special tests other than the national university aptitude test, the consideration of previous education or work experience, knowledge or experience that is of particular value for the course applied for or the vocational field the programme is oriented towards, or other factual circumstances that are relevant to the educational programme in question.</p>
<p>Upper-secondary school grades</p>
<p>Upper-secondary school grades currently carry considerable weight when it comes to higher education selection. The goal-related grading system is however built on the belief that knowledge and performance are in no way normally distributed among students, but – on the contrary – that all students should be able to achieve the goals set for a specific grade and even those for the highest grade. In other words: a goal-related grading system is not particularly suitable for ranking purposes.</p>
<p>While they have been in operation, the goal-related grades in upper-secondary school have also betrayed a number of negative effects, mainly in terms of grade inflation over time and substantial variation in grade-setting from one school or municipality and the next. The situation has not been helped by the basically unrestricted option of being able to retake grades later on to improve one’s competitiveness.</p>
<p>The question I have been wrestling with has therefore been: how to save upper-secondary grades as a higher education selection criterion in light of their lack of legal security and reliability? I reached the conclusion that this presupposes considerable changes being made to how grades are assessed as qualifications. This proposal is discussed further in the section below, Proposals for new admission rules .</p>
<p>The national university aptitude test</p>
<p>The university aptitude test is also of relatively major importance when it comes to higher education selection, not least since the envisaged target group for the test has changed and now covers all applicants, and not just “25:4s” as was originally intended. The aptitude test basically possesses good ranking properties, but despite this is still mainly based on the testing expertise we had in the 1960s and 1970s. The test also treats applicants whose native language is not Swedish unfairly. There is therefore good reason to modernise the test, taking into account the results of broadly established evaluations of the test performed in recent years.</p>
<p>Work experience</p>
<p>Work experience is not only a criterion for basic eligibility (the 25:4 rule) and for special eligibility (termed professional life experience) but also a selection criterion (along with results from the aptitude test in the so-called HA group). Work experience should continue to be afforded substantial value in connection with higher education admissions but in less of an across-the-broad way since it has in practice become little more than an “age supplement”. The idea of assessing real proficiency – i.e. an individual assessment of the applicant’s actual skills – should also be valid in this context, and work experience should be assessed and rewarded within the framework of the individually determined selection criteria of a university/college.</p>
<p>Other special tests</p>
<p>Using other special tests as selection criteria is another option that has been available to universities and university colleges subsequent to approval from the National Agency for Higher Education. Institutes have shown a somewhat lukewarm interest in using other special tests, however. The main reason for this lack of interest is probably the high costs involved in developing, implementing and evaluating such tests. The experiences of other special tests can in general however be perceived as positive.</p>
<p>It is therefore important to build on these existing positive experiences in the future. The Commission proposes the development of a number of national “subject area tests” or so-called “domain tests”. Such tests – a forerunner for which can be found in the American SAT II test – has both a high level of legitimacy and relatively good forecasting properties. It is, however, important that this type of test be developed on a national basis, both to maintain a high level of quality keep costs down.</p>
<p>Interviews, which also fall within the scope of other special tests as selection criteria, should, however, be used with extreme caution. Firstly, they are very costly, and secondly they favour people who have already assimilated the linguistic and cultural codes that by tradition are rewarded in higher education. Furthermore, we should also ask who should have the privilege of deciding what kind of personality the interview is trying to identify, as well as how credibly one can assess the “personality” of a 19-year-old.</p>
<p>Alternative selection</p>
<p>Alternative selection was introduced on 1 January 2003 and is colloquially referred to as “free quota”. It allows a university or university college to decide the selection criteria for a maximum of ten per cent of its places – selection criteria that cover some degree of previous knowledge or other factual circumstances. The option of using alternative selection has been used on relatively small scale, not least because of the uncertainty surrounding its real purpose and compliance with existing legislation governing equality of treatment in higher education.</p>
<p>I feel this option should remain, but become part of the third route into higher education, i.e. become one of the locally</p>
<p>determined selection criteria. In this respect, institutes should consider knowledge and experience that is particularly valuable for the programme the student is applying for or as regards the vocational field towards which the programme is oriented.</p>
<p>Special grounds</p>
<p>Special grounds may refer for example to disabilities or some other circumstance or to the fact that the applicant has knowledge or experience of particular value to the programme for which she/he is applying. Higher education institutes are as a rule rather cautious when it comes to utilising this option to admit individual students.</p>
<p>The option should remain, however, and universities and university colleges should report annually on how many people have applied and been accepted on special grounds, what these special grounds were and how many have been accepted.</p>
<p>Real proficiency</p>
<p>Universities and university colleges should nowadays assess an applicant’s real proficiency, which involves making a holistic assessment of his/her potential for successfully completing the programme she/he is applying for. Experience of the first year after these assessments were introduced shows good promise for the future, but a number of obstacles need to be eradicated.</p>
<p>Some examples: firstly, real proficiency is still considered to be somewhat of a sidetrack. Secondly, national assessment equity should be strengthened and the proposed subject area tests could well play an important role in the future in this respect. Thirdly, it is unfortunate that so many of those who have been deemed eligible based on real proficiency have still not been accepted, because the institute has not wanted/dared to use this alternative selection criteria to admit a student.</p>
<p>Proposals for new admission rules</p>
<p>Basic eligibility</p>
<p>I propose that a requirement for at least a Pass grade in the core subjects  of Swedish and English be added to the basic eligibility requirements. This corresponds to courses in Swedish A and Swedish B or Swedish as a Second Language A and B and English A. Applicants must also have completed an approved upper-secondary school project. These courses and project work must be included in the courses in which the applicant has attained a Pass grade, covering at least 90 per cent of the upper-secondary school credits needed to have completed an upper-secondary school programme. The same requirements will be placed on upper-secondary adult education as for upper-secondary school education and only a person with a final grade from adult secondary education will have fulfilled the requirements.</p>
<p>The reasons to put forward this proposal are to ensure that eligibility requirements provide true and relevant information, because evaluations performed by the National Agency for Higher Education indicate deteriorating knowledge in above all Swedish and English and because basic eligibility requirements including Swedish and English make it easier to construct special eligibility requirements.</p>
<p>The basis for this proposal is a simulation of the number of people achieving basic eligibility in several different subject combinations, including the one currently being proposed. I believe the proposed changes will not have a negative effect on the transition to higher education.</p>
<p>Special eligibility</p>
<p>I propose a system of 14 different subject area accreditations as a way of organising and describing special eligibility. The fundamental idea is that the prospective student will have a legitimate right to clear and comprehensible information on the eligibility requirements for a particular higher education programme and that universities and university colleges should describe their eligibility requirements in a clear, comprehensible and uniform manner.</p>
<p>Neither should entrance requirements for programmes that are basically the same be allowed to vary from one university/university college to the next. Even a range of programmes that is in many respects diversified can be accommodated within the framework of a small number of subject area accreditations. In addition, the information supplied on eligibility requirements must also be clear and educationally sound, otherwise it will not fulfil its purpose. I therefore propose that subject area accreditations be called “subject area accreditation for behavioural science”, “subject area accreditation for technology”, and so on.</p>
<p>Both subjects essential for accreditation and subjects worth additional merit will be specified for each of the 14 subject area accreditations. The essential subjects will constitute the necessary entrance requirements, whilst the additional merit subjects are those that are not required for accreditation but for which extra points can be awarded. The purpose here is to encourage uppersecondary students to take in-depth and diversified studies that are relevant to higher education. We can use a nursing programme to exemplify the idea behind essential and additional merit subjects, which under the proposal would be included in the subject area accreditation for care studies and nursing.</p>
<p>Subject are accreditation for care studies and nursing</p>
<p>In other words, Mathematics B and Science B are the essential subjects needed for eligibility, whereas the subjects listed as additional merit subjects provide “extra points”. The idea here is for only a maximum of three additional merit subjects to provide extra points, with one point per subject regardless of the grade</p>
<p>gained by the applicant, so as not to create unnecessary stress. Another thought is to highlight programme-specific courses from primarily vocational programmes, which in the case of the abovementioned example would be courses from the Health Care Programme.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, the National Agency for Higher Education would issue regulations governing the applicable subject area accreditations for an educational programme leading to an advanced vocational qualification, whilst the university/university college itself, after consultations with the National Agency for Higher Education, would determine the applicable subject area accreditations for other educational programmes aimed at new higher education entrants.</p>
<p>Assessment of qualifications and selection</p>
<p>Three routes will lead students into higher education: grades, tests and local selection criteria determined by the university/university college. At least 30 per cent of places should normally be allocated based on grades, at least 30 per cent based on the university aptitude test and at least 10 per cent on the locally determined selection criteria but it should also be possible to allocate the places differently if there is good reason to do so, for example if it is a question of programmes primarily aimed at further education and training.</p>
<p>Grades as selection criteria</p>
<p>Under the proposal, grades should be assessed differently in the future, by:</p>
<p>• assessing qualifications in two steps (firstly the entire final grade, then the additional merit subjects),</p>
<p>• scrapping the option of being able to compete for selection with diluted programmes,</p>
<p>• introducing an upper limit of 18.5 for aggregate final grades (a maximum of 3 points for additional merit subjects can be added to this, however),</p>
<p>• presenting aggregate figures to just one decimal place.</p>
<p>• scrapping the option of supplementing grades later on unless these are fail grades (it should be possible to improve these grades but only count them at Pass grade even if a better grade is achieved),</p>
<p>• excluding local courses,</p>
<p>• not affording sport and health special treatment,</p>
<p>• amalgamating the two selection groups BF (grades from folk high schools) and BG (grades from  upper-secondary school).</p>
<p>University aptitude tests as selection criteria</p>
<p>The university aptitude test should be developed and modernised by implementing the following measures:</p>
<p>• Adapt it to people with Swedish as a second language.</p>
<p>• Adapt it to authentic measurements.</p>
<p>• Link it to ICT (information and communication technology).</p>
<p>• Adapt it to special needs students.</p>
<p>• Develop alternatives to the written test.</p>
<p>• Expand the test to include an essay component.</p>
<p>• Develop subject area tests,  so-called “domain tests” as an alternative to the general university aptitude test.</p>
<p>• Offer all students a free university aptitude test during their last term at  upper-secondary school.</p>
<p>Locally determined selection criteria</p>
<p>The various local elements that currently exist – alternative selection, other special selection tests, real proficiency, etc. – should be put together into one coherent, locally determined selection criterion.</p>
<p>This selection criterion would mean that universities and university colleges would themselves be able to base selection on:</p>
<p>1. special selection tests other than the national university aptitude test,</p>
<p>2. knowledge, work experience or other experience that is especially important for the programme being applied for or especially valuable as regards the vocational area towards which the programme is oriented, or</p>
<p>3. another factual circumstance relevant to the programme.</p>
<p>There should also be a link between the locally determined selection criteria and the recruitment goals established by the Government.</p>
<p>Selection when applicants are equally well qualified</p>
<p>If applicants are equally well qualified, selection can currently be made based on the need to improve recruitment from the underrepresented gender. Afterwards, it comes down to drawing lots. I propose that when applicants are equally well qualified, regard should firstly be paid to gender, then to order of priority, and then to test results. Only after that should lots be drawn.</p>
<p>Deferring or interrupting studies</p>
<p>I propose the introduction of a provision in the Higher Education Ordinance enabling a university/university college’s rejection of a student’s application to defer or interrupt his/her studies to be appealed to a higher instance.</p>
