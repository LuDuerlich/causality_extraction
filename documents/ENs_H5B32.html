<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Inquiry remit</h2>
<p>In March 2015, the Swedish Government decided to appoint a parliamentary Committee, for a review of energy policy. According to the terms of reference, the task of the Energy Policy Commission is to prepare a proposal for a broad agreement on energy policy with a particular focus on the conditions for electricity supply after 2025–2030.</p>
<h2>The work</h2>
<p>In accordance with the terms of reference, the Commission’s work has been conducted in three phases. During the first phase, knowledge was reviewed and alternatives were formulated. The work has been carried out in broad dialogue with various stakeholders, such as power industry and business sector organisations, environmental organisations, municipalities, government agencies and researchers. The Commission has also examined international developments and made use of experts from other countries.</p>
<p>During the second phase of the work, the challenges and opportunities faced by the energy system were analysed more closely. Finally, based on the framework agreement between five Riksdag political parties in June 2016, the Commission prepared a number of proposals and assessments.</p>
<h2>Points of departure</h2>
<p>Global demand for energy has grown since the middle of the 20th century, and most commentators expect this to continue in coming decades, primarily because of a powerfully expanding middle class in Asia and rapid industrialisation in many developing countries.</p>
<p>The dominant share of the global energy supply, more than 80 per cent, is still based on fossil fuels (oil, coal and gas). The consumption of renewable energy throughout the world has increased by 71 per cent since 1990. However, renewable energy’s share of total energy supply has only increased by around one percentage point. Nuclear energy’s share of the total energy supply has decreased, despite an increase in nuclear energy production worldwide.</p>
<p>Over the past 200 years, Sweden’s consumption of energy has increased tenfold. However, in recent decades the level has been stable. Electricity consumption has also levelled off since the mid1980s. Since peaking in 2001, electricity consumption has decreased in all sectors except transport.</p>
<h2>A new situation</h2>
<p>The energy system is currently changing in a number of ways, both globally and in our neighbourhood. In large parts of the world, such as Asia and Africa, the consumption of energy is continuing to increase, while in other regions, such as Europe and North America, it is levelling off or even decreasing. Technological development is rapid in all parts of the energy sector. The cost of new technologies, such as solar cells, wind turbines and battery storage, has decreased significantly in recent years.</p>
<p>The supply of electricity, which to date has been largely based on large centralised production sources, features more and more small-scale production, with a high proportion of variable energy and an expectation of more active customers.</p>
<p>A general trend has been the increased significance of electricity in all sectors of society, for example in process control and automation in the manufacturing industry, an increased proportion of electricity-powered vehicles and a greater number of electricitypowered heat pumps in buildings. In many cases, electrification leads to an increase in efficiency. At the same time, the increased dependency on electricity, within the industrial sector for example or as a result of ongoing digitalisation, underscores the necessity of securing the continued robustness of the electricity system.</p>
<p>Energy markets are currently undergoing significant changes. The new conditions mean that a number of new problems have arisen, but they also provide opportunities to enable the maintenance of a secure and adequate energy supply. This concerns, for example, the electricity system’s ability to ensure sufficient capacity and energy to customers 24 hours a day.</p>
<h2>Scenarios</h2>
<p>The Energy Policy Commission has examined and compiled the results of a number of scenarios for future demand for energy, primarily electrical energy. The scenarios clearly illustrate the great uncertainties involved in judging future consumption of electricity. In the scenarios presented, electricity consumption in Sweden in 2030 varies between 116 TWh and 162 TWh, and in 2050 between 107 TWh and 195 TWh.</p>
<p>The challenges in the electricity system involve bringing about investments in production facilities, expanding and adapting electricity grids to new modes of production and making it possible for customers to become more active and flexible in their consumption. At the same time, technology has developed rapidly, which enables a broad range of new solutions. Against this background, it is important to create conditions for an electricity supply that is secure in the long-term and sustainable, and to bring about economically effective investments in all parts of the energy system – supply, conversion, transmission, storage and consumption.</p>
<h2>Framework agreement</h2>
<p>On 10 June 2016, a framework agreement was reached between five Riksdag political parties: the Swedish Social Democratic Party, the Moderate Party, the Swedish Green Party, the Centre Party and the Christian Democrats. The agreement consists of a common road map for a controlled transition to an entirely renewable electricity system, with a target of 100 per cent renewable electricity production by 2040. This is a target, not a deadline for banning nuclear power, nor does it mean closing nuclear power plants through political decisions. The framework agreement has formed the basis of the proposals and assessments presented in this report.</p>
<p>The proposal of the All Party Committee on Environmental Objectives on net zero emissions into the atmosphere by 2045 highlights the fact that the transition of the energy system may need to take place more rapidly than previously anticipated.</p>
<h2>Challenges for the future</h2>
<p>The Commission on Energy has identified a number of challenges during the course of its work.</p>
<p>More efficient consumption of energy and electricity is a prerequisite for the transition of the energy system. The consumption of electricity and other forms of energy continues to become more efficient. At the same time, several factors point to the possibility of electricity consumption increasing in the future, such as the increasing possession of electrical devices and population growth. A transition to electricity may also contribute to a more efficient use of resources and reduced energy supply overall. The announced closure of four nuclear power reactors and the expansion of variable electricity production have contributed to an increased focus on the significance of capacity, that is, the availability of electrical energy at any given time. According to the Commission, there is reason going forward for energy policy not to solely focus on the efficient consumption of energy, but also on the need for capacity.</p>
<p>An ecologically sustainable electricity system with secure and stable electricity supplies is a prerequisite for many important functions in society. Swedish welfare has been largely built on processing timber, ore and hydropower. Other sectors of industry are also strongly reliant on electrical energy. It is important that energy policy also continues to support the development of industry and contributes to strengthened competitiveness.</p>
<p>An increased share of variable electricity production and a reduced share of plannable production leads to a new situation for the production system as the various forms of power have differing characteristics that affect the robustness of the electricity system.</p>
<p>This will place new and changed demands on an expansion of transmission capacity throughout the country and to surrounding countries to ensure operational and supply security in the electricity system.</p>
<p>The Swedish electricity system is becoming increasingly internationally connected and consequently increasingly reliant on the surrounding world. Our electricity supply must therefore be viewed in a Nordic and European perspective. Internationalisation leads to increased complexity and reduced national control, but at the same time creates new opportunities.</p>
<p>Swedish electricity generation today mainly consists of hydropower and nuclear power, but the share of renewable electricity production has increased considerably in recent years mainly through an expansion of wind power. At the same time, the power companies have announced the closure of four nuclear power reactors by 2020. The need for solutions that can create flexibility in the electricity system increases along with these developments. Favourable investment conditions are necessary to bring about investments in generation facilities and in various types of flexibility solutions for the system. Great importance must also be placed on the characteristics of various types of facilities, such as adjustability, plannability and environmental impact.</p>
<p>Electricity generation technology is under constant development. There are a number of opportunities – existing and potential – to increase flexibility in the electricity system through energy storage and consumer flexibility. Together with other smart services and products, new technology in the electricity transmission network, for example measurement and control equipment, can contribute to meeting the capacity needs of the system. Efficient cooperation between various energy carriers, for example between the supply of electricity and heat, has major advantages.</p>
<p>A change in the characteristics of electricity production also creates new challenges both in operating the power system and maintaining its reliability of service. Efficient permit processes and short lead times in investments in power production facilities and transmission networks are very important for ensuring adequate transmission capacity in the electricity network and good access to ancillary services.</p>
<p>New demands will be placed on the future electricity transmission networks at local, regional and national level. Interconnectors will have special significance as a result of the ongoing integration of the Nordic and European markets. Interconnectors may provide opportunities both for the export of surplus and for imports to handle situations of output shortage.</p>
<p>The transition of the energy system also entails changed roles and responsibilities for various actors. This applies to both new actors on the electricity market and existing and established actors. The need for a systemic, holistic approach and a functional division of responsibilities increases. A number of trends are also challenging the traditional role of distribution companies.</p>
<p>Integration of the EU electricity market involves increased reliance on the surrounding world, but also creates the conditions for achieving common solutions to the challenges faced by the electricity system. Security of supply and security policy aspects are intimately connected when seen from an international perspective. Development towards more small-scale electricity production in connection with a good electricity supply in Sweden is important when seen from a security policy perspective.</p>
<p>Today, actors in the electricity market are operating in a challenging investment climate as a result of long periods when electricity prices have been lower than the costs of producing new electricity. To also ensure a favourable energy and capacity balance, high security of supply and competitive electricity prices also in the long term, an investment climate that promotes both competition and a reasonable return on capital is necessary.</p>
<p>The new situation has led to the design of the electricity market being discussed at EU level, Nordic level and nationally. Various solutions are under discussion to ensure adequate production capacity and security of supply in the system. The ability of the electricity market to supply electrical capacity appears to be particularly important in this respect.</p>
<p>Development of the energy system is rapid, with a constant stream of new solutions. New technologies and new services must be integrated into the system to satisfy the demands for an efficient and secure electricity system, social sustainability and a good environment.</p>
<h2>Proposals and assessments</h2>
<p>The Commission on Energy presents a number of proposals and assessments to make it possible to tackle this new situation.</p>
<p>• The target by 2040 is 100 per cent renewable electricity production. This is a target, not a deadline for banning nuclear power, nor does it mean closing nuclear power plants through political decisions.</p>
<p>• By 2030, Sweden’s energy use is to be 50 per cent more efficient than in 2005. The target is expressed in terms of primary energy use in relation to gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>Sweden must have a robust electricity network with high security of supply and low environmental impact, and offer electricity at competitive prices. This creates a long-term perspective and clarity for actors in the market, and helps generate new jobs and investment in Sweden.</p>
<p>The energy policy is based on the fact that Sweden is closely linked to its neighbours in northern Europe, and aims to find joint solutions to challenges in the common electricity market.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a starting point is that by 2045 at the latest Sweden will have no net emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and thereafter achieve negative emissions.</p>
<p>In the report, the Commission presents a number of supplementary proposals and assessments. They involve the following:</p>
<p>• The electricity certificate system will be extended and expanded by 18 TWh of new electricity certificates until 2030.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Energy Agency will be tasked to formulate sectorial strategies for energy efficiency together with various industries. The sectorial strategies will be drafted by the Swedish Energy Agency together with various industries and therefore do not constitute a target established by the Riksdag.</p>
<p>• The fees for connection of offshore wind power plants to the national grid should be abolished. How this should be implemented requires further analysis.</p>
<p>• The tax on thermal nuclear capacity will be phased out gradually over a  two-year period beginning in 2017.</p>
<p>• The principles on the conditions for the planning of new nuclear power reactors (Government bill 2008/09:163) remain in place. The investment rules for the Nuclear Waste Fund will be changed such that investment opportunities are expanded from the start of the next  three-year period in 2018.</p>
<p>• Sweden must impose modern environmental requirements on hydropower, but with a review procedure that is designed so as not to place unnecessary administrative and financial burdens on the individual companies relative to the environmental benefits sought.</p>
<p>• The property tax on hydropower plants will be reduced to the same level as for most other electrical production plants, i.e. 0.5 per cent. The tax will be reduced gradually over a  four-year period beginning in 2017.</p>
<p>• There will be an investigation into how existing regulatory frameworks and tax legislation can be simplified and adapted to facilitate the development of new products and services in the areas of energy efficiency, energy storage and  small-scale sales of electricity for various purposes, and the electrification of the transport sector.</p>
<p>• It is proposed that a special energy efficiency programme should be introduced for  electricity-intensive Swedish industries, replacing the former “PFE” Programme, as long as responsible financing can be found.</p>
<p>• An inquiry should be appointed to investigate broadly the potential obstacles to enabling services to develop with respect to active customers and energy efficiency. The inquiry should investigate which economic and other policy instruments (e.g. ‘white certificates’) are most effective for increasing efficiency in terms of both energy and output.</p>
<p>• The abolition of the tax on thermal nuclear capacity and reduction of property tax on hydropower plants should be financed through an increase in energy tax.  Electricity-intensive industry will be exempted.</p>
<p>• Broad discussions are under way in Europe and in Sweden on which electricity market model should be used in the future. There is no reason to alter the existing market model used in Sweden and the Nordic region in the short term. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to conduct a broad discussion over time on the design of the future market.</p>
<p>The Energy Policy Commission presents a number of additional assessments on various aspects of the energy area. Among other things, an implementation group comprised of representatives of the political parties that concluded the framework agreement should be formed with the aim of continually following up the framework agreement.</p>
<h2>Impact assessments</h2>
<p>The Energy Policy Commission has assessed the conceivable con- sequences of its proposals. The Commission has presented assess- ments and proposals that aim to facilitate the renewal and transition of the energy system. The costs of achieving a more flexible electricity system and integrating a higher share of renewable electricity pro- duction should be assessed in relation to the advantages in the form of increased security of supply and the more efficient use of overall production resources. All in all, the proposed measures are expected to lead to lower total system costs and increased economic efficiency.</p>
