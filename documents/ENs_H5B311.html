<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The remit in brief</h2>
<p>The Committee is to investigate and submit proposals for the design of a distance-based tax for heavy goods vehicles. One aim of the tax is that heavy vehicles should to a greater extent bear their economic costs to society. The tax may also contribute to achieving the Government’s objective to reduce the environmental impact of the transport sector. Another effect of the tax may be to encourage some long-distance goods transport to be moved from roads to rail or sea. Depending on its design, the tax could also increase the possibilities of controlling regulatory compliance in general among providers of heavy road transport.</p>
<p>The remit consists of several components. The Committee is to identify and analyse potential technical solutions to deal with tax collection, draw up proposals for a model and function description of a technical solution, analyse and draw up proposals for the design and scope of the tax levy (including tax levels and grounds for differentiation of tax rates), draw up proposals for how the tax levy should be organised and analyse and clarify the division of responsibility between the actors involved, and draw up necessary rules of procedure. All analyses should be made from the perspective of law, administration, the economy, public finances, transport policy, industrial policy and the environment. The remit also includes identifying and analysing adopted and planned systems for distancebased road charges and road taxes in other European countries and to consider whether it is possible in general to transfer any of the existing systems to Swedish conditions. In addition, the Committee is tasked with making impact assessments of the proposals presented.</p>
<h2>Some key principles for the work</h2>
<p>One of the key principles for the work is that the distance-based tax is actually a tax, which has some implications of both a legal and economic nature. Another key principle is the traffic operators’ liability for costs and the internalisation of these external effects. Another key principle concerns the potential of the tax in relation to policy and effectiveness. The fuel tax will not be a policy instrument in the long term, since vehicles will run to an increasing extent on alternative fuels, which will probably be taxed at a lower rate. On the other hand, a distance-based tax will be more effective than both fuel tax and time-based road charges. In addition, distancebased charges for heavy goods vehicles will become increasingly common generally. Moreover, one key point is the significance of the distance-based tax for levelling out conditions of competition between Swedish and foreign hauliers. Another key point is that a distancebased tax should be uncomplicated, in the sense of being easy to understand, adapt to and process. The final key point concerns designing a tax system that is as cost-effective as possible.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<h2>Current taxation of heavy goods vehicles on roads</h2>
<p>The taxation of heavy goods vehicles and levy of road charges and road taxes are to some extent harmonised in the EU. EU Directives are applied in Swedish legislation, for example when levying vehicle tax, road charges for Swedish and foreign vehicles and road infrastructure charges. Under EU law it is not allowed to levy both a time-based road charge and a distance-based road toll on heavy goods vehicles on one and the same road network. Consequently, if a distance-based road tax is introduced for heavy goods vehicles in Sweden the current time-based road charge must be discontinued.</p>
<h2>International survey</h2>
<p>As stipulated in the terms of reference an international survey is made in the report. The USA (Oregon) and New Zealand have had distance-based road tolls for heavy goods vehicles since the 1940s and the 1970s respectively. In Europe, Switzerland, Austria and Germany introduced distance-based road tolls in 2001, 2004 and 2005 respectively. A number of other European countries thereafter followed suit and the latest addition is Belgium in 2016.</p>
<h2>Considerations</h2>
<h2>General requirements of a road tax system</h2>
<p>Certain general requirements should be made of a road tax system. This applies in particular to the conditions required for a system to be accepted by those affected by it, but also to other requirements, such as technical flexibility and legal security. The most important requirements for acceptance are that it reflects the purposes for which it was introduced, that the system is easy to understand and use, that it involves reasonable costs and that it fulfils the requirements that may be made concerning personal privacy etc.</p>
<h2>Privacy aspects</h2>
<p>When designing a road tax system it is of great importance to safeguard personal privacy. Route information should therefore preferably stay with a private actor chosen by the taxpayers themselves. Transfer of information to the authorities should thus be minimised. A system that would entail gathering all the information in one and the same database can and should be avoided. Moreover, camera surveillance used for controlling the road tax should be focused on vehicles and registration plates and not the people in the vehicle.</p>
<h2>Choice of technology</h2>
<p>A Swedish road tax system should be based on satellite positioning with flexible measurement methods for measuring the distance driven, in which tolerance levels are prescribed that determine the maximum allowed deviation in accuracy of measurement. Only functional requirements should be imposed on measurement. Thus the system should be technology neutral as far as possible.</p>
<h2>User declaration or toll declaration as a basis for the road tax system</h2>
<p>To enable the State to levy a distance-based tax it must obtain information on how vehicles are used on the roads. In a user declarationbased system it is the taxpayers who supply the State with this information and who are responsible for the correctness of the data. In a toll declaration-based system it is instead the State that collects data with or without the participation of the taxpayer. The Committee has made the assessment that the road tax system should be user declaration-based. The individual should however provide information electronically, since this reduces the risk of error and saves time and costs.</p>
<h2>Roads</h2>
<p>The road tax should cover national roads as well as municipal roads and streets, but not private roads and streets.</p>
<h2>Vehicles</h2>
<p>Heavy goods vehicles weighing less than 12 tonnes account for such a small amount of road wear that from the point of view of marginal costs it is not warranted to include them in the system. The tax should therefore apply to heavy goods vehicles and goods vehicle combinations with a total weight of at least 12 tonnes. Military, police, emergency, road maintenance and veteran vehicles should be exempt.</p>
<h2>Size and differentiation of the tax</h2>
<p>Under EU rules a Swedish road tax may be levied to cover costs of construction, operation and maintenance of roads. It may also cover costs for air pollution and noise, but not for accidents. Moreover, it may cover costs of setting up and operating the tax system itself. In the opinion of the Committee the Swedish road tax should cover the costs of maintenance and repair (costs of surfacing work), air pollution (except carbon dioxide), noise, as well as operation and administration of the system. Moreover, in the opinion of the Committee the tax should not be differentiated with reference to time and space, since there is a risk that the costs will outweigh the benefit with such differentiation. Further, the tax should be calculated on the basis of whether a motor vehicle is able to use trailers or not, so that a vehicle with a towing device always pays tax at the same rate, regardless of whether a trailer is used or not.</p>
<h2>Organisation of the road tax system</h2>
<p>The Swedish Tax Agency should be the taxation authority. However, the Swedish Transport Agency, which already administers other vehicle-related taxes and charges, should administer the road tax on behalf of the Tax Agency. The Police Authority should be responsible for roadside checks. The Swedish Transport Administration should own and manage roadside equipment. The Swedish Enforcement Authority should be responsible for collection and enforcement of unpaid road tax.</p>
<p>To be able to levy the distance-based tax the Swedish Transport Agency must obtain data on how the vehicles are used on the roads. In addition, the Agency needs methods and tools to be able to verify this data. Consequently, detailed information on vehicle use needs to be saved. The control arrangements assume that the data is not stored in the vehicle itself. It is neither appropriate to leave it to the taxpayers themselves to decide on the form of storage nor to allow a public agency to act as a storage place. Instead, the model that should be chosen is for the taxpayers to engage private actors, i.e. service providers, to store the data. A very large percentage (approximately 85 per cent) of the vehicles deemed to be taxable already have technical equipment that can be used to transfer the information to a service provider.</p>
<h2>Infrequent users and temporary visitors</h2>
<p>Route tickets should be offered to make the system more userfriendly for infrequent users and temporary visitors.</p>
<h2>Compliance control and sanctions</h2>
<p>Lack of compliance with the tax system’s rules means that tax revenue is withheld. Moreover, companies that do not comply with the rules acquire competitive advantages over companies that comply. An effective system of controls and sanctions is therefore of great importance for achieving in practice the aims of the rules. Questions concerning controls and sanctions are also of great importance for a system to be perceived as credible and fair, which in turn is important for the system to be accepted by road users. Hence, the correct dimensioning of the control system is important for achieving the desired level of compliance.</p>
<h2>The question of whether it would be appropriate to transfer another country’s system to Swedish conditions</h2>
<p>The Committee has considered whether it would be appropriate to transfer in general any of the existing foreign distance-based tax and charging schemes to Swedish conditions, but made the assessment that this would not be appropriate. However, parts of other countries’ system concepts can be used. Selected parts of the systems in New Zealand, Oregon and Hungary in particular appear to be suitable to transfer to Swedish conditions.</p>
<h2>Choice of model for the system</h2>
<p>The general requirements that can reasonably be applied to a road tax system and the current technological premises determine which systems can be used. The costs of investments and administration must also be included in the overall assessment.</p>
<p>The Committee has outlined and analysed five conceivable models for a road tax system. These models have their strengths and weaknesses as well as opportunities and limitations. There is no model that is unassailable. The Committee has therefore endeavoured to introduce a system that implies significant advantages for controls without unreasonably high costs or overly complicated regulation. The Committee has chosen the model that meets most of the requirements that should be made of a road tax system, at the same time as the system achieves a reasonable level regarding the accuracy, acceptance, control and costs of the tax. The chosen model does not preclude future development, but is estimated to be a good foundation for adaptation to new requirements in future.</p>
<h2>The Committee’s proposal A distance-based road tax for Swedish and foreign heavy goods vehicles</h2>
<p>The Committee proposes a distance-based road tax for Swedish and foreign heavy goods vehicles and vehicle combinations of at least 12 tonnes. The tax will vary based on the characteristics of the heavy goods vehicle. The owner of such a heavy goods vehicle is to be associated with a licensed service provider, which stores the information on how the heavy goods vehicle is used on the roads. The service provider will report compiled data to the Swedish Transport Agency. Once a month the heavy goods vehicle owner must confirm or amend the data reported by the service provider to the Swedish Transport Agency. Special solutions in the form of route tickets are proposed for infrequent users and temporary visitors. Checks that the correct tax is levied will be made by means of camera surveillance, roadside checks, supervision and ordinary tax controls.</p>
<p>The introduction of this new tax will entail new obligations for hauliers, but it must also be emphasised that the Committee’s proposal means that all practical processing of the tax can be transferred to a third party.</p>
<p>The size of the tax and scope of tax liability</p>
<p>Taxable vehicles are, with some exceptions, motor vehicles or articulated motor vehicle combinations with a total weight of at least 12 tonnes if the motor vehicle is intended exclusively for road transport of goods. Both Swedish-registered and foreign-registered vehicles will be subject to the tax.</p>
<p>The tax will be levied at EUR 0.04–0.18   (SEK 0.38–1.69) per kilometre, depending on the weight class (road tax weight), number of wheel axles, EURO emission class and whether it has a towing device or not. For motor vehicles without a towing device this interval is EUR 0.04–0.12 (SEK 0.38–1.17) per kilometre and for vehicles with a towing device the interval is EUR 0.06–0.18 (SEK 0.56–1.69) per kilometre. With the chosen differentiation, the tax amount is always the same for a vehicle regardless of when or where it is used on the roads covered by the tax. The tax of an average vehicle without a towing device is about EUR 0.06 (SEK 0.60) per kilometre and the tax of an average vehicle with a towing device is about EUR 0.11 (SEK 1.10) per kilometre.</p>
<p>Tax liability arises when a taxable vehicle is used on a road that is subject to the tax. The tax will be levied on national roads and municipal roads and streets. On the other hand, private roads and streets will not be included in the tax liability.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the taxable person be the vehicle owner, unless the vehicle is equipped with an on-board unit linked to a contract with an EETS provider. In the latter case the EETS road user that has entered into a contract with the EETS provider is the taxable person instead of the vehicle owner.</p>
<p>Procedure and organisation</p>
<p>The Swedish Tax Agency will be the taxation authority, but the Swedish Transport Agency will make most decisions on behalf of the Tax Agency.</p>
<p>The taxable persons must pre-register their vehicles with the Swedish Transport Agency before tax liability arises (pre-registration). Pre-registration is only done once, but where necessary it must be updated (amendment registration).</p>
<p>Taxable persons must also provide information to the Swedish Transport Agency concerning how the vehicle is used on the roads that are subject to the tax. They can then opt for one of two different electronic procedures. They can either declare road use every month in arrears or declare each individual trip in advance (route ticket).</p>
<p>Those choosing the monthly procedure must use a service provider to keep an electronic log of how the vehicle is used in Sweden. A service provider must have an operating license. The Swedish Transport Agency is the licensing and supervisory authority.</p>
<p>Compliance checks</p>
<p>The Police Authority will make roadside checks aimed at detecting certain infringements and report them to the Swedish Transport Agency. The roadside checks can be coordinated with the roadside checks already carried out today. Moreover, the Swedish Transport Agency will use camera surveillance to detect infringements. The Swedish Transport Agency must report some infringements to the Swedish Tax Agency, which is to review decisions if grounds exist. The Swedish Tax Agency can also in other cases initiate an investigation or an audit.</p>
<p>Special charges for infringements</p>
<p>The Swedish Transport Agency will levy a sanction charge if the taxable person has not fulfilled their obligation to submit a preregistration or amendment registration, if the taxable person has not fulfilled the obligation of keeping an electronic log or if the taxable person does not have a valid route ticket. The sanction charge is EUR 2 600 (SEK 25 000) on each occasion and a new charge may be levied for each seven-day period. The charge is levied in advance through the agency of the police if the infringement is detected at a roadside check and the taxable person is not habitually resident in Sweden. If the advance is not paid the vehicle may be prevented from continuing its journey.</p>
<p>The Swedish Transport Agency levies a late filing charge if the taxable person submits the monthly declaration late. The late filing charge is normally EUR 65 (SEK 625).</p>
<p>The Swedish Tax Agency levies a surcharge in the event of discretionary taxation or incorrect information. The surcharge for discretionary taxation is EUR 520 (SEK 5 000) and 40 per cent of the tax determined as a result of the discretionary taxation, in addition to what would otherwise have been determined. In the same way the surcharge for incorrect information is EUR 520 (SEK 5 000) and 40 per cent of the tax that would not have been determined if the incorrect information had been accepted.</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances the surcharges will not be imposed. The Swedish Tax Agency can also decide on full or partial exemption from the surcharge if it would be unreasonable to charge the full amount.</p>
<p>Payment and effects of non-payment</p>
<p>The tax must as a rule be paid at the latest by the last day in the second calendar month after the month to which the tax decision refers. A route ticket must be paid before starting the journey. Taxes or charges decided in the case of correction or review must be paid at the latest 30 days after the decision date.</p>
<p>A late payment penalty will be levied in the event of non-timely payment. A prohibition on use will apply to a vehicle in the event of non-payment, with certain exceptions.</p>
<p>It will also be possible to lay claim to a vehicle to pay the amounts owed to the State for taxes or charges under the Road Tax Act.</p>
<p>Payment of overdue taxes and charges may be demanded from a foreign vehicle owner when the vehicle is stopped at a roadside check. If payment is not made the vehicle may be prevented from continuing its journey.</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Road Tax Act also include provisions concerning deferment of payment, exemption from and repayment of taxes or charges paid, correction and review of decisions and appeal and enforcement.</p>
<h2>The road tax in relation to other taxes and charges</h2>
<p>Value added tax will not be levied on the proposed road tax.</p>
<p>The road tax will be deductible against income tax. However, the special charges payable on infringement under the Act will not be deductible.</p>
<p>The current time-based road charge for certain heavy goods vehicles will be abolished when the road tax is introduced. Moreover, vehicle tax needs to be adjusted when the road charge is abolished and the road tax is introduced.</p>
<p>The current congestion tax, which is levied on heavy goods and other vehicles in Gothenburg and Stockholm, will remain unchanged when the road tax is introduced. Road infrastructure charges, which are levied on heavy goods and other vehicles using the bridges in Sundsvall and Motala, will remain unchanged when the road tax is introduced.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>The number of Swedish taxable persons will be the same as the number of Swedish persons currently subject to the current timebased road charge; that is 22 500, with a total of about 78 000 vehicles. The committee assesses that the number of foreign taxable persons will be about 28 000 with a total of about 100 000 vehicles.</p>
<p>The Committee assesses that the number of service providers a couple of years after introduction could be 15–20.</p>
<p>A road tax will entail increased costs for about 90 per cent of those subject to the tax, while about 10 per cent will have lower costs compared with the current road charge.</p>
<p>One aim of introducing the tax, according to the Committee’s terms of reference, is that heavy goods traffic should to a greater extent bear the economic costs to society that it causes. The Committee’s proposal for a distance-based road tax will mean that heavy goods traffic will pay its costs for road wear, emissions of air pollutants (apart from carbon dioxide) and noise (rural noise). Another aim of the Committee’s proposed road tax is to reduce the negative effects of heavy goods transport and promote reduced road wear. Road wear depends on the weight per axle and the size of the tax is therefore dependent on the vehicle’s weight class and number of axles. To promote reduced emissions of air pollutants, the tax is lower for vehicles in a cleaner EURO emission class. The road tax is also aimed at achieving a transfer of goods transport from road to other modes of transport such as rail and sea, which reduces the negative effects of transportation in heavy goods vehicles. Moreover, the road tax increases the possibilities of controlling compliance as a whole among heavy road transport providers.</p>
<h2>Traffic and environmental effects</h2>
<p>Vehicle mileage will only decrease marginally in the short term. In the longer term, however, there will be a decrease in vehicle mileage of 4–5 per cent and a transfer to rail and sea of about 3–4 and 2–3 per cent respectively. There will also be a transfer from smaller goods vehicles to larger goods vehicles.</p>
<p>The environmental effects are estimated by and large to follow the traffic effects. In the short term there will only be marginal changes. A transfer of goods to railways and shipping may reduce emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases per transported tonne, which means improved environmental vehicle mileage efficiency. A transfer from small goods vehicles to larger but fewer goods vehicles means an improved energy efficiency for this mode of transport and fewer heavy goods vehicles on the roads. This should probably reduce the risk of accidents involving goods vehicles. The road tax provides greater incentives to use trailers, which leads to fewer emissions per tonne transported and thus better environmental efficiency.</p>
<h2>Public finance effects</h2>
<p>The table below shows the net effects on public finances. Today’s road charge will be discontinued and corporate taxation will decrease. The road tax is expected in the short term to increase central government tax revenues by EUR 226–335 million net. In the long term a transfer from road transport to other modes of transport is expected, which will reduce the revenues from fuel tax. At the same time, revenues from track charges and fairway charges are expected to increase somewhat.</p>
<p>Expenditure is expected to increase by EUR 45–59 million. The total net revenue is expected in the long term to be EUR 162–286 million annually.</p>
<h2>Economic benefit to society</h2>
<p>A simplified cost-benefit analysis shows that road tax in the long term is positive. The tax factor is of significance for whether the cost-benefit analysis is positive. The analysis is made on the basis of a transfer of about five per cent of goods transport to other modes of transport. The tax revenues are seen in the cost-benefit analysis only as a transfer from companies to the State and do not affect the economic benefit of the tax to society.</p>
<h2>Effects for the business sector and industries and regions</h2>
<p>The road tax will affect some product groups and sectors more than others. Hauliers in the forestry, food and civil engineering sectors will have transport cost increases of 3–11 per cent. The opportunities for hauliers to pass on this cost increase to their customers (transport purchasers) varies depending on the competition situation and market structure. Transport is assessed in general, however, to have a low degree of price sensitivity, which may benefit the hauliers. The Committee assumes that the hauliers can pass on 90–100 per cent of their costs to the transport purchasers.</p>
<p>The increased transport cost for transport purchasers impacts in turn various sectors in different ways, depending on the transport needs in the sector. The sectors outside the haulage industry that are expected to be impacted most are the forest industry, the food industry and the civil engineering industry. Within the forest industry, the sawmill and wood products industries will be more affected than the pulp and paper industry. Since transport costs are one of several types of expense, the final effect will be far less than the transport cost increase in terms of production cost increases. Other sectors and product groups are expected to have lower increases in transport costs and production costs.</p>
<p>Transport distances are longer in central and northern Sweden than in southern Sweden, which gives a higher percentage of transport costs. In the most affected sectors the number of employees in each workplace is on average smaller in central Sweden than in other parts of the country. The Committee therefore estimates that central Sweden is the region that may be most affected by the tax.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the Road Tax Act come into force on 1 May 2021. It is proposed that the Act on Service Providers for Road Tax come into force on 1 July 2020.</p>
