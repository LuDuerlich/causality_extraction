<p>The Committee's proposals</p>
<p>The Committee proposes, inter alia , the following amendments to the</p>
<p>N  The debtor shall consult with the administrator not merely prior to making payments but also prior to the performance of other types of obligations;</p>
<p>N  In order to prevent termination, the debtor need not demand that the entire agreement be performed. Instead, the debtor may decide that the agreement shall be performed only with respect to a specific outstanding term or quantity;</p>
<p>N  The other party to the contract will be entitled to request notification as to the manner in which the agreement shall be performed, notwithstanding that the debtor is not in delay constituting grounds for termination at the time of the granting of the company reorganisation order. If, following such enquiry, the debtor fails to demand performance within a reasonable period of time, the other party to the contract shall be entitled to terminate;</p>
<p>N  The debtor's current entitlement to performance, without being required to provide consideration in respect to that which was furnished to him prior to the company reorganisation, shall also apply where the debtor was not in delay constituting grounds for termination prior to the company reorganisation;</p>
<p>N  In conjunction with hire purchases and financial leasing, the other party to the contract must allow delivered property to remain in the possession of the debtor where the latter pays amounts which become due and payable after the granting of the company reorganisation order. However, after the conclusion of the company reorganisation the other party to the contract may repossess the property, unless the debtor pays amounts which became due and payable prior to the company reorganisation;</p>
<p>N  Notwithstanding the fundamental moratorium on execution during the company reorganisation, the other party to the contract shall be able to repossess property to which he holds title in the event the debtor does not decide that the agreement shall be performed;</p>
<p>N  Where the debtor demands that an agreement be performed during the company reorganisation, the claims of other party to the contract for payment in respect of performance of his outstanding obligations may not be reduced through a composition;</p>
<p>N  Where the debtor consumes something provided in performance of an obligation without having decided that the agreement shall be performed, he shall pay full consideration for the obligation performed notwithstanding any composition;</p>
<p>N  Where, in performance of an agreement, the debtor has executed performance in kind, the other party to the contract may not set off his payment obligation against a composition claim;</p>
<p>N  Employment agreements shall be governed by the same rules as other agreements. Accordingly, employees shall not be entitled to withhold work on the grounds that wages earned prior to company reorganisation, to which a wage guarantee shall apply, have not been paid. Boycotts which are aimed at inducing the employer to pay wages earned prior to a company reorganisation will become impermissible;</p>
<p>N  In order that company reorganisations will not be exploited in order to circumvent the right of priority rules set forth in the Employment Protection Act, damages due to unfair dismissals during or otherwise in connection with the company reorganisation shall not be covered by a composition.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes the following amendment to the Right of Priority Act (Förmånsrättslagen) :</p>
<p>N  Claims which, in accordance with the above points, cannot be reduced through a composition shall enjoy rights of priority if a bankruptcy petition is granted not later than three months after the company reorganisation.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes the following amendment to the Bankruptcy Act (Konkurslagen) :</p>
<p>N  Rules shall be incorporated into the Bankruptcy Act concerning the accession of the estate in to the debtor's agreements which correspond to the rules proposed regarding the debtor's rights to performance in the event of a company reorganisation. In the event of hire purchase agreements and financial leasing, the debtor must, however, immediately pay all due and payable amounts in order to pre-</p>
<p>clude termination. In addition, the estate in bankruptcy may lack a right of accession due to the nature of the legal relationship. The proposal relating to bankruptcy requires certain supplementary investigation regarding consequential amendments before it can be implemented.</p>
<p>The Committee's duties</p>
<p>In 1999, the Committee submitted its principal report, New Right of Priority Rules (SOU 1999:1). It was proposed therein, inter alia , that floating charges be converted into a general right of priority and that the security shall cover one half of the value of all of the debtor's property. It was further proposed that the right of priority in respect of taxes be abolished, that the right of priority in respect of wages be amended and that a wage guarantee be introduced in conjunction with company reorganisations. However, such wage guarantee shall be deducted from the wage guarantee payable in the event of an immediately subsequent bankruptcy .</p>
<p>During the course of its work, the Committee was issued with supplementary terms of reference to investigate whether, during a company reorganisation, the debtor should be entitled to terminate agreements prematurely. The Committee addressed this investigation work separately. In conjunction therewith, the Committee considered certain other issues concerning the debtor's agreements in conjunction with a company reorganisation. These were partially regulated through the enactment of the Company Reorganisation Act (hereinafter "CRA") which, however, has subsequently been deemed to be in need of certain clarification and amendments. Finally, the Committee has considered the need to incorporate into the Bankruptcy Act general rules regarding termination and performance of the debtor's agreements by means of the estate's accession thereto, corresponding to the rules which have been proposed to apply in the event of company reorganisations.</p>
<p>Extraordinary right of termination</p>
<p>The problem</p>
<p>The starting point in conjunction with company reorganisations is that the debtor's agreements remain in force. However, the debtor is not obliged to perform its obligations during the company reorganisation but, rather, enjoys a moratorium (Chapter 2, section 17 of the CRA). Normally, the claims of other party to the contract may be compulsorily reduced through a judicial composition.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the possibility of a reorganisation may be rendered more difficult by the debtor being a party to onerous agreements, a fact which constitutes a serious encumbrance notwithstanding that the agreements are subject to a composition. In addition, at present the debtor may be forced to demand performance of an obligation for the entire outstanding term of the agreement in order to preclude the other party from terminating the agreement, notwithstanding that the debtor needs to utilise the agreement for only a limited period of time. The question thus becomes whether the debtor, through termination, can release himself from onerous agreements such that the other party to the contract does not even obtain a claim which is subject to a composition or, in any event, cannot present a claim in contract for compensatory damages and  whether the debtor may demand performance of an agreement in order to prevent termination but then, immediately thereafter or following a certain period of time, terminate the agreement with the effect that, after the expiry of the termination period, the other party merely has a composition claim.</p>
<p>Foreign law provides examples of both of these types of termination rules which are aimed at facilitating reorganisations in the event of both company reorganisations and bankruptcies.</p>
<p>Total discharge from certain debts or from liability in contract for compensatory damages</p>
<p>The Committee's conclusion is that the principle of the equal rights of the creditors prevents the debtor from being accorded a possibility of total discharge from certain onerous agreements, such that the other party to the contract does not even obtain a composition claim or an unsecured claim in the bankruptcy. In the Committee's opinion, such a discharge should take place only within the ambit of the avoidance of transactions rules pursuant to the provisions set forth in Chapter 4 of the Bankruptcy Act (particularly sections 5 and 6). The need for simplicity in the application of law militates strongly against the other</p>
<p>party to a contract being precluded from presenting proof of its claim in contract for compensatory damages. Accordingly, the Committee does not make any such proposal.</p>
<p>Right to performance with respect to a limited period of time or quantity</p>
<p>With respect to the second issue, namely the introduction of an extraordinary right of termination  following a demand for performance, the Committee notes that, in accordance with governing law, a demand for performance during a company reorganisation does not render the debtor's obligation to make payment of consideration independent of a composition. If, following a demand for performance, the debtor declares without warning that he is no longer willing to make payment in consideration of the other party’s performance of the contract, the other party to the contract only has a composition claim for damages. Accordingly, there is no need for an extraordinary right of termination on a prioritised plane in conjunction with company reorganisations. However, the Committee is of the opinion that rules should be incorporated pursuant to which the other party against which a demand for performance has been made and which must, accordingly, be prepared to perform on pain of liability in damages should be entitled to consideration or damages which are independent of whether the debtor achieves a composition (see further below). If the agreement is divisible in time or quantity without significant prejudice to the other party (for example, a lease agreement or regular or instalment deliveries), the debtor should not, however, be forced to demand performance of all outstanding matters in order for the other party to the contract to forfeit its right to terminate. In the event of such agreements, the debtor should be granted what in reality corresponds to an extraordinary right of termination following a demand for performance. However, instead of entitling the debtor, following a demand for performance, to be discharged from liability on the prioritised plane at any time, subject to a specific period of notice of termination, the Committee proposes that the debtor in his original demand for performance  should be able to determine, at his discretion, the period of time or quantity in respect of which performance will take place. With respect to the period or quantity in excess thereof, the other party will obtain a composition claim (as if performance had never been demanded). One reason for the proposal is that the other party to a contract which is obliged to make do with a composition claim regarding a specific part of the performance of its outstanding obligations normally is in no worse position than if</p>
<p>obligated to make do with a composition claim regarding performance of all of its outstanding obligations. Through the manner in which the rule is drafted, the other party to the contract will know immediately what is to apply in the future and it will not be necessary, in respect of the various relationships which may be involved, to state a fixed, general period of notice of termination or to fall back on a reasonable period of notice of termination. The debtor's entitlement to limited performance will encourage him to commence the company reorganisation before the insolvency becomes too deep.</p>
<p>Thus, upon the commencement of a company reorganisation, the debtor should be able, for example, to decide that leased premises shall be retained for three months, during which period of time the other party’s claim for payment is protected against a composition, following which the premises will be at the other party’s disposal. Compensation for damage during any outstanding period of notice of termination will thereupon become only a composition claim, just as the claim for damages would have been if the debtor had initially decided that the agreement would not be performed at all during the company reorganisation.</p>
<p>Corresponding rules in conjunction with bankruptcy</p>
<p>In proposals for corresponding rules concerning the debtor's agreements in the event of bankruptcy, the Committee presents no proposal that the estate in bankruptcy be granted a general right to make certain claims, in whole or in part, unenforceable as claims in the bankruptcy.</p>
<p>On the contrary, it is stated that certain rules pursuant to which an employee may not present proof of claim for wages for the entire contracted period of employment or the period of notice of termination, and may not present proof of claim for the entire agreed wages are, in principle, debatable insofar as the agreements cannot be subjected to general rules relating to avoidance of transactions. However, the Committee presents no proposals regarding amendments on these points.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Committee proposes that a bankrupt's estate should be entitled, in respect of a limited period or quantity , to accede to an agreement which is divisible, and for which the estate assumes liability . In respect of the excess period or quantity, the other party to the contract shall only have a claim in the bankruptcy. Accordingly, here too the technique of a right of termination following a demand for performance (i.e. after accession and liability for the estate) will be applicable.</p>
<p>It might appear to be the case that it represents a significant improvement for the bankrupt's estate to be able to accede to agreements during a limited period of time or for a limited quantity since, under currently applicable law, the estate must accede to the entire outstanding agreement (see, e.g., Chapter 12, section 31 of the Land Code relating to rents for commercial premises). In fact, though, at least in certain cases, this proposal also entails a strengthening of the position of the other party to the contract. It is precisely with respect to rents for commercial premises that an estate which does not wish to accede and assume liability nevertheless is entitled, during a customary period of notice of termination (normally nine months) to use the premises in exchange for regular payment of the rent. In such case, the lessor obtains no claim against the estate for rent for all of the remaining term but, instead, only an entitlement to successive advance payments on its claim for payment in the bankruptcy. Accordingly, the estate has the possibility, for example after three months, to place the premises at the lessor’s disposal without notice  and direct the lessor to present a proof of claim for damages in the bankruptcy in respect of unpaid rent during the remainder of the period of notice of termination. It is proposed that this possibility to retain the premises in exchange for successive payment of rent be abolished by the lessor obtaining a right to terminate the agreement with immediate effect in the event the estate fails to claim performance for the entire term of the agreement or for a fixed part thereof (see below).</p>
<p>Other proposals concerning company reorganisation</p>
<p>Duty of consultation</p>
<p>It is proposed that the provisions of Chapter 2, section 15 of the CRA regarding the debtor's obligation to consult with the administrator be extended to cover not merely payment of debts incurred prior to the company reorganisation but also to the performance of other obligations (performance in kind). The purpose is to strengthen the principle of the equality of rights of unsecured creditors and to promote the influence of the administrator.</p>
<p>Prohibition on execution</p>
<p>It is proposed that the prohibition on execution set forth in Chapter 2, section 17 of the CRA be adjusted such that, primarily, execution levied on property to which the other party to the contract holds title shall be possible where the debtor fails to demand performance of the agreement in question. Where the debtor fails to declare that he is prepared to make payment or to provide security in pace with the new performance of obligations by the other party to the contract, e.g. in the form of continued grant of use of property, the other party shall thus not merely obtain a right of termination (see below) but also a right to cause repossession to be executed.</p>
<p>Extension of the prohibition on termination</p>
<p>According to Chapter 2, section 20 of the CRA, following the granting of a company reorganisation order the other party to a contract may not terminate the contract due to the debtor’s delay constituting grounds for termination which existed prior to the company reorganisation. Notwithstanding such delay, subject to administrator's consent the debtor is entitled to decide that the agreement shall be performed. The Committee proposes that the provision be extended such that a mere application  for a company reorganisation order will constitute an impediment to termination. In addition, the provision which makes mandatory the debtor’s right to performance is clarified such that conditions pursuant to which an agreement automatically terminates in the event of company reorganisation ( ipso facto clauses ) are also invalid. On the other hand, a certain protection is introduced for the benefit of the other party to the contract which terminates an agreement following a good faith  application for a company reorganisation order.</p>
<p>The same performance rules irrespective of whether the debtor was in delay constituting grounds for termination prior to the company reorganisation</p>
<p>According to Chapter 2, section 20 of the CRA, the other party to the contract is entitled to notification  whether the agreement shall be performed – with the associated entitlement to security for payment in respect of future performance and the right to terminate the agreement in the event of no response or a negative response regarding performance only where the debtor was in delay constituting grounds for termination prior to the company reorganisation. At the same time, the</p>
<p>debtor has the right, specifically granted in the provision, to performance without being required to make payment for obligations performed and received prior to the reorganisation –  notwithstanding the rules governing the contractual relationship in question - only where the debtor provided the other party to the contract with grounds for termination prior to the reorganisation. The Committee is of the opinion that these rules should also be applicable when the debtor has not been in delay constituting grounds for termination prior to the reorganisation. The intention with the first proposal is to counteract uneven contractual obligations whereby the other party to the contract must be prepared to perform but cannot count on more than a composition claim. The intention with the second proposal is, inter alia , to encourage the filing of early applications for company reorganisation orders.</p>
<p>Demands for performance provide the other party to the contract with protection in the event of a composition</p>
<p>According to Chapter 2, section 20 of the CRA, the debtor's demand for performance has the consequence that the other party to the contract is entitled to security when he is to perform his outstanding obligations in cases where the debtor is not contractually obligated to make immediate payment of consideration. Where the other party’s outstanding obligations to be performed lie in the future, the other party is entitled to security for payment only where, for special reasons, such is necessitated in order to protect him against loss. This results in uneven obligations. Accordingly, it is proposed that the debtor's demand for performance should result in the other party’s payment claims and any claims in damages being outside a composition. The proposal may be compared with the accession of a bankrupt's estate resulting in a debt for the estate.</p>
<p>In the event performance is demanded, the debtor need pay full consideration only in respect of the other party’s outstanding obligations</p>
<p>The Committee proposes no change in the rule set forth in Chapter 2, section 20 of the CRA whereby the debtor, following a demand for performance, in principle is not required to make payment in consideration of performance received prior to the company reorganisation. The rule probably has no independent significance in the event of regular and instalment deliveries to the debtor since, in such context, general</p>
<p>contractual rules already prevent termination in relation to subsequent performance of obligations when a recurrence of the default in payment cannot be expected (see sections 43 and 44 of the Sale of Goods Act). On the other hand, the provision is of great importance, for example, in conjunction with leases for commercial premises where, pursuant to the provisions of the Land Code, the debtor may terminate the agreement if all due and payable rents have not been paid (see Chapter 12, section 42 of the Land Code and NJA 1989, page 206). The equivalent must be assumed to apply to other rights of use agreements, e.g. publishing agreements, licence agreements, and operational leasing, as well as the use of telecommunications services.</p>
<p>The extraordinary right created by the CRA to performance in exchange for payment only in respect of obligations performed which are received during the company reorganisation applies, however, only during the reorganisation procedure. When such ceases, the general contractual rules once again apply. The extent to which the debtor, in order to save a contract, must then pay all debts relating to the performance of obligations received prior to the reorganisation depends on the content of the general contractual rules and on whether the debts in question are reduced through a composition.</p>
<p>Credit purchases with a right of repossession and financial leasing</p>
<p>The purpose of the rule that the debtor is required to make full payment in consideration of performance received prior to the reorganisation is, naturally, that the other party to the contract, which merely has an unsecured claim for payment in respect of such performance, should not receive full payment for the same while other creditors with unsecured claims are subjected to a composition. The other party should only be absolved from taking new risks, i.e., he should receive full payment for future performance of obligations in respect of which he has a right to withhold delivery and a right of repossession. Where the other party has a right of repossession protected by rights in rem  pursuant to which the property susceptible to repossession constitutes security for performance of all  the debtor's obligations, as is the case with a purchase on credit which is subject to right of a repossession and in conjunction with financial leasing, rights in rem  speak strongly in favour of the other party to the contract being able to demand immediate payment of all due and payable amounts in order not to terminate and repossess such party’s property.</p>
<p>The manner in which hire purchases and financial leasing shall be addressed according to governing law is unclear. Even if the other</p>
<p>party to the contract has a civil law right of termination should not all due and payable debts be paid immediately, because of the prohibition against execution set forth in Chapter 2, section 17 of the CRA he cannot repossess goods without the debtor's voluntary co-operation. Taking into consideration the fact that company reorganisations generally do not take place during a period in excess of three months, the Committee proposes that a middle way be adopted. Through a demand for performance, the debtor should be able to prevent repossession during the reorganisation, provided that the debtor successively pays future due and payable amounts such that the goods need not serve as security for new debts.</p>
<p>In order for the debtor to be able to become owner of the goods after the reorganisation, he must, however, pay the entire purchase price or leasing fee plus any option amount insofar as the goods were worth so much that they constituted security for the payment which was neglected prior to the reorganisation; in fact, in such case the other party’s claim for such payment lapses without a composition (see Chapter 3, section 3 of the CRA).</p>
<p>Performance in kind by the debtor</p>
<p>The provisions relating to the content of performance are specified in the proposal in respect of those cases in which, under the agreement the debtor must perform in kind, e.g. deliver goods or perform contracting work. Also in such cases the debtor may, in principle, demand that the other party to the contract perform its outstanding obligations (to make payment) against full consideration only in respect of such payments, i.e. the debtor need not deliver goods which correspond to an advance payment received prior to the reorganisation. However, such a limitation on performance is conditional on the debtor's performance being divisible (cf. sections 43 and 44 of the Sale of Goods Act). If a division of the performance of the debtor's obligations (delivery of the goods or the contracting work) would result in significant prejudice for the other party to the contract, the debtor shall be entitled to performance (i.e. the right to outstanding payment) provided he fulfils all of his performance obligations under the contract. Example: where the other party to the contract has paid half of the contract sum for construction on two floors prior to the reorganisation but the debtor has not yet performed any of the contracting work, the debtor cannot demand to receive the outstanding portion of the contract sum against delivery of the second floor.</p>
<p>The debtor's liability for defects</p>
<p>As mentioned above, where the debtor has demanded performance he will be liable for ensuring that the other party to the contract receives the agreed consideration for performance of his outstanding obligations, even where the debtor reaches a composition. Where the debtor is to perform in kind, he cannot circumvent his liability for delay by providing defective performance. To the extent the debtor has liability for delay which is outside the scope of a composition, he thus also has a liability for defects which is outside the scope of a composition. This liability will cover defects in performance in kind which the debtor, through a demand for performance, may be deemed to have promised to provide in exchange for receipt of new payment, notwithstanding the company reorganisation.</p>
<p>In other cases the following principles ought to apply.</p>
<p>Where the performance of the debtor's obligations is divisible  such that he would have been able to demand outstanding payments against due consideration for such amounts without the need to provide any performance in kind in respect of a payment received prior to the company reorganisation, the debtor's liability for defects should be covered by a composition to the extent the defect relates to a performance in kind which constitutes consideration for a payment received by the debtor prior to the company reorganisation, irrespective of whether the performance in kind was executed before or during the company reorganisation. Example: where, under an agreement for instalment deliveries prior to the company reorganisation, the debtor has received payment for product A and delivers the same, following which he demands payment for product B (and delivers the same), he will thus not be liable for defects in product A, irrespective of any composition.</p>
<p>When the performance of the debtor's obligations is not divisible  but, rather, the other party’s contractual obligation to make (supplementary) payment is contingent on a defect not existing in an already delivered performance, it might be thought that a demand for outstanding payment should result in the other party’s claim in the event of a defect being protected against a composition, irrespective of whether the defect relates to something that was delivered prior to or after the commencement of the company reorganisation. Thus, during a company reorganisation a contractor should be responsible for defects, independent of any composition, if he claimed any payment during the company reorganisation and it later transpired that the contracting work had been defective, irrespective of when such part of the contracting work was performed. However, such an extensive liability for defects independent of a composition might result in the debtor not daring to</p>
<p>claim a small outstanding portion of the payment, and it might also appear to be unreasonable from the perspective of rights in rem  that the other party to the contract, thanks to a small supplementary payment (against certain supplementary performance), should obtain a claim for full consideration which is protected in the composition also in respect of payments made prior to the commencement of the reorganisation. Taking into consideration the fact that the debtor's liability to refund the purchase price or to pay the other party’s rectification costs or damages is divisible – while redelivery and rectification almost constitute sanctions for the protection of the party obligated to perform in kind, which in practice are never carried out through execution measures – it would best accord with performance rules in general if the other party, when the defect relates to a performance in kind made prior to the commencement of the reorganisation, should have a claim outside the scope of a composition only up to the amount he paid during the reorganisation (cp. chapter 5, section 15 of the Bankruptcy Act), or alternatively in proportion to how much of the price he paid during the reorganisation.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the scope of liability for defects not subject to a composition should not be restricted by the wording of legislation.</p>
<p>Set-off of a composition claim against the debtor's claim for payment for performance in kind during the company reorganisation</p>
<p>The basic concept that the other party to the contract, in the event of performance, should obtain full value for his new performance of obligations but only have a composition claim in respect of previously executed performance also forms the basis for a proposal that the other party to the contract should not be entitled to set off a composition claim against the debtor's claim for payment in respect of performance in kind which the debtor has chosen to execute during the reorganisation. This entails a change in governing law (see NJA 1916, page 154 and 1996, page 368).</p>
<p>Performance restricted to a specific time or quantity</p>
<p>As mentioned above, it is proposed that the debtor be able to determine that performance of the outstanding obligations on both sides shall be limited to a specific time or specific quantity, but exceptions shall be made where such a division would result in significant prejudice for the other party to the contract or where the other party possesses a right</p>
<p>to performance by the debtor which is protected against the debtor's creditors. The latter is the case, for example, where the other party leases an apartment in the debtor's property and has taken possession of the apartment or registered the tenancy. The other party may terminate the agreement insofar as the debtor has not demanded performance.</p>
<p>Misleading allocation of consideration in the agreement</p>
<p>As mentioned in several places above, in the event of performance the debtor must make payment of consideration in respect of the obligations performed by the other party to the contract during the company reorganisation. Where the allocation of the debtor's consideration for various obligations performed by the other party would obviously be misleading, the allocation should be adjustable. The aforesaid applies both when the other party to the contract has performed partially prior to the reorganisation and when the debtor demands partial performance of the remaining obligations.</p>
<p>The debtor's liability for disposition when performance is not demanded</p>
<p>With respect to the other party’s right of repossession , in relation to property which, usually by mistake, has been given to the debtor following an application for company reorganisation when performance is not to take place, the sole change proposed is that the right of repossession shall be declared to be generally applicable, and thus also where the other party to the contract has paid money. If the debtor has disposed of the property delivered by the other party such that it cannot be returned essentially unchanged or undiminished, it is proposed that the other party’s claim for consideration be independent of a composition, something which currently is not set forth in section 63 of the Sale of Goods Act but which is perhaps implied.</p>
<p>If, without having demanded performance, the debtor utilises the subject matter of a performance provided during the reorganisation such that it cannot be returned , for example retains possession of leased premises, in respect of which elapsed time cannot be reinstated, or accepts a service, the debtor shall make payment in consideration of that which has been used, independent of any composition. The proposal entails an amendment to governing law (see NJA 1999, page 617).</p>
<p>Rights of priority in conjunction with bankruptcy</p>
<p>Through the proposal that the claim of the other party to the contract for consideration in respect of its outstanding performance should lie outside a composition, after the debtor has demanded performance with the administrator's consent, it is natural that the claim for consideration and certain closely related claims should be accorded a general right of priority in accordance with section 10 of the Right of Priority Act in cases in which the company reorganisation is followed by an bankruptcy within three months. In such cases, the company reorganisation and the bankruptcy nearly constitute a single insolvency procedure and the performance has been demanded in approximately the interests of the creditors collectively, who are creditors in the bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Trading in financial instruments</p>
<p>The rules governing the debtor's agreements set forth in the CRA shall apply to all types of agreements, unless any other law expressly states that a different provision shall have precedence. The Financial Instruments Trading Act contains provisions pursuant to which agreements regarding final settlement in conjunction with company reorganisations shall be enforceable against the debtor and the debtor’s other creditors.</p>
<p>Employment agreements</p>
<p>The Committee has considered the extent to which employment agreements should be exempted from the general rules regarding the debtor's agreements in conjunction with company reorganisations. Such an exception exists today. According to the exception, notwithstanding the commencement of a company reorganisation, an employee can terminate the agreement if the debtor (the employer) is in material default in payment of wages earned prior to the reorganisation . Employees are also entitled to withhold continued work until such time as all due and payable wages are paid, and their trade union can have recourse to a boycott.</p>
<p>The Committee is of the opinion that these exceptions in the CRA lack objective justification. Even if the other party’s claim regarding performance prior to the reorganisation enjoys a general right of priority, in all other cases it is subject to the moratorium on performance and execution in conjunction with a company reorganisation. The debtor requires a moratorium and it is not always possible to determine whether the debtor's financial position is such that wage claims should</p>
<p>receive a full dividend in an bankruptcy in the event the reorganisation attempt is unsuccessful. Provided that the Committee's proposals set forth in SOU 1999:1 are enacted i.e. that wage guarantees shall apply i.a. for wages earned prior to the reorganisation then the need for social protection is taken care of. The trade union right to have recourse to a boycott may reasonably be deemed to assume that the employer does not have any legal grounds for its failure to pay due wages. In order to avoid any doubt regarding the meaning of the final paragraph of section 41 in the Co-determination in the Workplace Act, it is proposed, as a supplement to the provision, that boycotts for the purpose of debt collection may not be instituted in relation to wages earned prior to a company reorganisation.</p>
<p>Where the debtor has demanded performance of an employment agreement, the employee shall be obligated to continue to work in exchange for receipt of security for wages for future work  and in exchange for such a wage claim falling outside a composition and enjoying a general right of priority in accordance with section 10 of the Right of Priority Act. As with other types of agreements, the demand for performance may relate to a shorter period  than the remaining term of the employment. However, the debtor is not able to demand performance at a different level of employment. Where no performance, or performance limited in time, is demanded, the employee may terminate the agreement with immediate effect or with effect sometime thereafter, irrespective of any other applicable period of notice of termination.</p>
<p>Should the employer terminate the agreement, then pursuant to the proposal in SOU 1999:1 the employee shall be entitled to wage guarantee for a normal termination period of time but his claim shall have no priority in bankruptcy and thus be subjected to a composition. However, if the employee is utilised during the termination period, then his wage claim shall be paid irrespective of a composition and with no wage guarantee. The same applies if the employer neither demands performance nor terminates the agreement.</p>
<p>In order that the debtor, in the event of a company reorganisation, does not obtain greater possibilities to circumvent the order of priority in conjunction with termination of employment  than are available to a bankrupt's estate or the party acquiring the business of the estate (see section 25 of the Employment Protection Act), it is proposed that damages awarded for violations of the Employment Protection Act during or otherwise in connection with the company reorganisation shall be protected against a composition.</p>
<p>Other proposals relating to bankruptcy</p>
<p>Starting point</p>
<p>The Bankruptcy Act contains no regulations regarding the estate's entitlement to demand performance of the debtor's agreements or, as it is usually called, the estate's right to accede to the debtor's agreements. However, individual acts contain provisions relating to the contractual relationships affected. See, for example, section 63 of the Sale of Goods Act; Chapter 4, section 26, Chapter 8, section 17, Chapter 9, section 30, and Chapter 12, section 31 of the Land Code; section 47 of the Commercial Agents Act; section 27 of the Commercial Representatives Act; Chapter 2, section 27 and Chapter 4, section 7 of the Partnerships and Non-registered Partnerships Act; and sections 26 and 28 of the Insurance Contracts Act. An explanation for this fragmented regulation is that the management of operations in the event of bankruptcy is transferred to a liquidator – a factor which, in certain but not other contractual relationships, may result in such an erosion in the other party’s conditions for the agreement that it is not deemed reasonable that the estate accede to the agreement.</p>
<p>The need for reform</p>
<p>One disadvantage with the lack of a common regulation in the Bankruptcy Act is that uncertainty often prevails regarding the estate's right of accession in unregulated contractual relationships, and the provisions that do exist are sometimes contradictory without the contradictions being susceptible to any reasonable explanation. The lack of a common insolvency law perspective in the legislation has also resulted in the contractual interests of the other party to the contract having a strong impact on the development of case law (see NJA 1989, page 206). It should also be clear that reforms cannot be carried out without legislation (see NJA 1999, page 617).</p>
<p>There exists a practical need to clarify the extent to which a bankrupt's estate has a right of accession in unregulated contractual relationships. According to the Committee, certain changes in the legal situation are also required (regarding partial accession, set-off, and liability for utilisation of rights of use when accession has not taken place). It should also be clarified whether the estate's right of accession is mandatory, where such occurs.</p>
<p>In addition, it may be noted that bankruptcies currently constitute absolutely the most important instrument for the reorganisation of companies. While there are less than 50 company reorganisations a</p>
<p>year pursuant to the CRA, there are 5,000–10,000 bankruptcies in a normal year. If it is desired that businesses affected by bankruptcy shall survive, albeit that they must be transferred to a new owner, it is important that the estate, through accession to the debtor's agreements, can keep the agreements alive until such time that all the assets in the business can be transferred. However, in order that even a piecemeal sale of the insolvent company's assets shall yield a satisfactory result for the creditors, it is necessary that certain agreements be retained, such as lease agreements, certain employment agreements, telephone and electricity supply agreements, etc.</p>
<p>In various countries, company reorganisations (in which the debtor continues to survive as a legal entity), and bankruptcies (which procedure normally concludes with a change in ownership of the assets), are now integrated. It may initially be difficult to know if the insolvency procedure should be concluded the one way or the other. However, in Sweden an unsuccessful company reorganisation cannot be smoothly transformed into a bankruptcy in which any party can purchase all assets without assuming liability for the debts. A liquidator must be appointed instead of the administrator and a new estate inventory must be prepared based on the date of the granting of the bankruptcy petition. Even if the Committee's proposal contained in SOU 1999:1 is implemented, namely that wage guarantees shall be available also in conjunction with company reorganisations, the employees may, based on their own choice of either the date of the filing of the application for a company reorganisation order or the date of filing of the bankruptcy petition, influence what constitutes wages earned prior to the insolvency procedure and what constitutes termination wages during the procedure. It would be beneficial if these procedures could be merged also in Sweden.</p>
<p>General rules regarding the estate in bankruptcy 's rights of accession under the Bankruptcy Act</p>
<p>As a step in the direction towards an integrated insolvency procedure, the Committee presents a proposal regarding general rules governing the bankrupt's estate's accession to the debtor's agreements. The rules are largely in accord with the rules proposed for company reorganisations. As with the rules in the CRA, the provisions shall be subordinated to any other act. This exception may be of very great significance in conjunction with bankruptcies since several of the provisions existing today, which deviate from those which it is proposed shall become general in the Bankruptcy Act, will remain in force. In general, the</p>
<p>exceptions are where the debtor's person is significant for the due performance of the agreement. The Committee also proposes, in keeping with the pattern in Denmark and Norway, that the general provisions regarding accession by the bankrupt's estate, shall not apply where the nature of the legal relationship otherwise requires. Naturally, this exception leads to uncertainty regarding the legal situation in certain contractual relationships or individual agreements, but the uncertainty will in no way be greater than at present. The advantage with a general main rule is that clear justification is required in order for a type of agreement or an individual agreement to fall outside the scope of the common pattern.</p>
<p>Deviations from the rules set forth in the Company Reorganisation Act</p>
<p>On two points, deviations are proposed from the rules relating to company reorganisations.</p>
<p>The first point relates to the bankrupt's estate's liability for the utilisation of the other party’s premises or labour force. In SOU 1999:1, the Committee stated that the estate should be liable for resources used by the estate during the bankruptcy. However, the Committee proposes that there should be a transition period of one week before the estate becomes liable for a commercial lease agreement or an employment agreement. The reason is that a certain period of time is often required before the estate can assess whether it has use for the premises and the employees, and that the work might still not be conducted in an entirely efficient manner during the initial period of the bankruptcy. The Committee finds no reason to amend this proposal. However, no transition period should apply in conjunction with company reorganisations, where the focus is that the operations shall continue and where the debtor, which retains the management, often has planned the company reorganisation before it commenced.</p>
<p>The second point relates to the estate's accession to the debtor's purchases on credit subject to a right of repossession, and financial leasing agreements. In the event of company reorganisations, a deviation is made in this context from the fundamental rights in rem  approach through the proposal that the debtor may retain the property during the reorganisation if he demands performance and pays amounts which become due and payable during the reorganisation. The aim is that the debtor will obtain a moratorium at the same time as the risks of other party to the contract do not increase. In addition, it can be assumed that most company reorganisations are concluded within a few months. By contrast, a bankruptcy is often significantly more protracted. For this</p>
<p>reason, the other party to the contract should be able to terminate the agreement and repossess the goods unless the debtor, in conjunction with a demand for performance, also pays all amounts which became due and payable prior to the bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The existence of the agreement after the conclusion of the bankruptcy</p>
<p>Finally, it may be pointed out that the intention of rescuing an agreement in the long-term in the event of bankruptcy differs in a couple of respects from the situation with company reorganisation.</p>
<p>One difference is that, upon conclusion of the bankruptcy, the agreement must normally be transferred to a third party, something which generally requires the consent of the other party to the contract. In such circumstances, the third party then has the possibility to renegotiate the agreement.</p>
<p>Another difference is that the other party’s claims for payment for obligations performed prior to the bankruptcy remain insofar as such have not been covered by a dividend in the bankruptcy. Therefore, the issue arises whether the other party after the bankruptcy shall be entitled to terminate an agreement when bankruptcy claims remain unsatisfied. Such a right is of course not in question when pursuant to applicable contractual rules the debtor himself could have retained the part of the contract that the estate has acceded to, in spite of a breach related to another part (see e.g. sections 43, 44 and 56 Sale of Goods Act). In some contractual relations, especially lease, the debtor must fulfil all his duties to prevent termination (see e.g. chapter 12 section 42 of the Land Code). Here it would be surprising if the debtor after the bankruptcy – when the debtor is a physical person or a company which may be allowed to survive pursuant to proposals in SOU 1999:36 and 2001:1 provided its share capital has been restored – would be able to retain the lease without paying all remaining debt for which the debtor is still liable. Consequently, neither a third party, which has acquired the right from the estate, should escape liability for such debts. The counter argument, that a party succession has taken place and that both the debtor and a third party should be able to exercise the same right as the estate had, seems conceptual. The estate could as well be regarded to administer the debtor’s rights, albeit with an extra protection against termination in order to prevent the estate from being forced to pay debts arisen before the bankruptcy when the estate wants to retain an agreement during the bankruptcy (cf. CRA). With this approach the result will in practise be the same as today follows from chapter 12 sections 31 and 38 of the Land Code, since pur-</p>
<p>suant to said rules an assignee is liable for lease debts related to the time prior to the bankruptcy, no matter whether the estate has acceded to the contract or not. The Committee finds it inappropriate that the estate by an assignment could exploit an extra value of a contract and assumes therefore that the relevant contractual rules will come into force when the bankruptcy has ceased.</p>
