<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>We have been tasked with conducting a general review of the Population Registration Act (1991:481). We shall consider whether the provisions of the Act serve their purpose taking into consideration the information in the population register. According to the terms of reference, the review is to especially examine the following issues.</p>
<p>• How the current construction of personal identity numbers can be changed so that the need for more numbers can be met.</p>
<p>• How the system of coordination numbers works in practice.</p>
<p>• Whether the population register should continue to be connected to church parishes or whether a different solution should be chosen.</p>
<p>• Whether it would be appropriate to introduce legislation concerning ‘security marking’ of information in the population register database, and how  security-marked information should be treated in transfers to other agencies.</p>
<p>• Whether regulations concerning entering children with double residence in the population register are appropriate and compatible with the best interests of the child.</p>
<p>According to the supplementary terms of reference, we have been instructed to examine whether there is a need for special regulations, when entering EU citizens and their family members in the population register.</p>
<p>Our examination of the first two issues listed above was presented in our interim report in June 2008, SOU 2008:60</p>
<p>Personal Identity Numbers and Coordination Numbers . In this final report, we report the results of the general review and other issues.</p>
<h2>General starting points</h2>
<p>One important purpose of population registration is that various functions in society should have a correct basis for their decisions and other measures. The information in the population register should reflect the actual place of residence, identity and family law circumstances in order to provide functions in society with a correct basis for decisions and measures. A great deal of importance must be attached to this purpose in the design of the regulatory framework. This concerns, for instance, the issue of which persons should be registered in the population register and where in Sweden a person should be considered to be resident.</p>
<p>We have applied a number of controlling principles when assessing whether reasons exist to change the provisions of the Population Registration Act concerning the persons to be registered in the population register and on their correct place of residence. These provisions should be symmetrical as far as possible. Those covered by Swedish regulations to a great extent should be registered in the population register. Moreover, no importance should be attached to the wishes of the individual for population registration. Finally, the same regulations should apply for EU citizens and their family members as for other people.</p>
<p>Sweden has an obligation to apply the EC acquis communautaire including the Free Movement Directive . The Free Movement Directive contains the conditions that may be applied to EU citizens and their family members when they move between and stay in Member States. No review has been made of whether the provisions of the Population Registration Act are compatible with EC legal provisions since Sweden became a member of the EU. We have therefore analysed whether the Free Movement Directive contains provisions which may affect population registration and whether there are provisions in the Population Registration Act that conflict with the Free Movement Directive.</p>
<p>We consider that registration in the population register only of people who should be considered as being resident in Sweden in the sense intended in the Population Registration Act does not conflict with the Free Movement Directive. The provisions on establishing where in Sweden an individual should be considered as being resident, registration of births, marriages and deaths and the allocation of coordination numbers are, in our view, not covered by the Free Movement Directive.</p>
<p>The provisions of the Population Registration Act that entail administrative duties for the individual in connection with residence in Sweden are covered by the provisions of the Free Movement Directive. According to the provisions of the Free Movement Directive, the period of respite for registration of residence in Sweden should not be less than three months. We therefore propose that notification of moving to Sweden should be made at the latest three months after moving here. Otherwise, we do not consider that any changes are needed in the administrative procedure due to the Free Movement Directive.</p>
<p>In our view, it is not either in conflict with the Free Movement Directive that population registration serves as the basis for rights and obligations, provided that it is possible for the individual to confirm his or her entitlement to a benefit in another way than by being registered in the population register.</p>
<h2>Persons who are to be registered in the population register</h2>
<p>We have considered that the current rules on population registration when moving to Sweden largely serve their purpose and that no major changes are required. The praxis that a person shall be considered as regularly spending the night in a country where he or she in the normal course of life spends the night at least once a week or another organisation of time of the same extent should be covered by the legislation. We are also proposing certain changes in order for the provisions to better serve the purpose of population registration.</p>
<p>An alien who is obliged to have a residence permit shall not be registered in the population register if he or she does not have such a permit unless there are exceptional reasons for his or her none the less being registered in the population register. The requirement for a residence permit has been justified by the fact that an alien who is staying in Sweden without the necessary residence permit should not have access to those benefits that would ensue if he or she were registered in the population register.</p>
<p>A person who is covered by the regulations on the right to reside under Chapter 3 a, section 3 or 4 of the Aliens Act (2005:716) should be registered in the population register if he or she has such a right.This means that people at present may be registered in the population register who neither have a right to reside nor a residence permit and who accordingly are not entitled to stay in Sweden for more than three months. If a person who is registered in the population register does not have a right to reside, he or she does not either have a right to equal treatment with Swedish citizens after the initial three months in Sweden. When these individuals are registered in the population register, they will probably be given equal treatment to a great extent since a number of regulatory frameworks use population registration as a basis for qualification for entitlement to, for example, various benefits. We therefore propose that a person who is covered by the regulations on the right to reside under Chapter 3 a, section 3 or 4 of the Aliens Act should be registered in the population register if he or she has a right to reside. If the person does not have a right to reside he or she should be registered in the population register if there are exceptional reasons or if the person is required to have a residence permit and has one. It shall be possible for the Tax Agency to obtain a statement from the Migration Board on the right to reside. The Tax Agency shall also have direct access to information about the name, Swedish personal identity number and, when relevant, the coordination number, a certificate on the right to reside and the date of registration or application for a residence card. The information at the Tax Agency relating to population registration concerning the personal circumstances of an individual, which the agency has obtained from the Migration Board, shall be regarded as confidential if disclosure can be assumed to be detrimental to the individual or his or her next-ofkin.</p>
<p>Children born outside Sweden shall not be registered in the population register from birth. However, children born outside Sweden shall be registered in the population register if the child’s mother or father is registered in the population register as being stationed abroad on Swedish government service. If only the father is registered in the population register, he shall moreover have custody of the child.</p>
<p>A child which is adopted by a person who is stationed abroad on government service shall be registered in the population register if the adoption is valid in Sweden and the child is under 12 years of age. If the father or a parent under Chapter 1, section 9, of the Children and Parents Code, has been stationed abroad on government service, but does not have custody of the child from birth or by adoption, his or her child, which is born abroad, should be registered in the population register if the child can be considered as having sufficient links to Sweden. A child referred to in the above proposals need not have a residence permit or a right to reside to be registered in the population register.</p>
<p>In the assessment of whether an alien who needs a residence permit to stay in Sweden can no longer be considered as having his or her normal residence in Sweden, it shall be taken into account whether he or she lacks such a permit.</p>
<h2>The correct place of residence in the population register Parish replaced by municipal district</h2>
<p>Population registration has taken place for a long time in a territorial parish within the Church of Sweden. As long as the Church of Sweden administered the population register, it was natural for population registration to take place on the basis of the church’s territorial parishes. Since 1 January 2000, the Church of Sweden has decided on changes in the territorial parishes. Accordingly, the state no longer has any influence over the territorial division into parishes.</p>
<p>If population registration in a parish ceases, this has consequences in a number of areas. Information about the parish is currently used, inter alia, as a basis for administrative divisions, statistics and research. The activities of the Church of Sweden are furthermore based on the division into parishes and a change will therefore have major consequences for activities related to the Church. This applies, in particular to burials and burial fees, which the state is ultimately responsible for, but also collection of church fees. We have carried out a questionnaire survey to obtain knowledge, inter alia, about the extent to which division into parishes is actually used today and the consequences that may ensue from various changes.</p>
<p>The responses to this survey show that the need of the division into parishes applied by the Church of Sweden from time to time must now be considered as being relatively limited in a wider societal perspective. This need will also probably decrease apace with continuing mergers of parishes. However the result of the survey shows that there is a need of another corresponding division in the population registration, which is stable.</p>
<p>We consider that it is inappropriate on grounds of principle to base the country’s civil population registration on the internal division into organisational units of a religious denomination. This division has moreover become very unstable and more mergers of parishes can probably be anticipated. There are examples of divisions which are no longer suitable for civil conditions, for example when a parish extends over several municipalities. There is also a limited need of a division into parishes. In the light of this, we are therefore proposing that population registration should no longer take place in a territorial parish within the Church of Sweden. Population registration should take place according to the municipality as well as by building and apartment. The place of population registration shall be the municipality where the individual is registered in the population registration and the place of residence at birth shall be the municipality where the new-born child is to be registered in the population register.</p>
<p>We further propose that the National Land Survey should no longer include information about the Church of Sweden’s parishes in the property register with the register map but that the Church of Sweden should be responsible for reporting the division into parishes.</p>
<p>To meet the need of a stable division between properties and municipalities, we propose that a new division be introduced between property and municipality called a district. The geographic form of the district should be based on the division into parishes that applied in 1999/2000. The name of the districts shall be specially investigated by the National Land Survey in consultation with other agencies and organisations. The Government shall decide on the name of districts and on any changes in their names. Decisions on introducing districts and changing the geographic extent of districts shall be made by the Government. The exact geographic extent of the districts shall be specially investigated by the National Land Survey. The districts need not comply with property boundaries but they shall always comply with municipal boundaries. The national land surveys shall decide on changes of the district’s boundaries in the event of registration of properties over municipal boundaries. The National Land Survey shall draw up the layer of districts in the register map. The national and municipal land survey agencies shall update the register map in the event of changes in the districts. Information about districts shall be included in the address part of the property register and linked to the address of the site. Codes shall be allocated to the districts. Statistics Sweden shall, together with the Tax Agency and the National Land Survey, investigate how this is to take place. The codes for districts shall be available to the public.</p>
<p>Population registration should not be made according to districts. However, information about districts shall be registered in and be able to be notified from the population register database.</p>
<p>A person who is registered in the population register in a municipality or under the heading without known place of residence shall be provided with a burial plot at a public cemetery in the parish where the property at which he or she was last registered in the population register is located. A person who is registered in the population register in a municipality or under the heading without known place of residence shall pay the burial fee to the principal, unless it is a municipality, in whose administrative area, the person liable to pay the fee was last registered in the population register.</p>
<p>If individuals are no longer registered in the population register in a parish, the Church of Sweden must then provide the state with information about the division into parishes in such a way that this information can be linked to particular persons. The Tax Agency and the Church of Sweden shall be instructed to investigate in more detail the information needed to administer the burial fee and the church fee and how exchange of information is to take place to enable efficient collection of fees.</p>
<p>We consider that there should be a separate inquiry into the issue of how other activities currently based on the parishes of the Church of Sweden should be dealt with in future.</p>
<h2>The correct place of residence in the population registration</h2>
<p>The present basic structure shall be retained, namely that</p>
<p>• a person should be registered in the population register at the property and in the municipality where he or she is considered to live,</p>
<p>• a person who lives at a property which contains a number of apartments shall also be registered in the population register at the apartment,</p>
<p>• a person is considered to be resident at the property when he or she regular spends, or when a move to another apartment has taken place, can be assumed to regularly spend the night there, and</p>
<p>• a person is considered to regularly spend the night at a property where he or she spends the night at least once a week or another organisation of time of the same extent .</p>
<p>However, we propose that, with regard to the assessment for a person with double residence, that he or she be considered to be resident at the property where he or she, taking into consideration all circumstances, may be considered as having his or her normal residence. This assessment shall accordingly be made less stringent, and more flexible, so that it is not the case, as today, that it is largely only the place of residence of the family or the place of work for a person without a family, which is important. However, great importance shall still be attached to the family in considering where a person is regarded as being resident.</p>
<p>A new provision on population registration of persons who lack a known place of residence shall be included in the Population Registration Act. This provision shall make clear that population registration without a known place of residence may only be made if the person’s residence, applying other provisions, cannot be attributed to a municipality and the person cannot be assumed as having moved abroad.</p>
<p>Today, a stay of six months shall not lead to changed place of residence. This provision is important, in particular for single persons. For persons with a family, longer stays may entail an unchanged place of residence. The current provisions on exceptions from change of population registration in the event of temporary stays at another place entail a deviation from the principle that population registration shall show where a person is actually residing. For a person with a family, it may furthermore be the case that the information in the population register does not comply with the actual circumstances for a longer period of time. We have attempted to avoid this as far as possible, in order for the population register to serve its purpose. However it is reasonable that population registration is not changed during short periods of stay. A temporary stay of six months may in many cases be experienced as far too short. We propose that a period of residence decided in advance of at most a year shall not be considered to lead to changed population registration, regardless of whether a person has a family or not. We further consider that the provisions in the Population Registration Act, in the absence of strong reasons to do otherwise, should be the same for single and married persons. The special exception for time-defined periods of residence for people with families should therefore be removed.</p>
<p>The provision relating to members of parliament and government ministers should remain unchanged. However, exceptions for periods of residence due to appointment as a member of a committee or commission and for special appointments by the Riksdag should be removed.</p>
<p>A wholly new provision should be introduced concerning fulltime paid elected representatives in county councils. A period of residence due to an appointment of this kind shall not lead to a change of residence in the population register.</p>
<p>The provision that a period of residence solely due to service under the Total Defence Duty Act shall not be considered as leading to changed place of residence shall be removed.</p>
<p>The provisions concerning stays due to care at an institution for young people or for addicts have been slightly changed.</p>
<p>For a child living with special services under the Act concerning Support and Service for Persons with Certain Disabilities (LSS), this stay should not lead to a change of residence.</p>
<p>Persons living in residential facilities for the aged shall, as a main rule, be considered as being registered in the population register there. However, as exception no change shall be made in population registration if stay in a residential facility for the aged in another municipality than that where the individual is registered has been decided upon by the municipality where the person is registered.</p>
<h2>Population registration for children</h2>
<p>To facilitate the Tax Agency’s investigation in cases where the parents provide contradictory information on where a child is resident, special consideration is to be given, when determining where a child with double residence is considered to be resident, to whether there is a judgment with legal force or an agreement approved by the social welfare committee, which regulates the issue of a child’s custody, residence or access. If the child’s residence differs to a considerable extent from the content of the judgment or agreement, the judgment or agreement shall be disregarded.</p>
<p>Another proposal that we are making to facilitate investigation by the Tax Agency is that a child which lives equal amounts of time with both parents shall, when moving house, be considered to be resident at the parent whom the parents have reached agreement on.</p>
<p>A decision on population registration without prior notification of a change of address applies from and including the date of the decision. When notification of change of address for a child is rejected because it has not been signed by both parents and the Tax Agency decides on the child’s population registration after investigation of residence, this may lead to the child being registered in the population register a long time after move, which may be to the disadvantage of the parent with whom the child lives, who, during the intervening period, is deprived of certain allowances. To avoid these disadvantages, the same rules shall apply as in population registration after notification of a change of address in those cases where the decision on population registration has been notified without prior notification of change of address, i.e. the decision shall apply from the date of the move or from the date of notification.</p>
<p>A person with custody of a child shall have the right to appeal alone against a decision on the child’s population registration.</p>
<h2>Protection of persons</h2>
<p>On application, the Tax Agency shall make a notation in the population register that an individual or a next-of-kin of the individual may be exposed to threats or violence or suffer serious injury, i.e. that they have a need of protection. The individual may appeal against a refusal of such a request. The need for information on the need of protection shall be reviewed at the latest within three years of the date of registration. It shall be possible to appeal also against a decision to remove such information.</p>
<p>The Tax Agency should in its investigation on protection requirements obtain a statement from the police authority or another body that may be assumed to be able to provide information. However, no statutory regulation is proposed of what an application for a need of protection is to contain.</p>
<p>The Tax Agency shall, in cases concerning information on a need of protection, be able to decide to make a notation on a need of protection for the period until a decision has been notified on the matter, which has attained legal force.</p>
<p>A new secrecy provision is to be introduced, which is to apply to cases concerning information on a need of protection for information about an individual’s personal circumstances, if it is not clear that the information can be disclosed without the individual or a next-of-kin suffering injury.</p>
<p>An application for a child for information on a need of protection may be made by one custodian alone, if the purpose of the application is to protect against the other custodian.</p>
<p>The Tax Agency shall notify the social welfare committee when a decision on need of protection concerns a child under the age of 18.</p>
<p>The agencies by and large have good procedures for dealing with information on persons exposed to threats and who have therefore received a secrecy marking. However, from a number of quarters, we have been informed that deficiencies still occur. There do not seem to be any major deficiencies in the current statutory regulations, although deficiencies occur in application. No statutory changes are required to deal with the existing problems. All agencies should, however, review their procedures for dealing with this information.</p>
<h2>Other regulations Registration of information on others than persons in the population register</h2>
<p>One problem for many agencies today is that there is no central register which contains information about EU citizens who may be entitled to various benefits and which is available for all agencies in a simple way. Every agency may therefore need to request personal particulars which, for example, can confirm a person’s identity. The right to equal treatment of union citizens and their family members would be facilitated, also in cases when these persons stay in Sweden for less than a year, if the persons were registered in the population register database. Registration in the population register database would, among other things, mean that other authorities could obtain information in a simple way about whether the person was permanently resident in Sweden for a longer period than three months and that the person had the right of residence at the time of registration. This should mean that it would be simpler for the person in contacts with other agencies. We are therefore proposing that a person who is not registered in the population register but who has a right of residence stay shall, if the period of residence in Sweden is intended to be for a longer period than three months but for less than a year, notify his or her stay in Sweden to the Tax Agency. The Tax Agency shall be able to request that notification of registration is made in person. A decision on a registration case may be appealed against to the County Administrative Court in the County of Stockholm. Leave to appeal should be required for appeal to the Administrative Court of Appeal. The person registered shall be given a coordination number by the Tax Agency if he or she does not already have such a number or a personal identity number. A person who has notified his residence shall be obliged to provide the Tax Agency with information about change of address, also in connection with moving away from Sweden.</p>
<p>SPAR shall be able to contain information on persons who have been registered in the population register.</p>
<h2>Notifications</h2>
<p>Only the Tax Agency shall be able to accept notifications in population register matters.</p>
<p>A notification of a move to Sweden shall, in addition to the current provisions, contain information about any coordination number or personal designation which the person has received in another Nordic country.</p>
<p>A child born outside Sweden shall be notified for population registration only if the child is to be registered in the population registration by virtue of the special provisions that apply for children of people who are registered in the population register under section 14 of the Population Registration Act. This applies both to birth children and to adopted children. A child of a person registered in the population register under section 14 of the Population Registration Act which is not registered in the population register from birth, shall be notified to the population register when the child has a sufficient link with Sweden.</p>
<p>The Chief Guardian shall be instructed to provide information to the Tax Agency about when guardianship is arranged, altered or ceases. The secrecy that applies today for the Chief Guardian shall also apply to the Tax Agency’s population registration activity.</p>
<p>The estate of a deceased person may notify the Tax Agency of a special postal address to which post concerning the deceased can be sent if it differs from the previously registered address.</p>
<p>The obligation for the individual to leave information to the Tax Agency is expanded to also include certain information which under the Database Act may be included in the population register database. Changes of information previously registered shall be notified.</p>
<h2>Orders, conditional fines, punishments and appeal</h2>
<p>The special provision on sanctions in the Population Registration Act shall be repealed. The provisions on instructions and conditional fines in cases under the Names Act shall be transferred to the Names Act.</p>
<p>It should be clarified that if there are reasons to change a person’s population registration after reconsideration or appeal this shall be done, even if a new decision on population registration has been made after the decision first made.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<h2>Persons who are to be registered in the population register</h2>
<p>The requirement on the right of residence for population registration means that it can be assumed that the quality of the information in the population register will be improved and the outflow of public funds decrease. The proposal that it shall be possible to transfer information on the right of residence electronically between the Tax Agency and the Migration Board entails costs. In our view, it should be possible for the costs for a further development of the system to be met by the agency’s existing resources.</p>
<p>The proposal that a child born outside Sweden shall no longer be registered in the population register from birth means that the quality of the information in the population register is improved. This proposal facilitates the work of both the Tax Agency and the National Social Insurance Agency and should increase confidence in the population registration. We further consider that this proposal will entail cost savings for the state since the incorrect outflow of benefits will decrease. We consider that the proposal will have few consequences for the children and parents.</p>
<p>The proposal, that when considering whether an alien, who is required to have a residence permit to stay in Sweden, no longer can be considered as having his or her normal residence in Sweden, it shall be taken into account whether the alien has a residence permit or not, means that it will be possible to deregister more people from the population register than at present, who should not reasonably be registered in the population register. This primarily means savings for the state in the form of reduced expense for grants and other benefits. The consequences will be limited for the Tax Agency.</p>
<p>The proposal that the Migration Board’s obligation to provide information to the Tax Agency shall be expanded will mean an improvement in the quality of the information in the population register database. The new routines for transfer of information between agencies which must be produced can be co-ordinated with the work already in process between the agencies. The expanded provision of information should only lead to limited costs.</p>
<p>The proposals on population registration of children who are born or adopted by those stationed abroad mean that men and women will be treated equally which entails increased gender equality and equal treatment of all children of these persons. These proposals have no consequences for the Tax Agency or the National Social Insurance Agency.</p>
<h2>The correct place of residence in the population registration</h2>
<p>The proposals that population registration in the Church of Sweden’s parishes shall cease and that the state shall no longer administer division into parishes entails no extra costs for the state. The negative consequences of division into parishes no longer being provided by the civil society will be small, in particular in the light of our proposing a new more useful division, see more below. Our proposal will, of course, have major consequences for the Church of Sweden, whose entire activity is based on division into parishes, and for government activity linked to the Church of Sweden’s parishes, namely burials and collection of burial and church fees. The church estimates that the proposals would entail adjustment costs and subsequent annual costs. For the Tax Agency, the proposal will entail costs for systemic changes. We consider that the consequences of both the Tax Agency and the church can be alleviated by the very generous implementation provisions that we propose.</p>
<p>The fact that the place of population registration and the place of residence at birth currently consist of a parish entails certain problems, mainly that the places may have Christian names, which is removed. The proposals on burials and burial fees for persons who are registered in the population register in a municipality and those who lack a known place of residence have small consequences.</p>
<p>The districts which will replace the parishes will, with the design we propose, be considerably cheaper to administer for the state. Initially, the introduction of the districts will, however, entail an adjustment cost, in particular for the Tax Agency but also for the National Land Survey, to adjust the old parish boundaries after changes in municipal boundaries. The proposals may also have other positive consequences, in particular preservation of the important cultural heritage represented by the parishes and former parishes. We consider that many activities which use the division into parishes today can change to using a division into districts. There may be costs initially although it will in time entail savings for these users.</p>
<p>All in all, the proposal that population registration in the Church of Sweden’s parishes should cease and the introduction of districts will entail major savings for the National Land Survey and the regional land survey agencies. For the Tax Agency, the proposal will mean savings for the population registration through it not being necessary to respond to changes in division into parishes. However, it will necessitate systemic changes in the operation of the population register as well as in performing the task of collecting fees for the Church of Sweden. The costs of collecting fees vary, however, depending on the information which can be obtained from the Church of Sweden. If the Burials Commission proposes changes with regard to the burial fee, this may also affect the costs, so that these will be lower.</p>
<p>Our proposals with regard to population registration of children will facilitate processing by the Tax Agency. Furthermore, the legal situation will be better adapted to the general conception of justice. The improved opportunities for appeal will mean more cases for the courts, although we do not believe that this will entail a more substantial increase. As regards our proposals otherwise on changes in the provisions on place of residence in the population register, these only affect small groups of people and the consequences will therefore be limited.</p>
<h2>Protection of persons</h2>
<p>The introduction of information on the need of protection entails costs to register a new item of information in the population register database. Costs will also be incurred by other authorities who wish to be able to receive and register this information.</p>
<p>The possibility of appealing against a refusal will entail an increased flow of cases to the county administrative courts. However, it is not probable that a large number of cases will be appealed against, and the costs will thereby be negligible. This is an important change which will lead to increased legal security for the individual.</p>
<h2>Other regulations</h2>
<p>Our proposal to introduce special provisions on registration of persons covered by the Free Movement Directive, but who are not registered in the population register, means that the situation of these people in Sweden will be made easier which in turn will mean that Sweden will better comply with its undertakings under EC law than is currently the case. This proposal does not mean any costs in this part. However, the Tax Agency must register information on the right to reside which entails costs for changes in the IT systems.</p>
<p>The proposal that only the Tax Agency should be able to receive notifications of moves does not entail any cost increases.</p>
<p>The proposal that the Chief Guardians shall notify the Tax Agency when guardianship is arranged, altered or ceases , entails certain costs for the Chief Guardian and for the Tax Agency. The Tax Agency’s cost will consist of adjusting its IT system to make it possible to register new information.</p>
<p>We also propose that an estate of a deceased person may notify a special postal address for the deceased to the Tax Agency. This proposal means no extra costs.</p>
<p>The proposal to repeal the special provision on sanctions means that it will be possible to use the conditional fine as a means of applying pressure on those who do not comply with their obligations under the Population Register Act and an adaptation to the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>We propose that the main part of the provisions entailing that a parish is replaced by a district and municipality come into force on 1 January 2015. The proposal concerning information on the need of protection will come into force on 1 January 2013. Our other legislative proposals will come into force on 1 January 2012.</p>
