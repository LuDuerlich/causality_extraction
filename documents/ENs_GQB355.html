<p>The IT bill, an Information Society for all  was a clear initiative from the Swedish Government to develop and stimulate the establishment of a new IT infrastructure. The bill clearly identified the goal that Sweden should be the first nation to be an information society for all. It also states the motives for the establishment of an open national broadband backbone network. In a decision on August 17, 2000 the Swedish Government commissioned Svenska kraftnät (the Swedish National Grid) to undertake the construction of such a national network on strictly commercial terms. The instruction was to provide network capacity based only on so called dark fibre and to complete the task before the end of year 2002. However, since the commission was given, the conditions have drastically changed and Svenska kraftnät have declared to the Government that they will not, under current circumstances, be able to fulfil their task.</p>
<p>On November 29, 2001 the Swedish Government decided to appoint a committee (dir 2001:99) with the task to contribute to the create conditions so that the main city of all municipalities could be connected to the national backbone network in accordance with the commission to Svenska kraftnät. The task for the committee has been to re-use any existing networks, to rely on existing subsidiaries and any other resources and if necessary, investigate if alternatives to dark fibre from Svenska kraftnät could be used, such as dark fibre from other owners of networks, optical wavelengths, transmission other broadband transmission services or wireless solutions.</p>
<p>We propose that Svenska kraftnät should fulfil their commission. However, due to changes in the marketplace we consider it both reasonable and necessary to change the conditions for their commission. We have studied several measures that can be taken.</p>
<p>In summary I propose the following measures:</p>
<p>N  Svenska kraftnät should fulfil their commission to establish en national backbone network</p>
<p>N  The limitation that the network should provide only dark fiber should be eased and that cooperation with Banverket should be possible</p>
<p>N  The timetable for completion of the network should be extended to December 31, 2004.</p>
<p>N  The backbone network need not be connected to the main city of the municipality. Instead, the connection can be made through cooperation with the regional networks within the municipality.</p>
<p>N  The government should not request any return on invested capital from Svenska kraftnät for the capital that pertain to the fibre business for the period 2002 – 2006. Before the end of that period it should be taken into consideration whether lowered return on invested capital should be requested also for the years to come, or if normal return should be requested, or even if a higher return should be requested, depending on the situation in the market place at that time and expected level of investments.</p>
