<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Our remit</h2>
<p>Our remit can be divided into two parts. The first part deals with the right to royalties that authors have in certain cases when a copy of an original work of art is resold after the first transfer (resale right). The background to this is that the Riksdag has announced that certain issues concerning resale rights should be reconsidered. Accordingly, we have been instructed to analyse and decide whether an expanded obligation to report the sale of a work of art should be introduced for persons who are required to pay royalties, and whether new control and penalty measures should be introduced to ensure payment of royalties. The remit includes analysing whether the present regulations on resale rights affect competition in the art market, and determining whether a different way of calculating or paying the royalty should be used, compared with today.</p>
<p>The second part of the remit pertains to a provision concerning copyrights. Certain issues, such as the scope of the provision, were highlighted in connection with the implementation of an EU directive in the area of copyrights. Since, when implementing the directive, there was a lack of preparatory material, it was decided that these issues should be considered at a later date. We have been instructed to consider whether the opportunity available to archives and libraries to produce and disseminate copies of works for certain special purposes should be expanded to also include institutions other than libraries and archives. The terms of reference also identify a number of consequential and specific issues.</p>
<p>Below is a summary of our proposals and assessments. Our positions on issues concerning resale rights are presented first, after which we turn to the issues concerning production and dissemination of copies within the activities of certain institutions.</p>
<h2>Resale rights</h2>
<p>There is a need for reform</p>
<p>We have followed up and examined how the provisions on resale rights have worked in practice. Experiences of the practical application show that resale rights are established in the Swedish art market and that the provisions have contributed to realising the aim of the act in a relatively positive way. However, in certain areas we consider that the legislation could be more effective and appropriate. Firstly, there is a need for the collecting organisation to have access to more effective legal tools to obtain reports. Secondly, the right of the organisation to access records underlying reports must be clarified. Thirdly, there is a need to improve the opportunities for the organisation to identify the actors towards whom it is to direct its claims concerning reports. Furthermore, the minimum amount for the right to royalties should be reconsidered.</p>
<p>Stricter accountability</p>
<p>Resale rights are managed collectively by an organisation that represents a number of authors whose works in the area are used in Sweden. The act therefore contains regulations concerning accountability under which the person obliged to pay royalties must, at the request of the organisation, report sales on which royalties are due that were made during the last three calendar years. However, in practice it has only been possible to assert the right to receive reports to a limited degree. We propose several measures to expand and tighten up accountability.</p>
<p>Expanded accountability</p>
<p>Under current regulations, the requirements concerning reporting and payment obligations coincide. One problem with this is that the organisation usually cannot show that a sale on which royalties are due has occurred without access to the records. Therefore, in practice, the organisation cannot assert its right to access the records. We propose that the reporting obligation be expanded by removing the requirement concerning an obligation to pay. This will mean that those who operate professionally in the art market as sellers, purchasers or intermediaries will be obliged to report to the organisation on the basis of their professional capacity, regardless of whether or not they have participated in a sale that entails an obligation to pay a royalty.</p>
<p>Sales of works of art are to be reported without the need for a request</p>
<p>Under current law, reports are to be provided at the organisation’s request. Accordingly, the person obliged to pay royalties can wait to report a sale until the organisation requests they do so, regardless of how many works of art he or she sells or purchases, or for which he or she acts as an intermediary. However, the organisation is not usually aware that a work of art has been sold. We propose that a person who is professionally active in the art market as a seller, purchaser or intermediary be obliged to report sales on which royalties are due made during the previous calendar year by 1 April each year. If no sales on which royalties were due were made, information to this effect is to be stated in the report.</p>
<p>Clarifying the right of the organisation to access records underlying reports</p>
<p>We propose that the organisation be entitled to examine receipts and other records underlying reports. This will help clarify the extent to which the reporting obligation extends under current EU law. If, in an individual case, the organisation shows circumstances that give reason to assume that the report does not correctly represent the sales that have occurred, or if for some other reason it is necessary to ensure payment of the royalties, the organisation is to have the right to examine the documents upon which the report is based.</p>
<p>The obligation to report will be limited in time</p>
<p>We propose that the obligation to report is to cease if the organisation does not request a report within three years after the end of the calendar year that the report was to cover. The same limit is to apply if the organisation requests access to background documents.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s view of other control and penalty measures</p>
<p>During the course of its work, the Inquiry has considered other control and penalty measures. Examples include regulations concerning penalties for those who do not report sales on which royalties are due and control options based on the participation of an auditor. We consider that there is currently no need of such intrusive measures.</p>
<p>The threshold for the right to royalties will be raised</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes raising the threshold for the right to royalties. A right to royalties will only exist if the sale price excluding value added tax exceeds one tenth of the price base amount. In 2014, this corresponds to SEK 4 400.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s view of two issues concerning competition</p>
<p>The first issue concerning competition pertains to how the royalty is paid. Under current regulations, certain professional dealers may be forced to pay two royalties for the same work of art; first when the work is purchased and then when it is resold. We consider that this gives those who sell on commission a certain competitive advantage compared with dealers. However, we should wait for an evaluation by the European Commission before deciding whether legislation should be changed to create better conditions for effective competition in the area.</p>
<p>The second issue concerning competition pertains to how the royalty is calculated. More precisely, the issue deals with the fact that auction houses pay royalties based on the purchase price for the purchaser excluding commission (hammer price), while art and antique dealers pay royalties based on the full sale price. Our assessment is that the current application of the provisions give auction houses a certain competitive advantage compared with art and antique dealers. However, the issue of how the relevant concept in EU law should be interpreted is a question of application of the law. This matter should not be regulated in national legislation.</p>
<h2>Production and dissemination of copies within the activities of certain institutions</h2>
<p>We now move on to the issues concerning the right of certain institutions to produce and disseminate copies. The relevant provisions are found in Section 16 of the Act on Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works (1960:729). Below is a summary of our proposals.</p>
<p>The provision in Section 16 of the Act on Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works should also cover certain museums</p>
<p>Under current law, state and municipal archive authorities, research libraries and technical libraries that are operated by public authorities, as well as public libraries, may produce copies of works for certain purposes, namely (1) for preservation, supplementation or research, (2) to meet borrowers’ requests for individual articles, short excerpts or other material which, for security reasons, should not be made available in the original, or (3) for use in reading devices. We propose that the provision in Section 16 of the Act on Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works be expanded to cover the central museums, the regional and municipal museums, and other museums if these are operated by public authorities.</p>
<p>A new provision should be introduced</p>
<p>However, the proposal to allow the museums to freely carry out the acts now specified in Section 16 of the Act on Copyright in</p>
<p>Literary and Artistic Works does not meet one of the museums’ basic needs, namely to reproduce works of art in digital catalogues which are needed to maintain an overview and to manage the collections. We therefore propose introducing a new provision in Section 16, second paragraph of the Act on Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works. The provision will give the central museums, the regional and municipal museums, and other museums if these are operated by public authorities, the right to produce copies for the purpose of internal documentation.</p>
<p>Clarifying that copies may not be made for the purpose of making a profit</p>
<p>We propose that it be clarified that producing and disseminating copies pursuant to Section 16 of the Act on Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works may not occur for the purpose of making a profit. This will clarify the existing requirements under EU law.</p>
<p>The collective licence provision in Section 42d of the Act on Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works should be expanded</p>
<p>We propose expanding the collective licence provision in Section 42d of the Act on Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works to cover the central museums, the regional and municipal museums, and other museums if these are operated by public authorities.</p>
<p>Greater opportunities for museums to present film or stage works</p>
<p>We propose that the central museums, the regional and municipal museums, and other museums if these are operated by public authorities, should be able to freely present film or stage works that are part of their own collections using technical aids intended for individual visitors.</p>
<h2>Entry into force, etc.</h2>
<p>We propose that the new provisions enter into force on 1 July 2015. They are to apply to works and performances that originated prior to the entry into force. If a resale of an original work of art has occurred prior to the entry into force, older provisions shall still apply. The new regulations concerning accountability shall be applied even in the case of a resale that occurred prior to the entry into force.</p>
