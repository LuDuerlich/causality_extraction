<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The final task of the Survey is, among other things, to analyse whether the present division between area concessions and line concessions, and its connection with the rules for tariff setting and reporting are suitable for the creation of purpose-oriented, operationally reliable and cost-effective electricity networks and, should this not be the case, to propose measures for it. We shall also consider the conclusions that are drawn when analysing the electricity market and which are relevant for the proposal for extended concession requirements for natural gas markets that have been advanced by the Electricity and Gas Market Survey.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have through supplementary directives been given a number of new tasks. One of these is to analyse whether decisions on permit issues should be appealed against to the administrative court instead of to the government, and possibly submit a proposal for a change in court hierarchy. The Survey shall also consider whether network concessions can be associated with the possibility for review instead of being limited by time. Finally, the Survey shall analyse whether the present regulations for the permit review of a network concession for line are appropriate for structural changes in the existing power line network and possibly propose suitable measures.</p>
<p>The Survey’s concluding report contains an introduction in which the current regulations and preconditions for the Survey work in general are described (Chapter 1). After this, the Survey gives an account of the current regulations in Norway, Denmark, Finland and Germany. In Chapters 3–8, the questions listed above are taken up in consecutive order. Chapters 9 and 10 deal with proposals concerning the coming into effect of the proposed regulations as well as economic and other consequences. After this, the Survey gives an account of the most important proposals in these chapters.</p>
<h2>Demarcation of area and line concessions (Chapter 3)</h2>
<p>Chapter 2 of the Electricity Act contains regulations that concern network concessions. A network concession for a line (line concession) concerns a power line with a basically predetermined route and is for the most part applicable in the case of lines carrying a higher voltage, usually in the National Grid or in regional lines. A network concession for an area (area concession) does not concern a specific line but entitles the holder, within a specified area and without special review, to build lines that are included in the local transmission network.</p>
<p>An area concession may only be granted if the area – bearing in mind the network activities – comprises a suitable unit. The area may not completely or partially coincide with another concession area, and in this decision a highest permissible voltage shall be specified for the network.</p>
<p>As the Survey shows, It is not always easy to determine which voltage can be assumed to be needed during a network company’s concession period. With the Survey’s proposal that an area network concession should apply until further notice (see Chapter 5), special consideration shall be given to the voltage that may be assumed to be needed in order to run the network for a reasonably foreseeable period of time.</p>
<p>The Survey proposes that the provisions of the Electricity Act, that a highest permissible voltage for the power line network shall be specified in a decision on an area network concession, should be supplemented by regulations to the effect that in choosing the highest permissible voltage, consideration should be given to the voltage that may be considered necessary in order to run the network, to the environment given a future extension of the network, the securing of a socio-economically motivated extension and the consequences for the customers effected.</p>
<p>During permit assessment for an area concession, it is not decided where and how a line shall be installed. This is the reason why it is not necessary to conduct an environmental impact assessment (EIA) when applying for an area concession. For construction within the framework of an area concession, an EIA shall be conducted to the extent that it is necessary for the case in question, whereas an EIA shall always be included in an application for a line network concession.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the performance of an EIA is generally an expensive procedure and gives rise to a delay in the permit process for the applicant. It is therefore important that the need for the performance of an EIA, as is the case with the construction of a network subject to an area concession, should only be enforced where it is especially important.</p>
<p>The Survey feels that overhead power lines with a voltage of up to and including 50 kV, and buried cables of up to and including 130 kV, do not often entail any particular impact on the environment. Within the specified voltage range, it is not the line voltage that is the determining factor as to whether there is deemed to be an impact on the environment, but rather the nature of the surroundings through which the lines are planned to pass. We therefore propose that the demand for the inclusion of an EIA in the application for a network concession for a line should be removed for the voltage range in question and be replaced by a provision that the County Administrative Board concerned, within the framework for consultation in accordance with the Environmental Code, should determine whether or not an EIA needs to be conducted.</p>
<h2>Network tariffs and the reporting of network activities (Chapter 4)</h2>
<p>The principal question in Chapter 4 concerns the overall account of a network concession for an area together with lines that are covered by a network concession for a line. The present wording in § 11 of the Reporting Ordinance states that a line which is covered by a network concession for a line, and which is entirely located within the concession area, shall, if the line is included technically and organisationally in the area, be reported together with the area network concession.</p>
<p>The ruling of § 11 of the Reporting Ordinance has been applied and interpreted in different ways by electricity network companies, since it is these companies that decide which lines are to be reported together.</p>
<p>The Survey’s proposal aims, within the framework of the basic principles of the Electricity Act, to better adapt the regulations on reporting and the structure of the network tariffs to the current conditions for electricity network activities.</p>
<p>We propose that the regulations be introduced into the Electricity Act in order to provide clearer statutory support at the same time as the regulations be extended and clarified partly through new wording.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the network authority be given the possibility, after an application from the concession holder, through decision, to allow collective reporting in cases other than those that can be deduced from the present wording in § 11 of the Reporting Ordinance and the revisions in the regulation that the Survey proposes. Collective reporting based on the network authority’s decision means that the functions of the lines in the electricity network will have greater importance for how the lines are reported, which will in turn be important in determining which rules are to be applied with respect to the structure of the network tariffs. The structure of the network tariffs for customers whose facilities are connected to a certain line will in these cases be more dependent on what function the line in question has in the concession holder’s network rather than the type of concession that has been specified for the line.</p>
<p>For the concession holder, this means a simpler and clearer structure of the network tariffs in the concession holder’s collected network activities. For customers, the proposal means that the same tariff setting will be applied for the customer category concerned, irrespective of whether the customer’s facility is connected to a line that is covered by a network concession for a line or an area.</p>
<p>In the changeover to collective reporting, the network tariffs may be influenced in an increasing or decreasing direction for different customer categories. In order to avoid excessively large and farreaching changes being made directly, it is proposed that the network authority should be able to decide on a transitional (interim) period of up to and including five years for the application of an integrated network tariff structure.</p>
<p>The provisions of the Electricity Act concerning the structure of the network tariffs mean that the latter shall be distance-independent for all customers on a local and regional network level. For incoming supply customers connected to regional lines, however, the concession holder may apply distance-dependent network tariffs. The proposal of the Electricity Network Survey on new regulations for collective reporting may have an impact on the conditions governing which regulations are to be applied with respect to the structure of the network tariffs. However, these consequences may be considered to be compatible with the basic principles for network tariff design and cost balancing in the Electricity Act. The Survey therefore proposes that no changes be made regarding the regulations.</p>
<h2>Period of network concession validity (Chapter 5)</h2>
<p>A network concession is granted for a certain predetermined period – 40 years in the case of a line concession and 25 years for an area concession. Should there be any special reasons, or the applicant requests it, a shorter period of time can be prescribed. Subject to an application by the concession holder, the period of network concession validity can then be extended for a further 40 and 25 years respectively. In principle, the same assessment shall then be made as for an application for a new concession. The Survey has been tasked with analysing whether the permit can be reviewed instead of being limited by time.</p>
<p>As regards the review of area network concessions, it can be stated in general that the network authority has normally been able to grant a renewed concession without factual assessment having given cause for serious consideration. The Survey feels that if there is a need for changes to be made in the distribution network for electricity for reasons concerning, for example the structure of energy policy or a change in the energy system, it would probably be relatively ineffective to utilise the review institute. There should be other courses of action that give faster results since reviews of area network concessions are made at twenty-five-year intervals. To this shall be added the fact that such structural reasons do not carry the same weight for area concessions as for line concessions since the public do not have any direct influence over how the network concession holder routes the lines within the concession area.</p>
<p>We propose, therefore, that the regulation that area network concessions should be granted for a specific period of time be deleted and replaced by a ruling to the effect that area network concessions should remain valid until further notice. In the opinion of the Survey, the current ruling in the Electricity Act and in the Act on the special administration of certain electrical installations gives sufficient opportunity for the review of an area concession, should such review be necessary because the concession holder failed to fulfil his undertakings.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the Survey, there is good reason – with a similar motivation as that presented in the case of area network concessions – to propose that line network concessions should also be made valid until further notice. A proposal on these lines, however, should be supplemented by the expressly stated option to review a granted network concession. We therefore propose that network concessions for lines shall as a general rule of thumb apply until further notice. During an initial forty-year period, the network authority will only be able to review the network concession in accordance with the regulations that already apply today for the review of a network concession during a current period of validity. Once this forty-year period has expired, the reasons for review or reassessment will be broadened and more parties will have the opportunity to request a review.</p>
<p>The first assessment made by the network authority will thus be, on request, to assess whether or not a review procedure should be initiated. The justification as to why the network authority should initiate a review procedure for a network concession shall be that there is a need for socio-economic reasons, for the network concession holder’s business economic reasons or for reasons of the type stipulated in Chapters 2–4 of the Environmental Code, i.e. environmental, outdoor recreational or cultural reasons. A local authority or county administrative board or network concession holder shall be able to apply for the review of a line network concession when forty years have elapsed since the concession was granted. It shall also be possible for the network authority to initiate a review on its own initiative.</p>
<p>If the network authority has decided to initiate a review procedure for an existing network concession, the assessment shall be based in this second stage on the grounds that may exist for the decision to initiate a review procedure and to a large extent on those regulations that are applied in connection with an application for a new line network concession.</p>
<h2>Concession decision for structural changes (Chapter 6)</h2>
<p>A basic prerequisite for the granting of a network concession is that the facility is suitable from a general point of view. A suitability assessment of this type normally comes into question in the case of a network concession for a line. An application for a line concession shall, among other things, contain information on the transmission demand that the line is intended to satisfy. At the time of application, it is assumed that the applicant has examined and prepared the matter to such a level of detail that the technical structure of the line and the principal route alternatives have been established.</p>
<p>Concession assessment is thus basically made on the basis of the preconditions for each individual line. However, in the case of major structural changes several power line projects may be dependent on each other for implementation. As an example, mention can be made of the Stockholms Ström project, where Svenska kraftnät was commissioned by the Government to study the design of the future 70–400 kilovolt power line network in the Stockholm region.</p>
<p>The Survey has been given the task of assessing whether the current regulations for permit assessment for a line network concession are suitable in the case of structural changes in the existing power line network..</p>
<p>In our opinion, it is likely that similar structural changes in the electricity network as those in Stockholm will be made in other cities in Sweden. The Survey concludes that, as with major road and rail projects, it is in the interest of all parties to have the permissibility of a structural change clarified at an early stage. A change is also dependent on the fact that the entire project can be implemented so that it will be possible to remove those lines that are proposed to be removed. There is also a certain amount of uncertainty in today’s regulations in that all the previous work could prove to be unusable if the final project applied for in a structural change process is rejected.</p>
<p>We therefore propose that in a structural change of the electricity network, a permissibility assessment should be conducted in line with the Electricity Act. The assessment should cover the structural change project in its entirety. Once the Government has decided that a certain project is permitted, the network authority shall administer the permit question in the individual parts of the project in accordance with the customary concession rules for line. The assessment conducted by the network authority shall then be restricted to those issues that have not been assessed by the Government.</p>
<p>An application for permissibility assessment shall contain an EIA. The regulations for permissibility assessment are co-ordinated with the regulations for line concessions in the introductory regulations in Chapter 2 of the Electricity Act.</p>
<h2>Appeals, etc. (Chapter 7)</h2>
<p>A permit (concession) is required from the Government in order to be allowed to construct or use a high-voltage electrical power line. However, the Government can authorise the network authority to examine questions in a network concession that do not concern a foreign connection. This means that the network authority’s decision in a concession case, for example on the granting and transfer of a network concession and a change in the boundaries for an area network concession, shall be appealed against to the Government.</p>
<p>Other decisions made by the network authority shall be appealed against to the general administrative court in accordance with the Electricity Act. The Network Authority is entitled to act as a party in court and to appeal against a ruling of the court which has meant that the ruling of the network authority has been factually changed. The Survey has been tasked with analysing whether decisions on permit matters should be appealed against to the administrative court instead of to the Government.</p>
<p>The revision of a decision pursuant to the Electricity Ordinance or the Electricity Act could involve a weighing between the interest of the network concession holder to conduct his activities and the interest of some other interested party in not being affected by the activities for, for example, financial or environmental reasons.</p>
<p>We do not consider, however, that the scope for discretionary assessments should be deemed to so prominent that they should be attributed decisive importance in the matter of whether the Government or the administrative court should retry the network authority’s decision. Nor do we recognise any decisive need for the Government to be able to influence the judgement of how different interests should be weighed against each other in current matters relating to the Electricity Act and the Electricity Ordinance. It should be possible for these assessments and the weighing up of stakeholder interests to be handled in a secure way by the general administrative courts.</p>
<p>This also applies in the opinion of the Survey to decisions regarding line network concessions. In previous considerations on this matter, it has been stated that questions in connection with line network concessions should be appealed against to the Government, since the grounds for appeal, which now concern application of the Environmental Code, largely concern suitability assessments. We consider, however, that it should also be possible for these questions to be handled by the administrative courts. An appeal against a granted network concession for a line also includes, for example, questions such as whether the applicant, from an economic and administrative point of view, is suitable to be approved as a network concession holder. Furthermore, the appeal involves assessing whether the applicant, from a financial and administrative point of view, is suitable for approval as a network concession holder.</p>
<p>The Survey thus feels that there is every reason why the present court hierarchy should be changed and that the cases in question should instead be appealed against to the general administrative court. Excluded from the first paragraph are decisions by the network authority pursuant to the current Section 2, § ? 2 and 4 of the Electricity Ordinance according to which appeals should continue to be made to the Government.</p>
<p>Our proposal means that in principle all appealable decisions of the network authority shall in future be referred to the County Court as the first court of appeal. Rulings or decisions by the County Court shall be appealed against to the Administrative Court of Appeal, but this requires leave to appeal in order for it to be possible. The Supreme Administrative Court will be the final court of appeal, but this also requires leave to appeal.</p>
<h2>Concessions for natural gas (Chapter 8)</h2>
<p>The Natural Gas Act covers regulations concerning concessions for natural gas lines, but other applicable legislation also applies, irrespective of whether or not the line is subject to concession (e.g. Environmental Code, the Planning and Building Act, etc.).</p>
<p>The principle ruling of the Natural Gas Act means that a natural gas line may not be built or utilised without a permit (concession) from the Government. A concession shall normally be granted for 40 years. However, a concession is not needed for a natural gas line that is located after a metering and regulation (MR) station).</p>
<p>The Electricity and Gas Marketing Survey proposed in 2004 that exemption from the concession requirement for natural gas lines located after an MR station should be abolished and that an area concession should be introduced for natural gas networks. The survey has been tasked with analysing this proposal for extended concession demand and shall in this context consider the conclusions that are drawn in the analysis of the division of concessions on the electricity market.</p>
<p>Our opinion, however, is that there is no need to introduce an area concession for a distribution network for natural gas. The new legislation that now applies in the area imposes clear and extensive demands on a network owner’s activities even when the lines are operated without a concession. The legal obligations cover the responsibility of the network owner for operation, maintenance and expansion of the gas line network, as well as the financial accounting, connection of lines and transmission of gas. The network owner is also responsible for drawing up a monitoring plan and for reporting measures taken on the basis of this plan. In the Survey’s opinion there are therefore ample opportunities for monitoring the activities of a network company without having to introduce advance review.</p>
<p>We feel that those problems which the proposal for area concessions was intended to solve should be fundamentally approached by other means. It should be possible for the potential problems to be solved within the framework of the current regulations. The Survey proposes only one change in the regulations, which concerns the demarcation of concession requirements for natural gas lines.</p>
<p>The purpose of a distribution network, to supply end users with natural gas, was the original motive for the exemption from concession obligation. This was subsequently equated with the location of the lines after an MR station. However, this connection has proved to be unclear, and can therefore be questioned.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Survey proposes an amendment of the Natural Gas Act to the effect that a concession should not be needed for a natural gas line the main use of which is to transmit natural gas to end users within a certain delimited geographical area.</p>
<p>Natural gas lines for which concessions are not needed according to current regulations should also continue to be exempted from the need for a concession.</p>
<h2>Coming into effect and interim regulations (Chapter 9)</h2>
<p>The Energy Network Survey proposes a number of changes to the current legislation for electricity and natural gas. The Survey feels there is no reason why the proposed changes in legislation should not come into effect within the not too distant future. It should also be possible for the proposed changes to come into effect at one and the same time, but with certain interim regulations. Altogether, the proposed conditions should be able to come into force on 1 July 2010.</p>
<h2>Economic impact and other consequences (Chapter 10)</h2>
<p>The Survey proposes a number of changes in the regulations for permits to build and use high-voltage electrical power lines. A change is also proposed in connection with the permit requirement for natural gas lines.</p>
<p>In many cases, the proposals mean more a redistribution of resources between areas of activity than a change in the demand for resources in the activities concerned. Therefore, the overall con- sequences of the Survey’s proposals could be considered to be fairly reasonable. We submit an overview of the changes in the utili- zation of resources as well as other consequences that may be assumed to occur as a consequence of the proposals.</p>
<p>Several of the proposals will lead in our opinion to less of a demand for resources, reduced costs and a decrease in time consumption for authorities and network concession holders. The proposal that the appeal regulations should be changed so that cases which are administered and ruled on by the network authority in accordance with Chapter 2 of the Electricity Act shall be appealed against at the general administrative court will in our opinion lead to demands for a miner strengthening of resources at the County Court con- cerned, while there will be a corresponding decrease in resource requirements on the part of the Government.</p>
