<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit is to examine issues relating to central government debt policy and to analyse the government bonds market in terms of the way in which it functions and the role it plays for financial stability. The remit can be divided into two parts. The first deals with how the government bonds market – and hence the Government’s ability to borrow and conduct central government debt policy – may be affected if central government debt declines. It also includes an analysis of how forthcoming regulatory requirements in the financial markets may affect the demand for government bonds. The second part consists of a more general overview of central government borrowing and debt management and encompasses a range of issues. For example, we consider the provisions in the Budget Act (2011:203) regarding central government borrowing and debt management and present proposals on how these can be adapted to other parts of the Act. We also review the process for the control of central government debt management, as well as liquidity management by the Swedish National Debt Office (the Debt Office). The Inquiry’s conclusions from both parts of its study are presented below.</p>
<h2>Opens the way for borrowing in excess of requirements A new borrowing purpose</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes the introduction of a new borrowing purpose in the Budget Act, allowing the Government, after special authorisation from the Riksdag, to raise loans for central government for the purpose of ensuring good borrowing preparedness. On the</p>
<p>Inquiry’s assessment, such borrowing in excess of requirements could be conducted at limited cost and risk.</p>
<p>The backdrop to the Inquiry’s standpoint is that central government debt has declined since the mid-1990s and it is not impossible that this trend will continue if current budget policy ambitions remain as they are. A low level of central government debt is basically positive for Sweden. However, it poses new challenges for central government debt policy, as a small central government debt and low borrowing requirement could lead to the disappearance of established markets and borrowing channels.</p>
<p>There is a close link between the primary market for bonds in which central government borrows and the secondary market in which financial actors mainly operate. A well-functioning secondary market is essential if central government is to have access to efficient borrowing channels in the Swedish market. If turnover and liquidity in the secondary market decline, price formation in the market will deteriorate. This will lead to more volatile prices and increased uncertainty for all actors. In the long term, this will have knock-on effects for central government in the form of increased borrowing costs (all other things being equal) and greater difficulties attracting investors.</p>
<p>If there were a period in which the borrowing requirement became so low that central government completely stopped issuing bonds, the nature of the market would probably change. The market makers would disappear, since this system builds on the Debt Office’s primary dealer agreements. Trade in outstanding bonds would decline sharply and would probably take place via brokered deals, i.e. without an intermediary temporarily taking on the owner’s role. Swedish government bonds would become illiquid and the investor base would change.</p>
<p>If the central government borrowing requirement were to increase again after the system had shut down, it is not certain that it would be possible to build up an equally effective trading system again. It takes time to regain market actors’ confidence in the market and in the long-term interest of central government in maintaining liquidity. Moreover, in these circumstances it cannot be taken for granted that the market makers will be there. Furthermore, investors are slow to change their behaviour and it can be difficult to entice them back to a market once they have left it.</p>
<p>In view of these circumstances, the Inquiry considers that at times when the normal central government borrowing requirement is low, it should be possible for central government to borrow in excess of requirements so as to sustain the Swedish market for government bonds. In this context, the option of borrowing in excess of requirements can be seen as a means of ensuring that central government has good opportunities to borrow in the future should the need arise. Borrowing in excess of requirements should also cover central government’s need to retain the necessary skills and infrastructure to be able to borrow in foreign currencies, since experience shows that this is an important source of finance if central government needs to borrow money quickly.</p>
<p>The possibility of borrowing in excess of requirements is therefore primarily about ensuring good borrowing preparedness for central government. However, borrowing in excess of requirements will also benefit the financial system. The Swedish government bond rate is often used as a risk-free comparative rate for pricing and valuing other financial and real assets. Swedish government bonds are also an important investment alternative for many investors and moreover hold a unique position in the financial regulatory framework. In addition, Swedish government bonds are an important instrument in times of financial turmoil, as investors shun risky investments in such situations. Even if the Inquiry does not consider that these factors in themselves can justify central government borrowing in excess of requirements, the Inquiry believes that a well-functioning market for government bonds helps the financial system function more effectively, not least by making it more robust and less vulnerable to disturbances.</p>
<h2>Management of funds borrowed in excess of requirements</h2>
<p>By definition, borrowing in excess of requirements gives rise to a cash surplus, which will need to be invested in some way. Hence, central government will build up a portfolio of assets financed by borrowed funds. The Inquiry considers that the management of these funds should be decided in more detail by the Riksdag, in connection with authorising borrowing in excess of requirements. In the Inquiry’s assessment, the need to borrow in excess of requirements probably lies relatively far in the future. There is therefore no reason to decide on more specific details concerning the management of assets at the present time.</p>
<p>However, the Inquiry has taken a closer look at some issues as a contribution to future discussions. Among other points, the Inquiry considers that the objective of asset management should be to minimise management risk relative to returns. The reason for central government to borrow in excess of requirements is not to earn money but to ensure good borrowing preparedness. Consequently, the assets should also be managed in an explicitly risk-aware manner. If the asset portfolio becomes permanent or very large, the issue should be re-assessed.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers further that as a rule the funds should only be used to repay the underlying loans when they fall due. This is natural given that the asset portfolio is purely a consequence of central government’s need to borrow in excess of requirements. When the loans fall due and are no longer needed it is therefore reasonable that the borrowed funds be used to pay off the same loans.</p>
<p>Finally, the Inquiry considers that the Debt Office should be responsible for managing the funds. If the asset portfolio becomes permanent or very large, this issue may also need to be re-assessed.</p>
<h2>A buffer in situations of crisis</h2>
<p>The Inquiry does not believe that central government should borrow in order to establish a buffer for crises. A crisis buffer could, in principle, be motivated by concern about not being able to borrow in a fiscal crisis. This happened, for example, in Greece, Portugal and Ireland during the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.</p>
<p>However, in the Inquiry’s view, several reasons argue against central government borrowing in order to build up a crisis buffer. The most obvious is that the buffer would consist of borrowed money, which would hardly be of more than temporary help in a situation in which central government has difficulty borrowing in the capital markets. For one thing, selling assets would weaken the net financial position of central government in just the same way as if expenditure were being financed by new loans. For another, these loans would also need to be refinanced. Moreover, a crisis fund would need to be very large to make any difference in a crisis of such magnitude that central government risked finding it difficult to finance its activities by its own borrowing.</p>
<p>It is only actually if allocations to the buffer fund were to displace other central government expenditure during the period in which the fund was being built up that the true financial position of central government would be improved. This, however, would not be a matter of central government debt policy so much as a reflection of a reorientation of budget policy by setting a far more ambitious surplus target.</p>
<h2>Review of the regulatory framework for central government borrowing and debt management</h2>
<p>In the second part of its remit, the Inquiry has reviewed the provisions governing central government borrowing and debt management in Chapter 5 of the Budget Act. The Inquiry proposes a number of legislative amendments. None of them involves any major substantive change; they are to be regarded, rather, as adjustments to other parts of the Budget Act or to other changes in circumstances.</p>
<h2>From annual to standing authorisation</h2>
<p>At present, annual authorisation is required for the Government to raise loans for central government for the purposes stated in the Budget Act. The Inquiry proposes replacing this requirement with standing authorisation. Authorisation to raise loans for central government is a necessary prerequisite for central government to be able to conduct its activities. It is therefore difficult to see authorisation from the Riksdag as anything more than a formality, despite statements to the contrary in the legislative history. This fact should be reflected in the Budget Act.</p>
<h2>Possibilities for public enterprises to borrow etc. should be further examined</h2>
<p>The Inquiry sees major advantages in a uniform system for borrowing and debt management in the central government sector. In light of this, the current special regulations for borrowing and debt management by certain public enterprises (affärsverk)appear questionable. Transferring these public enterprises’ loans and other financing solutions to the Debt Office would also offer a means for central government to increase its borrowing via government bonds without needing to borrow in excess of requirements.</p>
<p>However, the question of certain public enterprises (affärsverk) being able to borrow outside the Debt Office framework is complicated, as is the provision in the Budget Act excluding borrowing by public enterprises from the objective of central government debt management. These questions lead into issues that lie outside the Inquiry’s remit. The Inquiry therefore considers that it would be more appropriate to analyse this matter in another context.</p>
<h2>Provision on central government use of funds provided from the Riksbank should be removed</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes the elimination of the provision restricting central government use of funds transferred from the Riksbank in exchange for foreign exchange loans to meet the Riksbank’s need for foreign exchange reserves. The Inquiry cannot see that the provision serves any function.</p>
<p>Firstly, lending to the Riksbank is now organised in such a way that no funds are transferred from the Riksbank to the Debt Office.</p>
<p>Secondly, even if such transfers were to occur, the Government has found in previous legislative considerations that the concept of monetary financing is not applicable to these funds. Moreover, in the Inquiry’s view, the provision cannot be justified by the need to prevent a conflict with the requirements presented by monetary policy. This is already regulated by another provision in the Budget Act (Chapter 5, Section 5). This provision therefore seems superfluous.</p>
<h2>Possibility of issuing government bonds for liquidity supporting purposes should be retained</h2>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the possibility for the Government or, if so determined by the Government, the Debt Office to issue government bonds for liquidity supporting purposes (Chapter 5, Section 1, first paragraph, point 4 of the Budget Act) should be retained. Admittedly, the proposal of the Financial Crisis Committee, according to which the Riksbank would be given the opportunity to remedy any shortage of government bonds by borrowing government bonds from the Debt Office, offers an alternative solution to the problem. However, the Inquiry shares the Financial Crisis Committee’s view that the two methods can be seen as complementing one another, not as substitutes for one another. In some situations one approach may be more suitable than the other. A financial crisis is by definition an unforeseen and extraordinary situation. The Inquiry therefore considers that it is important for central government and its agencies to have access to as broad a range of measures as possible in any such situation.</p>
<h2>Explicit statutory support mandate for central government liquidity management</h2>
<p>Payments received and made by central government are very unevenly distributed both over the year and within months. These payments are affected by a number of different factors. While these factors may be more or less predictable, from the perspective of the Debt Office they are largely impossible to influence. The ability to steer payment flows as part of managing central government debt is therefore limited. Consequently, liquidity management – in the sense of measures for short-term loans and investments of funds – are a necessary and essential element of the task imposed by central government debt policy.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes the introduction in Chapter 5 of the Budget Act of explicit statutory support for the Government or, if so determined by the Government, the Debt Office to raise loans in advance of need in the context of liquidity management. The proposal does not involve any substantive change but codifies current practice.</p>
<h2>A longer temporal perspective in the control of central government debt management</h2>
<p>The current central government debt policy process is regulated in the Budget Act and functions well, in the Inquiry’s view. However, the Inquiry proposes the introduction of a longer temporal perspective in the control of central government debt management, so as to require guideline decisions to be taken at least once every third year instead of every year as is now the case. The main reason is to save resources at the Debt Office and the Government Offices. The annual guideline process requires substantial resources, even when the changes in the guidelines are in fact minor. In periods when it is deemed that the guidelines can apply for more than one year, it should be possible to use these resources in a better way than in the guideline process. Even now, the guidelines refer to the next four-year period, with the decisions concerning the last three years being provisional.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes the introduction in Chapter 5 of the Budget Act of an explicit provision giving the Riksbank the opportunity to give its opinion before the Government takes its decision on guidelines, even if such a decision is taken outside the ordinary guideline process. If the decision-making material is not based on proposals from the Debt Office, the Debt Office should also be given the opportunity to state its opinion. This proposal does not involve any substantive change; it can be seen as a clarification of existing provisions.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the amendments enter into force on 1 January 2016. The Inquiry sees no need for transitional provisions.</p>
