<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Radio frequencies are electromagnetic waves in the frequency range between 9 kHz and 3 000 GHz. Radio frequencies (spectrum) are a necessary precondition not only for mobile telephony and mobile connection to the internet, but also for all other wireless communication and radio usage. Spectrum is used in areas such as navigation, meteorology, defence, science, law enforcement, public protection and disaster relief, air, sea, road, and rail transport, satellites, media production and broadcasting of radio and television. The digitalisation of society will lead to spectrum being used in even more areas to connect humans, sensors, systems, vehicles and other things.</p>
<p>Radio spectrum is a limited resource with an ever-increasing significance for society. The need for radio spectrum use is also increasing in the sectors regarding public goods and use by government agencies, for instance the Swedish Armed Forces. The competition for access to radio spectrum is also increasing between agencies. For example, it is already the case today that several government agencies with assignments that are critical to the functioning of society would like to be allocated frequencies that have already been assigned to other agencies with similarly critical assignments. The remit has shown that the Swedish Police Authority wants frequencies assigned to the Swedish Armed Forces, and the Swedish Armed Forces wants frequencies assigned to the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency and frequencies that are currently allocated for digital audio broadcasting (DAB).</p>
<p>Radio spectrum is of considerable value for society. In Sweden, radio spectrum use can be assumed to contribute between SEK 138 billion and SEK 230 billion to gross national product per year. It is therefore extremely important to society that this resource is used to create maximum benefit for society and helps achieve the goals of society in an efficient way. Even a minor increase in efficiency in the use of radio spectrum can contribute positively to Sweden’s economy, growth and possibilities to meet political goals. Radio spectrum is a common resource for Sweden. The Inquiry believes that this resource to a larger extent should be translated into monetary value in order to be managed by the Government and distributed in accordance with political goals and decisions. The by far largest contribution to the Swedish economy is however created through a socio-economic efficient radio spectrum use in itself.</p>
<p>Spectrum management needs to be modernised so that radio spectrum can provide as much benefit for society as possible and meet the future needs of society in terms of radio usage. Spectrum management needs to create a level playing field for different radio technologies and usages so that the technologies and platforms that are in demand can develop. Rules and conditions need to be clear, non-discriminatory and not too cumbersome, and they need to enhance competition in order to promote investments. If the rules for spectrum management are not changed, the Inquiry believes that there is a risk that Sweden will not be able to reap the full benefits of digitalisation and the development of new mobile services for fifth-generation mobile platforms (5G) and their successors, because it will be difficult for usage that is dependent on technology to gain access to suitable radio licences.</p>
<p>The Inquiry presents several proposals with the aim of meeting society’s need for spectrum as efficiently as possible, both today and in the future. Most of the proposals can be handled separately or as a package. The Inquiry’s proposal on spectrum usage fees must, however, be viewed as a key proposal in order for several of the other proposals to be implemented successfully.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also presents proposals on strengthening national security interests for spectrum licensing. These suggestions can also be dealt with separately or as a package.</p>
<h2>The remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit was to propose how the use of frequencies can be planned for the long term – the period 2027–2047 – to be able to meet the needs of society as efficiently as possible. The remit included examining conditions relating to radio spectrum for different public goods, such as maritime traffic, transport and traffic management, total defence, law enforcement, civil protection, public service broadcasting and science. The remit also included reviewing the parts of the regulation on the right to use radio frequencies that govern the interests of actors that are vital to the functioning of society, and proposing the legislative amendments necessary to better meet the radio spectrum needs of actors that are vital to the functioning of society and better safeguard national security interests. The Inquiry’s terms of reference are appended to the report.</p>
<h2>Future spectrum usage for the period 2027–2047</h2>
<p>One of the clearest trends in the mid to long term is an increasing radio use and thus an increasing demand for radio licenses and access to radio frequencies. The Inquiry has paid close attention to trends regarding radio use in different areas and sectors, such as crisis preparedness, law enforcement, defence, digitalisation, connected society, technical developments, traffic and transportation, and broadcasting. In all sectors the trend is towards increased radio usage as well as for new services as for an increased need of mobility and data transfer, except for terrestrial broadcasting and DAB.</p>
<p>There are several factors of significance for future spectrum usage. Certain factors can be wholly or partially controlled – such as rules and micro-economic conditions – whereas other factors, such as the security situation, are more difficult to control.</p>
<p>There is a development towards the same radio network including several different types of radio transmitters on earth as well as in space. Technical reasons for separate infrastructures that only provide a specific service diminishes as the technology develops. Military communication will however probably continue to be separate, mainly because of specific needs of abilities, secrecy and security protection.</p>
<p>The digital services that can be offered and the needs for wireless communication that can be met in the period 2027–2047 will still be limited by the possibility to expand capacity in the wireless networks at a reasonable cost. This is also dependent on large and continuous investments in radio networks and radio technology.</p>
<p>The massive increase in demand for radio spectrum and the possibility to use radio transmitters, as well as end-users’ demand for wireless capacity, mean that there is a need to change the rules for spectrum management so that societal development is not hampered by a lack of radio licences.</p>
<p>Spectrum management needs to create conditions for both technical and societal development that supports the societys’, individuals’ and citizens’ needs.</p>
<p>Almost all practically useful spectrum between audible to visual have already been claimed, pushing spectrum-efficient technologies to the limits, see annex 3. Users that have been granted licences during periods of abundant spectrum access will have to upgrade their systems or make room for more efficient technologies. As a consequence, all users of the spectrum should be treated equally so as to promote modernisation towards more spectrum-efficient solutions and to make room for new applications.</p>
<h2>Spectrum management for the future</h2>
<p>The demand for and value of radio spectrum are ever-increasing. The Inquiry is of the opinion that spectrum management needs to create a level playing field for different radio technologies and radio applications so that the technology and the platforms that are in demand can also develop. To create conditions for the necessary investments, rules and conditions need to be clear, non-discriminatory and not too cumbersome, and they need to enhance competition. Access to radio spectrum can be of considerable value. The Inquiry believes that the Government should distribute this value in accordance with political goals and decisions rather than distribute it among certain actors in such a way that it could be regarded as a hidden subsidy. It does not make sense to provide a detailed plan of frequency usage in Sweden for the period 2027–2047. In this timeframe, the uncertainties regarding technological developments and international harmonisation efforts are too great. Therefore, the Inquiry proposes that the law is changed so that future needs to use radio transmitters and receivers can be met regardless of the development. However, it is necessary at this stage to begin laying the foundations needed to provide necessary spectrum for future needs within the abovementioned timeframe. In view of the international cooperation and development required, a lot of time is needed to make changes to spectrum usage. On top of that, it is necessary to prepare changes well in advance so that they do not have adverse effects and incur high costs for spectrum users. The investment horizon for radio equipment is up to 30 years ahead when it comes to certain applications. Predictability is necessary for market actors to feel certain about investing in infrastructure and radio equipment. In certain cases, the Government must plan or act now in order to prepare for the period 2027–2047.</p>
<p>The Inquiry presents 11 proposals aimed at meeting future spectrum needs as efficiently as possible. Some of the proposals require legislative amendments, while others are of a more strategic character. 1. All spectrum should be priced.  The pricing should lead to a national economic efficient spectrum use. Such spectrum usage fees means that spectrum users will be as efficient as possible with regards to their enterprise. Radio spectrum is a common resource. This resource should to a larger extent be translated into monetary value that can be distributed in accordance with political goals and decisions, instead of being distributed to certain actors in such a way that it could be regarded as a hidden subsidy. However the greatest value for Sweden is created by the radio use in itself. The implementation of the pricing proposal is critical for the successful implementation of many of the other proposals. 2. All radio spectrum usage should be treated equally,  meaning that radio usage consisting only in the reception of radio signals should be licensed. Such licenses includes an obligation to pay for frequencies that are excluded from other use. The mere reception of radio signals can thus provide an opportunity for legal protection against harmful interference and can be considered in frequency planning in the same way as radio transmitters. 3. Increased focus on national economic efficiency in spectrum management.  Spectrum management should be based on the requirement that the use of radio frequencies should be efficient in terms of the national economy. 4. Licences should be granted in the most suitable frequency range.  The regulatory authority, not the applicant, determines the most appropriate frequency range for specific licences. 5. Simplified process for selection procedures  with the possibility for general regulations in more cases than today. 6. Selection procedures in more cases.  Especially for licences that are not intended for public use. 7. Enable competitive procedures regarding the granting of single licences  so that it is possible to deviate from the ‘first come first served’ principle. 8. Adopt a strategic policy for international harmonisation . A  long-term  strategic policy for international harmonisation can make Sweden more efficient in gaining traction for international decisions that benefit Swedish spectrum management. 9. Prepare for possible changes of the frequency bands allocated for broadcasting . Decreased demand for reception of terrestrial television and digital radio broadcasting may lead to changes in international allocation that Sweden needs to be prepared for. 10.Introduce the option of setting requirements concerning the provision of public service content when issuing radio licences. Decreased demand for reception of terrestrial television and digital radio broadcasting may lead to increased difficulties for public service companies to reach out to the public with public service content. Requirement to provide public service content may be an effective tool to ensure continued access to public service content for the citizens. 11. Digitalise Swedish spectrum management. If Spectrum management is digitalised it can be more efficient and legally secure.</p>
<h2>Strengthening national security interests</h2>
<p>Sweden’s national security strategy mentions, among other things, that internal and external threats to society are more complex today than ever before. The primary aim of security work in Sweden is to secure the life and health of the population. The protection of the public’s safety and security is closely connected to the protection of important public services and fundamental values. The military security situation in Europe and our neighbourhood has deteriorated. Crises and incidents that also involve military force can arise and the threat of military attack can never be excluded. Regarding threats to infrastructure, particular mention may be made of disturbances and loss of access to important support systems, such as information and communication systems and network operations centres.</p>
<p>The Inquiry presents six proposals and one assessment aimed at strengthening Sweden’s national security interests. All proposals, except for the last one, refer to a situation in which Sweden is not at war or in danger of war. 1. Radio frequencies for defence and law enforcement are ensured  by more clearly regulating the process of allocating frequencies for certain defence and security authorities and also stressing the prioritised status and the importance of these authorities’ tasks when allocating spectrum. 2. Strengthen the possibility for common national communication services for crisis preparedness and total defence to have access to the necessary frequencies  by clarifying how needs assessments for licences should be conducted. 3. Introduce the possibility to set requirements that are important to Sweden’s security.  Attaching requirements to licences to use radio transmitters or protected reception will enable the regulatory authority to quickly revoke licences when the conditions are not met. 4. Grant and transfer of licences should be denied if the buyer’s radio use can be assumed to harm Sweden’s security.  It is important that the regulatory authority have the possibility to act to safeguard Sweden’s security in all aspects of spectrum management. There should not be a possibility to circumvent the rules, for instance when transferring the right to use radio spectrum. 5. Licences can be revoked if the use of radio spectrum can be assumed to harm Sweden’s security.  To make the rules comprehensive, it is important that the regulatory authority can act to safeguard Sweden’s security in all aspects of spectrum management, even for licences that have already been granted. 6. Mobile operators should be able to provide priority functions for certain actors.  Communication networks for mobile applications may in certain cases be overloaded due to a great number of active connections, for instance during major events, acts of terror, accidents or natural disasters. With this functionality installed in commercial mobile networks, it will be easier for actors to procure prioritised communication based on their needs. However, only certain actors should have the possibility to procure such priority functions. 7. Prepare regulations for electronic communication networks and communication services.  In the event of war or danger of war, or if there are such extreme conditions caused by war beyond Sweden’s borders or by the fact that Sweden has been at war or in danger of war, the Government may issue ordinances about communications networks, communication services and other radio usage necessary for the country’s defence or security in general. The Inquiry proposes that such ordinances should be decided. In these situations that are the object of the rule the Government may need to act quickly to secure communications networks, communication services and other radio usage necessary for the country’s defence or security in general. Issuing such ordinances in peacetime provides ample time for the  decision-making process and to practise the application of the ordinance. Such an ordinance also guarantees radio frequencies for the defence of Sweden in the event of war or danger of war.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the legislative amendments enter into force on 1 January 2021 but that the rule on spectrum pricing and payment of usage fees be implemented on 1 January 2025 to give affected companies, government agencies and other actors time to adjust to the new regulation.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposals</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals aim to meet future need to use radio. The proposals are assessed to lead to increase benefit to society and have positive effects for Sweden’s growth and economy. The Inquiry’s proposal on a usage fee for spectrum licences will lead to increased costs for licences that are currently free of charge. The costs may be cumbersome but the Inquiry believes that the proposal is justified to meet the need for spectrum in the future and to achieve sustainable spectrum management in the long term. The proposals entail higher costs for certain government agencies and the Inquiry proposes that this increase in cost can be offset by an increased administration appropriation. Since the usage fee for spectrum licences is paid to the Government and the agencies are compensated with an equal in- crease in their appropriation, the proposal is cost-neutral for public finances.</p>
<p>The Inquiry believes that the usage fee for spectrum licences or protected reception, as well as the fact that all licences will be treated equally, will promote competition between different radio-based services.</p>
