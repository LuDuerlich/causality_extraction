<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In accordance with the given directives, the investigator shall look into the way in which road traffic taxation is formulated and in particular consider issues pertaining to the environment, traffic safety and competition, with a fiscal perspective as the basic point of departure, and also paying attention to the impact of traffic taxation on the efficiency of the transport system.</p>
<p>The inquiry includes an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of a kilometre tax. The levying of vehicle taxation is to be examined. The possibility of introducing financial incentives for vehicles with low emissions shall be considered. Taxation of diesel fuel for private motoring, business traffic and work machines shall be investigated. Those statutes that regulate the levying of vehicle tax are to be reviewed, with the aim of simplifying the regulations and modifying them to accord with the terminology of EC-law.</p>
<p>Those parts of the inquiry that particularly effect the haulage industry’s competition situation shall be given priority in the interim report. The same applies to the issue of tax relief for heavy vehicles that fulfil certain stricter requirements for emissions, as well as conclusions regarding the introduction of a traffic and environmental tax component in the taxation of motor fuel.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in accordance with the supplementary directives the inquiry shall analyse the way in which a Swedish kilometre tax system can be formulated against the background of ongoing legislative work in Europe and the development of a kilometre tax system that has been planned and implemented there.</p>
<p>The terms of reference comprise studies of different systems or combinations of systems for the taxation of road traffic. It should already be emphasised at this point that the deliberations and proposals that are made in this interim report must of necessity be seen as preliminary .  In order to take a final decision on the various subsidiary issues, it is necessary to have an overview of all parts of the taxation system and their internal relations. The aim must be to achieve an overall perspective. We will return to these decisions in our final report.</p>
<p>In this interim report the above mentioned priority issues will be addressed.</p>
<h2>A traffic and environmental tax component</h2>
<p>According to the Swedish Green Tax Commission’s model for a system of energy taxation which is stable and easily understandable and which has an increased relationship to the environment (SOU 1997:11), all fuels that are used for heating purposes must be subject to a carbon dioxide tax, an energy tax and a sulphur tax. The basis for the model is the creation of an additional special traffic and environmental tax component (TE) in motor fuel taxation in order to take into consideration the costs to society that are caused by traffic-related environmental effects and other costs, so called external costs. We have investigated the suitability of isolating out a component such as this from the energy tax.</p>
<p>In this context we have found that the TE-component is not especially well suited to internalise (capture) the negative external environmental effects to which traffic gives rise. Costs such as those that relate to noise, crowding and accidents for example.</p>
<p>However, we have come to the conclusion that TE is practicable within motor fuel taxation in order to distinguish between different types and qualities of fuel. However, even in this respect it is hard to decide definitively.</p>
<p>TE can also be used to illustrate the structure of motor fuel taxation concentrating on, among other things, environmental effects. It therefore has a pedagogical effect.</p>
<p>According to the Swedish Green Tax Commission’s model, TE is only tied to motor fuel taxation. However we will study different systems or combinations of systems for taxing road traffic. This is where, for example, kilometre taxation comes into the picture. It is consequently impossible at this moment to take a position solely towards a TE within motor fuel taxation as an isolated phenomenon. An overall view, in which the different sections of traffic taxation are included, must also be established here.</p>
<h2>Competition Situation in the Haulage Industry</h2>
<p>Due to Sweden’s membership of EU, Sweden’s haulage contractor’s working in the area of international freight have become involved in a common transport market in which they are in competition with hauliers from other EU-countries. The haulage industry has pointed out the fact that the level of costs of Swedish business are considerably higher than those in competing countries and that measures must be taken by the government to strengthen the competitiveness of the Swedish hauliers.</p>
<p>The trade association Svenska åkeriförbundet (the Swedish Association of Haulage Contractors) has emphasised the fact that it is the so-called supplementary wage costs (employer’s contributions) that are the cost item that represents the greatest burden on the Swedish haulage industry with respect to competition. However, the debate that concerns these costs lies outside our remit which, according to the terms of reference, deals with all the different parts of road traffic taxation, i.e. motor fuel taxation (diesel fuel taxation) and the levying of vehicle tax including road toll charges.</p>
<p>We have acquainted ourselves with the studies and reports that have been carried out as well as compiled some current comparative material ourselves in order to put together a general picture of the industry’s competitive situation. We can note that the picture of the haulage industry’s competitive situation that emerges is somewhat divided. Notwithstanding this we are able to draw the conclusion that the Swedish haulage business is undeniably finding it difficult to assert itself in an ever-harder climate of international competition</p>
<p>Firstly, with regard to diesel fuel taxation , there are a number of different factors that argue against a tax reduction. Partly, the Swedish taxation level for diesel fuel is already low in the intermediate layer among comparable countries; partly, work is in progress within the EU to, among other things, differentiate the tax levy for diesel fuel so that the tax burden on the haulage industry can be lightened; and partly, work is proceeding in Sweden on a national green tax programme. Under these circumstances, it would be unfortunate to institute a specific intervention, the result or value of which cannot be judged in relation to ongoing activities.</p>
<p>The levying of road charges  for heavy goods vehicles, the socalled Eurovignette charge, is regulated in agreements with other participating countries in the Eurovignette project. The terms of reference of the inquiry do not currently extend to a consideration of levels and other pre-requisites for levying this charge. We shall however also deal with road tolls in that part of the inquiry that relates to consideration of any possible Swedish kilometre tax system.</p>
<p>The levying of vehicle tax  only amounts to a small part of the total costs for a vehicle, in general about three percent of a haulage contractor’s total costs. A reduction in the tax levy would consequently in itself only produce a small impact on overall costs. In order to change the trend in terms of costs to some extent, and in the slightly longer term to achieve a more favourable competition situation the vehicle tax should however be adjusted. A general reduction  of the vehicle tax for all heavy vehicles should however not take place.</p>
<p>In this context it should be observed that heavy traffic accounts for a large proportion of the total emissions of among other things, nitric acid and particles. In order to reduce the negative environmental impact of road traffic it is therefore necessary that any tax changes have a clear environmental  profile. A differentiation of the vehicle tax could take place on the basis of compulsory emissions levels, since emissions from different types of vehicles display great differences. A differentiation such as this would improve the competition situation for the cleaner vehicles.</p>
<p>In order to simultaneously both improve the Swedish haulage industry’s competitive conditions and reduce the negative environmental impact of road traffic and achieve a desired environmentalmanagement, we are therefore now proposing a differentiation of the vehicle tax on the basis of compulsory emissions levels, see further below.</p>
<h2>Financial incentives for new heavy vehicles with low emissions</h2>
<p>According to the current EC-regulations (directive 1999/96/EC), in order to reduce the negative environmental effects of exhaust emissions from heavy traffic, a member state can decide on tax relief ( financial incentives ) solely for motor vehicles that fulfil certain stricter exhaust requirements. Tax relief will apply in this context to all new vehicles that in advance  fulfil the specifically indicated limit values according to the respective environmental class. The tax relief will cease on the day that the application of the emissions limit values for new vehicles becomes binding. The tax relief must not exceed, for any type of vehicle, the additional costs for the technical equipment that is required to comply with the limit values.</p>
<p>Naturvårdsverket (The Environmental Protection Agency) has calculated that a financial incentive such as this for exhaust emission purification equipment would amount to in total 16,400 Swedish kronor per vehicle for the next requirement stage (environmental class 2005) and to in total 19,500 Swedish kronor per vehicle for the requirements according to environmental class 2008.</p>
<p>If the vehicle tax were reduced by an equivalent amount, it would fall below the minimum tax rates decided by the EU for levying of vehicle tax for heavy goods vehicles in certain weight intervals. Giving a financial incentive of this type in the vehicle tax  is therefore not possible.</p>
<p>According to EC-law a financial subsidy provided by the state is presumed to constitute state support and as such is considered incompatible with the common market. A state subsidy can however be accepted if, among other things, the support falls within the EC-commission’s environmental guidelines (2001/C 37/03). A subsidy can be approved up to a maximum level of 30 percent gross of the investment costs that are entitled to receive support. This would mean that a subsidy of about 6,000 Swedish kronor per vehicle at the most (30 percent of 19,500 Swedish kronor). We consider an amount of that order of magnitude to be too insignificant in terms of value in relation to the total investment in a new vehicle. Under circumstances such as these, a financial incentive should therefore not be given in the form of a direct financial subsidy  either.</p>
<p>We are consequently not putting forward a concrete proposal for incentives that are referred to here. If further discussions within the EU concerning subsidy amount etc. would provide a reason for it, further consideration in terms of the Swedish interest could take place based on the material we are presenting.</p>
<h2>An environmentally differentiated vehicle tax for heavy motor vehicles</h2>
<p>As has just been said, the introduction of a financial incentive in accordance with the directive 1999/96/EC for acquiring new heavy vehicles with low emissions has been shown to be unsuitable. However, the creation of some form of incentive to promote the acquisition of environmentally friendly technology is a matter of urgency. This is in line with the vehicle tax and road tolls directive 1999/62/EC, that states that the use of environmentally friendly vehicles should be encouraged through a differentiation of taxes and charges, on the condition that a differentiation such as this does not prevent the functioning of the internal market. It can be further noted that Germany for example has differentiation of its vehicle tax in accordance with environmental demands.</p>
<p>With the aim of, on the one hand, improving the competitive situation of the haulage industry, on the other hand of increasing the use of clean heavy motor vehicles, we propose a vehicle tax scale that is differentiated in accordance with the environmental classes that exist for vehicles.</p>
<p>Most heavy vehicles that fulfil stricter environmental demands are taxed at a rate that is in principle reduced to the EC minimum levels. The differentiation is implemented in such a way that heavy vehicles (over 3.5 tonnes) that at least fulfil the most recent compulsory exhaust requirements that apply to new vehicles, are taxed at a lower rate than heavy vehicles with a lower environmental class. In the first stage  the higher environmental requirements are the equivalent of environmental class 2000 (or cleaner). In order to receive a lower vehicle tax in the second stage  requires environmental class 2005 (or cleaner) and during the third stage  environmental class 2008 (or cleaner). By means of this structure, long-term control is built in that encourages the use of cleaner vehicles.</p>
<p>The proposal is adjudged to increase the use of environmentally friendly vehicles due to the fact that there is a strengthening of the incentive to use clean vehicles that are already available, and to encourage the purchase of new vehicles with a better environmental class at an earlier date.</p>
<p>It is also more favourable to choose a vehicle with a better environmental class earlier than it becomes compulsory, since the total tax deduction then will be greater.</p>
<p>The reduced vehicle tax for heavy vehicles is financed by means of an increased vehicle tax for small busses and light lorries (total weight max. 3.5 tonnes). These vehicles are in the same weight class as private cars and in addition are in many cases used in the same way as these cars. An increase is therefore also motivated by reasons other than the financing of environmentally differentiated vehicle tax of heavy vehicles.</p>
<p>The significance of the vehicle tax for the haulage industry’s international competitiveness is certainly not that great. The proposal is nevertheless considered to facilitate competition by decreasing the Swedish vehicle tax for heavy vehicles that satisfy stricter environmental demands to, in principle, the EC minimum levels.</p>
<p>The proposal also represents a simplification of the tax scales by suggesting broader weight intervals, in line with EC minimum tax rates. This too means that many vehicles will be taxed at a reduced rate compared with today.</p>
<h2>Heavy vehicles with pneumatic suspension</h2>
<p>The minimum tax rates for levying of vehicle tax for heavy goods vehicles that have been decided (directive 1999/62/EC) are differentiated through considerably lower tax for vehicles that have drive shafts with pneumatic suspension or other equivalent suspension, than for other vehicles. In some European countries the presence of pneumatic suspension is taken into account in vehicle taxation, in others it isn’t.</p>
<p>In general it can be stated that pneumatic suspension is positive in terms of wear. However, there is some uncertainty regarding the connection between pneumatic suspension and road wear. In order to differentiate the vehicle tax scale for heavy goods vehicles in terms of the presence of pneumatic suspension would require more detailed knowledge of the significance of pneumatic suspension for reduced road wear. Against this background no tax differentiation is proposed with regard to this sort of suspension.</p>
<h2>Certain light vehicles</h2>
<p>Busses and lorries with a total weight of max. 3.5 tonnes attract a lower vehicle tax than private cars. This relationship is unsatisfactory. All these vehicles should be taxed uniformly, however, without the application of an integrated tax. The tax on private cars should be left unchanged for the present but the tax on small busses and light lorries should be increased to the level of private cars. This should take place in successive stages and in a first stage by means of a percentage increment of just over 50 percent.</p>
<p>The increase in the tax levy for small busses and light lorries is motivated by administrative reasons, as well as for reasons of fairness. In addition there are also environmental reasons for adjusting the tax level so that the tax levy for small busses and light lorries is at least not less than that for private cars. It can be assumed that an equivalent taxation will stop the re-registering of private cars to light lorries for purely tax related reasons and thereby the tax avoidance that is the result of it.</p>
<p>The higher vehicle tax for diesel powered vehicles in relation to petrol driven vehicles, that is equivalent to a lower taxation of the fuel itself, petrol or diesel fuel, remains.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposal</h2>
<p>State budget consequences</p>
<p>Taken together, the proposal is considered to produce overall budget neutrality viewed over a period of three and a half years starting from the 1 st  April 2003.</p>
<p>Other consequences</p>
<p>The proposal to, in the long term, put the taxation of small busses and light lorries on an equal footing with that of private cars may, on account of this above mentioned alignment, be expected to reduce tax avoidance through re-registering of vehicles between the different categories. It can also be expected to have positive effects for the police’s traffic surveillance operations with regard to these particular vehicles.</p>
<p>The consequences for small companies, in terms of working prerequisites, competitiveness or conditions in general in relation to larger companies, of the proposed changes to the vehicle tax are not clear-cut. Haulage contractors who use heavy vehicles with engines that fulfil higher environmental demands are rewarded and gain a better competitive position in comparison with competing countries.</p>
<p>Contractors who use light vehicles receive a somewhat higher tax. The increase will be at the most 1,100 Swedish kronor per vehicle per year, but for some vehicles not more than 200 kronor.</p>
<p>It should be noted that these small businesses are exposed to international competitive pressure to a lesser extent than businesses that operate heavy vehicles.</p>
<h2>Coming into effect</h2>
<p>It should be possible for the changes that we are proposing to come into effect the 1 st  April 2003.</p>
