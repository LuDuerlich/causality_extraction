<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>On 10 December 2015, the Government and the Alliance parties reached an agreement concerning measures to combat terrorism. Under this agreement, there is a consensus that the work carried out by the current National coordinator to safeguard democracy against violent extremism (hereafter ‘the Coordinator’) must continue in some form once the remit has come to an end. In addition, the Government has in recent years tasked a number of government agencies with increasing the knowledge about violent extremism and supporting actors with methods to facilitate efforts against such extremism. This is the background to the first assignment in the terms of reference for this inquiry – to propose which government agency should take over the tasks of the coordinator to protect democracy against violent extremism as of 2018.</p>
<p>It is people – in local municipalities and often young people – who are attracted to or drawn into violent extremism. Likewise, it is people in the local municipality who realise that they want to leave the extremist environment. Efforts to combat violent extremism must therefore to all intents and purposes take place in our local communities. Under the abovementioned agreement, it was also agreed that the municipalities have a responsibility to undertake structured and concrete work to prevent radicalisation and recruitment to violent extremist groups.</p>
<p>This is the background to the second part of the remit – to look into the municipalities’ responsibility to safeguard democracy against violent extremism.</p>
<h2>Democracy and risk</h2>
<p>Violent extremism in Sweden is essentially made up of three main environments: the right-wing extremist white power environment, the left-wing extremist autonomous environment and the Islamist extremist environment. In addition, there are lone wolves who are not part of these environments but who are inspired by their conspiratorial, hate-filled and suggestive messages.</p>
<p>Supporters of violent extremism do not accept democratic principles and rules, and this represents a fundamental threat to the democratic order. They are also characterized by the fact that they basically want to change the democratic society and introduce a different social order. On the path towards this goal, violence and other crimes are seen as legitimate methods.</p>
<p>Moreover, the path itself towards this goal is marked by crime. The activities of the various extremist groups undermine, challenge and threaten democracy in different ways. The white power movement attacks people who are considered to have the ‘wrong’ religious convictions, ethnic background or sexual orientation, and this represents an attack against the principle of the equal worth of all people. People in the autonomous scene and the white power scene attack each other. Elected representatives from established parties are attacked. Officials and journalists are subjected to harassment, violence and other forms of unlawful influence. Public premises are subjected to vandalism.</p>
<p>There is also concern about the relatively large number of returnees from theatres of war who have fought for terrorist organisations such as Daesh. They can handle weapons and explosives and fight in groups. Their threshold for using violence has been lowered and some of them may be traumatised as a result of the horrors of war. What everyone ultimately fears is an actual attack.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that this criminality that threatens democracy constitutes major risks for both society and individuals. The main elements in the Coordinator’s strategy are therefore democracy and risk.</p>
<h2>Strengthening democracy, stopping people from joining and facilitating defections</h2>
<p>Democracy and risk: how are the Coordinator’s fundamental approaches expressed in practice?</p>
<p>Democracy can be strengthened to combat violent extremism. This is done, among other things, through material produced by the National Agency for Education and the Swedish Media Council to make it easier for teachers to have ‘difficult’ discussions and improve young people’s criticism of sources. Violent extremism lives and thrives on the internet. The Living History Forum produces educational material about democracy and about intolerance and racism throughout history and today.</p>
<p>The more people who join violent extremist groups, the greater the risks. Through grants from the Swedish Agency for Youth and Civil Society, for example, associations and religious communities can take action to ensure that people are not drawn into violent extremism. Civil society organisations and religious communities are also cornerstones of a democratic society.</p>
<p>The risks are also reduced if defecting from violent extremist organisations and environments is facilitated. Through support from social services and organisations, individuals find it easier to leave extremist scenes.</p>
<p>These are also the pillars that make up the Coordinator’s strategy: strengthening democracy, stopping people from joining violent extremist groups and making it easier for them to defect from such environments. This reduces the risks of violent extremism as fewer people exist in such contexts.</p>
<p>Some critics may believe that this approach is too soft for dealing with one of the most serious threats of our time. But the role of the Coordinator is to activate to a greater extent a larger proportion of society’s overall resources than just law enforcement. The idea is to make use of the extensive capacity society possesses to strengthen democracy, stop people from joining violent extremism and facilitate defections. A great deal of suffering can be averted in this way.</p>
<p>When preventive efforts take effect, this in turn means that fewer violent extremist individuals need to be monitored. This increases the capacity of the justice system: the Police and the</p>
<p>Swedish Security Service will have better chances of preventing crimes at the preparatory or attempt stage; they will be able to solve the crimes that are nonetheless committed.</p>
<p>It cannot be stressed enough how important it is to combat extremist motivated crime at the earliest possible stage.</p>
<p>During the two and a half years in which national coordination against violent extremism has been ongoing, almost all of the country’s 290 municipalities have been visited. The concurrent experience shows that the following three conditions must be met for concrete efforts against violent extremism to be made at local level.  There must be a municipal coordinator or contact person.  A municipal status report on the scope and structure of violent extremism must be produced.  A municipal action plan against violent extremism must be devised.</p>
<p>Municipalities can of course join forces to meet these conditions where appropriate (small municipalities, common problems, etc.).</p>
<p>Many actors need to help each other to produce a local status report and contribute to an action plan. Who knows what? Municipal officials in schools, social services, emergency services and other public services have information at their disposal. What knowledge is possessed by civil society organisations and religious communities, employees at youth homes and homes for care or residence, parking companies, government agencies such as the Swedish Tax Agency, and of course the local police?</p>
<h2>Violent extremism – part of contingency planning</h2>
<p>This model of coordination, status report and action plan is already implemented in municipal contingency planning, although the focus up to now has been more on flooding, major fires and similar challenges than on violent extremism. However, numerous municipalities have begun to apply a social risk perspective in their analyses. This applies to various types of incidents that threaten social sustainability. One such social risk is the local occurrence of violent extremism.</p>
<p>The county administrative boards have a responsibility for county-wide contingency planning and receive municipalities’ status reports and action plans. At national level, it is the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency that deals with contingency planning.</p>
<h2>Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency as national coordinator</h2>
<p>The Coordinator’s proposal is for the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency to get the responsibility as national coordinator to safeguard democracy against violent extremism as of 2018 (the headquarter is situated in Karlstad, see front cover). The principal reasons behind this proposal are the Agency’s national risk perspective and its ability to coordinate at different levels. At an overarching level, the Agency is responsible for dealing with all risks facing the Swedish society, and this should also include the risks of violent extremism.</p>
<p>The task as national coordinator is not about carrying out every single practical measure; it is about ensuring necessary actions are carried out by relevant actors through coordination. A few such coordination tasks include the following.  Assisting with methods for developing local status reports and action plans.  Monitoring and analysing the scope and character of violent extremism in Sweden.  Collaborating with key actors to organise training, initiate projects, produce handbooks, etc.  Initiating and monitoring research, as well as collecting and spreading knowledge so that it can be used in the practical work.  Supporting county administrative boards and municipalities by providing guidance and support.</p>
<h2>The county administrative board as an engine</h2>
<p>The most important work is performed in the municipalities, but because there are a lot of them in Sweden, they have varying preconditions and different characteristics; national coordination can be perceived as very distant from the local level. The Coordinator therefore proposes that the county administrative boards have a role as county coordinators vis-à-vis the municipalities (see the county towns on the first page cover). The county administrative boards have close contact with and good knowledge of the county’s municipalities. Added to this is the counties’ abovementioned contingency planning function with regards to status reports and action plans.</p>
<p>The county administrative board’s most important role is to support the municipalities in their work on local level coordination, status reports and action plans, and provide advice and support. Various cooperation projects can be started between the municipalities on the county administrative board’s initiative.</p>
<h2>Advice and support lead to positive developments</h2>
<p>The integral elements of the municipalities’ efforts to combat violent extremism are thus coordination, status reports and an action plan. Almost all municipalities already have a contact person and some of them work on status reports and action plans. The coordinator has outlined a structure for continued coordination to safeguard democracy against violent extremism: the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency and the county administrative boards.</p>
<p>Continued work on good examples and support from this coordination should therefore be adequate to ensure continued positive developments with coordination, status reports and action plans at municipal level. Moreover, existing legislation points in the same direction.</p>
<p>The coordinator therefore does not consider that any legislation is needed requiring the municipalities to establish coordination and draw up status reports and action plans.</p>
<h2>Municipal responsibility</h2>
<p>The blows of violent extremism target our democratic society, of which the municipalities form the foundation. Violent extremism also threatens and attacks the rights and freedoms of individual members of the municipality. It is therefore in the public interest to safeguard democracy against violent extremism in various ways, in accordance with the Local Government Act. Coordination, status reports and action plans have been mentioned as important instruments in this work.</p>
<p>There are good opportunities, particularly at municipal level, to use the Local Government Act to take measures to strengthen democracy. This is not just about increasing voter turnout in general elections; it is about involving more people in local governance processes. By providing support to associations and religious communities, we can help intercept young people with little trust in society.</p>
<p>The Education Act states clearly that school is an activity that serves democracy. A great deal is also done in schools so that pupils can learn about democracy and human rights, and so that these values permeate the school environment. The aim is for pupils to develop the ability to actively take part in democracy.</p>
<p>Municipal social services have good preconditions for taking action against violent extremism. This is not only as a result of the responsibility that follows from the Social Services Act, but also largely because social services meet a lot of people at risk of ending up in extremism.</p>
<p>Social services should conduct outreach activities and have a clear preventive focus. The Social Services Act places great demands on social services, particularly with regard to young people. Under the Education Act, municipalities also have a res- ponsibility to ensure that young people under the age of 20 who have not completed a national upper secondary school programme are involved in some form of activity. Consequently, there is a good basis for preventing that people, especially young people, join violent extremist groups.</p>
<p>Social services must also support people who find themselves in destructive environments. The Social Services Act provides many</p>
<p>opportunities and there is also compulsory legislation in the form of the Care of Young Persons Act.</p>
<p>On the whole, the Coordinator considers that the legislation not only places demands on the municipalities but also provides major opportunities to actively protect democracy against violent extremism. The obstacles that do nonetheless exist essentially have to do with inadequate advice and support. In this respect, the current and future coordinators have a major responsibility.</p>
