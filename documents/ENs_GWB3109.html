<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Inquiry on a new teacher education programme (HUT 07) now presents its report, entitled Sustainable teacher education . The present teacher education programme, with a single teaching qualification, dates from a reform in 2001. In several evaluations, the education programme has been criticised for a lack of sufficient scientific grounding, excessive freedom of choice for students and the absence of important areas of knowledge. The teacher education programme is the largest higher education programme in terms of numbers and is offered at 26 institutions. The programme has difficulty attracting applicants and the percentage of students dropping out of the programme is high.</p>
<p>As a basis for its proposals the Inquiry has gathered extensive background material in a number of areas. The historical background has been examined and the regulations governing higher education and schools have been reviewed. The design of teacher education programmes in some other countries has been studied, together with the view presented in some research of the teacher’s role and duties. Further, with the help of Statistics Sweden, the Inquiry has carried out a questionnaire survey aimed at a large proportion of the people who have been through the present teacher education programme.</p>
<p>From an early stage the Inquiry has proceeded on the following assumptions:</p>
<p>- teacher education should be an academic professional programme</p>
<p>- the hallmarks of teacher education should be sustainability, professionalism, effectiveness and high quality</p>
<p>- teacher education should give future teachers a thorough foundation on which they can build during their career by continuous skills development</p>
<p>- the attractiveness and status of teacher education need to be raised.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has analysed the skills requirements for teachers teaching different age categories and in different types of school. This analysis has led the Inquiry to divide the contents into three levels:</p>
<p>- an overall perspective setting its stamp on all teacher education</p>
<p>- core knowledge and skills that all teachers need</p>
<p>- knowledge and skills specific to teachers in a certain age category or type of school.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a teacher education programme with a common core of educational science and a number of clearly defined specialisations. Two new professional degrees, for primary school teachers  and secondary school teachers , are proposed to replace the present single degree. This means that all higher education institutions that want to offer teacher education will have to apply to the Swedish National Agency for Higher Education for the right to award the new degrees.</p>
<p>Two new degrees</p>
<p>Under the Inquiry’s proposals, Sweden, like several other countries, will have two teaching degrees.</p>
<p>Primary school teachers  lay the absolutely essential foundation, primarily in reading, writing and arithmetic skills, but also in other areas. These teachers, qualified to teach a broad range of subjects, work in pre-school, the pre-school class, years 1–6 of compulsory school and leisure time centres. The primary school teacher programme will have four specialisations:</p>
<p>- pre-school</p>
<p>- pre-school class and years 1–3 of compulsory school</p>
<p>- years  4–6 of compulsory school</p>
<p>- leisure time centres.</p>
<p>The pre-school specialisation will be a 3-year programme, with the option of an additional supplementary year. The other three specialisations will be 4-year programmes. Primary school teachers taking the leisure time centre specialisation will also be qualified to teach one or two subjects in years 1–6 of compulsory school.</p>
<p>Secondary school teachers  will be responsible for deepening pupils’ knowledge in years 7–9 of compulsory school, upper secondary school and adult education. They will therefore be qualified to teach a narrower range of subjects. This category also includes teachers in practical and artistic subjects, whose education will prepare them to teach in all years of school. The secondary school teacher programme will have four specialisations:</p>
<p>- general subjects, years  7–9 of compulsory school</p>
<p>- general subjects, upper secondary school and adult education</p>
<p>- vocational subjects, upper secondary school and adult education</p>
<p>- practical and artistic subjects.</p>
<p>The specialisation in general subjects, years 7–9 of compulsory school, will be a 4-year programme and will qualify students to teach two subjects, with the option of an additional supplementary year to qualify to teach a third subject or  to teach at upper secondary school. The specialisation in general subjects, upper secondary school and adult education, will be a 5-year programme and will qualify students to teach two subjects, including in years 7–9.</p>
<p>For subject teachers in general subjects the Inquiry recommends, on the basis of schools’ needs, set combinations of subjects with the dual purpose of increasing employability and making it more feasible to gather students taking the secondary school teacher programme into larger cohesive groups. Students can wait until their third year of education before deciding between years 7– 9 and upper secondary school.</p>
<p>For secondary school teachers in vocational subjects, the Inquiry proposes a three-term programme with a requirement for relevant previous vocational experience or academic studies.</p>
<p>Teachers in practical and artistic subjects will take a 4-year programme. Teachers in practical subjects in compulsory school  will also qualify to teach one general subject, while teachers of physical education at upper secondary school  will instead study in-depth in their</p>
<p>subject area. Teachers of artistic subjects  will study in-depth in their subject area or one other compulsory school subject.</p>
<p>General qualifications</p>
<p>All specialisations will lead to a general degree in addition to a professional degree.</p>
<p>It can be assumed that the proposal on dual qualifications, which means that after completing a teacher education programme students will receive both a professional and a general degree, will be attractive to many potential students of education. Apart from the obvious value of the courses as a qualification, students who decide for one reason or another not to follow their studies through to the professional degree can be rewarded for the effort they have put into their studies by at least receiving a general degree at the level they have reached.</p>
<p>The clear educational structure presented means that students can see and identify paths to skills and career development. It will become clear that the teaching profession is not the dead end many perceive it to be today.</p>
<p>Overall perspective</p>
<p>Four overall perspectives have been found to be so essential that they should run through all teacher education. These are:</p>
<p>- a scientific and critical approach</p>
<p>- a historical perspective</p>
<p>- an international perspective</p>
<p>- information and communications technology (ICT) as an educational resource.</p>
<p>All four perspectives are areas that need to be strengthened in teacher education. The scientific and critical approach  counteracts normative attitudes. It requires future teachers to be aware of and able to evaluate different educational methods and theories. The historical and international perspectives  broaden the knowledge of students of education in time and space and counteract a narrowly contemporary and national view of school and learning. ICT as an</p>
<p>educational resource  is an absolutely essential part of a teacher education programme attuned to the digitalisation of society and school.</p>
<p>Joint core of educational science</p>
<p>The Inquiry is of the opinion that all teachers need a certain set of knowledge and skills, regardless of their specialisation and of the organisation of the school. These may be divided into the following eight areas:</p>
<p>- The organisation of education and its conditions, foundations of democracy</p>
<p>- Curriculum theory and didactics</p>
<p>- Theory of science, research methods and statistics</p>
<p>- Development and learning</p>
<p>- Special needs education</p>
<p>- Social relations, conflict management and leadership</p>
<p>- Assessment and grading</p>
<p>- Evaluation and development work</p>
<p>This core of educational science  should be worth 60 higher education credits, corresponding to one year of full-time study. The contents can usefully be adapted according to specialisations within the programme.</p>
<p>Enhanced subject knowledge</p>
<p>Professional teachers should have a very good knowledge of the subjects they teach. The Inquiry’s proposals will enhance subject knowledge in several ways. In primary school teachers’  subject education, the emphasis is placed on the learning of basic reading, writing and mathematics skills, but the education will also give skills in other relevant subject areas, depending on specialisation. For secondary school teachers , the attention given to their teaching subjects will be substantially enhanced and focused compared with the present situation. Practical, school-based training will no longer</p>
<p>be counted as part of the teaching subject education. As a result, secondary school teachers’ subject studies will be equal in terms of academic merit to those of other students.</p>
<p>The Inquiry attaches great weight to the importance of subject didactics . The didactic perspective is to be an active component in the teaching subjects and this will be facilitated by the clearly defined specialisations and cohesive groups. Reinforcement of the national centres that exist for certain subjects is proposed, as well as building up new subject didactics centres. Under the proposal, all major subjects will have a national resource centre.</p>
<p>Improved scientific grounding and proven experience</p>
<p>The Higher Education Act lays down that academic professional programmes are to build on a scientific foundation and proven experience. Both these pillars need strengthening in teacher education, by measures including the following.</p>
<p>Investment in educational science research</p>
<p>Compared with other academic programmes, the teacher education programme has a relatively weak scientific foundation, both in terms of the proportion of teachers with research degrees and in terms of the resources allocated to research in educational science. A long-term improvement of the quality of teacher education requires a strengthening of the scientific foundation. The Inquiry assumes that the resources available to higher education institutions will be allocated internally so as to give educational science research a fair share of appropriations. In addition, the Inquiry proposes the following research investments:</p>
<p>- Increased appropriation to the Swedish Research Council’s Committee for Educational Science</p>
<p>- Funds to build up research capacity in the form of a basic appropriation to seven higher education institutions over a tenyear period</p>
<p>- Special appropriation for admission and supervision of research students funded by local authorities</p>
<p>- As described above, the development and running of additional centres for subject didactics, including a joint service function, and reinforcement of certain existing centres.</p>
<p>Improved practical school-based training and new types of appointment</p>
<p>Proven experience – which in the case of teacher education means experience of schools – also needs to be strengthened. This will be done by improving the practical school-based training performed by students of education and by changes in the types of appointment offered to teachers of education who lack a research degree.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that practical school-based training should constitute an independent component of the teacher education programme, worth 30 higher education credits (equivalent to one term of full-time study). Practical school-based training will take place at ‘field schools’ with which teacher education programmes will sign formal agreements. These field schools will be chosen after quality review. The agreements will guarantee that places in relevant practical school-based training are available, that supervisors have been appointed and trained, and that the examination of students’ work is clear and legally certain.</p>
<p>The education teachers who are to guarantee proven experience should have up-to-date   and relevant  experience of teaching activities. They should therefore either hold temporary appointments at the higher education institution or a combined/exchange appointment at a higher education institution and the appropriate type of school.</p>
<p>Higher requirements and better levels of prior knowledge</p>
<p>One of the most important factors in achieving a successful school system is that the right people become teachers. With fewer and fewer people applying to teacher education programmes, the average level of prior knowledge among students entering these programmes has fallen. This negative trend needs to be broken. The proposal for a new and improved teacher education programme will probably attract more applicants and create competition for places, which will lead to a higher level of prior knowledge. In view of the</p>
<p>great importance of the teaching profession for the general level of education in society, the Inquiry would like prior education requirements to be generally raised and proposes additional analysis on this point. In this connection it may also be worth considering some form of aptitude test  for teacher education.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposal will lead to clearer requirements regarding both the contents and depth of teacher education. The proposal on general degrees means that virtually all students of education will write at least one piece of independent project work, which will raise the scientific level. The international dimension needs to increase, not least as regards research-based course literature.</p>
<p>Examination of right to award degrees, profiling, cooperation and concentration</p>
<p>A teacher education programme with new qualifications and clearly defined specialisations will require that the right to award degrees in different specialisations will only be given to higher education institutions that are adequately equipped to conduct teacher education in the specialisation concerned. In examining suitability, the Swedish National Agency for Higher Education will consider the scientific basis in educational science, teaching subjects and subject didactics, how proven experience is guaranteed and whether the practical school-based training is well organised.</p>
<p>It is neither likely nor appropriate that all 26 higher education institutions that now provide teacher education will offer all the specialisations in the new teacher education programme. Instead, the higher education institutions will have to concentrate on the area or areas in which they find, after internal stocktaking, that they meet the requirements. This means that the new teacher education programme will be characterised by clearer profiling, more cooperation  between higher education institutions and greater educational focus .</p>
<p>In-service training and skills development</p>
<p>The greater general validity and sustainability that characterises the proposed new teacher education programme, and in particular the educational science core, requires future cooperation between</p>
<p>higher education institutions and school authorities to continuously provide in-service training and skills development for active teachers. This also applies to areas of importance to the development of society that need to be quickly incorporated into schools.</p>
<p>Sustainable teacher education</p>
<p>The Inquiry has chosen to entitle its report Sustainable teacher education . The concept of sustainability implies</p>
<p>- that teacher education will not need to be subjected to radical makeovers every ten years,</p>
<p>- that teacher education will give future teachers a solid knowledge base and effective tools that enable them to exercise the profession in a professional and secure manner,</p>
<p>- that teacher education will give knowledge of subjects that builds on a scientific basis and proceeds from the perspective of subject didactics,</p>
<p>- that  up-to-date contact with the practical field is guaranteed through relevant practical school-based training at qualityassured field schools and temporary appointments for education teachers from the school system,</p>
<p>- that only those higher education institutions that meet the requirements when their right to award qualifications is reviewed will be entrusted with conducting teacher education in one or more specialisations,</p>
<p>- that professionally active teachers receive continuous  in-service training and skills development.</p>
<p>The Inquiry hopes that the proposed changes in teacher education will also raise the status of the teaching profession.</p>
