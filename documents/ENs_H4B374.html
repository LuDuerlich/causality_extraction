<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The Act on Transparency of Party Financing (2014:105) entered into force on 1 April 2014. The introduction of the Act marked a transition to binding regulation from a long tradition of purely voluntary agreements on revenue statements among Riksdag parties. In connection with the introduction of the Act on Transparency of Party Financing, the Riksdag also approved amendments to the Act on State Financial Support to Political Parties (1972:625). These amendments mean that support under the act is only paid to political parties that have not received anonymous contributions.</p>
<p>The Act on Transparency of Party Financing applies to political parties and electoral candidates at central level. The ministry memorandum that preceded the Act (Ds 2013:31) proposed that the Act should also apply to political parties and electoral candidates at regional and local levels. The memorandum also suggested that there should not be any ban on political parties and electoral candidates receiving anonymous contributions. In light of the results of the consultation, the Government decided that the issues of revenue statements at regional and local levels and a ban on political parties and electoral candidates receiving anonymous contributions should be investigated further. In its bill (Govt Bill 2013/14:70), the Government announced its intention to appoint, as soon as possible, a cross-party committee of inquiry to investigate these issues, among others.</p>
<p>A recommendation on this subject was adopted in 2003 by the Council of Europe: the Recommendation on common rules against corruption in the funding of political parties and electoral campaigns.</p>
<p>The Council of Europe’s Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) evaluates member States’ compliance with the Recommendation. In a report of February 2009, GRECO recommended seven measures that Sweden should take to increase the transparency of funding to political parties and electoral candidates. In follow-up reports since the introduction of the Act on Transparency of Party Financing, GRECO has deemed that Sweden now complies with several of the recommendations, but stated that the reporting obligation should apply to political parties’ activities at all levels and that a general ban on anonymous donations should be introduced.</p>
<h2>The Cross-Party Committee’s remit</h2>
<p>The Cross-Party Committee’s remit consists of four main issues. The aim is to ensure a coherent and considered regulatory framework for transparency of party financing.</p>
<p>Firstly , the Cross-Party Committee is to consider whether a reporting obligation should be introduced for political parties at regional and local level and for electoral candidates who are appointed as members or alternate members of county council assemblies or municipal councils. Furthermore, the Cross-Party Committee is to consider whether a reporting obligation should be introduced for affiliated organisations and other legal persons whose organisations are closely associated with a political party. The Cross-Party Committee is also to analyse and consider the structure of any potential reporting obligation and supervision of this, e.g. whether the revenue statements should be submitted collectively for each political party, or by individual units.</p>
<p>Secondly , the Cross-Party Committee is to analyse and consider whether a ban should be introduced on political parties and electoral candidates receiving anonymous contributions. Particular attention is to be given to how anonymous contributions – made despite the ban on receiving them – should be managed.</p>
<p>Thirdly , the Cross-Party Committee is to analyse and consider whether special regulations on transparency and a requirement of consent from individual members with respect to financial support given by labour market organisations to political parties or electoral candidates should be introduced.</p>
<p>Fourthly , the Cross-Party Committee is to analyse and consider whether an obligation should be introduced for political parties that operate commercial lottery activities whose proceeds go to the party to inform lottery participants of this. The Cross-Party Committee is also to consider whether special regulations should be introduced preventing political parties using lottery activities to circumvent provisions on reporting or a ban on anonymous contributions.</p>
<p>In addition, the Inquiry is to analyse and consider various other issues  concerning the scope of application of the Act on Transparency of Party Financing. For example, the Cross-Party Committee is to consider whether the current restrictions to ‘political’ activities and to personal election campaigns should remain. Furthermore, the CrossParty Committee is to consider whether a reporting obligation should be introduced for dedicated fundraising organisations. Finally, the Cross-Party Committee is to consider whether the legislation should be clarified with respect to what is meant by the donor’s ‘identity’, or whether it is more appropriate to leave it to the application of the law to develop established practice in this area.</p>
<p>The Cross-Party Committee’s remit also includes outlining how these proposals relate to the Instrument of Government (particularly the provisions on freedom of association), the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and the GRECO recommendations to Sweden.</p>
<h2>A reporting obligation at regional and local level</h2>
<p>Political parties at regional and local levels and affiliated organisations</p>
<p>At present, political parties taking part in elections to the Riksdag (Swedish Parliament) or the European Parliament are obliged to submit revenue statements concerning their activities at central level for publication. We propose that this obligation also apply to political parties taking part in elections to county council assemblies or municipal councils and also concern parties’ activities at regional and local level, as well as activities run through affiliated organisations.</p>
<p>Members and alternate members at regional and local level</p>
<p>At present, a political party’s revenue statements must include certain revenues for members and alternate members of the Riksdag or the European Parliament who were appointed by personal election campaign. We propose – in line with our proposal to widen the reporting obligation to political parties at regional and local levels – that this obligation should also apply to members and alternate members of county council assemblies or municipal councils. We also propose that the obligation no longer be restricted to those appointed following a personal election campaign, so that it applies to all members and alternate members of the Riksdag, county council assemblies, municipal councils or the European Parliament.</p>
<p>Every non-profit organisation, member and alternate should submit individual statements</p>
<p>Under the current system, a political party must submit a revenue statement for all of its organisational sections collectively at central level and for members and alternate members at the same level. The political party’s authorised representatives at central level must sign the revenue statement. We propose that revenue statements for a political party (including its affiliated organisations) that has activities via several different non-profit organisations should not be submitted collectively. Instead, each organisation should submit revenue statements concerning their own activities. Information about certain revenues from activities pursued in a company or any other operational form should be included in the revenue statement for the non-profit organisation that has controlling interests in the activities. Under our proposal, every member and alternate should also submit their own revenue statement.</p>
<p>Exception to the reporting obligation for small revenues</p>
<p>At present, a political party is not required to submit a revenue statement if its revenues in a financial or calendar year are less than half (0.5) a price base amount (SEK 22 400 in 2017). We propose that non-profit organisations at central level within political parties with mandates in the Riksdag or the European Parliament or that otherwise receive state party support and non-profit organisations at central level within such parties’ affiliated organisations should be obliged to submit revenue statements every year regardless of the size of their revenues. Under our proposal, other non-profit organisations and members and alternate members would not need to submit revenue statements if their revenues in a financial or calendar year are less than half a price base amount.</p>
<p>Under our proposal, when assessing whether revenues are less than this amount, as is the case today public party support and organisational support should not be included. We also propose that membership fees (if certain criteria are fulfilled) and contributions from other parts of a political party’s organisation should not be counted.</p>
<p>Moreover, under our proposal, revenues under the stated amount would not need to be reported. In other words, we propose that the current reporting obligation for small revenues be removed.</p>
<p>Dedicated fundraising organisations</p>
<p>We consider that the reporting obligation should not currently be extended to include dedicated fundraising organisations, i.e. independent bodies created for the purpose of supporting a political party or electoral candidate that are entirely outside the control or influence of the party or candidate.</p>
<h2>A ban on anonymous contributions</h2>
<p>A ban on anonymous contributions exceeding a certain value</p>
<p>Under current law, it is permitted for political parties and electoral candidates to receive anonymous contributions, i.e. contributions given to the party or candidate by donors unknown to them. However, under the Act on State Financial Support to Political Parties, for a party to be entitled to support under that Act, the party or a member or alternate member must not have received anonymous contributions.</p>
<p>We propose that a ban be introduced on political parties and their affiliated organisations receiving anonymous contributions with a value exceeding one twentieth (0.05) of one price base amount (SEK 2 240 in 2017). We propose that this also apply to electoral candidates, members and alternate members of the Riksdag, county council assemblies, municipal councils and the European Parliament. A contribution should be considered anonymous if the recipient does not know and cannot find out the identity of a given donor.</p>
<p>Management of anonymous contributions given despite the ban</p>
<p>If a prohibited anonymous contribution is made, under our proposal a sum corresponding to the amount by which the contribution is prohibited, should be repaid to the donor or, if this is not possible, to Kammarkollegiet (the Legal Financial and Administrative Services Agency) no later than three months after the end of the accounting period. If this does not occur, the prohibited anonymous contribution is to be considered received.</p>
<h2>The required content of a revenue statement</h2>
<p>The extent of the reporting obligation should in essence be the same for all those subject to it</p>
<p>Under our proposal, the extent of the reporting obligation should in essence be the same for all those subject to it. The current provisions concerning the content of a revenue statement should continue to apply, with certain adjustments, and apply to all those obliged to report. The threshold for the obligation to report the identity of a donor should be half (0.5) a price base amount (SEK 22 400 in 2017) for all those obliged to report.</p>
<p>The restriction to personal election campaigns should be removed</p>
<p>Under the Act on Transparency of Party Financing, a revenue statement for a member or alternate member should only concern revenues to personal election campaigns for the member or alternate member. We propose that the restriction to revenues for personal election campaigns be removed, and revenue statements for members or alternate members should contain details of certain revenues that they have had in their capacity as electoral candidate, member or alternate member.</p>
<p>The restriction to political activities should be removed</p>
<p>Under our proposal, political parties and their affiliated organisations should report how they have financed all of their activities, not just their political activities – as is the case under the current legislation.</p>
<p>Public support</p>
<p>Under our proposal, a revenue statement should contain details not only of public support of the kind referred to in the current legislation, but also of political party support under Chapter 2, Sections 9 and 10 of the Local Government Act (1991:900), support under the Act on State financial support to parliamentary parties’ women’s organisations (2010:473), and State and municipal support paid to parties’ youth organisations.</p>
<p>We also propose that county councils and municipalities be required to make details of the political parties and organisations (non-profit) to which they have paid political party support under Chapter 2, Sections 9 and 10 of the Local Government Act and the sums involved available to the public on their website.</p>
<p>Revenues from lotteries, collections and other revenues</p>
<p>Under the Act on Transparency of Party Financing, revenue from sales, lotteries, collections and similar activities must be reported.</p>
<p>We propose that for revenues from lotteries that require permits from the Swedish Gambling Authority, the number of tickets and price per ticket be included in the revenue statement.</p>
<p>Moreover, we propose that the post revenue from collections  be restricted to revenue from cash collections  and that every cash collection be reported individually, stating the amount collected and the time and place of collection. Revenues from other collections should be reported as contributions from individuals.</p>
<p>We also propose that the post  revenue from similar activities be removed. Under our proposal, a revenue statement should instead contain details of the amount of  other revenues and make it clear what these revenues refer to.</p>
<p>Simplified handling of small contributions</p>
<p>We propose a simplified handling process for single contributions from individuals of less than one two-hundredth (0.005) of one price base amount (SEK 224 in 2017). The sum total of such contributions should be reported in a revenue statement, and it is not necessary to state whether the contributions were anonymous. Nor do they need to be counted when assessing whether the total contributions from the same donor exceed the threshold for reporting the donor’s identity.</p>
<p>Details of donors’ identities</p>
<p>Under our proposal, the transparency legislation should clearly state that details of a donor’s identity means their name and either their address or their personal identity number/organisation registration number.</p>
<h2>Submission and publication of revenue statements, supervision and sanctions</h2>
<p>Submission and publication of revenue statements, and supervision</p>
<p>Under the current Act on Transparency of Party Financing, a revenue statement must be submitted to Kammarkollegiet and have been received no later than 1 July of the year following the financial year or calendar year to which the statement refers. Kammarkollegiet is also responsible for publishing the statements and exercises supervision of the transparency legislation. We propose that this system continue to apply to all revenue statements.</p>
<p>Details to be published</p>
<p>Under the current legislation, Kammarkollegiet must make the revenue statements available to the public on its website, with the exception of the details of a donor’s identity if the donor is a natural person. This should apply to all revenue statements in the future under our proposal. We also propose that Kammarkollegiet publish on its website details of received payments of prohibited anonymous contributions.</p>
<p>Late submission fees</p>
<p>If a notification from an individual or other circumstances give cause to do so, Kammarkollegiet must, under the Act on Transparency of Party Financing, investigate whether a revenue statement should by rights have been submitted instead of a notification. Under our proposal, the obligation to notify should, as previously mentioned, be removed. We therefore propose that Kammarkollegiet should, in the same circumstances, instead investigate whether a person who was legally obliged to submit a revenue statement has failed to do so in time.</p>
<p>If such an investigation shows that there was an obligation to submit a revenue statement, a late submission fee should be charged. The late submission fee should be SEK 10 000 for non-profit organisations at central level within political parties with a mandate in the Riksdag or European Parliament or that otherwise receive state party support, and non-profit organisations at central level within the affiliated organisations of such parties. For other nonprofit organisations, the late submission fee should be SEK 2 500. For members and alternate members it should be SEK 500.</p>
<p>Special fees</p>
<p>Under the Act on Transparency of Party Financing, Kammarkollegiet must investigate the content of a revenue statement if a notification from an individual or other circumstances give particular cause to assume that the revenue statement is incorrect. If such an investigation shows that the political party has omitted revenue items or understated the value of revenues, or has not fulfilled the obligation to provide information under the Act correctly, a special fee must be charged. We propose that these provisions also be applied to those at regional and local level and in affiliated organisations who would be obliged to submit revenue statements under our proposal. However, we propose certain amendments and additions.</p>
<p>Failure to correctly provide certain additional details under our proposal should also be grounds for charging a special fee. Where the obligation to provide information has not been fulfilled correctly, a special fee of SEK 20 000 should be charged to nonprofit organisations at central level within political parties with mandates in the Riksdag or the European Parliament or that otherwise receive state party support and non-profit organisations at central level within such parties’ affiliated organisations. In the case of other non-profit organisations and members and alternate members, the special fee in such cases should be SEK 5 000.</p>
<p>If a notification from an individual or other circumstances give particular cause to assume that an association or person has received an anonymous contribution in contravention of the ban on receiving such contributions, Kammarkollegiet should investigate whether this has occurred. If the investigation reveals that the association or person has received a prohibited anonymous contribution, a special fee should be charged to the recipient. The amount of the special fee should be set at a level that is twice the value of the amount by which the contribution exceeds the permitted threshold.</p>
<p>Adjustment of the late submission fee or special fee</p>
<p>Under the Act on Transparency of Party Financing, Kammarkollegiet may decide to reduce or refrain from charging a late submission fee or special fee if exceptional grounds exist for doing so. We propose that this continue to apply to non-profit organisations at central level within political parties with mandates in the Riksdag or the European Parliament or that otherwise receive state party support and non-profit organisations at central level within such parties’ affiliated organisations. In the case of other non-profit organisations and members and alternate members, we propose that</p>
<p>Kammarkollegiet be able to decide to reduce or refrain from charging a late submission fee or special fee if there are special grounds to do so.</p>
<p>Anonymous contributions and the right to state party support</p>
<p>It should no longer be a prerequisite for the right to support under the Act on Transparency of Party Financing that a political party, member or alternate member has not received anonymous contributions.</p>
<h2>Increased influence for members of labour market organisations</h2>
<p>In our assessment, no special regulations should be introduced for the time being on transparency and on requirement of consent from individual members with respect to financial support given by labour market organisations to political parties or electoral candidates. We therefore make no such proposal.</p>
<h2>Information to lottery participants</h2>
<p>Since the lottery legislation is currently under review, in our assessment there is no reason to further investigate as part of our remit whether political parties that operate commercial lottery activities whose proceeds go to the party to inform lottery participants of this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we consider that there are insufficient grounds to introduce special regulations to prevent lottery activities being used to circumvent provisions on reporting anonymous contributions or the ban on political parties and electoral candidates receiving such contributions.</p>
<p>We therefore propose no changes to the lottery legislation.</p>
<h2>The relationship between our proposals and the Instrument of Government, the European Convention for the Protection</h2>
<h2>of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the GRECO recommendations</h2>
<p>We consider that our proposals are compatible with the provisions of the Instrument of Government and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms on freedom of association, the prohibition of coercion to divulge political opinions and the prohibition of inclusion in a public register without consent.</p>
<p>In our view, the implementation of the proposals would mean that Swedish legislation would be more in line with the GRECO recommendations to Sweden on measures that should be taken to increase the transparency of funding of political parties and electoral candidates.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>Our proposals would lead to a somewhat increased administrative burden and increased costs for Kammarkollegiet. We consider that these should be financed with public funds and provide an assessment of how this could be achieved.</p>
<p>We consider that our proposals would only lead to marginal cost increases for other administrative authorities and the administrative courts. These additional costs can be financed within the framework of existing appropriations. For county councils and municipalities, too, our proposals only imply minor cost increases that can be accommodated within existing appropriations.</p>
<p>For political parties, members and alternate members at regional and local level and for affiliated organisations, the proposals will lead to a somewhat increased administrative burden.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>For legal-technical reasons, we propose that the Act on Transparency of Party Financing be repealed and replaced with a new act and enter into force on 1 January 2018. It is proposed that the amendments to</p>
<p>the Act on State Financial Support to Political Parties enter into force on the same date.</p>
