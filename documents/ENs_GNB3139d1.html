<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Sweden’s annual volume of total public procurement amounts to about 400,000 million crowns. This is equivalent to more than 23 % of the aggregate production of goods and services in Sweden, i.e. the gross national product (GNP). Most procurement carried out by the government, the parliament, public agencies, municipal governments, county councils and state-owned businesses has been regulated since 1994 in the Public Procurement Act (LOU).</p>
<p>Task of the Procurement Committee</p>
<p>The task of the Procurement Committee was to study the need for state supervision of public procurement. One important issue was to determine whether the future supervisory agency should have the right to take legal action. The Committee was instructed to devise a definition for the concept ‘supervision’ in the procurement field and propose ways for developing a supervisory function with greater ‘weight’.</p>
<p>The Committee was to review all the regulations in chapter 6 of the LOU. Sweden introduced these regulations, even though they are not required by EU directives on public procurement. This is mainly because Sweden already had similar regulations prior to its membership in the EU. Several other EU and EES countries also have rules for procurement according to ‘threshold values’ and for ‘B’ services (health, medical care, social services, education etc.)</p>
<p>The Committee also had the task of reviewing regulations on damages in public procurement and studying the way other EU member countries have implemented directives on appeals procedures in this area. The Committee, finally, was to consider the Sector Reform Study’s proposals for measures for dealing with disreputable suppliers (SOU 1997:111.)</p>
<p>Problems in public procurement</p>
<p>About 3,500 directive-controlled procurements operations, i.e. EU procurements, are carried out each year. In Sweden, however, simplified procurements, governed by chapter 6 in the LOU, predominate in terms of volume and value. About 200,000 simplified procurement procedures are carried out each year. Direct procurement also occurs to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>Many of the country’s approximately 10,000 procurement units lack the resources and skills to follow the rules on public procurement. Even when these skills do exist, a large percentage of public procurements is pursued outside professional procurement departments. This can be remedied to some extent by programmes for skills enhancement and quality control measures at units responsible for public procurement.</p>
<p>Procurement units which neglect the rules, more or less deliberately or through negligence, and operate by their own rules are more difficult ‘nuts to crack’. Paradoxically, anyone who attempts to follow the law but who makes an error may be incur heavy damages, whereas someone who has no intention of following the law need not be greatly concerned about possible sanctions.</p>
<p>General starting points for our proposals</p>
<p>The Public Procurement Act has resulted in improved quality and good economic effects in the six years it has been in force. The Committee’s view is that the potential for additional improvements in quality and savings is considerable if public procurement procedures could be improved even further. More efficient public procurement could therefore contribute to enhanced welfare, security and growth. More efficient public procurement could also contribute to the implementation of other social objectives, such as labour market and environmental policies.</p>
<p>Competition and Public Procurement Authority</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the present state supervisory authority, the National Board for Public Procurement (NOU) will be merged with the Swedish Competition Authority to form a new agency, the Swedish Competition and Public Procurement Authority. The new Authority’s supervision of public procurement would be greatly expanded. The Authority would be supplied with the ‘muscle’ and resources needed to prevent serious infringement of the rules in the Public Procurement Act.</p>
<p>Market damage fee</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the Competition and Public Procurement Agency, a trade organisation or an individual supplier shall have the right to file a suit with a county court and demand the imposition of a ‘market damage fee’ if a procurement unit deliberately or negligently commits a serious infringement of provisions in the LOU in its procurement of goods, services or construction work. The Committee cites eight typical cases in which a market damage fee could be imposed. The market damage fee should be restricted to serious infringement. Such infringement normally undermines confidence in public procurement.</p>
<p>Specifying every situation in which a market damage fee should be imposed would be impossible. However, the following are some typical situations: 1) A procurement unit has deliberately or negligently been guilty of prohibited direct procurement, it is obvious that the organisation which carried out the procurement is a procurement unit and there is no legal exemption from the obligation to invite tenders. 2) A procurement unit has deliberately or negligently prepared improperly ‘slanted’ specifications, so only one supplier it wishes to favour ‘fits the bill.’ 3) A procurement unit has deliberately or negligently drawn up arbitrary and imprecise evaluation criteria, without any ranking, so only one supplier ‘fits the bill.’ 4) A procurement unit has deliberately or negligently manipulated the tender evaluation procedure by changing qualification stipulations or evaluation criteria, compared to those set forth in the tender invitation. 5) A procurement unit has deliberately or negligently accepted a tender which arrived after the deadline, and the tenderer is unable to show that the delay was not the tenderer’s fault. 6) A procurement unit has deliberately or negligently accepted a tender submitted by someone who is disqualified, and improper special treatment is a risk. 7) A procurement unit has deliberately or negligently accepted a tender from someone who gave, promised or offered a bribe or some other improper recompense to someone deciding on or participating in the resolution of a procurement matter. 8) A procurement unit has deliberately or negligently neglected to advertise a current procurement which must be advertised, according to chapters  2-6 of the LOU.</p>
<p>Changed rules on damages</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the damages which may be awarded to an injured supplier shall be calculated on the basis of delictual damages. In other words, a supplier shall receive full compensation for the loss she/he sustains if she/he loses out on a contract which should rightfully have gone to her/him. In contrast to the wording of the present regulation on damages, however, the Committee proposes that the possibility of receiving damages be limited to an amount which is reasonable in relation to costs and lost profit. The Committee also proposes that the statute of limitations in actions for damages and actions for market damage be extended from one to two years from the date a contract was signed or a procurement matter was resolved in some other way.</p>
<p>Simplifications and clarifications</p>
<p>The Committee also proposes a number of simplifications and reliefs for procurement units. The right for a procurement unit to invite a tender from only one supplier without advertising the procurement has been introduced. However, this right assumes that there are special reasons for this procedure. The possibility of holding simplified design contests has also been introduced. A ‘design contest’ refers to a contest for architectural services etc. carried out to give the arranger an opportunity to obtain a technical drawing or the like from contestants as input for the performance of a particular task.</p>
<p>A demand for mandatory advertising in an electronic database has been introduced. A selective procedure option is also being introduced in chapter 6 at the same time. The main idea is to make it easier for small and medium-sized companies to find out which procurement matters are in progress. Increased participation by these companies in public procurements will increase competition and growth.</p>
<p>A number of regulations are also proposed whose aim is to deal with disreputable suppliers. A supplier who is a legal entity can be barred from participation in procurement if a representative of that legal entity has been convicted of a business crime or been found guilty of serious dereliction in the pursuit of his trade. Acceptance of a tender from anyone who has attempted to bribe a representative of a procurement unit is prohibited. Nor may a tender be accepted from anyone who is disqualified, and improper special treatment is a risk. Finally, an initiated procurement may not be broken off unless there are objective reasons for so doing .</p>
