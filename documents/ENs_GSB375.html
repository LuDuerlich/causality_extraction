<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The task given to us has been a comprehensive one, entailing not only the application of the right of access to public records in the light of the new situation that has arisen in a society using information technology, but also a general review of the Swedish Official Secrets Act. We have presented our previous proposals in three reports: Offentlighetsprincipen och den nya tekniken (The right of public access to official records with respect to the new technology) (SOU 2001:3), Ordning och reda bland allmänna handlingar (Keeping public records in order) (SOU 2002:97) and Ny sekretesslag (A new Swedish Official Secrets Act) (SOU 2003:99). This report brings our work to its conclusion.</p>
<p>In this final report we submit proposals with respect to the following:</p>
<p>applying to state-owned companies the right of access to public records,</p>
<p>the protection that prevails concerning freedom of information should be strengthened with respect to employees in those municipal companies where the principle of the right of access to public records applies,</p>
<p>the clarification of the regulations in the Swedish Official Secrets Act concerning secrecy in foreign matters,</p>
<p>the co-ordination of the regulations of the Swedish Official Secrets Act with respect to international treaties in order to achieve greater clarity,</p>
<p>and the obligation of an authority that refuses to provide a public document on the grounds of secrecy regulations with respect to an international treaty, to indicate which provision in the agreement is applicable.</p>
<p>This final report also contains our deliberations concerning the significance of the right of public access to official records and the Swedish Official Secrets Act with respect to the exchange of information between municipalities and their companies and between the municipal companies themselves. We also discuss the possibility of exchanging information between the various company organs (general meetings, the board, the CEO and accountants) in a municipal company that has to apply the principle of the right of access to public records.</p>
<p>The background</p>
<p>The intention behind the right of public access to official records is that this should be a guarantee of the rule of law and should ensure efficiency in administrative matters and democratic governance. Public power is exercised at the discretion of the people. It is therefore necessary for the general public to be given sufficient insight into public matters in order for there to be a basis for the free formation of opinions and a free flow of information. The right to be given access to public records is of major significance with respect to this insight. The significance of public records as a source of information has also increased as the state and the municipality have taken on the responsibility for new tasks. In this way there has been an increase in the areas in which the principle of the right of public access is to be applied.</p>
<p>It is a civic right to be allowed to view public records. This aspect is also important with respect to administrative policies. The right to view public records, freedom of information and the protection of information all contribute to the rule of law and mean that there are more stringent demands concerning the quality of documents and official letters, which can thus contribute to improving the quality of public administration and helping it to fulfil its goals. Openness increases confidence in public institutions and makes corruption and the misuse of power more difficult.</p>
<p>The right to view public records may only be restricted if this is justified with respect to one or more of the grounds for secrecy that are itemised in chapter 2 of the freedom of the press act. These restrictions are to be carefully itemised in a special statute or in another statute to which that particular statute refers. The particular statute to which the freedom of the press act refers is the official</p>
<p>secrets act (1980:100). The official secrets act also regulates the professional secrecy that applies to employees working in the field of public administration. An obvious prerequisite when framing regulations concerning secrecy is that there should not be a greater degree of secrecy achieved that that which is absolutely necessary to protect the interests that occasioned the regulation in question.</p>
<p>We commissioned the Swedish Agency for Administrative De- velopment to evaluate the financial consequences of implementing the principle of public access to official records in state-owned companies. The evaluation includes an estimate of what the principle of public access to official records currently costs not only state and municipal authorities, but also companies belonging to county councils and municipalities. The Swedish Agency for Administrative Development estimates that the total cost of the principle of public access to official records is no more than SEK 550 million per year.</p>
<p>The right to view public records shall also apply to stateowned companies</p>
<p>We propose that the regulations in the freedom of the press act concerning the right to see public records shall also apply to the records of limited companies, economic associations, trading companies and foundations in which the state has a legally decisive influence. When the official secrets act is applied, such companies are to be placed in the same category as authorities. By legally decisive influence, we mean that the state, on its own or together with municipalities and county councils,</p>
<p>1. owns shares in a limited company or in an economic association amounting to more than half the total votes in a company or association or in some other manner has that many votes at its disposal in the company or association,</p>
<p>2. is entitled to appoint or dismiss more than half the members of the board of a limited company, economic association or foundation, or</p>
<p>3. constitutes all the partners with unlimited liability in a trading company.</p>
<p>The principle of public access to official records shall only apply to state-owned companies that are Swedish legal entities: i.e. companies, foundations and associations that are established in accordance with Swedish legislation. The state can exert the legally decisive influence directly, by means of the government or authorities, for example, or indirectly by means of another state-owned company in which the principle of public access to official records applies.</p>
<p>The proposal means that what constitutes the public domain in municipal and state-owned companies will be viewed in a uniform manner. The basis of this proposal is that the case for insight into public activities is equally valid, irrespective of the outer form chosen for the activity in question. The principle of public access to official records contributes to the rule of law and intensifies the demands for quality in the administration. Openness increases confidence in public institutions and makes corruption and the misuse of power more difficult. As a result of our survey, we found that most stateowned limited companies and foundations can be compared to municipal companies. Their task is to provide something that is of general interest for the country and its inhabitants, such as infrastructure and properties for general use, culture, education and research. There is thus no reason to retain the difference between insight into state-owned and into municipal companies.</p>
<p>The principle of public access to official records is not to apply to a state-owned company whose shares are listed on a Swedish or foreign stock exchange. We also propose that it should be possible to grant a state-owned company total or partial exemption from the application of the principle of public access to official records. The government shall be allowed to grant such a dispensation if there is a particular reason to do so with respect to the nature of the activity concerned, the competition it is subject to, or other significant economic interests.</p>
<p>In order for a dispensation to be granted, there must be a clear difference between the company in question and the municipal companies. Such a difference could be that the most of the company’s business is conducted abroad. However, if a company has a legal or actual monopoly or has some form of task to perform for society, insight may only be restricted in exceptional cases. This also applies if the company has a pronounced political role to play within its sphere, or if it is wholly or partially financed from public funds.</p>
<p>The proposal means that those state-owned companies that are subject to the principle of public access to official records are to</p>
<p>apply the regulations of the official secrets act and the archive act with respect to how documents are to be registered, organised and preserved. Documents that have been preserved are an important part of our cultural heritage. To a considerable extent, this also applies to company archives. Making these regulations applicable to the archives of state-owned companies, creates guarantees that the valuable cultural heritage that they constitute will be preserved.</p>
<p>The official secrets act as it is presently constituted already contains several regulations that protect information in various types of business enterprises. The current regulations are probably sufficient for the needs of most state-owned companies. However, there may exist state-owned companies that have a particular need for confidentiality by virtue of their activities. We have not been able to study the business activities of state-owned companies in sufficient detail to be able to submit such proposals.</p>
<p>It is our opinion that the implementation of the principle of public access to official records would entail little expense as far as investment and running costs are concerned. These costs should be weighed against the gains that arise as a result of better insight, such as increased efficiency and less risk of corruption. Moreover, the preservation of the archives of state-owned companies constitutes a gain for our cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Insight into other subjects of civil law</p>
<p>The right to view public records also applies to records pertaining to certain bodies that are itemised in the annex to the official secrets act. The annex also details the activity of the body to which the principle of public access to official records applies. Certain of these bodies will be subject to our proposal concerning insight into state-owned companies. They can thus be deleted from the annex.</p>
<p>There is still a need to be able to extend the insight into other subjects of civil law apart from municipal and state-owned companies. The itemising of such bodies in the annex to the official secrets act must therefore be retained. All legislative work that concerns the transferral of the exercise of public authority to individuals must contain an evaluation of the need for insight, i.e. whether or not to include the individual body in the annex to the official secrets act. It is our considered opinion that there are also grounds to consider applying the principle of public access to official records to addi-</p>
<p>tional bodies subject to civil law that have strong links to the public sphere by including them in the annex even though their activities are not the exercise of public authority. This could apply to nonprofit associations, for example, and other activities that are largely financed by public funds.</p>
<p>The exchange of information both between municipalities and their companies and between and within the companies themselves</p>
<p>We have found nothing to indicate that the official secrets act would inhibit municipalities and county councils from obtaining the information they need in order to exercise their ownership of municipal companies. Neither have we discovered anything to indicate that there is insufficient protection of confidentiality in those authorities exercising the function of ownership.</p>
<p>There are no boundaries with respect to confidentiality between the general meeting, the board and the chief executive officer in a limited company or an economic association that are subject to chapter 1 section 9 of the official secrets act. However, given the purport of the official secrets act, the auditor should be considered an authority in his or her own right. It is on the basis of chapter 14 section 1 of the official secrets act that information is submitted to the accountant by the other bodies within the company and any secrecy is transferred in accordance with chapter 13 section 1.</p>
<p>We propose that the regulations concerning insight should also apply to state-owned companies. Our deliberations in this respect will thus also apply not only to the relationship between the state and state-owned companies, but also between and within the stateowned companies.</p>
<p>Protection for the freedom of communication is to be strengthened for employees in municipal companies subject to the principle of public access to official records</p>
<p>We consider that the extent of the freedom of communication with respect to employees in municipal companies must be clarified. This is necessary if the impact of the principle of public access to official records is to be complete. We therefore propose that there</p>
<p>should be a referral in the official secrets act to certain regulations in the freedom of the press act and the right to freedom of expression in the constitution. By means of this proposal, the freedom of communication for the employees in a company subject to the principle of public access to official records will be the same as that for those employed by a public authority. The increased protection shall not apply to a chief executive officer, since he or she is liable to damages in accordance with the limited companies act or the economic associations act.</p>
<p>This increased protection with respect to freedom of communication shall also apply, subject to certain conditions, to the employees of those bodies itemised in the annex to the official secrets act. It applies if the communication publicised concerns the activity specified in the annex.</p>
<p>As is clear from what has previously been stated, we propose a general rule that the principle of public access to official records should apply to state-owned companies. If this is implemented, it means that our proposal concerning improved protection for the right of communication should also apply to employees (apart from the chief executive officer) in such state-owned companies.</p>
<p>Secrecy concerning foreign matters should be clarified</p>
<p>Our investigation of the implementation of secrecy concerning foreign matters by the Swedish administrative authorities indicates that the regulation in chapter 2 section 1 of the official secrets act is used relatively infrequently outside the Foreign Service (which comprises the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Swedish embassies and other missions abroad). In this respect there does not seem to be any real difference between the work of the authorities with respect to the EU and other international cooperation with authorities. Neither is there any indication that information is subject to secrecy orders to any greater extent than that intended by the legislators. On the contrary, our investigation indicates that the application of the secrecy regulation within the Foreign Service is such that nowadays a greater perturbation than before of Sweden’s links to other peoples is required if information is to be subject to secrecy regulations. According to chapter 2, section 1 of the official secrets act, it is nowadays a requirement that “it can be assumed that Sweden’s links with other peoples would be marred or the</p>
<p>country would be damaged in some other way if the information were to be revealed.” However, within the Foreign Service it appears to be a requirement that such a perturbation of the links in question must be so serious that actual damage could be assumed to occur if such information were to be revealed. We consider this restrictive application of secrecy concerning foreign matters and the development towards increased openness in international work to be a positive development.</p>
<p>It is our opinion that there is no reason to propose any comprehensive changes with respect to secrecy concerning foreign matters. On the other hand we propose a minor change to the effect that the actual easing of secrecy that is a consequence of changed practices within the administrative authorities concerned with foreign matters should be clarified and directly codified in the official secrets act. In the future, in order for information to be classified as secret with the support of chapter 2, section 1 of the official secrets act, it should be a requirement that “it can be assumed to damage Sweden’s links with other peoples or in some other way damage the country if the information is revealed.” Apart from the fact that this change better reflects the current practice within the Foreign Service (where this paragraph is most frequently applied), this will also indicate to other Swedish authorities the general easing of secrecy that we consider should be striven for.</p>
<p>The regulations of the official secrets act with respect to international treaties should be coordinated in order to achieve greater clarity</p>
<p>At the present time there are about ten regulations in the official secrets act that regulate secrecy concerning information that is in the possession of Swedish authorities which participate in international cooperation that entails the exchange of information between Swedish and foreign authorities. The regulations are not completely consistent and uniform. The common denominator of most of them is that they prescribe secrecy for information that an authority has acquired or has at its disposal as a result of an international treaty with another state or international organisation. In principle this means that secrecy applies either to the extent prescribed in an international treaty or as a consequence of binding EC legislation.</p>
<p>However, one consequence of the framing of the legislation is that there is a risk that the authority in question might misunderstand the extent to which secrecy should apply with respect to the information concerned and that absolute secrecy is therefore applied too often. Moreover, as a general rule the regulations are practically impossible for outsiders to understand, while at the same time that the legislative technique used makes it hard for the legislator to have an overview of any possible changes to the official secrets act that might be necessary when new international agreements are entered into or when new regulations in accordance with EC legislation become applicable in Sweden. We therefore propose that four of these regulations – in chapter 7 section 14; chapter 8 sections 5 and 6; and chapter 9 section 3 of the official secrets act – should be co-ordinated in a new and more clearly framed regulation.</p>
<p>What these four regulations have in common is, among other things, that they only prescribe secrecy for information about individuals’ personal or financial circumstances and only in order to protect the individuals themselves. Moreover, one requirement for secrecy is that the underlying international agreements have been approved by the Swedish parliament. We propose that these regulations should be replaced by a new one, to the effect that secrecy for individuals should apply “to information about individuals’ financial or personal circumstances that is at the disposal of an authority due to Sweden’s membership of the EU or due to any other agreement approved of by the Swedish parliament with another state or an international organisation, if revealing this information would conflict with the agreement”.</p>
<p>No change of substance is intended, but the new regulation makes the legislation more clear. It is clear that secrecy can be a direct consequence of EC directives or EC regulations. This is already the case at the present time, but this is not obviously apparent from the current wording. It can therefore be difficult for the general public to realise that this is the case. By means of the requirement that an authority shall evaluate any harm by referring to the agreement in question, it is clearly stressed that secrecy must not be stricter than what is prescribed in secrecy clauses in the underlying agreement. This is also the case at the present time, without this being clearly deducible from the wording of the legislation. We consider that the new wording considerably reduces the risk that as a result of misunderstanding and misinterpreting, secrecy will be stricter in Sweden than what is actually required as far as international cooperation is</p>
<p>concerned. Moreover, the regulation will be directly applicable when in the future the Swedish parliament approves new agreements that contain binding secrecy clauses. In this way the risk that the legislator overlooks any possible need for changed regulations in the official secrets act will be eliminated.</p>
<p>A new regulation concerning secrecy is needed in order to protect public interests in the course of international work</p>
<p>When Sweden enters into agreements concerning the exchange of information with other states or with international organisations, demands are often made by the parties to the agreement that the records and information that are entrusted to Sweden should be kept secret if the state or organisation handing them over does not approve of them being disseminated. This is referred to as “originator control”. In certain cases this secrecy is regulated in separate treaties or agreements concerning security and particular protection for certain information. These are known as “security agreements”. At the present time, information that is confidential according to such security agreements can, almost without exception, be subject to secrecy by Swedish authorities on the basis of, primarily, secrecy concerning foreign matters according to chapter 2 section 1 of the official secrets act, since revealing such information may, as a matter of course, be presumed to disturb or damage Sweden’s international links. However, the purport of freedom of the press act is that it is the Swedish authority which has the custody of a document that has the ultimate responsibility of examining and deciding the question of secrecy. The consequence of this is that the Swedish parliament or government cannot, in the course of negotiations, guarantee the other parties to an agreement that the secrecy required as part of the security agreement will be respected. This situation often causes problems for Sweden when it comes to international cooperation with other states or with other international organisations than the EU. In their different ways, the solutions used at the present time to circumvent this problem entail difficulties or disadvantages for Sweden.</p>
<p>We therefore propose a new regulation to the effect that secrecy shall apply with respect to the public domain “for information that is at the disposal of an authority as the result of an agreement that has been entered into with another state or international organisation,</p>
<p>with the approval of the Swedish parliament, which entails particular protection for certain information, if revealing this information would conflict with the agreement.”</p>
<p>Since, at the present time, the information that will be subject to the regulation can already be kept secret on the basis of the requirements of the secrecy concerning foreign matters, the purpose of the regulation is not to provide an extension of secrecy with respect to international work. Instead the purpose is to give Sweden a better position in international negotiations. Moreover, in accordance with our proposal, the application of the regulation will be circumscribed in two very important aspects. Firstly, secrecy will be applicable only to information that is regulated in that particular type of security agreement. This means that secrecy clauses in, for example, treaties of association or regulations and directives in EC legislation cannot be cited in support of a refusal to divulge information in accordance with the new security regulation. Secondly, most of the current security agreements concerning particular protection for certain information are entered into by the government, but in order for the this new security to prevail, we propose the requirement that an agreement should be subject to the scrutiny of parliament.</p>
<p>In this manner we consider that Sweden’s ability to conduct negotiations in the field of international cooperation will be improved without the risk of secrecy being extended more than necessary or having a negative effect upon the openness in EU work that Sweden is seeking to attain.</p>
<p>Demands for greater clarity when an individual’s request to view public records is rejected</p>
<p>Nowadays when an authority considers the issue of releasing a public record and rejects the request in a decision that can be appealed against in accordance with chapter 15 section 6 of the official secrets act, the decision normally cites the regulation in the official secrets act upon which the authority bases its decision and states the reasons behind any possible evaluation of harm caused. When information is subject to a secrecy order on the basis of the contents of an international agreement, such a rejection does not actually give any information, since the actual section of the official secrets act only refers to an agreement or treaty that is not specified. It can therefore be difficult for an applicant to judge whether or not a rejection by an</p>
<p>authority is correct. Often it is quite simply impossible for an individual to judge whether or not there is a relevant international treaty that prescribes secrecy for the information in question, or at the very least what the treaty requires of the Swedish authority with respect to the issue of secrecy.</p>
<p>We therefore propose an addition to chapter 15 section 6 of the official secrets act to the effect that if an authority rejects a request to view a public document, on the basis of what is stipulated in an international agreement, the authority must clearly specify what agreement is meant and what regulation in the agreement is applicable. If secrecy is cited on the grounds of Sweden’s membership of the EU, the authority must instead indicate which EC regulation or which EC directive, and upon which applicable stipulation in the regulation it bases its decision. Naturally the authority must also, as is the case at the present time, state the applicable paragraph in the official secrets act and the reasons behind any evaluation of harm in accordance with the secrecy clauses in the international agreement or the regulations in accordance with EC legislation. In this way Swedish authorities will be obliged to explain to outsiders in a clear manner what evaluation they have made in any particular case with respect to secrecy, concerning information that is brought forth in the course of international cooperation.</p>
