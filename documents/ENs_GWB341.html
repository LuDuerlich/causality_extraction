<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Our mandate comprised a number of different issues, which could be divided into two main areas, namely, issues concerning traffick- ing in human beings and issues concerning child and forced marri- age. As regards the first part of our task, the Inquiry was directed to conduct a review of the provisions on trafficking in human beings contained in Chapter 4, Section 1 a of the Penal Code. This review was aimed at facilitating more effective action to combat trafficking in human beings and included making an assessment regarding whether the description of offences or range of penalties should be changed.</p>
<p>As regards trafficking in human beings, we were also directed to deliberate upon whether the requirement for double criminality should be removed and whether the Aliens Act (2005:716) should be supplemented in order to make satisfactory provision for the protection that aggrieved parties in cases involving trafficking in human beings or closely associated offences may need. In this respect, the assignment referring to the Aliens Act was based on the report of the Committee on Social Insurance 2005/06:SfU4 (p.17), which stated that the Committee considered that a special provision ought to be introduced into the Aliens Act stipulating that it should be possible for anyone who actively participates in legal proceedings, by appearing as a witness or as an aggrieved party, to be granted a permanent residence permit in Sweden, pro- vided the person in question is, as a result of so doing, in need of protection in Sweden. We also needed to analyse the issue of Swe- den’s accession to the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (ETS no. 197).</p>
<p>As regards child and forced marriage, we were required to investigate whether the applicable criminal law protection is satis- factory regarding child and forced marriage. We also considered that this part of our assignment included issues relating to the</p>
<p>application of Chapter 2 of the Penal Code entitled ‘On the Appli- cability of Swedish Law’.</p>
<p>The offence of trafficking in human beings contained in Chapter 4, Section 1 a of the Penal Code</p>
<p>The provision on trafficking in human beings, which is contained in Chapter 4, Section 1 a of the Penal Code, is currently worded in a way that may impede it from being implemented in an effective way. This manifests itself in, among other things, the fact that con- duct involving trafficking in human beings is to a large extent con- sidered to comprise other offences, such as procuring and grave procuring according to Chapter 6, Section 12 of the Penal Code. The penal provision contained in Chapter 4, Section 1 a of the Penal Code should therefore be afforded a new wording, clearly specifying the conduct that is to be criminalised as trafficking in human beings. However, the provision contained in Chapter 4, Section 1 a of the Penal Code should also in the future be worded in accordance with the internationally acceptable definition of ‘trafficking in human beings’.</p>
<p>The offence of trafficking in human beings shall contain requi- sites that clarify the fact that the offence involves a violation of personal integrity, which is currently indicated through a require- ment being imposed on the perpetrator having made use of impro- per means. This requirement shall be retained.</p>
<p>The requisites that describe the improper means shall be given a somewhat clearer and more readily understood meaning than they have at present. It will consequently be stated that anyone who makes use of unlawful coercion or deception, abuses someone’s vulnerable situation, abuses someone’s youth or defencelessness, or abuses someone’s dependent status, has used such a means that may result in liability for trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p>The current list of the kinds of acts of trafficking covered shall be supplemented by the possibility of a person, who by some improper means controls another in order to exploit her or him, being penalised for trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p>In the current provision, a requirement is imposed that the per- petrator assumes control of the victim by using improper means and implementing one of the kinds of acts of trafficking covered. The requirement contained in Chapter 4, Section 1 a, first para-</p>
<p>graph of the Penal Code that the perpetrator is to have assumed control of the victim has, in some cases, led to the provision being applied in a way that is ineffective. This requirement should conse- quently be removed.</p>
<p>As regards the elements concerning the aim of the exploitation, the current subjective requisite "with the aim that" should be remo- ved and replaced with "with the intention of". In the future, it shall consequently no longer be necessary for the perpetrator to have had the direct aim of exploiting the victim in order for the act to be punishable. It will instead be deemed sufficient for the perpetrator to have acted with indirect intent or with intention through indif- ference.</p>
<p>Chapter 4, Section 1 a, second paragraph of the Penal Code penalises the passing over or receiving control of a person as traf- ficking in human beings. As a consequence of the changes to Chapter 4, Section 1 a, first paragraph of the Penal Code proposed, the situations referred to in the current second paragraph of Chapter 4, Section 1 a of the Penal Code will be covered by the first paragraph of the provision. The current second paragraph of Chapter 4, Section 1 a of the Penal Code shall therefore be remo- ved.</p>
<p>Certain conduct involving trafficking in human beings begins with the disbursement or receipt of payment for the victim, though without using any of the means referred to in the statutory provi- sion. In order to be able to establish a comprehensive regulation of all of the steps that conduct involving trafficking in human beings may entail, such transactions should also be punished as trafficking in human beings. A provision that clarifies the criminalisation of commercial transactions of this nature should therefore be intro- duced into Chapter 4, Section 1 a, second paragraph of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>For criminal liability to be incurred for trafficking in human beings with a child (that is to say, a victim under the age of 18) the perpetrator is required to have implemented an act of trafficking by improper means with the intent that the victim should be exploited for one of the purposes referred to in the list contained in the pro- vision. In order to clarify the vulnerable position of the child, it should be indicated by Chapter 4, Section 1 a, third paragraph of the Penal Code that anyone committing an act as referred to in the first paragraph of the provision against a child should always be deemed to have abused the child’s defencelessness. In practice, the</p>
<p>provisions of Chapter 4, Section 1 a, third paragraph of the Penal Code, viewed together with our current proposal that the requisite regarding control contained in Chapter 4, Section 1, first paragraph of the Penal Code be removed, mean that no requirement is impo- sed for the perpetrator to have used improper means if the victim of the trafficking in human beings is under the age of 18.</p>
<p>It is consequently clear that the consent of the victim is irrele- vant to criminal liability. We therefore consider that there is no reason to introduce a provision into Chapter 4, Section 1 a of the Penal Code about the consent of the victim to the exploitation being irrelevant to criminal liability.</p>
<p>The proposed amendment to Chapter 4, Section 1 a, first para- graph of the Penal Code means that the point of completion of the offence is brought forward in time.</p>
<p>The penalty for trafficking in human beings should also conti- nue to be imprisonment for at least two and at most ten years. The milder range of penalty contained in the provision should also be retained.</p>
<p>Child and forced marriage</p>
<p>We consider that there are no preconditions for criminalising further acts of a less serious nature that may precede the entry of a forced marriage. Nor do we consider that there is a need to intro- duce special titles for the offences aimed at forced marriages that are not child marriages.</p>
<p>However, we consider that there is any need to introduce a pro- vision aimed at those marriages that are concluded with a child under the age of 16 that are not to be deemed to be forced marria- ges. We therefore propose that a penal provision whereby a custo- dian who allows a child under the age of 16, who is a Swedish citi- zen or is resident in Sweden, to enter into a marriage that is valid in the country where the ceremony is performed should be sentenced to imprisonment for at most two years for allowing child marriage. This provision should be introduced into Chapter 7 of the Penal Code, ‘Offences against Family’.</p>
<p>We also consider that there is a great need to implement educa- tion and information initiatives to achieve a change of attitude regarding these issues and that broader competence should be cre-</p>
<p>ated to satisfy the support and protection needs of vulnerable children and young people.</p>
<p>Double criminality</p>
<p>The offence of trafficking in human beings is a very serious offence that is of an international and cross border nature. In order to establish effective criminal law protection against trafficking in human beings, the requirement contained in Chapter 2, Section 2, second paragraph of the Penal Code on double criminality for offences committed abroad should not apply to trafficking in human beings or the secondary and inchoate forms of offence in the case of trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p>We also propose that a judgment made in another state should not constitute an impediment to a new prosecution in Sweden.</p>
<p>In order to establish an effective criminal law protection against permitting child marriages, the requirements contained in Chapter 2, Section 2, second paragraph of the Penal Code on double crimi- nality for offences committed abroad should not apply to this offence.</p>
<p>Residence permits for victims of trafficking in human beings</p>
<p>The powers to grant a permanent residence permit contained in the Aliens Act (2005:716) are sufficient to satisfy the need to grant such residence permits to victims of trafficking in human beings who have actively assisted as witnesses or aggrieved parties and who as a consequence thereof are in need of protection in Sweden. In our opinion, there is no need for any further provisions within the area of protection aimed at this particular situation. On the other hand, the provisions of Chapter 5, Section 6 of the Aliens Act should be made clearer by it being explicitly stated in the pro- vision that, when making an assessment, particular account should be taken of whether the alien has been subjected to trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p>Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings</p>
<p>In September 2003, work commenced on preparing a European Convention against Trafficking in Human Beings. Sweden signed the convention in May 2005. This convention aims to prevent and combat trafficking in human beings, design a complete system of rules as regards protection and assistance for victims of trafficking in human beings, guarantee more efficient criminal investigations and prosecution, and also to promote international cooperation. For Sweden to be able to accede to the convention, a statutory amendment of Chapter 9, Section 16 of the Secrecy Act (1980:100) is required with the aim of protecting information about the vic- tim’s private life during the court proceedings. Such a statutory amendment will be effected by the offence of trafficking in human beings being included in the list contained in Chapter 9, Section 16, first paragraph of the Secrecy Act. There are otherwise no statu- tory amendments required for Sweden to accede to the convention.</p>
<p>Other issues</p>
<p>In order for it to be possible to punish trafficking in human beings in an effective and purposeful way, it is critical in our opinion that education and training initiatives are implemented, aimed at law enforcement authorities that come into contact with issues relating to trafficking in human beings. Such efforts must be directed towards the various factors that facilitate trafficking in human beings, the situation of the victim and the wording of the criminali- sation. In the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, requirements are imposed calling for training to be implemented regarding these issues.</p>
<p>Also, concerning issues relating to child and forced marriage, there is a great need for training as regards the criminal law provi- sions that may be applied and the support that the victim ought to get. It is necessary to create an information base within this area, both within individual authorities and nationally. It should be pos- sible for this to be effected through establishing a resource centre to which individuals within authorities and schools, for instance, can refer in order to get advice and through the Government pro-</p>
<p>ducing an action plan oriented towards measures to combat child and forced marriage.</p>
<p>Entry into force</p>
<p>It is recommended that the proposed statutory amendments enter into force on 1 July 2009. There is no need to make any special transitional provisions.</p>
