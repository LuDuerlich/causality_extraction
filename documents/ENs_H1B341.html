<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit from the Government</h2>
<p>When parents want a pre-school place for their child, the municipality should normally be able to offer one within four months. This is stated in the Education Act (2010:800). Some municipalities have more far-reaching guidelines, for example, stating that a place should be offered within three months, but such commitments are voluntary.</p>
<p>In the Budget Bill for 2012, the Government noted that in most cases the municipalities offer a place within four months. The Government also pointed out that some municipalities do not do this, which causes major problems for the parents affected.</p>
<p>In light of this, the Government has tasked us with looking into whether new measures or incentives are needed so that municipalities will offer more children a pre-school place within the statutory time limit. Part of the remit is to investigate how widespread the problem of delays is and analyse the reasons for this. Another part is to look into various ways of giving parents financial compensation if the municipality does not offer a pre-school place within the time limit.</p>
<h2>Problem of delays</h2>
<p>To find out how widespread the problem is, we sent a survey to all of Sweden’s municipalities. The results indicate that approximately 3 000 children per year are forced to wait too long for a pre-school place, which is slightly more than 2 per cent of all children starting pre-school. According to the survey, these children have to wait 2–3 months too long on average. A total of 36 municipalities replied that they would probably not be able to offer places to all children within the time limit. Previous surveys have also shown that delays occur, although the extent of the problem has not been clear.</p>
<p>The reason for these delays seems to be primarily a lack of planning and prioritising in certain municipalities. For example, the population projections drawn up may not be good enough, cooperation within the municipality may not work well enough, or there may be a lack of preparedness to take swift action when there is a shortage of places. Sometimes pre-schools are given lower priority when a municipality has little money.</p>
<p>The problem of delays has a negative impact. Children miss out on their education and parents find it more difficult to get back to their jobs or other occupation. In the worst case scenario, they may lose their livelihood and parts of their social insurance protection. This may be the case if they have run out of parental benefit days.</p>
<p>Moreover, employers may encounter problems if employees do not return to work as planned, and newly arrived immigrants may be delayed in becoming established in working life and society. There is also a negative impact on gender equality. Delays probably also entail economic costs, as the number of hours worked decreases. One example calculation shows that the total cost may amount to SEK 180 million per year. Parents’ loss of income probably accounts for a significant share of this cost.</p>
<h2>Proposal for a pre-school guarantee</h2>
<p>The question, then, is whether new measures or incentives are needed. It is already possible for the Swedish Schools Inspectorate to take action against a municipality that does not offer a pre-school place within the time limit, for example by imposing a fine. The parents may also be entitled to compensation from the municipality, and if there is a decision to appeal, it is likely that a legality review in court can be brought about.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we consider that the present measures are insufficient and we therefore propose a national pre-school guarantee. Such a guarantee does not currently exist. The idea is that as many children as possible are offered a pre-school place within the time limit and that parents who are still left waiting too long receive better protection. Under the proposal, the guarantee would involve four different measures: 1. A clear ‘place deadline’ in the Education Act 2. An information obligation for municipalities 3. A reporting obligation for municipalities 4. Compensation to parents in the form of a waiting allowance</p>
<p>The measures are described below. The intention is that these measures combined will lead to effective planning and clear political priorities in all municipalities, resulting in children being offered a preschool place within the time limit. It is proposed that the new rules should enter into force on 1 January 2015.</p>
<h2>A clear ‘place deadline’ in the Education Act</h2>
<p>The term ‘place deadline’ should be included in the Education Act to clarify the latest date by which the municipality is obliged to offer a pre-school place. This should normally be the day that falls four months after the parents applied for a pre-school place. It could also be the date on which the parents want the child to start, as long as the application was submitted at least four months in advance. The new term straightens out a few question marks but does not imply any major changes compared with the current system.</p>
<h2>An information obligation for municipalities</h2>
<p>The second proposal is that the municipalities should be obliged to inform parents of when their application was received by the municipality and of the place deadline that has been calculated for their child. The municipality should also provide information about the possibility of receiving a waiting allowance if the child is not offered a pre-school place within the statutory time limit. This information must be provided in writing and must be sent out as soon as possible after the parents’ application has been received. Some municipalities already provide such information, but this is a voluntary undertaking and not an obligation.</p>
<h2>A reporting obligation for municipalities</h2>
<p>The third proposal is that once a year the municipalities should check how many children were not offered a place within the time limit during that year and report this figure to the Swedish Schools Inspectorate, the municipal assembly and the auditors working in each municipality. This will allow the general public to access information about any delays and the Swedish Schools Inspectorate to carry out an inspection and intervene against municipalities that do not fulfil their obligations. A similar reporting system is in place in the social services and seems to have had a positive effect on delays in this area.</p>
<h2>Waiting allowance for parents affected</h2>
<p>The fourth proposal is financial compensation for parents who have had to wait too long for a pre-school place. We propose that they should be entitled to apply for waiting allowance from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency. This is a benefit that should largely be equivalent to parental benefit but that is only paid when a parent has had to wait too long for a pre-school place. If all the requirements are met, the parent should be able to receive compensation equivalent to his or her parental benefit at basic level or sickness benefit level. This provides protection if a parent has run out of parental benefit days. This also means that parents who have parental benefit days left do not have to use these during the delay. Instead, these days can be saved for later use.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the municipality that has not offered a preschool place within the time limit should be responsible for paying the waiting allowance. In purely practical terms, the Swedish Social Insurance Agency should calculate how much the municipality is to pay. It is proposed that the liability for payment cover the waiting allowance that has been paid and in some cases also a financial penalty that will go to the state. The financial penalty is intended to even out the differences between parents with differing levels of income so that the municipality pays the same amount regardless of who is affected by the delay.</p>
<p>The waiting allowance thus has a dual function. On the one hand, it should give parents some security and, on the other hand, it should place pressure on the municipalities to offer a pre-school place to all children within the time limit. For 2013, a municipality that fails to do this would have to pay SEK 946 per child each day, or almost SEK 30 000 a month. This creates strong incentives to offer a pre-school place to all children within the statutory time limit.</p>
<h2>Consequential amendments in other regulatory frameworks</h2>
<p>For the waiting allowance system to work and provide parents with reasonable protection, consequential amendments are necessary in several different regulatory frameworks. For this reason, we have submitted proposals concerning parental leave, sickness benefit qualifying income, unemployment insurance, labour market programmes and introduction activities for certain newly arrived immigrants. We are also reviewing several other benefits so that parents do not receive double compensation. Finally, we propose that the waiting allowance be taxable and pensionable.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the pre-school guarantee</h2>
<p>If the pre-school guarantee is introduced, we believe that almost all children will be offered a pre-school place within the statutory time limit. It will therefore not be necessary to pay waiting allowance very often. More children being offered a place within the time limit is of course good for the children and their parents. It is also beneficial for the establishment of newly arrived immigrants and for gender equality. The economic impact on society is positive as more parents will be able to go back to work as planned. This will increase total tax revenue.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the pre-school guarantee apply to applications for pre-schools under public management, i.e. municipal pre-schools. A parent who only wants a place in an independent pre-school will therefore not be entitled to waiting allowance. However, we do not consider that the proposal will have any major negative impact on independent pre-schools.</p>
<p>However, there are risks and disadvantages in other areas. It cannot be ruled out that a municipality may increase the size of children’s groups excessively or take other inappropriate measures</p>
<p>to be able to offer a pre-school place within the time limit and thus avoid its obligation to pay. There are therefore reasons for the Swedish Schools Inspectorate to monitor developments closely if the pre-school guarantee is introduced. The municipalities should, of course, be able to offer places to all children within the time limit, while maintaining a good standard with reasonably sized children’s groups and an appropriate staff ratio.</p>
<p>One disadvantage of the proposal is that it limits local selfgovernment. The municipalities will be given new tasks and may be affected by high costs if they do not offer a pre-school place within the time limit, although the waiting allowance only applies to municipalities that fall short. We consider that the municipalities should receive financial compensation for their new tasks, but not for the waiting allowance or the financial penalty adopted.</p>
<p>Finally, the proposal will entail some costs for the state. It is estimated that the pre-school guarantee could cost the state SEK 30– 40 million initially, and there would also be some additional annual costs. However, a large share of the costs may be compensated by the municipalities that do not offer places within the time limit. The guarantee may even result in higher revenues than costs for the state.</p>
