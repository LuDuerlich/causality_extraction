<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>An asylum seeker has a fundamental obligation to help to verify their identity, or alternatively to plausibly demonstrate it. However, the number of asylum seekers who submit a passport document when applying to the Swedish Migration Agency is very low. This causes difficulties both for the examination of asylum cases and for enforcement of refusal-of-entry or expulsion orders.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s terms of reference, the Government stated that to be able to maintain a long-term, sustainable and humane migration policy that safeguards the right of asylum, it is crucial that people who have been issued with a final and non-appealable refusal-of-entry or expulsion order following legally certain examination processes return as quickly as possible; however, a large number of such people remain in the country for long periods. The enforcement of refusal-of-entry and expulsion orders is often impeded by the subjects absconding or not having identity documents.</p>
<p>In the terms of reference, the Government also pointed to the fact that an increasing number of people remain in the country without ever applying for a residence permit. This group, who primarily live outside of society, includes many vulnerable children and young people. From a child perspective, in particular, it is important that minors can be identified at an early stage. Some people remaining in the country use a variety of identities.</p>
<p>In the Government’s view, it is important that the authorities have the tools they need to work more effectively with return cases. Clearly establishing identity is important, firstly to ensure that the case is examined as correctly as possible, and secondly from a security perspective, to ensure oversight of who is in the country. The provisions in the Aliens Act on internal control of aliens, for example, should therefore be supplemented. The Government also considers it important that the authorities have the necessary support in law to curb abuse of identity documents.</p>
<p>In light of this, with a view to reducing the number of people whose identity cannot be established while in Sweden, the Inquiry has been tasked with making proposals to give the Swedish Police Authority enhanced possibilities to take fingerprints, and to confiscate passports or other identity documents. The Inquiry has also been tasked with making proposals on how abuse of travel documents, alien’s passports and residence permits can be counteracted.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals Photographs and fingerprints</h2>
<p>A possibility should be introduced into Chapter 9, Section 8 of the Aliens Act for the Swedish Police Authority to photograph an alien and take their fingerprints if the alien’s identity and right to remain in the country cannot be verified during a control under Section 9 of the same Chapter (internal control of aliens). The Swedish Migration Agency should also be permitted to implement these measures in such cases.</p>
<p>Moreover, the lower age limit for when fingerprints can be taken under Chapter 9, Section 8 of the Aliens Act should, for reasons outlined in the report, be lowered to six years of age. The same lower age limit should apply to the taking of fingerprints in connection with controls under Section 9 of the same Chapter.</p>
<p>It should also be possible for an alien whose identity and right to remain cannot be verified at an internal control of aliens to be escorted – not just summoned or collected – to be photographed and have their fingerprints taken, and for their right to remain in the country to be investigated. Fingerprinting should not apply to children under the age of six, however. The obligation under Chapter 9, Section 11 of the Aliens Act to remain for investigation should also apply upon escort under Section 9 of the same Chapter.</p>
<p>Photographs and fingerprints taken in connection with an internal control of aliens should be checked against existing registers. If this check shows that the alien is entitled to remain in Sweden, the photograph and fingerprints taken and the biometric data produced in connection with the control should immediately be destroyed. Otherwise, the photograph and fingerprints should be stored in a national register at the Swedish Migration Agency, as well as data about the control and the identity information that emerged in connection with it. Storage of this kind is possible under existing provisions. The data should be eliminated no later than ten years after registration. However, provisions on storage times should be incorporated into the ordinance. The Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Security Service should have direct access to the data in the register, which is possible under existing provisions.</p>
<p>The proposed measures will tangibly improve the authorities’ possibilities to establish an alien’s identity and right to remain in the country.</p>
<h2>Possibility to search for and confiscate passports and other identity documents</h2>
<p>In connection with an internal control of aliens, just as in border controls, the Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Coast Guard should be permitted to conduct personal searches of an alien and to search their luggage, hand luggage, handbags and other possession for passports and other identity documents. This should be possible to the extent necessary to ascertain the alien’s identity and right to remain in Sweden, when the alien fails to fulfil their obligation to show, upon request, a passport or other documents proving their identity and that they are entitled to remain in the country.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if in connection with an internal control of aliens it is not possible to verify that an alien is entitled to remain in Sweden, or if their identity is uncertain, the Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Coast Guard should be permitted to confiscate the alien’s passport or other identity documents pending the alien receiving a permit to stay here, or leaving the country. If it later emerges that the alien has a residence permit in Sweden or is entitled to remain here on some ground other than that they have applied for a residence permit, the documents should be returned to them, unless there are special reasons for not doing so.</p>
<p>The proposed measures can, where effective, be expected to help ensure quicker and more efficient enforcement of refusal-ofentry and expulsion orders.</p>
<h2>Abuse of documents</h2>
<p>Abuse of documents, including travel documents, takes place to a not inconsiderable extent. In 2016, certain new provisions were introduced to curb abuse of Swedish passports. To the extent possible, similar provisions to those applicable to Swedish passports should in principle apply to travel documents and alien’s passports, which can also be used for travel.</p>
<p>If so required by compelling considerations of national security or public order, a travel document should not be issued.</p>
<p>In cases other than those referred to in Chapter 2, Section 7 of the Aliens Ordinance, an application for a travel document should be rejected if in the five years prior to the application, three travel documents have been issued to the alien and there are no special reasons to approve the application.</p>
<p>In cases referred to in Chapter 2, Section 10 of the Aliens Ordinance, the travel document should be withdrawn.</p>
<p>A travel document should have a maximum validity period of two years. If an application for a travel document is granted and the applicant has lost a travel document issued to them within the five years prior to the application, the period of validity of the new travel document should be limited to one year, unless there are special reasons not to impose such a restriction.</p>
<p>An application for an alien’s passport should be rejected if, in the five years prior to the application, three alien’s passports have been issued to the applicant and there are no special grounds to approve the application. However, this should not apply if the alien’s passport is to be issued pursuant to Chapter 2, Section 1a, second paragraph of the Aliens Act.</p>
<p>In cases referred to in Chapter 2, Section 16 of the Aliens Ordinance, a valid alien’s passport should be withdrawn, unless there are special reasons not to do so. This also includes cases where a provisional alien’s passport is issued to the passport holder.</p>
<p>An alien’s passport should have a maximum validity period of three years.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes certain provisions regarding those cases where there is valid reason to suspect misuse of a previously issued travel document or alien’s passport.</p>
<p>A residence permit card should have a maximum validity period of three years, and should as a general rule be handed over personally to the person in whose name it is issued.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Sweden should push for the creation of a centralised EU database containing information on residence permits and residence permit cards, for example.</p>
<p>Some of the Inquiry’s proposals concerning these matters should be incorporated into the Aliens’ Act, while the rest of the proposals may be included in the Aliens’ Ordinance or in the</p>
<p>Swedish Migration Agency’s regulations concerning the documents mentioned above. It is the Inquiry’s opinion that the proposals laid out will considerably decrease the possibility to abuse the documents in question.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposals</h2>
<p>The Inquiry considers that it should be possible to achieve the overall objective of the remit – to ensure that more people without leave to remain in Sweden return to their country of origin and to curb abuse of certain documents – through the proposals made.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is estimated that the proposals will have the effect of making internal controls of aliens more effective, which should reduce costs in the migration area, as processing times for aliens cases (both permit cases and removal cases) can be expected to be reduced. They can also be expected to lead to more efficient enforcement, and thus to greater predictability for individuals who are subject to final and non-appealable removal orders.</p>
<p>The proposed measures should also reduce the cost to society associated with people without permits. Nonetheless, the proposals may entail some increased costs for the Swedish Police Authority, which has primary responsibility for internal controls of aliens. However, it should be possible to finance any cost increases through redistribution within the Authority’s appropriations. Moreover,</p>
<p>according to the Swedish Migration Agency, the Inquiry’s proposals concerning validity periods of residence permit cards and the collection of such cards will entail increased costs for the Migration Agency. It should also be possible to finance these cost increases through redistribution within the Migration Agency’s appropriations.</p>
<p>The proposed measures on identifying aliens are expected to increase the possibilities to protect vulnerable people, not least children.</p>
<p>These measures should also contribute to tangible security improvements, impeding terrorism and other serious cross-border crime. The proposals are expected to have a positive effect on law enforcement and the detection of crime in general, and on crime prevention. The proposals may also help achieve integration policy objectives.</p>
<p>It is not thought that the Inquiry’s proposals will lead to any violation of individuals’ privacy that is incompatible with applicable law. On the contrary, with the use of new technologies in internal controls of aliens, the inconvenience to individuals should be reduced.</p>
<p>The proposals are not expected to have any other consequences worthy of note.</p>
