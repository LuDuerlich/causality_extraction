<p>Points of departure</p>
<p>The background to the assignment of the Commission is the criticism that has on several occasions, in the general public discourse, been directed at judicial decisions on adoption of foreign nationals not being recognised as affording any unconditional right to a residence permit for the persons adopted. The assignment of the Commission was to determine the importance that should be attributed to an adoption of an adult person when assessing the matter of a residence permit for the adopted person and also to determine how administrative questions concerning this should be resolved. Ac- cording to the Terms of Reference of the Commission, certain issues of a similar nature relating to children were also to be investigated. The assignment included surveying the extent and nature of the conflicts that may arise between the adoption rules and the aliens legislation and to assess whether there is any reason to implement any measures.</p>
<p>There are adoptions where it is already clear at the start that no conflicts between the adoption rules and the aliens legislation will arise. For example, this applies when the person adopted is under the age of 12 years and the circumstances are such that he or she automatically becomes a Swedish national upon adoption. Adoptions where an adopted person, who is a minor, was a child who has been living abroad at the same home as a person who is resident in Sweden, or where an adopted adult has previously been a member of the same household abroad as an adoptive parent, also fall outside the scope of the assignment. In the latter cases, the opportunities to obtain a residence permit correspond exactly with that applicable for immigrants’ biological children. Nor are adoptions that have taken place under the Hague Convention of 29 May 1993 on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoptions or adoptions of Nordic nationals affected by the assignment.</p>
<p>The survey</p>
<p>As a step in the survey of the conflicts, the Commission has conducted various investigations to establish the extent to which adopted non-Nordic persons, who are 12 years or more, have been granted residence permits in Sweden. In the investigations, decisions concerning residence permits have been split into two groups, one for adoption decisions issued in Sweden and one for adoption decisions issued abroad. The latter group has in its turn been divided into adoption decisions that apply automatically in Sweden and adoption decisions that apply subject to the approval of the National Board for Intercountry Adoptions (NIA). In total, the Commission has reviewed approximately 130 residence permit matters relating to adopted persons. Almost all those adopted who were adopted in accordance with a decision of a Swedish court or in accordance with an adoption decision which was issued abroad and approved by NIA – and who had applied for a residence permit – had been granted a permit at the time of the investigation. In some cases the application for a residence permit was rejected by the Swedish Immigration Board but granted by the Aliens Appeals Board. As regards adopted persons who were adopted under an adoption decision issued abroad that applies automatically in Sweden, there is no possibility to examine the extent to which residence permits have been applied for and granted.</p>
<p>Conflicts</p>
<p>The Commission has formed the opinion that it is primarily when adopted children are in some way disadvantaged in comparison with other children that the adoption provisions and the aliens legislation contradict each oth-er and that there is reason to speak of a conflict. The Commission has, in this connection, considered that three various situations should be afforded particular attention.</p>
<p>The first situation deals with the legal effects of the adoption in matters relating to residence permits. In the investigation conducted by the Commission, two cases were discovered where the aliens authorities rejected an application for a residence permit because an adoption decided abroad was considered to have primarily had the purpose of getting a Swedish residence permit for the adopted person. However, the Commission has been doubtful about regarding this situation as a conflict. This is primarily because there are no conflicts between decisions based on Swedish regulations when the family link that arose by a foreign adoption decision was evaluated in a matter concerning a residence permit in Sweden. However,</p>
<p>was issued in Sweden, a conflict would arise.</p>
<p>In the two other situations, there are such risks for what the Commission regards to be conflicts, that there is reason to implement measures. In one case this relates to vagueness in the rules for residence permits and the other case concerns inadequacies in information about the legislation.</p>
<p>The proposal and position adopted by the Commission</p>
<p>The legal effects of adoption in matters concerning residence permits</p>
<p>The Commission has considered that there is, first and foremost, reason to clearly establish what legal effects an adoption decision should have in a matter concerning a residence permit for the adopted person.</p>
<p>The family link that arise through an adoption decision that is issued by a Swedish court shall always be recognised by the aliens authorities. This is a result of both the examination that the court conducts before pronouncing an adoption decision and also the legal effects of the adoption in accordance with Swedish law. If the aliens authorities do not accept the family link that has arisen by the adoption, this virtually amounts to a reconsideration of the assessment made by the court. As a matter of principle, such an arrangement cannot be accepted.</p>
<p>As regards adoptions issued abroad that apply in Sweden in accordance with the Act on International Legal Relations concerning Adoptions (1971:796), there is scope, in a matter concerning a residence permit, for taking into account whether the adoption was implemented mainly in order that the adopted person should attain a more advantageous position in a matter concerning a residence permit and, as a consequence thereof, denying the effect of the adoption (cf. Government Bill 1971:113, p. 38 and Government Bill 1996/97:25, p. 111 f.). The Commission considers that there is a need for such a scope. As previously, it should thus be possible to take into account, when concerning a residence permit matter, that the adoption arose in an attempt to circumvent the aliens legislation, provided there are strong reasons for so doing. Thus, it is likely that there will be comparatively few cases where it may be appropriate to deny the legal effect of a foreign adoption in a matter concerning a residence permit.</p>
<p>The legal regulation</p>
<p>The importance that an adoption has in a matter concerning a residence permit not only affects the legal effect of the adoption, but also the possibilities to obtain a residence permit as prescribed by the immigration law rules. The opportunities to obtain a residence permit for adopted persons are neither mentioned in the provision that deals with residence permits for relatives (Chapter 2, Section 4, Aliens Act) nor in the travaux préparatoires  of the Act (Government Bill 1996/97:25). According to the Aliens Act, a minor unmarried child should be granted a residence permit if he or she was a child living at the home of a person resident in Sweden. Adult children may be granted a residence permit if they were previously a member of the same household as a parent resident in Sweden. As regards adults, it is a precondition that the joint household existed immediately prior to the parent moving to Sweden and that the application i presented rather soon thereafter. When the adoption has taken place recently, the adopted person seldom satisfies the requirements relating to prior joint home. When applying the law in such cases, the applications for residence permits of both minors and adults that have been adopted have been considered in accordance with a provision prescribing that a residence permit may be granted if the applicant has special links with Sweden (Chapter 2, Section 4, first paragraph, item 4, Aliens Act). According to the assessment of the Commission, it is necessary to adapt the legislation to the situation of the adopted person.</p>
<p>In practice, minors have normally already, by the adoption decision, been considered to have such a special link to Sweden that a residence permit has been granted. However, the formulation of the provision leaves scope for a rather extensive consideration of the matter. Item 4 – which in accordance with the travaux préparatoires  is in this connection intended to be a provision to be used in exceptional cases – is also ill-fitted for minor adopted persons, who comprise an important, and as regards number not a completely insignificant, group of applicants. The Commission considers that the opportunity of minor adopted persons to obtain residence permits should correspond more closely with the arrangements that have been developed through the application of the law and with that applicable for children who have been children living at the same home as someone who is resident in Sweden. The Commission therefore proposes a supplement to Chapter 2, Section 4, first paragraph, Aliens Act, whereby it should be prescribed that minor adopted persons have, in the normal case, a right to a residence permit.</p>
<p>It shall also be possible in the future to grant residence permits to adopted persons who are 18 years or more in accordance with the statutory provisions that are applied today. However, a clarification is proposed so that it is explicitly stated in the Act that special links to Sweden means both a link with relatives and other special links. In this way, adopted adults who have not previously been a member of the same household with the adoptive parents, will, in a more clear way, fall within to the scope of the provision.</p>
<p>Opinion of the Swedish Immigration Board</p>
<p>It is the opinion of the Commission that the adoption decisions made in Sweden should be founded on the broadest information base possible. As indicated in the Government Bill 1980/81:112, it may be appropriate, when a national from a non-Nordic country is adopted, that the views of the Swedish Immigration Board are obtained. The investigations of the Commission have shown that today such opinions are obtained in one-fourth of the matter where the person involved is adopted by non-Nordic nationals and aged 12 years or more. As the aliens authorities should, without further investigation, recognise the family link that arises by an adoption decision that has been issued by a Swedish court, there is reason to, in adoption matters, be more consistently alert concerning whether the primary aim of the adoption may comprise an endeavour to circumvent the aliens legislation. Therefore, the Commission proposes that Swedish courts should, as a matter of course, obtain opinions from the Swedish Immigration Board. This applies when the adoption relates to a non-Nordic national who is 12 years or more, unless obtaining such an opinion is manifestly unnecessary – e.g. when the person who is to be adopted already has a permanent residence permit.</p>
<p>Investigation from the child’s home country</p>
<p>It is the Commission’s decided opinion that, when the adoption relates to a foreign minor child, an opinion from the appropriate authority or organisation in the home country of the child should be included in the adoption matter, whenever it is in practical terms possible to obtain such views. A proposal for such arrangements has already been submitted by the Guardianship Commission in the report Adoption Issues (Official Government Report – SOU 1989:100). It is also a requirement that such opinions are obtained as regards adoptions under the Hague Convention of 29 May 1993</p>
<p>on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Ad- options. The information base for judicial decisions would be further broadened if opinions from the child’s home country were obtained. However, as this matter is being examined in another connection, the Commission does not make any proposal for legal regulation.</p>
<p>Information</p>
<p>Inadequacies in information about the legislation may have detrimental consequences for individual adopted persons. The view of the Commission is, therefore, that information about the legislation must be improved. The Commission proposes that the National Courts Administration and Swedish Immigration Board jointly prepare easily understood information material concerning the legal effects of adoptions and the possibilities of adopted persons to obtain a residence permit in Sweden. The material should be given to persons in Sweden who apply for adoption. The Swedish Immigration Board shall also provide, through the Swedish embassies and consulates, information about the possibilities for adopted persons to obtain residence permits in Sweden.</p>
