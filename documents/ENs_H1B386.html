<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>This interim report is a situation report of the work carried out by the parliamentary Air Defence Committee in 2013. A final report will be published in December 2014. Under its terms of reference, the Committee is to examine, analyse and evaluate the entirety of and the needs within the Swedish air defence after 2040. The Committee is to evaluate future operational needs and propose objectives for air defence beyond 2040. The results of the examination should provide a basis for a long-term strategy concerning the capabilities Sweden will need in this area. In its work, the Committee is to proceed from an essentially preserved level of economic ambition for air defence.</p>
<p>The examination covers air power. This refers to air defence forces and the anti-aircraft systems included in air operations. It means that air defence for a unit’s own protection is not included in the examined air defence.</p>
<p>Transport aircraft are not included in the examination under its terms of reference. The Committee has decided not to include helicopter units in the examination since these systems are only considered to contribute to air operations to a limited extent. The examination deals with all relevant types of missions included in air operations which, according to Försvarsmaktens Doktrin för luftoperationer  (Swedish Armed Forces air operations doctrine) covers counter-air operations, counter-land operations, counter-sea operations, airborne transport, air reconnaissance, search and rescue, and airborne command and control. Although transport aircraft are not included in the examination, it should be possible to include such mission types as airborne transport; air transport and air to air refuelling.</p>
<p>As the period of time under examination is far in the future, it is not reasonable to attempt a forecast of security policy and military strategy developments and hence the subsequent need of air power. However, the Committee has deemed it necessary to investigate</p>
<p>alternative international developments that may place different demands on air power in order to asses the impact of different requirements.</p>
<p>The Committee’s working procedure involves five main steps:</p>
<p>• International development scenarios – drawing up potential alternative security policy situations in 2040;</p>
<p>• Air defence structures that are adapted to these potential scenarios;</p>
<p>• Evaluation of these air defence structures relative to the potential scenarios;</p>
<p>• Feasibility studies – identification of possibilities and limitations to achieving these air defence structures by 2040 based on the current situation; and</p>
<p>• Analysis and synthesis.</p>
<p>This interim report describes essentially an analysis of its task, the method used and the first main step of the working procedure: the international development scenarios. These scenarios are characterised by three relevant factors: level of conflict, degree of international cooperation and operational environment. The examined conflict levels are: peace , crisis  and war . The degrees of international cooperation are: Sweden alone, Sweden and a small state, Sweden and a major power,  and Sweden and several states . Operating environments are: the Baltic Sea, the Norwegian Sea,  sub-Saharan  Africa  and an unconventional aggressor .</p>
<p>The work of drawing up various adapted air defence structures has begun and will continue in 2014 when the air defence structures will be evaluated and feasibility tests will be conducted.</p>
<p>The Committee has adopted the name ‘Air Defence Committee’.</p>
