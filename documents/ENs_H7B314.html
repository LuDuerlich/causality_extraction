<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Our assignment</h2>
<p>Our overall assignment has been to investigate and propose changes to the requirements and routines applicable to Swedish identity documents with the aim of reducing the increasing amount of frauds committed using falsified documents. Among other things, this assignment has consisted of analysing how the number of documents and issuers can be limited, how verification of the authenticity and validity of the documents can be improved, how they should be issued and designed to be more secure, and whether physical identity documents should include electronic identification at the highest authentication level. The assignment has also included proposing a uniform regulation for valid identity documents and submitting necessary legislative proposals.</p>
<h2>Government identity documents</h2>
<p>We propose a new act and ordinance on government identity documents with provisions for government identity cards and government electronic identification. In the act, the term government physical identity documents refers to the physical identity documents that are issued by central government, which is to say the new ID card and passport.</p>
<p>The ID card can be issued with or without the travel document function and replaces both the national identity card and the identity card for those registered as residents in Sweden. Issuing ID cards with a travel document function means that, as well as being usable as identity documents, it will also be possible to use them as travel documents, instead of passports, for travel within the EU. This corresponds to the current rules for national identity cards. The new</p>
<p>ID cards may also carry government electronic identification. Passports will continue to be regulated by the Passport Act.</p>
<h2>Government physical identity documents allow for secure identification</h2>
<p>At present, many documents are accepted as proof of identity, complicating the control of the documents’ authenticity and validity and meaning that these can be abused. Passports and the proposed government ID cards comply with the security requirements that should be made of identity documents and meet the need for identity documents among the country’s inhabitants. Consequently, only these documents should be accepted as physical identity documents in situations requiring secure identification.</p>
<p>A government physical identity document should be demanded to verify identity in connection with the issuance of passports and government identity cards, and in situations subject to the Act on Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Prevention).</p>
<p>However, the intention is also for such documents eventually to be the only identity documents used in other situations where there is a need to perform secure identity checks, for example when collecting letters and parcels at postal service points.</p>
<p>This means that, under the proposed legislation, driving licences will not be government identity documents. The reason for this is that driving licences do not comply with the security requirements that should be imposed for identity documents. Among other things, driving licenses have far too long periods of validity and no personal appearance is required for renewal. Above all, driving licenses are documents that verify competency to drive a vehicle, not identity documents.</p>
<h2>Government electronic identification on government identity cards</h2>
<p>Increasing digitalisation is making it increasingly difficult to cope with life in society without access to electronic identification. It is therefore important that everybody is given the opportunity to obtain secure electronic identification. Secure electronic identification also contributes towards counteracting identity-related crime. Secure basic identification performed by a government agency via a personal appointment reduces the risk of the wrong person getting access to electronic identification.</p>
<p>We propose that government electronic identification at the highest authentication level be included on the government identity card. It must also be possible to use electronic identification to create an electronic signature. This can be issued to persons aged 13 or over who are Swedish citizens or registered as Swedish residents.</p>
<p>The issuance of electronic identification will follow the same process as the issuance of ID cards. The same high level of security as for government physical identity documents will thereby be achieved.</p>
<p>As well as being usable for identification at a distance, government electronic identification can also be used for identity checks made when collecting letters and parcels, for example. Checking electronic identification at the same time as the physical identity document is checked makes identity checks more secure. To streamline checks, electronic identification checks could also replace checks of physical documents when this is deemed sufficient.</p>
<h2>The Swedish Police Authority will issue government identity documents</h2>
<p>We propose that the Swedish Police Authority takes the main responsibility for issuance. Large synergy gains can be achieved by allowing one public authority to take responsibility for issuing government identity documents. This creates conditions to make the process more uniform and secure, to improve the security level of the documents and to achieve better control. It also leads to cost savings and more efficient issuance activities.</p>
<p>The Swedish Police Authority already has a comprehensive and effective operation for the issuance of passports and national identity cards. Restricting the number of issuers also forms part of combating identity theft and identity-related fraud, which makes it particularly appropriate for the Swedish Police Authority to have responsibility for issuing all government identity documents.</p>
<p>Missions abroad and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs will be able to issue passports and identity cards to Swedish citizens in the same way as at present. The government identity cards issued by the missions abroad can also carry government electronic identification.</p>
<h2>The process for issuing government identity documents</h2>
<p>The new act and the new ordinance, as well as the provisions announced pursuant to them, will fully regulate the process for issuing government identity cards and electronic identification.</p>
<p>Appearing in person is fundamental for the security of the issuance process. It is therefore normally required for applicants to make a personal appearance both when applying for and when collecting ID cards. However, it is also possible to apply by proxy so that cards are available to persons who are unable to visit the issuing authority due to illness, disability or old age. Proxy applications, however, cannot be used to obtain ID cards able to function as travel documents, but only cards without this function.</p>
<p>Other security-enhancing regulations surround this procedure, as the applicant does not make a personal appearance. Among these, the applicant must verify, in a written certificate, their inability to attend in person and the proxy must report in person to submit the application and collect the ID card.</p>
<p>The applicant must verify their identity with a government physical identity document when the application is made. If the applicant does not have one, their identity can be verified with certain European passports, with the help of a certifier or, as a last resort, in another reliable way. The identity of an applicant who has been granted a residence permit can be verified using information held by the Swedish Migration Agency regarding that person’s residence permit. The issuing authority can also check the fingerprints and facial image as indicated by the residence permit card. If the application is made by a proxy, the identity of the proxy must be verified with a government physical identity document. Certain European passports will also be accepted. Before the identity card is issued, the applicant must, upon request, verify their identity in the same way as upon application.</p>
<p>The ID card will be valid for five years. The Government or the government agency appointed by the Government can announce regulations on the restriction of the period of validity in specifically stated cases.</p>
<p>Previously issued government identity cards must be surrendered for destruction upon the issue of a new identity card. This applies whether or not the old card was issued with the travel document function. Each person may therefore only hold one government identity card.</p>
<p>A government identity card may be withdrawn if any important information on the card is incorrect or is no longer applicable, or if it is damaged or worn out or has been amended without permission. In addition, a card may be withdrawn if there were impediments towards issuing the card at the time of issue and these impediments persist, as well as if another party than the person to whom the identity card was issued has the card at their disposal. If the card is withdrawn, the government electronic identification on the card will also cease to be valid. Electronic identification can also be withdrawn if security reasons make this necessary. Such withdrawal can be limited to a specific period of no longer than six months.</p>
<p>Some amendments are also proposed to passport legislation with the aim of making the process for the issue of passports more secure. Upon application for and collecting a passport, the applicant, as a general rule, must verify their identity with a government physical identity document. Exemptions corresponding to those proposed for government identity cards will also apply to passport applications. Furthermore, any previously issued passport must be surrendered for destruction when a new passport is issued. Passports may also be withdrawn if any important information on the passport is incorrect or no longer applicable.</p>
<h2>Register of ID cards and electronic identification</h2>
<p>There will be a register of ID cards, in the same way as today. Information on government electronic identification will also be registered.</p>
<p>Personal data may be processed if it is necessary for the issuing authority’s operations for the issue of cards and electronic identification. Personal data collected for these operations may also be processed if this is necessary for the issue of passports, for border control or to provide data in compliance with laws or ordinances. This also applies if it is considered necessary to prevent, hinder or uncover criminal activities, to investigate or prosecute crimes, or to maintain general order or security. Finally, data may be processed for other purposes, provided that the data is not processed in a manner that is incompatible with the purpose of collection.</p>
<p>Data and documents in the register may not be processed for a time longer than that necessary for the purpose of the processing and no longer than ten years after the expiry of the period of validity of the ID card or the rejection of the application for an ID card.</p>
<h2>Fingerprints and facial images</h2>
<p>Identity documents containing biometric material ensure the connection between the document and the person to whom it was issued. The use of biometric data is therefore an effective way of counteracting the abuse of identity documents. It also makes it more difficult to counterfeit the document. We therefore propose that fingerprints and facial images be stored on the government identity cards. It must be possible to check the fingerprints and facial images both when applying for and when collecting a new ID card or passport. Checks must also be possible when travelling to or from Sweden.</p>
<p>Children below the age of six and people who cannot provide fingerprints for physical reasons are exempt from the requirement for fingerprints. It must be possible to issue identity cards with shorter periods of validity for applicants with physical injuries of a temporary nature.</p>
<p>Instead of allowing the issuing authority to take fingerprints and a facial photograph, people applying for ID cards via proxies must attach a faithful photograph to their application. Both proxy and a witness must certify, in a written affidavit, that the application has been made by the applicant and that the photograph attached to the application faithfully represents the applicant.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the application for ID card and passport, it must be possible for the issuing authority to perform searches of facial images and biometric data in the ID card register and passport register. It must be possible to make equivalent searches when passport applications are made. The use of facial recognition can ensure that one person does not get ID cards issued for several identities. Searches of such data may not otherwise be performed. Just as for facial images, secrecy will be applied to the biometric data obtained from these and stored in the passport and ID card register unless it is clear that the data can be disclosed without that individual or a person close to them suffering harm.</p>
<p>However, fingerprints and biometric data obtained from these may not be processed in the ID card register but may only be stored temporarily in the case management system. The data may be saved with the aim of performing quality control of the identity document when it is collected. The data may not be used for searches. It may only be saved until the identity card is collected or the application is withdrawn or rejected. After this, the data must be deleted without delay.</p>
<h2>Checking identity documents’ authenticity and validity</h2>
<p>The checks that should be made of the authenticity and validity of identity documents vary from context to context. Different operations require different degrees of security. However, our proposal to restrict the number of physical identity documents that can be accepted, in situations where a particularly high degree of security is demanded, to passports and government identity cards will lead to a greater distribution of more secure identity documents, making it, in turn, possible to demand more effective and secure checks in other contexts too. The proposals for the government identity card to include fingerprints and facial images, and for central government to issue electronic identification to be included in the government identity cards, mean that it will be easier to check identities and will provide an incentive for more secure checks.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions</h2>
<p>It is proposed that our proposals enter into force on 1 January 2022. The long period until entry into force is needed to allow the Swedish Police Authority to manage the transition. For the same reason, transitional provisions are needed for the period of validity of the cards being used at present. It will be possible to use driving licenses and identity cards certified by the Swedish Standards Institute to verify the bearer’s identity when applying for a government identity document for one year following entry into force. It will be possible to use national identity cards and identity cards for those registered as residents in Sweden for the remaining period of validity of the cards when applying for a government identity document and in situations covered by the Act on Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Prevention). It will also be possible to use national identity cards when travelling in the EU.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>The aim of our proposals is to counteract fraud committed with the use of identity documents. The proposals mean that the identity documents issued will be more secure. This will help prevent people from either obtaining incorrect identity documents or making and using counterfeit documents. The proposals are expected to reduce identity-related crime and have positive effects for crime prevention work.</p>
<p>As our proposals aim to increase the usage of government identity cards, the number of applications for cards can be expected to increase. Furthermore, our proposals concerning fingerprints and facial images mean that some technical equipment will have to be obtained. The proposal for government electronic identification will also entail some costs. However, as our starting point is that the fee for the ID card will also continue to cover all costs, costs for the Swedish Police Authority are not expected to increase.</p>
<p>When government identity documents are all issued by one authority, the same staff, equipment and premises can be used, allowing synergy gains. Consequently, there is no reason to assume that the unit cost for issuing cards will increase, meaning that the fee for cards will be largely unchanged.</p>
<p>Our proposals, however, entail a certain expense for individuals who do not have an ID card issued by the Swedish Police Authority or the Swedish Tax Agency and who, in addition to their driving licenses, must obtain another card. However, the additional cost individuals may have to bear due to this will only amount to SEK 400 every fifth year. This must be placed in relation to the aim of the proposals, which is to protect individuals, among other things from the financial inconvenience that can arise when an individual’s identity is used for fraudulent purposes.</p>
<p>For companies performing identity checks, our proposals mean that document checks will be facilitated and the risk of being subjected to fraud will decrease. Even if our proposals do not prohibit the issue of other ID cards than government ones, they can be expected to have certain consequences for companies issuing cards certified by the Swedish Standards Institute. As these cards only make up a small proportion of identity documents issued, the consequences for these issuers should be relatively limited. Both companies issuing other forms of electronic identification and companies with eServices can benefit from the government electronic identification we propose.</p>
