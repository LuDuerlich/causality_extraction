<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Through the municipalisation reform, municipalities received full employer responsibility for all school staff as of 1991. Municipalities were also given responsibility to determine how resources should be allocated between different parts of the school system. Through municipalisation, municipalities were also given responsibility for organising schools and adult education, for following up and evaluating their own activities, and for developing these activities and offering continuing professional development for staff.</p>
<p>In the Social Democratic Government’s assessment, although pupil performance in Swedish schools appeared to be good in an international comparison, some pupils did not receive sufficient support in the integrated school that was introduced in the 1970s. Decentralisation to municipalities was intended to give rise to a new form of education involving increased cooperation between teachers and a school system that was better supported by citizens and school staff. Welfare policy had arrived at a crossroads. Continued improvement of public sector services, it was thought, could no longer take place by increasing government appropriations. Decentralisation, reduced detailed regulation and a transition to management by objectives and results would make the school system more appropriate and effective.</p>
<p>However, municipalisation, was a failure. Municipalities, school heads and teachers were never given the opportunity to prepare themselves for the new mandate. A new curriculum, designed as an adaptation to the new way of managing schools, was abstract and difficult for teachers to implement in their teaching. Follow-up and evaluation in the municipalities did not work. For reasons of principle, the National Agency for Education did not support school organisers and teachers; the whole point of decentralisation was that education providers would themselves find ways to satisfy the Government’s objectives. Moreover, under a new centre-right</p>
<p>government, many of the state policy instruments that were set up as conditions for municipalisation were either abolished or fundamentally changed. Through a further change in the system of central government grants in 1993, municipalities also assumed responsibility for deciding on allocation of resources between schools and other municipal activities. The rules concerning teacher qualifications were also liberalised. The financial crisis of the early 1990s was the main reason for these further deregulations, which in turn made cuts in school funding possible. Decentralisation thus became more far-reaching than was originally intended. The same Government also introduced the school choice system and the independent school reform, which made municipalities’ task of running schools more difficult.</p>
<p>The central government’s excessive transfer of power and responsibility for schools to municipalities, school heads and teachers in connection with municipalisation had an impact on both pupil performance and equality in schools. The performance of Swedish pupils has deteriorated and continues to decline according to international surveys. Teachers’ working conditions have deteriorated as a result of increased external management of schools and extensive documentation and other administrative requirements. Teacher salary growth has been poor for a long time, and the proportion of teachers lacking formal qualifications is high.</p>
<p>In order to address these problems, the central government has intervened in recent years with clearer learning goals, clearer performance requirements, more stringent qualification requirements, extensive initiatives for school improvement and continuing professional development, and stricter supervision. A ‘decentralised management by objectives’ has been replaced by a ‘centralised performance-based management’. It is still too early to see the results of these efforts to tighten up the system. However, there is a risk that supervision and control could become too rigorous and shift into an ‘Audit Society’, stifling teachers’ creativity and job satisfaction. To combat this, however, the Government has taken measures aimed at reducing teachers’ administrative burden.</p>
<p>Research shows that teachers are schools’ most important resource. Confidence in teachers and improvements in their working conditions stand out as the most urgent change needed in the Swedish school system.</p>
<p>In recent years, the central government has re-entered the school sphere with vigorous measures in areas in which it previously was</p>
<p>not as involved, although formally the same division of responsibility between the central government and municipalities has been retained. Whether the central government should reassume responsibility for the public school system and municipalities’ other assignments within the school system is an issue that is beyond the remit of this Inquiry to comment on. However, it is clear that a return to the division of responsibilities and centralised management by rule that prevailed prior to municipalisation is not a realistic alternative for today’s municipal schools. A modern school system that is accountable to the central government requires a regional or local central government organisation with a certain amount of independence from the Government and central school authorities. The central government cannot abdicate its responsibilities in the school world, regardless of which authority is responsible.</p>
