<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Committee on Public Administration has had the task of reviewing the tasks and organisation of the state administration. The purpose of the review, which encompasses all state agencies under the Government, is to make state administration and activities more effective and efficient by:</p>
<p>• clarifying what the state should undertake to do in the form of agency tasks,</p>
<p>• creating good conditions for the Government to govern state activities,</p>
<p>• putting in place a clearer and more easily grasped structure for state administration in various respects, and</p>
<p>• increasing the ability of the agencies to contribute to efficiency measures and carry out their tasks in light of the requirements made by EU membership.</p>
<p>The Committee on Public Administration has previously submitted an interim report entitled Opinion-forming  activities and small government agencies  (SOU 2007:107).</p>
<p>The tasks undertaken by the state</p>
<p>Since the mid-1990s the number of state agencies under the Government has decreased by more than two thirds. The Committee on Public Administration estimates that in 2009 there will be about 400 agencies. In addition to these, there are some 600 bodies that have tasks within the framework of tasks undertaken by the state but that are not agencies, such as non-profit associations and state-owned companies. These bodies do not come within the remit of the Committee on Public Administration.</p>
<p>The Committee on Public Administration notes that the question of what tasks should be dealt with by a state agency is ultimately a matter for political decision. The matters covered by such decisions have varied depending on the conditions, knowledge and values prevailing at different times. However, the Committee indicates certain areas where, for one reason or another, it is difficult to imagine that the state would not have to perform certain tasks. This applies to military defence, police services, the judicial system, foreign representation and taxation. The Committee also notes that the state needs to perform certain tasks of a regulatory and supervisory nature to maintain a working market economy. In total, the Committee estimates that expenditure on these types of tasks costs the central government budget between SEK 90 billion and SEK 120 billion in 2006.</p>
<p>The state can solve many other tasks in addition to those already mentioned. In the case of Sweden, the first two chapters of the Instrument of Government provide guidance on which tasks it should fall to state agencies or other public agencies to perform. However, in various areas, the form, funding and management of activities can vary in light of the requirements that should be made from the point of view of democracy, legal certainty and efficiency. Moreover, the perception that the state should solve a certain task does not say anything definite about the level of ambition, in economic or other terms, that must apply. In general, there is considerable freedom of action here. Nonetheless, the Committee’s opinion is that most state undertakings presuppose tasks of one form or another for government agencies, such as supervision.</p>
<p>Competitive activities run by agencies</p>
<p>The Committee on Public Administration has had special instructions to scrutinise and review activities engaged in by agencies in areas open to competition. The study commissioned by the Committee found that these activities had a volume of approximately SEK 25 billion in 2006, distributed across 109 state agencies.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that a general rule be introduced by law, stipulating that state agencies are not allowed to sell goods and services in competitive markets or markets that are potentially open to competition. The Committee’s proposal will allow the Government to decide on exceptions to the general rule in individual cases and on the basis of certain criteria. In addition, the Committee proposes that agencies authorised to sell a good and/or service in a competitive market be required to report revenue and costs associated with these activities separately. In the Committee’s opinion, inter-agency purchases of goods and services should be covered by the principles that apply to public procurement in general.</p>
<p>Governance: An act on state administration</p>
<p>The agencies are necessary instruments for implementing decisions taken by the Riksdag (Parliament) and the Government. Consequently, the way in which the agencies are governed is highly important in enabling the Government and the Riksdag to fulfil the political mandate that the electorate has given them. The governance exercised by the Government should be adapted to fit the activities and organisation of each agency. However, it is essential that the focus is on the results and efficiency achieved by the agencies. Central government must ensure that tax revenues are used well and economically. The Committee on Public Administration proposes that when they are established, state agencies should be given a mandate for a limited, specified time.</p>
<p>The Committee on Public Administration considers certain matters of state administration to be so important for implementing democracy that the Riksdag should decide on the basic principles and arrangements. Similarly, the Committee considers that the provisions concerning the activities of the administrative agencies should be characterised by stability and a long-term perspective. The Committee therefore considers that the regulation of the basic principles and arrangements for parliamentary and governmental governance of the agencies should be given legislative form. At the same time, the formulation and contents of these provisions must allow the Government to govern the agencies in a manner that is appropriate for each area. From a citizen’s perspective coherent legislative regulations would contribute to greater insight into and understanding of the way in which executive power is exercised.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the Committee on Public Administration, an act and associated ordinance on state administration should contain provisions on the following:</p>
<p>• principles of good administration from a citizen’s perspective,</p>
<p>• the Government’s authority and duty to govern the agencies,</p>
<p>• requirements for preparation of appointments,</p>
<p>• the conditions required for the Government to establish a new agency, and</p>
<p>• forms of agency management.</p>
<p>To further improve the conditions for and continuity of the Government’s governance of the agencies, the Committee proposes that a non-political official be appointed in the ministries to provide support to the political leadership.</p>
<p>The structure of state administration</p>
<p>In the past two years the Government has commissioned inquiries and taken decisions on changes in the agency structure in various areas of society. In some areas where there has not been very much change so far, inquiries are in progress or are planned to look over the agency organisation.</p>
<p>In light of the changes that have so far been investigated and in certain cases decided on, the Committee discusses certain areas that may warrant further consideration. The Committee proposes a review of the possibilities of reorganising some of the agencies that are responsible for the proper functioning of the market. The Committee also considers that there should be continued review of the organisation of agencies in the defence sector, and of agencies with responsibilities in property management, the county administrative boards and the museums. In the Committee’s opinion, there are also arguments for reorganising the police as a single agency, and it is proposed that the Government examine the possibility of such a change. The same applies to the National Archives and the regional archives.</p>
<p>Supervision is one of the basic functions of the state. Supervision that is independent and inspires confidence depends on supervisory agencies not having other responsibilities that may give</p>
<p>rise to conflicts of roles. The Committee on Public Administration considers that the county administrative board provides a suitable basis for achieving independent and autonomous state supervision. This would be a means of making the agency structure at regional level simpler and more efficient. In important respects, this measure would give the municipalities and many companies a single contact point in their relations with central government.</p>
<p>Only such supervision as requires highly specialised expertise should be performed by separate supervisory agencies. In the first place, such supervision as is already organised regionally should be transferred to the county administrative boards, as should supervision of activities that are largely carried out by the municipalities. However, each supervisory area needs to be examined separately before a change is made.</p>
<p>Consequences of EU membership for state administration</p>
<p>The European Union has an impact on the tasks performed by the agencies in a number of areas. Internal market principles have repercussions in areas that were previously regarded as strictly national, such as the administration of justice, policing and border protection. Agency contacts between Member States and with EU bodies have gradually been internalised and become a normal part of Swedish state administration.</p>
<p>In the view of the Committee on Public Administration, in some respects EU-related work involves a departure from the Swedish administrative model. EU-related matters are generally not regarded as matters for the Government and the relevant decisions are therefore not taken by the Government collectively. In EU-related work, the ministries also intervene directly in agency organisations, without a prior decision by the Government, thereby drawing directly on the resources of the agencies. The Committee’s assessment is that the regulation of EU-related work does not satisfy strenuous requirements for openness and transparency in the state administration.</p>
<p>In this context the Committee on Public Administration proposes that the system by which the Government can delegate responsibility for representing Sweden should be regulated by law. Other basic provisions on EU-related work should also be laid down by law. Rules on the application of EU-related work should</p>
<p>be prescribed by ordinance instead of in internal Government Office circulars, as is now the case.</p>
<p>The Committee on Public Administration also considers that EU-related work should focus even more clearly on early initiatives. The ministries and agencies should produce EU strategies in consultation. Within the framework of strategy production, the Government and agencies together should develop working methods with a view to concentrating the resources available in a given area. Problems associated with the incorporation of Community legal instruments also need to be addressed. Working methods must be developed and routines established in this area as well. As far as possible, the question of how new regulations are to be incorporated and applied should be considered as soon as the Commission tables its proposal. The Committee on Public Administration presents proposals for improvements in these respects.</p>
<p>Strategic skills provision and basic values in the state administration</p>
<p>The Committee on Public Administration considers that two of the most important issues for strategic skills provision in the state administration are, on the one hand, recruitment of senior officials and their skills development, and, on the other hand, recruitment of new staff. Further, the Committee is of the opinion that there is reason to review and analyse skills needs in light of the changes that the state administration is undergoing and faces in the near future. Present and future skills needs in various sectors of the labour market are important issues in this context, as is the ability of the state sector to assert itself in this competition.</p>
<p>The Committee on Public Administration wishes to emphasise that ultimately a state official works on behalf of the members of society. Employees in the state sector must have knowledge and understanding of the basic values underlying state administration and the role of state official. A common set of basic values makes it easier to preserve and strengthen a citizen-oriented basic outlook in state administration and is helpful to agencies developing their own tailor-made documents on basic values. It is highly important that ethical issues and the contents of the role as state official are highlighted and discussed continuously at the agencies. Attention must be given to actual and potential conflicts of values.</p>
<p>The fundamental principles of the state administration are laid down in various acts of the Riksdag. The Committee recommends that the Government compile and document the common basic values of all those employed in the state administration.</p>
<p>General measures to improve efficiency and cut costs</p>
<p>To achieve further efficiency gains and cut costs in state agencies, external pressure is required. The Committee on Public Administration makes two proposals to this end. The first is that the Government extend the existing productivity pressure on the financing of agencies’ overall administrative costs, to include activities financed by fees. The second is that the Government invite the private business sector to submit proposals to run state activities by giving them a ‘right to challenge’.</p>
<p>The Committee on Public Administration does not consider it an efficient use of resources for all agencies to be self-sufficient in all areas. Agencies do not always need to have an internal organisation of their own with the skills to solve all types of administrative tasks. In the Committee’s view, more concentrated, cross-agency management of large-volume services offers scope for efficiency gains and cost cuts. If this potential is used, substantial financial savings can be made. Until now, the opportunities for efficiency gains based on cooperation across agencies have been used only marginally because of various obstacles or inadequate incentives.</p>
<p>The Committee on Public Administration sees opportunities for savings in financial management and personnel administration. But there are other areas where more concentrated management could bring even greater savings and efficiency gains, such as IT services. In areas that require various types of specialist expertise, resource cooperation could help both to lower costs and to raise quality. In light of this, the Committee proposes that the Government take initiatives for shared, concentrated administrative solutions for the agencies.</p>
<p>The Committee on Public Administration also points to the potential for efficiency gains in connection with the generational change facing the state administration. Another general area for savings to which the Committee draws attention concerns costs of premises used by agencies.</p>
<p>The Committee on Public Administration proposes that the restrictions on appropriations savings by agencies be removed so as to harness opportunities for efficiency gains and cost reductions. For the same reason, the Committee proposes that the Riksdag and the Government should be able to decide on appropriations for agencies for a period longer than one year. Implementing this change would necessitate an amendment of the provisions of the Instrument of Government on the length of the budgetary period (Chapter 9, Article 3).</p>
