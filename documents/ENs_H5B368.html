<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Swedish system regarding the rights of children who are suspects or accused persons in criminal proceedings may seem to be solid. The trend is clear. As knowledge about the special needs of children etc. has grown, the procedural tools have also been refined. Over the years the child perspective has been given an ever clearer role in criminal proceedings. Essentially this is not a national phenomenon. Basically these rights are seldom unique to the Swedish legal system. On the contrary they are found in several international standards. The Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Convention on Human Rights are two important examples of this. The Convention on the Rights of the Child is explicitly aimed at safeguarding the rights of the child; it includes standards aimed at children who are suspects or accused persons in criminal proceedings. In its interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Court on Human Rights has stressed on several occasions that member states should take action to meet the special needs of children in their capacity as suspects or accused persons in criminal proceedings. In the case law of the European Court the child perspective often shines through concerning the right to a fair trial.</p>
<p>All EU Member States, including Sweden, have adopted both the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Convention on Human Rights. The European Convention also has, for example, the force of Swedish law. It has been proposed that the Convention on the Rights of the Child should be given the status of Swedish law. EU Member States, including Sweden, are also bound by the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, which also covers guarantees for children who are suspects or accused persons.</p>
<p>However, for some years the EU has been working actively on further strengthening the procedural rights of suspects or accused persons. The aim is for this to lead to greater trust between Member States and to ultimately guarantee mutual recognition of judgments and legal decisions between them.</p>
<p>As part of this work the EU has adopted several directives. One of the legal acts adopted is a directive specifically aimed at procedural safeguards for children who are suspects or accused persons in criminal proceedings: Directive (EU) 2016/800/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2016.</p>
<p>A large part of our remit has consisted of analysing the relationship between Swedish law and this Directive and proposing the amendments necessary to implement this Directive in Swedish law.</p>
<p>Our remit has also included two somewhat smaller issues not linked to this Directive. We have been tasked with considering a question concerning the rights of public officials to compensation for trial costs in certain cases and a question concerning simplified service of process.</p>
<h2>Proposal for implementation of the Procedural</h2>
<h2>Safeguards for Children Directive</h2>
<h2>Overview of the standing of children as suspects and accused persons etc. in the Swedish legal system</h2>
<p>In the Swedish legal system there is a long tradition of, and broad support for, special treatment of children.</p>
<p>Children under 15 years of age do not have criminal responsibility and, in principle, they cannot be subject to measures in the legal system on account of criminal offences. It follows from this that, for example, a preliminary investigation cannot be opened against a suspect who had not turned 15 years at the time of the offence. Instead it is the municipal social services that have the main responsibility for action being taken by society. To ensure that the assistive measures taken by the social services are appropriate and to enable them to be taken in time, it may be important to establish the circumstances surrounding the offence. The social services are not always able to investigate such circumstances. Under the Young Offenders (Special Provisions) Act (1964:167) the police and prosecutors are therefore able, under certain conditions, to conduct an investigation concerning an offence where the suspect is under 15 years of age. If someone can be suspected of commiting an offence before the age of 15 and the offence is of a serious nature, an investigation has to be opened unless there are special reasons for not doing so. In certain instances a court can also consider whether the child has committed the offence or affirm that this has not been established.</p>
<p>In general the system is also characterised by the view that children and young people who have committed offences should be subject to action within the social services in the first place. Children and young people who have criminal responsibility are also given special treatment. For example, substantive law in Sweden contains a special system of sanctions for young offenders. Recently a legislative proposal was submitted covering two new sanctions for young persons.</p>
<p>There is also an ambition that procedural rules should aim at bringing about positive change and foster favourable development. With respect to the treatment of children and young people who are suspected of offences, there are today a large number of explicit procedural rights that have to be guaranteed. The Young Offenders (Special Provisions) Act contains special rules for the processing by the police, prosecutors and courts of cases and matters concerning offences where children are suspects or accused persons. Most of these provisions apply to the 15–17 years age group, but some of the rights guaranteed by the Act have to be applied up until the suspect or accused person has turned 21 years. When there is no special regulation in the Act, it is the Code of Judicial Procedure and other general provisions that are applicable. It should, for example, be mentioned that the Preliminary Investigations Ordinance (1947:948) also contains special provisions aimed at the processing of matters where the suspect is under 18 years.</p>
<p>The special treatment of young offenders means, to begin with, a prompt processing requirement. A preliminary investigation against a person who is under 18 years of age that concerns a crime for which imprisonment can be imposed shall be conducted particularly promptly. It has to be concluded and a decision on the matter of prosecution has to be taken as soon as possible and no later than within six weeks from notification of the suspicion of the offence. This timeframe may only be exceeded in special cases, for example when necessary on account of the investigation or other special circumstances. In the courts cases concerning persons who have not attained 21 years always have to be processed promptly. When a prosecution is brought against a person who has not turned 18 years for an offence for which imprisonment for more than six months is provided, the same rules regarding the prompt processing requirement apply as when the defendant is being detained in custody by order of a court. This means, for example, that the main rule is that the main hearing has to open within two weeks from when the prosecution was brought.</p>
<p>The procedural rights also mean that children shall, in the same way as adults who are suspected or accused of offences, be informed of certain fundamental rights at an early stage of the process; the starting point being as early as when they are notified of the suspicion of an offence.</p>
<p>Another fundamental aspect is that children have to be assisted by a lawyer. The basis of the Swedish system is that a public defence counsel has to be appointed for a child – if it is not evident that the child does not need one. This means both that a child who is a suspect almost always has to be assisted by a defence counsel and that the state offers legal aid for the costs incurred. So it is not up to the child or the child’s custodian to determine whether or not a defence counsel is needed. The main rule is that a member of the Swedish Bar Association is appointed as defence counsel. In exceptional cases another suitable person who has a law degree can be appointed.</p>
<p>At an early stage in the process, before taking a decision on the question of prosecution, the prosecutor has, as a main rule, to obtain an opinion from the municipal social services committee. If the preliminary investigation applies to an offence that can result in imprisonment, the leader of the preliminary investigation shall, if possible, request such an opinion at an earlier stage, no later than when notification is given of suspicion of an offence. This opinion has to be obtained about a person who is suspected of having committed an offence before turning 18 years. The opinion has to include an assessment of whether the young person has a special need of measures intended to prevent them developing in an undesirable direction. The opinion also has to include a statement of the measures that the committee intends to take and, in certain cases, also an account of the young person’s personal development and their other living circumstances. The opinion can also give an account of the young person’s family situation and social relations, school and leisure time, health, emotional behaviour, etc. The opinion is then used as supporting information when the prosecutor makes their decision on prosecution or on a waiver of prosecution with a warning to a young offender or a waiver of prosecution. If a prosecution is brought, the court uses the opinion as supporting information when, for instance, selecting any sanction. If the young person is acquitted, the social welfare committee has to consider whether there are other reasons to commence measures.</p>
<p>Special rules also apply to children concerning deprivation of liberty. Even in cases where the suspicion relates to a more serious offence a person under 18 years may only be detained by a court as a last resort. There is a requirement that it is evident that adequate supervision cannot be arranged and there also have to be exceptional reasons for ordering detention (in practice the same rules apply to arrest orders ). If it is necessary to arrest and detain the young person, they are guaranteed certain rights. For example, the starting point is that the young detainee has to be placed in such a way that they do not spend time with adults unless doing so can be considered to be in their best interests. For example, a starting point is that the young person should already be able to come into contact with their close relatives when in police custody. The person who has been deprived of their liberty should also be able to continue their schooling etc. A person who has been deprived of their liberty is also guaranteed the right to be examined by a doctor and to health care etc.</p>
<p>The main rule is that all children who are suspected or accused of an offence have the right to have their custodians present during measures like an interview in a preliminary investigation and during their trial in court. For example, the starting point is that custodians have to be notified and summoned to police interviews. The main rule is that they are also notified about the prosecution and the court hearing. In certain cases, if the prosecution relates to an offence that can result in imprisonment, the custodian also has to be summonsed to be heard at the court hearing. If, for example, the custodian is unable to attend or if there are special reasons for not notifying or summonsing a custodian to attend, another person or other persons who have a role in the young person’s upbringing can be notified of and summonsed to attend an interview and a court hearing instead. A representative of the social services has to attend a police interview with a person who has not turned 18 years and who is suspected of an offence that can result in imprisonment – if this is possible and can be done without harming the investigation. In certain instances the court also has to notify the social welfare committee of the time of the main hearing against a person who has not turned 18 years.</p>
<p>Additional measures that ultimately protect the rights of children who are suspects and accused persons include the recording of interviews in the preliminary investigation and examinations in court. Sound and visual recordings may be made of interviews during the investigation. Under the current law this may be done in cases where it is particularly justified in view of, for example, the nature of the offence and the individual circumstances of the person interviewed. One circumstance that can be a particular justification for recording interviews is that the person to be examined is young. In courts the starting point is that examinations held have to be recorded. Secrecy provisions that are tied to the regulations about interviews mean that the recording of the interviews does not collide with the protection for the private life of the suspect.</p>
<p>In general the Swedish legal system is based on creating conditions to enable young people to participate effectively in their own trial. To give these rights the effect intended, the current law contains, for example, certain requirements concerning expertise or requirements concerning specialisation regarding persons who process matters in which children are suspects or accused persons. For example, the leader of the preliminary investigation has to be particularly suitable for the task and interviews have to be held by a person with special expertise. The judges handling cases involving young persons also have, according to the main rule, to be specially appointed.</p>
<p>The main rule is that the person who is suspected or accused also has to be present in person at their own trial. This system is of particular importance regarding children and young people who are accused persons. Exceptions can only be made in certain instances and then the system is, for example, based on requirements that the investigation has to be adequate and that the defendant has been served with information about the trial and about the consequences of not attending. So the starting point applicable is that the child or young person has to be present in person, and here the prime justification is educative. In cases against persons who have not turned 21 years it is possible, in order to safeguard privacy, to make departures from the principle that court hearings are held in public. In certain instances – for example in cases attracting a great deal of attention – it is possible for the court to hear the case in private. But close relatives of the suspect may still be allowed to be present.</p>
<h2>The current law largely complies with the Procedural Safeguards for Children Directive</h2>
<p>The Procedural Safeguards for Children Directive places further focus on the rights of children who are suspects or accused persons – regarding procedural rights for them in criminal proceedings. The Directive’s definition of children is persons under 18 years. So they are the Directive’s main target group. When justified by the circumstances in the particular case several articles of the Directive are also applicable to persons who reach 18 years during the period when the criminal proceedings are in progress. If – after the authorities have investigated the matter – it is uncertain whether the suspect or accused person is over or under 18 years, they shall be presumed to be a child when the Directive is applied. Member States may decide not to apply this Directive when a person concerned has reached the age of 21.</p>
<p>The Directive is limited to criminal proceedings and shall, in addition, be applied to children who are requested persons under a European arrest warrant. But the Directive does not cover any other types of proceedings. It should, for example, not apply to procedures that are specially designed for children and that could lead to protective, corrective or educative measures.</p>
<p>In our view the Directive applies to the processing of criminal matters, both in court and during the preliminary investigation. The scope of the Directive also includes proceedings that result in a summary imposition of a fine. It also covers other criminal proceedings that do not lead to examination by a court, for example a process that results in a waiver of prosecution with a warning to a young offender or a waiver of prosecution. The Directive also has an effect for children who are apprehended in Sweden in connection with European arrest warrant proceedings.</p>
<p>We consider that the provisions of the Directive should be applied in the first place to children aged 15-18 years. In certain instances its provisions also have an impact concerning persons who have reached the age of 18 but not 21. One example of a procedure that we consider falls outside the scope of the Directive is an investigation under Section 31 of the Young Offenders (Special Provisions) Act, which can be considered regarding children – who can be suspected of commiting an offence before the age of 15. The children do not have criminal liability and the proceedings cannot lead to a criminal sanction. In our view, proceedings of this type are ultimately intended to give the social services clarity as to what has happened so that they can deploy the right resources for the child. But it is, of course, important to also guarantee children under 15 strong protection for their rights in a criminal investigation.</p>
<p>The Directive applies as soon as a child is suspected or accused of an offence. We have made the assessment that, as far as Sweden is concerned, that point of time will normally be when a child is given notice of reasonable suspicion of an offence under Chapter 23, Section 18 of the Code of Judicial Procedure or is notified officially of the suspicion of an offence in some other way. However, even before this point in time the Directive calls for a particular approach by the authorities, i.e. criminal investigators, law enforcement agencies, courts, etc. The Directive also entails obligations in the type of proceedings in which a notification under Chapter 23, Section 18 of the Code of Judicial Procedure is not considered. With respect to proceedings in connection with a European arrest warrant the Directive applies when Sweden is the executing state and as of when the child is apprehended. It has to be possible to invoke these rights up until the end of criminal proceedings or European arrest warrant proceedings.</p>
<p>The Directive consists of several parts – all of which are intended to create safeguard mechanisms for children subject to criminal proceedings or a European arrest warrant. This is a separate supplement to the other measures adopted by the EU in order to satisfy the procedural rights of suspects and accused persons. For example, it includes special rules on children’s right to information in criminal proceedings. In this way it supplements the EU’s previously adopted Directive on the right to information in criminal proceedings with a child perspective. It also contains rules about assistance by a lawyer – and thus supplements the EU Directive on the right to access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings. The Directive also contains provisions that apply to the right of children to appear in person at their trial, the right to be accompanied by their custodians to their trial, etc. In addition, the Directive contains rules that apply to deprivation of liberty and other matters. Finally, the Directive contains, for example, provisions that apply to the training of professionals handling matters in which children are suspects or accused persons.</p>
<p>Our starting point is that the Swedish legal system is largely designed in such a way that it already corresponds to the Directive’s requirements today. Thus Swedish law already offers strong protection to safeguard the rights dealt with in the Directive. However, some changes are proposed below so as to fully comply with the Directive’s requirements.</p>
<h2>Right to information</h2>
<p>Children who are suspected or accused of offences have the right to information about what rights they have in the same way as adults in the same position. A few years ago, as also indicated above, the EU adopted a Directive on the right to information in criminal proceedings. This led to Swedish legislation being supplemented with regard to what information the police and prosecutor are obliged to give a suspect when the suspect is notified of reasonable suspicion of an offence, is deprived of their liberty or is told in some other way that they are a suspect. The Procedural Safeguards for Children Directive contains requirements concerning additional and special information when the suspect or accused person is a child. They have to be informed that their custodian or – where relevant – some other adult has the right to accompany them to a court hearing. The child’s custodian or some other adult also has to receive information.</p>
<p>To live up to the requirements in this part of the Directive we have proposed supplementary rules regarding the obligation to provide information. We propose inserting the great majority of them in the Preliminary Investigations Ordinance (1947:648).</p>
<h2>Safeguards for an effective defence</h2>
<p>Article 6 of the Directive contains a provision that children who are suspects or accused persons shall be assisted by a lawyer without undue delay once they are made aware that they are suspects or accused persons. The Article expresses a compulsory provision – children have to be assisted by a lawyer when they are suspected or accused of an offence unless this would not be proportionate. The absolute main rule is that children shall be assisted by a lawyer when questioned and have the right to meet in private and communicate with the lawyer representing them. There are only limited possibilities of temporarily limiting communication and meetings in private and of questioning the child when their lawyer is not present. This may only be done in isolated cases where the circumstances are exceptional, for example where immediate action by the authorities is imperative to prevent substantial jeopardy to criminal proceedings in relation to a serious criminal offence. Derogations from the requirement of assistance by a lawyer are also permitted where there is an urgent need to avert serious adverse consequences for the life, liberty or physical integrity of a person. These derogations may only be used at the pre-trial stage.</p>
<p>The Swedish legal system already offers strong protection at present. The provisions of the Young Offenders (Special Provisions) Act mean that, in principle, persons under 18 always have to have a public defence counsel appointed for them. A different outcome is only possible in instances where it is evident that there is no need for a public defence counsel. So the public authorities are responsible for ensuring an effective defence – and this is in good agreement with the Directive’s compulsory requirement of access to a lawyer. The exceptions permitted by Swedish law in evident cases must also be considered to be consistent with the Directive. In addition, when the Directive on the right to access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings previously adopted by the EU was implemented in Swedish law, the right of a suspect or accused person who had been deprived of their liberty to meet their defence counsel in private or to communicate with them in some other way was expanded. The possibilities of having their defence counsel present during questioning were also modified. In this way the Swedish legal system also guarantees possibilities for children to prepare and conduct their defence.</p>
<p>We have therefore concluded that today Swedish law already contains the core provisions foreseen by the Directive. However, the ultimate purpose of the provisions of this part of the Procedural Safeguards for Children Directive is to make an effective defence possible. In our view, this also makes other demands on the legal system than those that are immediately apparent from the Directive. A system that is characterised by a suspect or accused person being able to communicate relatively freely with their defence counsel and that foresees the presence of the defence counsel during all questioning of the suspect is an important legal safeguard. At the same time, such a system requires that the role of defence counsel is only entrusted to those who meet the applicable requirements concerning qualifications and suitability. Otherwise there is risk of the suspect or accused person appointing an unsuitable defence counsel during the investigation – and up until the question of criminal responsibility has been decided with final effect – who can influence the process or endanger legal safeguards. The situations that should be avoided are, in particular, those in which a person appointed by the suspect or accused person to defend them may, in the worst case, be an accomplice or a link between an accomplice and the suspect or accused person. This is not a big problem in the context of the Swedish legal system. To the extent that it occurs, it must be assumed to concern strictly exceptional cases. It is, however, something that should be countered to the greatest possible extent – especially since it can risk undermining the suspect’s fundamental right to an effective defence.</p>
<p>The problem can be attacked in various ways. One method is to change the rules about who can be a defence counsel. But we have chosen not to propose any change to the rules concerning the requirements that have to be met to act as a defence counsel. Our starting point is that the Swedish system follows the fundamental right that a suspect has to appoint their own defence counsel. A proposal of such fundamental changes would also require a perspective broader than the one we have to work within. According to our terms of reference, however, we have been tasked with investigating whether there should be greater possibilities of rejecting unsuitable defence counsel. But we have come to the conclusion that the current law is also adequate in this case. On the other hand, we consider that there is reason to try to make the application of the current regulations more effective. One step in that direction is to put the court in a position to make an earlier examination of whether or not a defence counsel, whose qualifications and suitability can be questioned, should be rejected or dismissed. We therefore propose that the law should state explicitly that if a prosecutor judges that a defence counsel does not meet the statutory requirements to be allowed to be a defence counsel, they shall report the matter for examination by the court. If the suspect has been apprehended, arrested by order of a prosecutor or detained by order of a court, the court should examine the matter as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If there are exceptional reasons it should be possible to also appoint a public defence counsel alongside the defence counsel appointed by the accused. In our view the prime instance of exceptional reasons is when the defence counsel appointed by the suspect influences the process or endangers security. And does so to such an extent that it is judged to be necessary to refuse communication or meetings in private if the suspect is deprived of their liberty. It can also involve situations in which it is judged necessary to refuse the presence of the defence counsel at questioning. This means that this regulation is chiefly aimed at cases where the defence counsel appointed by the suspect or accused person does not meet the requirements set for public defence counsel. In principle, defence counsel who meet the requirements set to be public defence counsel cannot be refused communication, private meetings and presence at questioning, etc.</p>
<p>For there to be considered to be exceptional reasons for appointing a public defence counsel – when the suspect or accused person has appointed a defence counsel – we also consider that there should be a risk that the processing of the matter as such will be adversely affected. This regulation is thus chiefly aimed at cases where there is a prompt processing requirement – such as when the suspect or accused person has been deprived of their liberty or is young. But we are not limiting this regulation to solely refer situations in which the supect or accused person is a child.</p>
<h2>Special deliberations about deprivation of a child’s liberty</h2>
<p>Several provisions in the Directive deal with deprivation of liberty of a child. To begin with the Directive contains provisions limiting deprivation of liberty. The starting point is that deprivation of liberty, in particular detention, of a child shall be viewed as a measure of last resort. Member States shall therefore, when possible, use alternative measures to detention. If a deprivation of liberty is necessary, it shall be limited to the shortest possible period of time. Account shall be taken of the age and individual situation of the child, and of the particular circumstances of the case. Children who are deprived of their liberty shall also be guaranteed certain rights, for example one starting point is they have to be placed so that they do not spend time with adult detainees unless doing so is consistent with their best interests. Even if a child reaches 18 years while in detention, there has to be a possibility to continue to hold them separately from other adults – if justified in the light of their individual circumstances.</p>
<p>As far as Sweden is concerned, the widely supported tradition of special treatment of young offenders also makes itself felt regarding deprivation of liberty, as is seen from the account given above, The Swedish legal system is in basic agreement with the requirements of the Directive. However, even though the present system is characterised by special treatment of young people, Sweden has received recurring criticism, at both national and international level, for its use of detention and restrictions. Part of this criticism has been that the use of restrictions is too extensive, resulting in isolation. In particular, the criticism made has drawn the attention of the legislator to the need for reforms. At present reform work is under way that includes a review of the detention regulations. That reform work also covers special rules for children. It is of great importance and will reinforce the impact of the Directive.</p>
<p>We have, however, found reason to also propose a minor change in this context. In order to meet the requirements of the Directive we propose a minor amendment to the Detention Act – that applies to persons who reach the age of 18 when they are in detention. The proposal is they should continue to be placed so that they do not spend time together with adult detainees – if this is justified in the light of their individual circumstances and is considered appropriate in other respects. When this assessment is made, particular account should be taken of the personal maturity and vulnerability of the suspect. Account should also be taken of what is best for the detainees under the age of 18 who will, in that case, be placed so that they continue to spend time with the person who is now of age. But the idea is not to narrow down the present system. So the object of the regulation proposed is not to limit possible placements for young offenders.</p>
<h2>Children who are requested persons under a European arrest warrant</h2>
<p>Several of the rights under the Directive shall also apply to children who are requested persons under a European arrest warrant. It is our view that Swedish law – when supplemented in the way we have set out above – meets the requirements of the Directive. Swedish law is already based on children who are requested persons being guaranteed the same procedural rights as and similar protection to those who are suspects or accused persons. However, we propose amending the Detention Act to make clear that its regulations shall apply to requested persons under a European or Nordic arrest warrant who have been detained, arrested or apprehended.</p>
<h2>The other two questions Information about simplified service of process in the probation board</h2>
<p>One of the other questions we have been tasked with analysing, alongside the implementation of the Procedural Safeguards for Children Directive, is the question of whether a probation board should be able to give information about simplified service of process. This is to make it possible to use simplified service of process in the district court regarding an action to set aside probation. That system has been proposed in an earlier request to the Ministry of Justice.</p>
<p>What we have been tasked with examining is whether – in common with what applies to, for example, a prosecutor or a police officer under Chapter 33, Section 6, second and third paragraphs of the Code of Judicial Procedure regarding documents in a criminal matter – a probation board should be able to give information about simplified service of process when the board decides to request that a prosecutor bring an action at a court to have probation set aside. We have concluded that this is an effective and appropriate system. The character of the sanction of probation is such that the incentives for addressing misconduct are strong. Otherwise the trust that the sanction involves for the sentenced person is undermined. So potential efficiency gains in the processing of a case concerning an action to set aside probation are desirable. Problems concerning service of process act in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Our specific proposal is that the chair of the probation board should be able to provide information about simplified service of process in connection with a meeting that the sentenced person attends in person – and at which it has been decided that the board will request that the prosecutor bring an action to set aside probation. We also propose that the requirements currently specified in Chapter 33, Section 6 of the Code of Judicial Procedure and the Service of Documents Act (2010:932) should also apply to simplified service of process in this case.</p>
<h2>Right of public officials to compensation for trial costs</h2>
<p>The other question covered by our terms of reference – that is also outside the implementation of the Procedural Safeguards for Children Directive – concerns the right of ‘public officials’ to compensation for trial costs. The regulations in question are in the Act on the right of public functionaries to reimbursement of trial costs in certain cases etc. (1981:1310).</p>
<p>In the meaning of that Act the term public official includes employees of central government or of a municipality, county council or a local federation. Such an employee who is, for example, acquitted following a private prosecution for an offence in the exercise of their post has the right to receive compensation from their em- ployer for the trial cost that the injured party has been ordered by the court to pay but has not paid. The same applies if a private claim against the official is refused. The present situation is that the right to compensation that applies to employees of central government etc. is dependent on the acquittal judgment gaining legal force. In an application to the Ministry of Justice the Swedish Agency for Gov- ernment Employers has pointed out that the present system means that the employee, i.e. the public official, may need to pay a cost for legal representation, for example, from their own funds, while waiting for a ruling to gain legal force. The Agency has therefore proposed adding a provision on an advance to the official to the Act. We propose a system that is in line with the one proposed by the Swedish Agency for Government Employers. The specific point of the proposal is to make it possible for an employer to reimburse the public official for their trial costs even before a court ruling awarding the official compensation for trial costs gains legal force. The public official will then be liable to repay if a higher court sets aside or varies the ruling in question. This repayment obligation will also apply to the extent that the injured party or the claimant pays the amount awarded after the ruling has gained legal force.</p>
<p>This part of our remit also includes another issue. Under the present system a public official may take measures within the frame- work of their post to prepare and conduct their defence – when they are the subject of a private prosecution or a private claim that is connected to an offence in the performance of their duties. They may, for example, present a written defence or attend a court hear-</p>
<p>ing during the time when they are in post. The cost incurred as a result of such measures is not considered to be a compensable cost in the legal proceedings. According to the Chancellor of Justice, the present system weakens the preventive effect of the system of trial costs to some extent – since a person who takes legal proceedings against a public official and, for example, brings a private prosecu- tion does not risk needing to pay their opposite party’s costs. In a letter to the Ministry of Justice the Chancellor of Justice has there- fore proposed a review of the present system. In this part of the inquiry we have, however, come to a different conclusion from the Chancellor of Justice. In our view the present system takes suffi- cient account of the preventive effect of the system of trial costs. Consequently we do not propose any amendments to the Act.</p>
