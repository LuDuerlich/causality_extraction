<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>Freedom from discrimination is a human right. Despite this, our society is far from being free from discrimination. This is, of course, a problem. Another problem is that many people who have been discriminated against do not receive support and help to safeguard their rights.</p>
<p>The overall aim of our inquiry was to find solutions to these problems or, at least, ways to reduce them.</p>
<p>Our remit has covered a number of different areas:  Review of  the role and responsibilities of the Equality Ombudsman. Our remit has involved analysing the Equality Ombudsman’s legal possibilities and responsibilities for handling complaints, conciliation, and the right to bring an action in a court of law. We were also tasked with studying the Ombudsman’s handling of complaints from individuals and examining the types of complaints that are not investigated and, if possible, assessing the consequences of this.  Review of the organisation of  efforts to combat discrimination at regional and local level . Many activities at local level receive state support. Our remit has included a review of state support, whether it is effective and conditions that should apply for receiving support. At regional level, the county administrative boards are important actors. We have been tasked with assessing whether the county administrative boards should have greater responsibility for action to combat discrimination and, if so, what responsibilities they should have and how their work in this area should be organised.  Analysis of whether  a different procedure from the one currently used for monitoring and promoting equal treatment can help to ensure effective action to combat discrimination.  Analysis of the  burden of proof under the Discrimination Act. It has been questioned whether the burden of proof rule has had an impact in practice. We have therefore been tasked with examining how the courts apply the burden of proof and report it in their judgments. The purpose of this study was to assess whether, in practice, the burden of proof is lessened for the person claiming to have been discriminated against, as the rule sets out to achieve. A similar burden of proof is contained in the Parental Leave Act (1995:584) and the Education Act (2010:800). These have also been included in our assignment. We have also addressed the burden of proof in the Act on special protection for workers against reprisals for whistleblowing concerning serious irregularities (2016:749).  Analysis of who should be responsible for  monitoring action to combat discrimination in schools – the Equality Ombudsman or the Swedish Schools Inspectorate.  As regards schools, the responsibility for monitoring compliance with the rules to protect children from discrimination and other violations is shared between the Equality Ombudsman and the Schools Inspectorate. Part of our remit has been to analyse whether the provisions in the Discrimination Act pertaining to areas subject to the Education Act should be moved to the Education Act so that they can be coordinated with the rules on protection against degrading treatment of children and pupils, or whether the problems that arise could be solved by enhanced cooperation between the Equality Ombudsman and the School Inspectorate.  Analysis of whether the regulations on  protection against discrimination in public sector activities  need to be amended.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s starting points</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has aimed to create a system in which stakeholders at different levels take active measures to combat discrimination. A system in which different stakeholders can complement and support each other in their action to combat discrimination and in providing support and assistance to victims of discrimination. The objective is that the risk of being discriminated against will decrease and that victims should be able to receive support and help, including through counselling and learning about their rights and opportunities.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of discrimination in establishments subject to the Education Act, our starting point was to create the best protection and support for children and pupils who are victims of discrimination and other violations in schools.</p>
<h2>Our proposals The role and responsibilities of the Equality Ombudsman</h2>
<p>Our assessment is that the Equality Ombudsman should by and large continue to work as it does today. Its mandate includes providing individual support and assistance, but this is not its primary task. The agency also has other responsibilities and should work at an overall level to establish practices and undertake promotion action.</p>
<p>Only courts can determine that someone has been the victim of discrimination and award compensation. The Equality Ombudsman may bring an action in a court of law. To clarify that the Equality Ombudsman is not to act as an agent for everyone who wants to bring an action in court, we propose that the provision on the Equality Ombudsman’s right to take action be amended. It should be clear that the Equality Ombudsman should primarily exercise its right to take action to obtain rulings in precedentsetting cases, that is, cases involving issues where guidance from the courts is needed. We propose that the right to take action also apply in cases in which the Equality Ombudsman considers that there are other special reasons.</p>
<p>In addition, we present recommendations concerning how the Equality Ombudsman should handle complaints from individuals. At present, only a small number of complaints lodged with the Ombudsman are investigated. We do not believe it is reasonable to propose that the Equality Ombudsman investigate all the complaints it receives. However, we do believe that the Ombudsman should investigate more cases by notifying the reported party so that they learn of the complaint and are given the opportunity to respond to it. This may lead to the reported party revising their procedures or voluntarily offering some form of compensation to the victim. In addition, more parties will learn that they have been reported and awareness about discrimination can spread. More victims of discrimination can obtain redress. We also believe that the Equality Ombudsman should to a greater extent send decisions and communications regarding other measures taken as a result of the complaint to the person filing the complaint. Decisions that mean the Equality Ombudsman will not investigate a complaint any further should include an annex containing general information about what the Equality Ombudsman does and what options are available for individuals to proceed on their own. Furthermore, we believe that the Equality Ombudsman should make more frequent use of the possibility to take decisions under its supervisory responsibilities other than decisions to bring an action.</p>
<p>The Equality Ombudsman’s primary task, also in the future, should be to help the parties reach agreement. However, in our opinion the Equality Ombudsman should broaden its work involving consensual solutions, and examine the possibility for parties to reach agreement in more cases.</p>
<h2>Regional and local efforts</h2>
<p>State support to anti-discrimination offices</p>
<p>Anti-discrimination offices are non-profit civil society organisations. In our opinion, they play an important role in combating discrimination. We therefore propose that offices continue to receive state grants. We believe that the main objective of the offices’ activities should be to offer support to individuals. As a prerequisite for obtaining a grant, the offices must use at least half of it to offer free advice and support to individuals about how they can safeguard their rights. This means that there will be a certain shift in the focus of the offices’ activities.</p>
<p>An increase in monitoring and feedback is required. This will help to improve the chances of ensuring the quality of the activities receiving grants.</p>
<p>In addition, we propose a new ordinance. This would introduce a number of changes aiming to modernise the regulations.</p>
<p>The Equality Ombudsman will be required to provide advice and support to the anti-discrimination offices. This will be stated in the Act concerning the Equality Ombudsman. In practice, the proposal means a codification of current practice.</p>
<p>The work of the county administrative boards</p>
<p>We propose that the county administrative boards’ responsibility to combat discrimination through various promotion actions  should be clarified in their mandate and would include knowledge transfer, support, and education and training for strategic stakeholders in the county. We do not present any detailed proposals concerning a more specific description of the county administrative boards’ responsibilities in this regard. This is because the conditions – and thus also the need for action – vary between counties. This action is to be undertaken in consultation with the Equality Ombudsman. The Act concerning the Equality Ombudsman must stipulate that the responsibility of the Equality Ombudsman is to give advice and support to the county administrative boards in their efforts to combat discrimination.</p>
<p>The county administrative boards are already undertaking the type of promotion action our proposal covers, but to varying degrees. Our proposal would make it clear that the county administrative boards have a responsibility to undertake external action to combat discrimination.</p>
<h2>Proposal to establish an anti-discrimination board</h2>
<p>One reason it is difficult for victims of discrimination to obtain redress is that if those concerned are not in agreement, judicial review is required. Most people are reluctant to pursue litigation, if only because doing so may result in having to pay high court costs. We propose the establishment of an anti-discrimination  board –  a board to provide a simple, inexpensive and quick procedure for the examination of discrimination disputes .</p>
<p>Such a board would improve the effectiveness of anti-discrimination efforts and enable more victims of discrimination to obtain redress. The new board tasked with examining discrimination disputes should be established as a separate decision-making body at a new agency, where the board would be the main activity. We have provided an overall view on how we believe the board should work, and in particular discussed certain matters of principle. Similarly, we have discussed in general terms how it should be organised. However, if an anti-discrimination board is to be established, further consideration of these issues will be required.</p>
<h2>Burden of proof</h2>
<p>A specific evidentiary rule applies in discrimination disputes. The purpose of this rule is to lessen the burden of proof for the victim of discrimination. We propose an amendment to this rule. The reason for this is to clarify that this is a matter of a presumption rule. A clearer formulation should contribute to the correct interpretation and application of the rule.</p>
<p>We also propose that the burden of proof in the Parental Leave Act, the Education Act and the Act on special protection for workers against reprisals for whistleblowing concerning serious irregularities should be amended accordingly.</p>
<h2>Responsibility for combating discrimination in establishments subject to the Education Act</h2>
<p>We believe that collective responsibility to combat abuse – in all its forms – in establishments subject to the Education Act is most consistent with the best interests of the child. We therefore propose that the responsibility for monitoring action to combat discrimination in establishments subject to the Education Act be transferred from the Equality Ombudsman to the Schools Inspectorate. Consequently, the provisions in the Discrimination Act pertaining to establishments subject to the Education Act will be transferred there and coordinated with the rules on abusive treatment. This means that the prohibitions of discrimination and reprisals as well as the rules on active measures to combat discrimination that apply to establishments subject to the Education Act will be regulated by the Education Act.</p>
<p>We present proposals for amendments to the Education Act that the coordination of the rules will require. One such proposal is that compensation for discrimination should be the form of compensation that applies to all forms of violations, that is, to both discrimination and other degrading treatment. However, the possibility of receiving compensation for ‘financial loss’ will remain.</p>
<h2>Protection against discrimination in public sector activities</h2>
<p>The Discrimination Act prohibits discrimination in certain areas of society regardless of whether the activities are conducted in the public or private sector. For public sector activities, a special regulation also prohibits discriminatory treatment. There are doubts as to whether this protection is sufficient. We have concluded that it is not appropriate to examine the question of an extension of the special regulation within the scope of this inquiry. We believe that the Government should examine the possible introduction of a general prohibition of discrimination.</p>
<h2>Implications of the proposals</h2>
<p>Our assessment is that the proposals we present will lead to greater opportunities for individual victims of discrimination to safeguard their rights. More victims will be able to receive help, either from the Equality Ombudsman or from an anti-discrimination office. By clarifying the county administrative boards’ responsibility for external promotion action, more municipalities, companies, organisations and others in the counties will be able to learn about discrimination. This in turn may lead to greater attention to these issues, and to fewer people becoming victims of discrimination.</p>
<p>The change we propose to the burden of proof in the Discrimination Act could result in the burden of proof being lessened for the person claiming to have been discriminated against, as the rule sets out to achieve. The same applies to the other burden of proof rules that we have proposed should be amended accordingly.</p>
<p>Our proposal to establish an anti-discrimination board requires further investigation before it can be implemented. However, we believe that establishing such a board could be a good way to improve the effectiveness of anti-discrimination efforts and enable more victims of discrimination to obtain redress.</p>
<p>Implementation of the proposals will affect the work of the Equality Ombudsman, the county administrative boards and the Swedish Agency for Youth and Civil Society. It will involve both new responsibilities and, to some extent, a new focus for their activities. The anti-discrimination offices will also be affected. The conditions for receiving government grants will be clearer and requirements will increase in some cases, including for the offices’ reports to the Agency for Youth and Civil Society.</p>
<p>Our proposal to transfer the responsibility for monitoring action to combat discrimination in establishments subject to the Education Act to the Swedish Schools Inspectorate and transferring the regulations from the Discrimination Act to the Education Act should make the rules easier to apply. Another effect is that it will be easier for children, pupils and parents to know what to do. Under the proposal, children and pupils who are victims of discrimination or other degrading treatment in establishments subject to the Education Act can receive the same support and the same access to redress regardless of the basis of the violation. The proposal will also have implications for the agencies concerned, in particular for the Schools Inspectorate, the Equality Ombudsman and the National Agency for Education. Individual schools and their governing bodies will also be affected by the proposal to some extent.</p>
<p>Our proposals will have a positive impact on gender equality and the prospects of achieving the integration policy objectives.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the new rules enter into force on 1 July 2018.</p>
