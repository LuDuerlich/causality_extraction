<p>Remit</p>
<p>We have been tasked with conducting a general review of the Population Registration Act (1991:481). According to the terms of reference, the review is to especially examine the following issues.</p>
<p>• How the current construction of personal identity numbers can be changed so that the need for more numbers can be met.</p>
<p>• How the system of coordination numbers works in practice. If we conclude that the system should be retained, we will present proposals as to how it can be improved. We will also review the group of government agencies that have the right to request a coordination number for an individual and the purposes for which this request can be made. Further, we will review the situation for people staying in Sweden who are covered by the Act on Immunity and Privileges in Certain Cases (1976:661) (Act on Immunity and Privileges). If we conclude that a different identification system should be used, we will present proposals as to the necessary legislative amendments.</p>
<p>• Whether the population register should continue to be connected to church parishes or whether a different solution should be chosen.</p>
<p>• Whether it would be appropriate to introduce legislation concerning ‘security marking’ of information in the population register database.</p>
<p>• Whether regulations concerning entering children with double residence in the population register are appropriate and compatible with the best interests of the child.</p>
<p>We will report the financial consequences that any proposals may entail and present proposals for how these costs may be financed.</p>
<p>Under the supplementary terms of reference, we have been instructed to examine if there is a need for special regulations when entering EU citizens and their family members in the population register, in light of the provisions of the ‘Free Movement Directive’ and certain related issues.</p>
<p>Our examination of the first two issues listed above is presented in this interim report. We will report the results of the general review and other issues in our final report, which we will present no later than 1 September 2009.</p>
<p>A new personal identity number</p>
<p>Personal identity numbers today</p>
<p>Personal identity numbers are only established for those who are to be entered in the population register.</p>
<p>A personal identity number consists of the date of birth, given in six digits, a three-digit birth number and a check digit. The birth number is odd for men, and even for women. Unless it is unnecessary, the date of birth is to be specified using eight digits, of which four designate the year, so that the century is also specified.</p>
<p>There are 999 birth numbers for each date of birth. Usually, 300–400 of them are used for people who are born in the country and are entered in the population register. The other numbers are primarily used for people who are entered in the population register after having immigrated to Sweden.</p>
<p>The personal identity number is of great importance in society and is used in all areas of society. It satisfies the needs of government agencies and others for a clear, easily accessible and easily used tool to identify an individual.</p>
<p>Problems with personal identity numbers</p>
<p>The current way personal identity numbers are constructed means that there are a limited number of personal identity numbers available for each date of birth. As a result, the number of birth numbers used for certain dates is so large that all, or almost all, of the numbers have been used.</p>
<p>The reason that personal identity numbers for certain dates of birth are used more than others is that people who immigrate in some cases give dates of birth that are concentrated to a limited number of days. Many immigrants come from countries where the date of birth does not have the same significance as it does in Sweden. Some countries do not register births at all, or register births at a later stage. In any case it was common in the past that in some countries, the date of birth was registered using a fictitious date, often 1 January or 1 July. It is therefore mainly personal identity numbers for dates of birth on 1 January and 1 July of different years for which all, or almost all, the numbers have been used. The Swedish Tax Agency and Statistics Sweden have estimated that within the next five years, there will be no numbers available for some fifteen dates of birth.</p>
<p>In light of the major significance of personal identity numbers in society, it is a serious problem that for certain dates, all, or almost all, personal identity numbers have been used. It is thus necessary to change the construction of the personal identity number so as to increase the availability of numbers.</p>
<p>Our proposal for a new personal identity number</p>
<p>The personal identity number will play an important role – possibly greater than today – for a long time to come. Further, it can be assumed that it will be more difficult and more expensive to make changes to the personal identity number system in the future. Changes to the future personal identity number system – whether large or small – should not be necessary at such short intervals as has been the case to date. The present personal identity number system has lasted for about 50 years. That is much too short a period of time. A new personal identity number should at least last 100 years, preferably even longer.</p>
<p>The future personal identity number system must contain enough numbers so that it can cope with both increased birth rates and extensive immigration. It is difficult to assess how birth rates and immigration will change. The personal identity number system must therefore include substantial margins. In the future as well, many immigrants will be registered as being born on 1 January or 1 July in their countries of origin. The personal identity number must also be able to handle additional categories of people being</p>
<p>entered in the population register and assigned personal identity numbers.</p>
<p>Further, a new personal identity number must be unique and stable at an individual level. It must not be possible to confuse a personal identity number with organisation registration numbers, and it should be designed so that it is easy to remember. The personal identity number is to have one check digit that is calculated in the same way as at present.</p>
<p>We have considered several different ways of changing the personal identity number. When assessing the alternatives, the costs and implementation time were of major importance. These factors have been considered against the other consequences a change would have.</p>
<p>Information on the date of birth, i.e. the year, month and day, is registered in the population register database. Today, this information is also part of the personal identity number. The alternative we propose means that the personal identity number will still have information on the year and month of birth, while the two digits in the personal identity number that currently specify the day of birth will instead consist of a two-digit figure between 01 and 31 or, if the month of birth has less than 31 days, the number of days that the month has. This figure is to be included as part of the birth number, which will thus consist of five digits instead of three, as is the case today. So as not to affect the construction of the personal identity number, the hyphen will come after this figure. Since information about dates of birth are registered, anyone who needs information about a day of birth can access this from the Swedish Tax Agency’s population register database or the Government’s Swedish Population and Address Register (SPAR) and, as necessary, store this information in private IT systems.</p>
<p>People who already have a personal identity number will retain</p>
<p>it.</p>
<p>The technical changes required to implement this alternative are limited and the costs in comparison with other alternatives will be low. There will be no costs to users who do not need information about dates of birth.</p>
<p>Personal identification of people</p>
<p>not entered in the population register</p>
<p>Coordination numbers today</p>
<p>Before 2000, personal identity numbers could also be assigned to people who were not or who had not previously been entered in the population register. On 1 January 2000, coordination numbers were introduced and since then, personal identity numbers can only be established for people who will be entered in the population register. Following a request from a government agency, a coordination number can be assigned to a person who is not or who has not been entered in the population register. In principle, the coordination number is designed like a personal identity number, but the digits for the day of birth are to be added with the number 60.</p>
<p>The coordination number was introduced because some agencies also needed personal identification for people who are not to be entered in the population register, to avoid cases of mistaken identity and to enable information to be transferred between agencies. The Government did not consider it appropriate that these people continued to be assigned personal identity numbers since it could give the impression that they were residents in the country, which was not desirable.</p>
<p>Certain government agencies have the right to request coordination numbers for certain purposes. Coordination numbers are primarily used for individuals who will be registered in the tax database and for individuals who are suspected of criminal offences or who have committed criminal offences and will be registered in the legal system’s information system. Another group are people covered by the Act on Immunity and Privileges and who are staying in the country for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>As a rule, the identity of the individual must be established by the agency requesting a coordination number in order for one to be assigned. As regards people who will be entered in the tax register or registered in the legal system, it can, however, be difficult to establish their identity, and it is therefore not a requirement for assigning them a coordination number.</p>
<p>Problems with coordination numbers</p>
<p>It can be difficult to solve practical, everyday problems for people who have coordination numbers, especially for people staying in the country for longer periods of time, such as staff at foreign embassies and consulates, and staff at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which is an EU agency located in Sweden. The problems consist of difficulties gaining access to health care other than in emergency situations, gaining access to bank services, signing rental agreements, and others.</p>
<p>The problems arise because the coordination number is relatively unknown in society and technical limitations in some areas of activity mean that registering coordination numbers in IT systems is not possible. Another shortcoming is that identity checks are not secure enough. Further, there are certain services that people with coordination numbers are not entitled to, primarily due to the fact that they are not entered in the country’s population register.</p>
<p>Coordination numbers will be</p>
<p>retained and assigned for more purposes</p>
<p>To a great extent, the problems that exist are due to the coordination number not being known in society. It will be possible to include information about people who have coordination numbers in SPAR from 1 June 2008. Our assessment is that in the future, when this information is contained in SPAR, knowledge about these numbers will increase in society over time. The change will improve the situation for people who have coordination numbers, and the problems that currently exist will disappear after a few years.</p>
<p>The change to the personal identity number that we propose means that it will still look like today’s personal identity number, even if the information on the day of birth is replaced with a number that does not represent any specific information. As is the case with the current number, this personal identity number will give the impression that the person has a strong link to the country. People who, in the future, will be assigned a coordination number are people who have a weak link to the country. The reasons given when the coordination number was introduced, i.e.</p>
<p>that there was a need to differentiate between these people and those who were entered in the population register, are still valid today. In view of this, we consider that decisive arguments exist for retaining coordination numbers.</p>
<p>To enable the exchange of information and to minimise the risk of wrong decisions, it is of vital importance that government agencies and others have a common means of identifying an individual. We therefore propose that all government agencies be able to request a coordination number for an individual if it is necessary in their activities to prevent cases of mistaken identities or to exchange information about the individual. Our assessment, accordingly, is that there is no need to limit the right to request coordination numbers to particular agencies or purposes. This personal identification can subsequently be used by local government agencies, private companies and other organisations.</p>
<p>Certain people covered by the Act on Immunity and</p>
<p>Privileges will be entitled to a personal identity number</p>
<p>Certain people covered by the Act on Immunity and Privileges often stay in the country for many years, but because of exemption clauses in the Population Registration Act they are still not entered in the population register. These people should be able to live and function in society in the same way as other people living permanently in the country. The problems that exist with coordination numbers are greater for those people who stay in the country for a longer period of time than for other groups who have coordination numbers since they more often have contact with authorities and companies, such as banks. The problems these people have need to be solved as soon as possible. Their ties to the country are such that they would have been entered in the population register if there were no special exemption clause in the Population Registration Act. We therefore propose that people who are covered by the Act on Immunity and Privileges, even though they are not entered in the population register, are to be assigned a personal identity number if they fulfil the requirement on residence in the Population Registration Act and are entitled to stay in the country. Even those people who today have a coordination number but who fulfil the requirements for receiving a personal identity number are to be entitled to one.</p>
<p>The proposal will probably mean that once these people have been assigned their personal identity numbers, they will feel that it is easier to live and function in society. Nor is there a risk that they will not gain access to various services due to technical problems in dealing with the actual personal identification. Our proposal will also mean that Sweden’s international reputation will be improved since there will be less criticism directed at Sweden.</p>
<p>People who are covered by the Act on Immunity and Privileges but do not fulfil the requirements for receiving a personal identity number can instead, as at present, be assigned a coordination number.</p>
<p>The Government Offices alone will have the right to request personal identity numbers or coordination numbers for these people.</p>
<p>Other proposals on coordination numbers and personal identity numbers</p>
<p>One of the problems with coordination numbers is establishing the identity of the people who are to be assigned such a number. At present there are no rules or guidelines for what the requirements should be for an identity to be considered established. We therefore propose that the Swedish Tax Agency specify the requirements regarding identification of those people who are to be assigned a coordination number.</p>
<p>We further propose that the Swedish Tax Agency be allowed to request the documents that formed the basis of the requesting agency’s identification of the individual, and that, when necessary, the Swedish Tax Agency be allowed to deny assigning an individual a coordination number if his or her identity is not established.</p>
<p>We also propose that an additional group of people – those covered by the Reception of Asylum Seekers and Others Act (1994:137) – should be eligible to be assigned a coordination number even if their identity has not been established.</p>
<p>The address specified in the agency’s request for coordination numbers or personal identity numbers may be changed following application by the individual. If change of address information has been submitted to an agency other than the Swedish Tax Agency, this agency is to notify the Tax Agency of the new address, provided that secrecy does not prevent this.</p>
<p>It should not be possible to appeal against a decision on assigning personal identity numbers to people covered by the Act on Immunity and Privileges. It should be possible for the population register database and SPAR to contain information about people who have been assigned a personal identity number without being entered in the population register.</p>
<p>We consider that existing regulations provide sufficient protection in the event of persecution and similar matters even for people who are assigned a personal identity number or a coordination number.</p>
<p>Consequences</p>
<p>A new personal identity number</p>
<p>Costs</p>
<p>A change in personal identity numbers will probably entail costs for practically all areas of society. It is therefore difficult to assess the total costs that the proposal may involve. Some alternative changes to the personal identity number have proved to entail very large costs. We have therefore chosen one of the most costeffective alternatives.</p>
<p>We estimate the costs for implementing our proposal to between a few million and 50 million kronor for most of the actors who need information about the day of birth in their activities. The costs appear to vary greatly depending on the size of the agency or organisation. For some actors, such as the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, the costs may be higher. The costs arise from the need to make changes in existing IT systems so as to make it possible to register information about dates of birth. It is thus a question of one-off costs. No noteworthy additional costs should arise once the change has been implemented. The new number should not entail any costs at all to actors who do not need information about the day of birth. The costs are unavoidable and may be considered to be of such a nature that it should be possible for each actor to cover them using the resources available to them.</p>
<p>Other consequences</p>
<p>We consider that our proposal for a new personal identity number will have some limited negative consequences over a transitional period until new routines are developed. This applies to those actors who need to know exact dates of birth in some situations, for example, the day an individual becomes legally competent. However, everyone who needs information about an actual day of birth can obtain this information from the Swedish Tax Agency’s population register database or SPAR. Further, it is often sufficient to know the year and month in which an individual was born. The proposal has no consequences for those who do not need information about the day of birth.</p>
<p>An individual often sees the date of birth as a single unit – made up of the year, month and day – and the new personal identity number may therefore feel inconsistent and strange. There is also the risk of errors, since an individual can sometimes be requested to specify his or her personal identity number, and sometimes his or her actual day of birth, and accordingly it may be unclear what information is requested.</p>
<p>Our proposal has no consequences for public and private actors in their capacity as employers.</p>
<p>Personal identification for people not entered in the population register</p>
<p>Costs</p>
<p>We consider the costs of enabling other agencies to request coordination numbers to be limited. The proposal that certain people can be assigned a personal identity number without being entered in the population register is estimated to cost a few million kronor.</p>
<p>Other consequences</p>
<p>We consider that our proposals for improving the identity checks that will be made before an individual is assigned a coordination number will mean that society’s confidence in these numbers will increase. It may be possible for people who are assigned coordination numbers and personal identity numbers to be entitled to additional services in society, such as an e-ID.</p>
<p>Our assessment is that it will take several years before the problems faced by people with coordination numbers are completely solved. People covered by the Act on Immunity and Privileges who, with our proposal, can obtain a personal identity number will, in our assessment, quickly find it easier to deal with practical, everyday issues.</p>
<p>In addition, our proposals have certain positive consequences for work with crime prevention.</p>
<p>Implementation of our proposals</p>
<p>We propose that the new personal identity number be introduced on 1 January 2010 and that the regulations on coordination numbers and personal identity numbers for people who will not be entered in the population register enter into force on 1 January 2009.</p>
