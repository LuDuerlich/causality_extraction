<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>The remit</p>
<p>In its terms of reference, the Inquiry is instructed to survey the extent of problems concerning late payments and long payment periods, and to analyse the need for measures. The Inquiry is also to propose measures to remedy the problems, on the basis of the needs analysis.</p>
<p>The survey</p>
<p>Statistics Sweden has carried out three surveys on our behalf. The first was a questionnaire survey addressed to 3 000 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The purpose of this survey was to learn more about the prevalence of long payment periods, the reasons why enterprises agree on long payment periods and make late payments, and how enterprises are affected by long payment periods. The questionnaire survey was supplemented by a followup survey in which 300 of the enterprises that responded to the questionnaire indicate payment periods for a number of randomly chosen invoices.</p>
<p>As a further supplement, we have carried out an interview survey with representatives of the management of the largest companies in 18 industries. Over 300 business leaders have been interviewed. This survey serves two purposes: to learn more about the causes of long payment periods and late payments by large companies, and to obtain a better picture of companies’ policies concerning credit periods.</p>
<p>Contractual payment periods</p>
<p>The average contractual payment period is 27 days. By far the dominant contractual payment period in Sweden is 30 or 31 days. According to our estimates, only about 7 per cent of invoices sent out by an average SME have a contractual payment period exceeding 31 days. Approximately 4 per cent of the invoices have a contractual payment period exceeding 60 days.</p>
<p>The average contractual payment period does not vary significantly according to the industry companies belong to or according to the industry or sector in which they make their main sales. However, subcontractors selling mainly to the transport equipment industry and to the electronics, radio, TV and communications equipment industry are relatively often subjected to contractual payment periods of 60 days or longer. The size of supplying and purchasing companies has a certain relevance to the contractual payment period. Invoices between large companies tend to have longer contractual payment periods than invoices between smaller companies. On average, export-intensive companies agree on longer payment periods with their clients than companies focusing on the domestic market.</p>
<p>Late payments</p>
<p>According to our survey, on average about half of all invoices sent out by SMEs to other companies and to public sector clients are paid too late. Most of the delays are short. However, our survey indicates that as many as 16 per cent of the invoices are paid more than a week after the due date.</p>
<p>Microenterprises (1–9 employees), small enterprises (10–49 employees) and medium-sized enterprises (50–249 employees) are more or less equally affected by late payments. Further, the findings do not reveal any clear signs of differences in payment practices between companies belonging to different size categories. Export-intensive companies state that they are affected by late payments to a greater extent than companies focusing on the domestic market. According to our study subcontractors supplying certain industries are somewhat more affected by late payments than others. However, the differences are too small to allow any definite conclusions to be drawn. Subcontractors supplying the</p>
<p>central government sector are relatively little affected by late payments. Subcontractors supplying the local government sector seem to be affected by late payments as much as subcontractors supplying the private sector.</p>
<p>Actual payment periods</p>
<p>Our study show that the average actual payment period for invoices sent out by Swedish SMEs to other companies or to the public sector is 30 days. The result of our study indicates that SMEs on average have somewhat longer actual payment periods for outgoing invoices than microenterprises. The results also indicate that the actual payment period is longer for invoices sent to large companies.</p>
<p>International comparisons show that the actual payment period in commercial transactions between companies and between companies and the public sector is shorter in Sweden and other Nordic countries than in other European countries. This finding is explained by both shorter contractual payment periods and fewer and shorter delays.</p>
<p>Need for measures</p>
<p>Long contractual payment periods</p>
<p>The decisive factor determining the need for measures to promote shorter contractual payment periods is the extent to which creditors assume a subordinate position in the contractual relationship when an agreement on long payment periods is established. This may be the case, for example, for subcontractors who are in a position of dependence on a dominant client. Our studies show that it is common for enterprises to be put under pressure to accept long contractual payment periods. Our questionnaire survey also shows that where companies have agreed to long payment periods as a result of pressure, this has had a considerable impact on their cash flow. The prevalence of pressure to accept long contractual payment periods differs according to the industry in which firms have their clients. Our findings suggest that subcontractors supplying the publishing and printing industry, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals industry, the transport</p>
<p>equipment industry, and wholesale and retail trade are particularly subject to pressure to accept long payment periods.</p>
<p>Existing legislation may offer opportunities to prevent long contractual payment periods when the supplier occupies a subordinate position in relation to the client. The Terms of Contract between Tradesmen Act (1984:292) allows the Market Court to prevent continued application of terms that are grossly unreasonable. An application for a prohibition may be lodged with the Market Court by an individual business operator, a group of business operators or some other association that has a legitimate interest in representing business operators. Entrepreneurs’ and industry organisations can therefore have an application for an order prohibiting long contractual payment periods examined by a court.</p>
<p>Late payments</p>
<p>About half the companies state that late payments have a considerable or quite considerable influence on the company’s cash flow. Our analysis shows that cash flow problems due to late payments have serious economic consequences for businesses and society. An equally large proportion asserts that late payments have a very considerable or quite considerable impact on the company’s administrative burden. A very rough estimate suggests that companies put sums that must be counted in billions of Swedish kronor per year into processing late payments and non-payments from other companies and the public sector. These are resources that could be used to produce goods and services instead.</p>
<p>Overall we consider that society stands to benefit from inducing the business sector and the public sector to more often pay credits connected with commercial transactions in time.</p>
<p>Deliberations</p>
<p>Our terms of reference require us to present proposals based on the need for changes revealed by our studies. The measures that are discussed and that require changes in the legislation also have adverse consequences for business. In the absence of a thorough analysis of the negative consequences, it is difficult to assess</p>
<p>whether the problems caused by long contractual payment periods and late payments are so serious, and the proposals so effective, that this can outweigh the disadvantages. Given the time allowed for our inquiry and the resources at our disposal, it has not been possible to investigate these issues sufficiently for it to be reasonable for us to present definite legislative proposals.</p>
<p>Our remit does not include proposing changes in the time allowed for reporting and paying value added tax, tax deductions and employer’s social contributions. It has become apparent in the course of our investigation that for many companies, the rules for VAT exacerbate the problems caused by long contractual payment periods and late payments. While our inquiry has been in progress, the Government has announced proposals that will allow small companies to report VAT on a quarterly basis. This will reduce the risk of small companies being forced to make VAT payments before they have been paid by their clients.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is not part of our remit to present proposals that change fundamental civil law regulations. Tackling the problems caused by agreements on long commercial credit periods by legislative means would require restricting the freedom of contract. In our view, these issues are so close to the heart of civil law that proposals in this direction fall outside the scope of our remit. In addition, we consider the Terms of Contract between Tradesmen Act (1984:292) can be applied so as to make it possible to prevent long contractual payment periods.</p>
<p>The measures that we consider possible to implement at national level concern increased costs for those who do not pay in time, increased transparency regarding payment periods at larger companies, and information measures.</p>
<p>Rules on late payment interest rates, debt recovery fees, etc.</p>
<p>Measures making it more expensive for a debtor not to pay in time would probably reduce the prevalence of late payments. Examples of such measures include a financial penalty in the event of late payment, a higher late payment interest rate and the possibility of charging higher fees for debt recovery measures.</p>
<p>Requirement for information in large companies’ external reporting</p>
<p>One way to increase the pressure on some large companies to pay in time could be rules requiring these companies to include information in their annual reports about, for example, average payment periods or the number of debts that are paid late. The UK has rules that, on certain conditions, require companies to include information about payment periods in their public reports.</p>
<p>Information measures</p>
<p>Increased awareness of the costs of not being paid in time, the compensation creditors are entitled to and how to go about obtaining compensation and payment could improve the situation, particularly for the smallest companies. It may be a good idea to commit public resources to producing and compiling such information, even if it is not obvious that the state should assume the main responsibility for such a measure.</p>
