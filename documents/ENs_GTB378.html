<p>The assignment</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s assignment has been to examine certain issues in the Act concerning the Ethical Review of Research involving Humans (2003:460) (the Ethical Review Act). The assignment has included considering whether the scope of the Act should be enlarged, making an examination of the processing by the ethical review boards and the Medical Products Agency of applications relating to clinical trials of medicinal products, proposing suitable procedures for appointing members and alternates to the ethical review boards, and following up on the routines of the ethical review boards for processing matters relating to research involving egg donation. The Inquiry has also had to investigate whether any particular difficulties, from a processing point of view, have arisen in applying the Act or with the ordinances that regulate ethical review, and if so, to propose changes.</p>
<p>Scope of the Ethical Review Act</p>
<p>The Ethical Review Act applies to research that involves a physical intervention or is conducted according to a method that is intended to affect a human being physically or mentally. The Act also applies to research involving a physical intervention affecting a deceased person or concerning studies of biological material that has been taken from a living or deceased person and can be traced to that person. In addition, the Act applies to research that is conducted without the express consent of the individual and that involves dealing with sensitive personal data as defined by the Personal Data Act (1998:204), or personal data concerning offences against the law, or similar information.</p>
<p>The scope of the Act – as stated above – encompasses research that uses methods intended to affect the person who is the subject of the research physically or mentally. Hence it does not cover situations in which the individual researcher can foresee that the method concerned may harm the research subject, although this is not the intention of the researcher. Nor does the Act encompass research involving processing of personal data in the cases listed above if the research subject has given his or her express consent to such processing. Research in the areas now mentioned is sensitive and such processing entails an obvious risk of violations of personal integrity. It is, moreover, in the interest of the individual researcher to have such research projects subjected to ethical review.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore proposes that the Act is enlarged to include a requirement for ethical review, first, in cases involving processing of sensitive personal data as defined by the Personal Data Act, irrespective of whether the research subject has given his or her consent or not, and, second, in cases where research is conducted according to a method that entails an obvious risk of harming the research subject.</p>
<p>The Ordinance concerning the Duties of Regional Ethical Review Boards (2003:616) contains regulations on advisory opinions. These opinions are issued by the ethical review boards upon request from the responsible research body and are optional. In order to give the review increased weight, the Inquiry proposes that the relevant provisions are incorporated in the Ethical Review Act and are there designated “optional review”. Where appropriate, the Act shall apply to optional review.</p>
<p>Processing of applications concerning clinical trials of medicinal products</p>
<p>A clinical study of the characteristics of a medicinal product using human subjects (a clinical trial of a medicinal product) currently requires both a review by the regional ethical review board and consideration by the Medical Products Agency.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has examined the possibility of creating a system in which the applicant only submits one application. The application form used by the Medical Products Agency has been designed by the European Commission’s guidelines group and is used by all EU Member States. The Inquiry therefore considers that it would be</p>
<p>unfortunate to change the form. The form used by the ethical review boards has been drawn up by the Swedish Research Council and there is no difficulty in changing it. After closer examination of whether it is possible to use the Medical Products Agency form for the purposes of the ethical review application as well, the Inquiry has found that there are a number of points missing in the Medical Products Agency form. The Inquiry has not found any convincing grounds to require researchers applying to the ethical review boards to fill in the Medical Products Agency form and then submit an extensive supplementary appendix. The Inquiry therefore proposes that the parallel application forms used by the two authorities should both be retained.</p>
<p>Further, as it has not been possible to specify any advantages of introducing a coordination procedure under which the two application forms would be submitted to and issued from the same address, the Inquiry does not propose any such scheme.</p>
<p>It has, however, become apparent that there is a need for coordination between the Medical Products Agency and the ethical review boards regarding information and consent to clinical trials, as well as other matters. The Inquiry therefore proposes that there should be consultation between the Medical Products Agency and the Swedish Research Council so as to bring about increased consistency in such issues.</p>
<p>Members and alternates on ethical review boards</p>
<p>A regional ethical review board consists of a chair, ten scientifically qualified members and five members representing the public interest. An alternate is appointed for each member. At present the Government appoints all members and alternate members of the regional ethical review boards (590 people). It is a heavy responsibility for the Government to appoint so many representatives.</p>
<p>The chairs of the regional ethical review boards and their alternates should continue to be appointed by the Government. In order to relieve the Government of the task of nominating the other members and alternate members, the Inquiry proposes that they should instead be appointed by the Swedish Research Council following proposals from universities and county councils/regions. Appointments shall be for a period of three years.</p>
<p>Proposals of suitable people with scientific qualifications should be presented by the universities at which the regional ethical review boards have their secretariat, following consultation with the higher education institutions in the geographical area covered by the board. Proposals of suitable people to represent the public interest can be delivered by different stakeholders to the county councils/regions in which the regional ethical review boards have their secretariat. In addition, the county council/region in which the regional ethical review boards have their secretariat should present proposals for suitable people, following consultation with other county councils/regions in the geographical area covered by the board.</p>
<p>The Government should continue to appoint the members and alternates on the Central Ethical Review Board.</p>
<p>Stem cell research</p>
<p>The approval of a regional ethical review board is required to conduct research that involves egg donation. No permission from the National Board of Health and Welfare is required in such cases. As this type of research is ethically sensitive and information about such research projects should be followed up at central level, the Inquiry proposes that the regional ethical review boards should be obliged to inform the National Board of Health and Welfare whether such research has been subjected to ethical review. The Swedish Research Council should issue regulations containing guidelines on how decisions by the ethical review boards should be formulated so as to facilitate data processing.</p>
<p>Other matters</p>
<p>The concept of research</p>
<p>The Ethical Review Act defines research as scientific research plus development work on a scientific basis. The Act gives no real guidance for interpreting the concept. Moreover, the definition given in the Act is circular, in that the concept to be explained is included in the explanation. The Inquiry therefore proposes a change in the definition given in the Act so that research is to be understood as a systematic scientific search for new knowledge. This will bring the definition into line with the OECD definition of the concept of</p>
<p>research, since research will then refer to basic research, applied research and development work.</p>
<p>Confirmation of previous approval</p>
<p>A research project that falls under the Ethical Review Act is examined on a single occasion by an ethical review board. Once permission has been given, no further examination occurs unless there is a question of a change in the research project. Approval lapses if research has not begun by at most two years after the approval decision came into force.</p>
<p>Swedish universities are highly dependent on external funds for research. For universities with outstanding medical and biological research, American financing is an increasingly important source of income. The US authorities have strict formal requirements for receiving research funds in terms of ethical review of research projects. For instance, a project financed by federal funds is required to undergo ethical scrutiny at least once a year. If these requirements are not fulfilled, the funding provider is entitled to cancel any grants approved.</p>
<p>In order to protect Swedish universities from the risk of losing research grants from foreign sources, the Inquiry proposes the introduction of a possibility to request confirmation of a previously approved research project by means of an optional review by a regional ethical review board.</p>
<p>Reporting of adverse reactions</p>
<p>The European Directive on good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use includes regulations on reporting serious adverse reactions (SUSARs). The Directive states, for example, that once a year the sponsor must report all suspected serious unexpected adverse reactions that have occurred to the ethics committee in each Member State (in Sweden, the ethical review board). In Sweden the ethical review boards have no power to revoke approval once it has been given.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the present system requiring sponsors to send reports on adverse reactions to the ethical review boards serves no real purpose. It is therefore proposed that the reports on</p>
<p>adverse reactions should only be sent to the Medical Products Agency for examination from its point of view. A regulation to this effect should be introduced in the statute book of the Medical Products Agency</p>
<p>Consequences of the Inquiry’s proposals</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals will lead to augmented duties for the Swedish Research Council. In order to finance this – and some of the financial deficit the operations incur – the minimum fees should be raised.</p>
<p>Need for future review</p>
<p>In connection with the Inquiry’s review of the Ethical Review Act, it has become apparent that there may be a continued need for review as regards secrecy, certain research databases and the organisation of the ethical review boards. There is also reason to keep an eye on certain issues associated with the geographical coverage of the Ethical Review Act.</p>
