<p>This report presents the current state of knowledge concerning the distribution of injury risks among Swedish children and youth, based on their socioeconomic status.</p>
<p>Over the years, there has been a lot of scientific evidence produced from very many different countries showing that people from lower social classes have mortality rates significantly higher than those from upper social classes, at least as far as each major cause of death is concerned. Large social differences have been observed at younger ages, with decreasing trends as age increases, particularly with regard to accidents and violent deaths.</p>
<p>Until recently, Sweden lacked information concerning the social distribution of injuries of various kinds. Also, as is the case for several other countries, little was known about the socioeconomic patterning of nonfatal injuries and about how socioeconomic distribution varies with age during childhood and adolescence.</p>
<p>An age and diagnostic specific mapping of the socioeconomic distribution of injuries can provide the foundation for the setting of priorities and the choice of preventive strategies.</p>
<p>This report presents an overview of the main results of a number of national studies based on register data linking children and youth to their parents and documenting a number of family and parental social attributes as well as characteristics of injuries found in outpatient and death registers. The period covered is primarily the first half of the nineties.</p>
<p>Based on international evidence, several types of injuries were considered, such as various categories of road users, injuries due to interpersonal violence and self-inflicted injuries. Both crosssectional and cohort study designs were used. In the crosssectional studies, various injury diagnoses were compared at different ages (0–4, 5–9, 10–14 and 15–19 years); in the cohort-</p>
<p>study, attention was paid to various categories of road users during childhood and youth, regardless of age.</p>
<p>Children’s socioeconomic status (SES) was established using thatof the highest member of their household, as attributed by Statistics Sweden in the census of 1990. The Swedish individual SES is a measure of class, based on one’s occupation and the average educational level required for that particular occupation. Seven household SESs were used: high/intermediate-level salaried employees, low-level salaried employees, unskilled workers, skilled workers, farmers, self-employed, and others (e.g. students, housewives, persons on early-retirement pension and long-term unemployed). High/intermediate-level salaried employees were used as the reference group in all instances.</p>
<p>In general terms, the report throws light on considerable differences in the distribution of injury risks, based on parental socioeconomic status. Compared to children from highand middle-level salaried employees, children from several socioeconomic groups show an over-risk of injuries in most diagnosis groups (among others traffic injuries, self-inflicted and violencerelated injuries). This applies to both boys and girls. In particular, children from unskilled worker families and the socioeconomic group “others” are at substantially higher risk. Another difference that is worth mentioning is the over-risk of traffic injuries associated with motorised vehicles among the children of farmers and other self-employed families.</p>
<p>In absolute terms, when consideration is paid to the incidence of unintentional injuries, only quite small differences are found between socioeconomic groups for fall and traffic injuries whereas differences are substantial for “other unintentional injuries” (e.g., burns, drowning, poisoning) in the younger age group (0–4 years). In the other age groups (5–9, 10–14 and 15–19 years), differences remain rather small for fall injuries while they become quite important for traffic injuries (all categories of road users aggregated). Differences in traffic injury incidence are largest in the older age group (15–19 years), particularly among boys.</p>
<p>A closer look at injury incidences for different categories of road users reveals clear socioeconomic differences for pedestrians, cyclists, motor vehicle passengers and motor vehicle drivers. Definitely, in both absolute and relative terms, socioeconomic differences increase remarkably when young people come into</p>
<p>contact with motorised vehicles (i.e., mopeds, motorcycles and cars).</p>
<p>Absolute differences in intentional injuries (i.e., due to interpersonal violence or self-inflicted) were studied exclusively among children aged 10 14 and 15 19 years. The group with self-inflicted injuries was the diagnostic group with by far the largest differences between children (particularly girls) from different socioeconomic groups. In relative terms, the largest differences were found in the age group 10 14 years, in violence-related injuries among boys and in self-inflicted injuries among girls.</p>
<p>The size of the gap between the mortality and morbidity rates of the most and the least advantaged groups can be regarded as indicative of the potential for improvement in a nation’s injury risk level. Methodologically, the magnitude of the risk difference between social groups can be measured in a large variety of ways. One such measure is the percentage of reduction in injuries expectable for the overall population given that children from all socioeconomic groups would incur the same risk as those with the lower risk (in this report, in most instances, the children of middle and upper level salaried employees); this is called the population attributable risk (PAR).</p>
<p>In the data at hand, in the case of unintentional injuries, the category “other unintentional injuries” has the highest PAR-value among children from the younger age group (15%) and the category of traffic injuries, the highest PAR – by far – in all three older age groups (20%, 14%, and 20% respectively). The greatest potential for improvement is found in intentional injuries, particularly for violence-related injuries among boys 10-14 years (51%).</p>
<p>Social differences in injury risks and injury consequences arise because children and young people are variously disadvantaged according to social group due to: differing opportunities for safety (e.g. some face higher structural risks in the physical and social environment); differing opportunities for avoiding risk (e.g. some are at greater circumstantial risk due to limited chances to compensate for – or cope with – danger and avoid injury); differing access to medical care (for treatment and rehabilitation).</p>
<p>In order to pave the way for sound preventive activities with the potential for promoting safety and reduce inequalities in risks, research is needed to clarify both the mechanisms underlying such differences and the differential impacts of safety measures.</p>
<p>The report puts into perspective various types of intervention susceptible to impact on the socioeconomic patterning of injury risks, classifying them according to their ultimate goal. A first set concerns those interventions aiming at decreasing the extent to which children and young people are differentially exposed to injury risks. This kind of measure usually falls into the category of primary prevention measures that attempt to lower structural risk levels in various living environments. Examples of such measures are housing policies, well-functioning and affordable public transport systems, product safety regulation or the creation and maintenance of inclusive public places.</p>
<p>A second type of measure aims at counterbalancing individual vulnerability to injury risks rather than lowering the risk levels to which individual from various socioeconomic groups are otherwise exposed. This is what happens with e.g., the inclusion of swimming lessons in school curricula, the free distribution and installation of smoke detectors in deprived living areas or that of bicycle helmets to young people living in such areas. Advocacy is also a measure of that type.</p>
<p>A third type of measure is the prevention of the unequal consequences of injuries. It can be achieved by the sound governance of medical services or by other types of measures aiming at reducing the consequences of injurious events. An example of such programmes at national levels can be found in the Swedish “Vision Zero”. Vision Zero is an approach to road safety endeavours founded on the premise that no one should have to be killed or seriously injured as a result of an accident within the transport system. Increased car crash safety (e.g., air bags) and traffic calming measures are injury-control means in line with that vision.</p>
<p>Finally, another type of strategy of a very different nature could have as a target to influence the social stratification process per se, through economic, social and educational policies that decrease the divisions between different groups in society and also influence the ease with which social mobility can take place.</p>
<p>As is the case in several other fields of action, a commitment towards the reduction of injury risk differentials between social groups will require concerted and multiple intervention. This will not be achieved without facing major ethical issues (among others the risk of stigmatizing some groups). But, as several have already stressed, this may be, if not above all, a matter of justice.</p>
