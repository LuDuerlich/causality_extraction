<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Swedish drug policy has come to a crossroads. One direction calls for a significant augmentation of resources in the form of commitment, direction, competence and funding. The other implies a lowering of sights and a considerable acceptance of drug abuse.</p>
<p>This is the main conclusion drawn by the Drugs Commission from its evaluation of public drug policy measures since the mid- 1980s. The review covered legislation in this field and measures to prevent abuse and rehabilitate abusers, as well as measures to limit the supply of narcotic drugs.</p>
<p>In the course of its work, the Drugs Commission has identified major deficiencies in the field of drug policy today.</p>
<p>The present state of drug policy is above all due to a demotion of the drugs issue as a political priority. The absence of political concern is of course reflected, among other things, by reduced funding of the public authorities and other sectors of the community which have to deal with narcotic drugs and their consequences. During recent years, all sectors of society in this field have experienced heavy cutbacks, simultaneously with the problem itself becoming severer and more widespread.</p>
<p>There are deficiencies today in the structure for combating the drugs problem, above all as regards preventive work and the care and treatment which abusers are now being offered. The very fact of more and more young persons taking an increasingly permissive attitude towards narcotic drugs reveals that a great deal of preventive work is not getting through. The care and treatment of drug abusers is a field which has been subjected to extensive spending cuts and downgradings by the municipalities of Sweden. In many communities the continuity of operations has been lost, and the Drugs Commission has also found a need for improving the competence of the persons dealing with these questions. It is the heavy abuser groups that have been the main victims. In the prison and</p>
<p>probation system too, there has been a downscaling of measures to channel drug abusers into care and rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Drug control authorities have also experienced heavy funding reductions and other changes in recent years. Meanwhile the supply of drugs has increased, in common with the pressure on Sweden as a drug market. Needless to say, this has compounded the difficulty of stemming the influx of narcotic drugs.</p>
<p>Drug control authorities, however, are in no uncertainty regarding such fundamentals as the purpose, means and ends of drug prevention. In recent years, consequently, control measures have predominated in practice, although in the debate on drug policy the focus of attention has often been on care and treatment, or the lack of them. In this way the vital balance of Swedish drug policy between different measures to curb demand and reduce the availability of narcotic drugs is being lost.</p>
<p>In its choice of direction, the Drugs Commission has found that Sweden’s restrictive policy on drugs must be sustained and reinforced. The Commission finds no arguments or facts to suggest that a policy of lowering society’s guard against drug abuse and drug trafficking would do anything to improve matters for individual abusers or for society as a whole. On the other hand, the results of Sweden’s present policy on narcotic drugs could – and must – be improved. In this report, accordingly, the Drugs Commission puts forward proposals aimed at creating coherence and balance and at strengthening, renewing and developing the restrictive policy on narcotic drugs.</p>
<p>Stronger political leadership</p>
<p>The Drugs Commission sees a need for stronger prioritisation, clearer control and better follow-up of drug policy and of concrete initiatives at all levels, from the local work done by municipalities and county councils to governmental activity.</p>
<p>The Commission recommends stronger leadership of drug policy, with the Government playing a more active role, both nationally and internationally. It further proposes a model for stronger local initiatives and improved local co-ordination, together with a more active role for central authorities in the development of methods and competence.</p>
<p>Responsibility for implementing the various policy components devolves on public authorities and organisations at local, regional and central level. The location of responsibilities at local and regional levels entails a considerable variation of ambition and commitment from one municipality and county council to another.</p>
<p>There is some co-ordination and interaction of initiatives on a sectorial basis or at local level, but there is no central co-ordination based on the holistic perspective on which drug policy so greatly depends. This in turn means that there is no overarching follow-up or development of the measures taken, nor is there any evaluation of their impact on each other.</p>
<p>Despite the fragmented picture thus emerging, the drugs Commission sees no reason for altering the basis allocation of responsibilities where drug questions are concerned. Nor does the Commission believe that more detailed legislation would help to bring about a constructive interaction of different agencies. Interaction ought instead to be based on an analysis of each agent’s potential contribution, of the benefits accruing from improved interaction, and of the necessity and possibilities of developing methods, knowledge and competence. The initiative in bringing about this kind of interaction – an active partnership between those who are affected and are responsible for addressing drug problems – ought in the Commission’s opinion to come from the Government, which must also provide a coherent follow-up of the measures taken.</p>
<p>Drug policy questions are the concern of several Ministries. The Minister of Health and Social Affairs is the minister responsible for the co-ordination of drug policy. The Drugs Commission takes the view that the national leadership should be reinforced by the appointment, within the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, of a minister specifically charged with the direction of drug policy activities. This would serve as a clear manifestation of national political leadership concerning the drugs issue.</p>
<p>The Minister’s duties should include responsibility for the direction and co-ordination of both national and international drug policy work, the main task being to frame long-term strategies for the achievement of national drug policy aims. This work must be based on a holistic perspective and must include all public measures to combat drugs, coupled with a clearer responsibility than at present for co-ordinating the work of national authorities.</p>
<p>To facilitate and intensify a development and co-ordination of local initiatives, the Drugs Commission proposes that local drug policy strategies be put in place by municipalities and county councils.</p>
<p>These local strategies are to serve as overarching steering documents, describing measures planned or in progress for the entire field of drug policy. The level of aspiration, like the choice of initiatives and methods, will be for each municipality to decide according to local conditions, but both long-term and short-term operational targets are to be clearly indicated, as well as the manner in which work is to be conducted, organised, evaluated and funded. The Drugs Commission further takes the view that the State shall to the greatest extent possible support municipalities and county councils in their framing of local strategies, not least by contributing towards a development of methods and competence.</p>
<p>Local mapping of the drug situation and of the extent of abuse should form part of the local strategies. Such mapping should if possible be conducted in such a way that it can also be used for national conspectuses. It is proposed that the National Institute of Public Health be commissioned, in collaboration with municipalities and county councils, to lay down practical guidelines for local mapping.</p>
<p>The development of interaction and of professional networks is an important part of local strategies. There is above all an urgent need to resolve problems of interaction between different agencies with curative responsibilities, because otherwise drug abusers are liable to fall between two stools. This applies to heavy abusers for whom composite and prolonged initiatives are required, and also to persons who are in the early stages of drug abuse and for whom readily available measures are vital.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the County Administrative Boards be allotted greater responsibility for the development of methods and competence. They should assist the municipalities with the framing of local strategies and should also be responsible for following up those strategies. In addition, it is recommended that the County Administrative Boards be allotted a role in the mediation of contacts between research environments and the municipalities.</p>
<p>Where central authorities are concerned, developments have moved towards a concentration of follow-up and supervisory tasks. The Drugs Commission points out that follow-up and supervision can generate considerable knowledge of developments at local level</p>
<p>within each authority’s ambit. The Commission wishes to highlight the importance of this knowledge being fed back to the agencies at local level, instead of being confined to the central authorities. In this process, the central authorities have the responsibility of analysing experiences in a holistic perspective and drawing conclusions regarding the need and opportunities for a development of methods and competence.</p>
<p>The Drugs Commission recommends that the central authorities assume greater responsibility for the active prosecution of questions concerning knowledge transfer and the development of methods and competence. This in turn calls for a strengthening of co-operation between the authorities themselves, not only in order to guarantee that no areas are excluded from surveillance, but also as a safeguard against unnecessary duplication of effort.</p>
<p>Both the county follow-ups, which the Commission proposes be conducted by the County Administrative Boards, and the more overarching follow-ups to be undertaken by the various authorities should be capable of furnishing good supportive documentation for overall assessments by the Government. On the basis of these analyses, the Government should be able to steer public initiatives more actively and where necessary propose studies, development initiatives and research in what are found to be fields of urgent importance. In addition, the Government should furnish the Riksdag (parliament) with regular complete reports on drug policy developments.</p>
<p>To mark the inauguration of a new offensive against drug problems, and as a starting point for partnership, the Commission recommends that national and regional conferences be held by the Government, together with the national authorities concerned, the Swedish Association of Local Authorities, the Federation of Swedish County Councils and NGOs. Developments will ultimately depend on whether drug policy initiatives can also be sustained in the long term, and ways of realising such a long-term solution should form the subject of such an inaugural series of conferences.</p>
<p>Measures to combat demand</p>
<p>As the Drugs Commission sees it, there are no hard and fast boundaries between preventive measures, care and treatment and</p>
<p>the restriction of supply. Commitment to effective care is also an important measure of prevention. Effective prevention and efficient care and treatment demand continuity and competence in the measures taken, and the Commission has therefore found itself called upon to suggest ways in which a structure can be designed which will be capable of both improving and deepening policy measures and of bringing about processes which can lead to development in the long term. Much of the preventive work that is being done today is characterised by temporary measures and projects which are often incapable of impacting on regular activities. Supportive environments for young persons have deteriorated and grown fewer in number, and both resources and methods are lacking for getting through to children and young persons at risk, as well as methods for intervening at an early stage of drug abuse. The Commission also finds grave deficiencies in the design of drug abuser care, added to which, the volume of such care is not commensurate with actual needs.</p>
<p>Current research into various preventive methods and programmes has shown that information and instruction about drugs occurring in a vacuum have no chance of impacting on young persons’ behaviour. In order to succeed, measures of this kind must be included in a system of measures restricting availability, and there must be clear rules which include society’s norms and values, as well as effective care and treatment.</p>
<p>The following are some of the areas of relevance to the development of abuse and to preventive work which have crystallised out of interviews with a large number of young persons: growing abuse of tablets and combinations of substances, young persons’ feeling of stress and exclusion, and the absence of an adult world.</p>
<p>The Commission’s contacts with authorities and organisations with responsibility for and knowledge of preventive work have pointed to a number of deficiencies in this field. The dissemination of knowledge and information is insufficient, with the result that effective methods have difficulty in getting through. Initiatives, above all in regular activities, are too infrequently documented and evaluated, and co-operation between different agencies suffers from the absence of a clear consensus view of what is to be termed preventive work.</p>
<p>Schools, in the Commission’s opinion, are the most important arena for drug prevention work, but there are many indications of preventive work in schools having diminished in recent years. The</p>
<p>Drugs Commission therefore proposes that the National Agency for Education, acting in collaboration with the National Institute of Public Health, be instructed to lay down guidelines for all school instruction concerning tobacco alcohol and narcotic drugs, for inclusion in the current Compulsory School and Upper Secondary School curricula.</p>
<p>In particular the Commission wishes to highlight methods aimed at working consistently and continuously with what is commonly termed social and emotional learning in school, with a view to promoting the mental health of children and young persons and increasing their resistance to drugs. The Commission also stresses the importance of a good school environment and of methods of pupil participation and parental involvement being developed in schools.</p>
<p>The Commission wants to stress the importance of developing strategies for the prevention of abuse among young adults between the ages of 18 and 25. They are often role examples to younger persons, and strategies for reaching them are lacking in most municipalities.</p>
<p>Not very much qualitative research exists as yet concerning the types of young person who use drugs on a more habitual basis. Survey findings, insofar as they exist, convey a contradictory picture. On the one hand a picture emerges of ordinary, problem-free youngsters using drugs without any serious consequences. On the other, it is also shown that the development of drug abuse commonly describes a pattern whereby the use of narcotic drugs has been preceded by extensive use of legal drugs and thus comes relatively late in the development of abuse.</p>
<p>One of the central tasks of preventive work is to counteract the normalisation of drug abuse. At the same time there must be preparedness for coping with the situation in the event of developments resulting in drugs becoming a more accepted element of everyday living. Without any reduction of efforts to reduce new recruitment, work must therefore be made to focus more than hitherto on measures to reach those who have already begun experimenting with drugs.</p>
<p>Schools and leisure amenities have the great responsibility of discovering young persons on the brink of abuse. The signals coming from such young persons must be quickly observed and responded to, and prompt action taken when abuse is revealed. Teachers with a knowledge of early signs and an ambition to sup-</p>
<p>port pupils who are not getting on well, like efficient school health care with a knowledge of young persons and substance abuse, are among the most important prerequisites for identifying and helping children in need of special support. Children and young persons with risk behaviour or otherwise in a risk zone must constitute a priority target group for preventive work in schools.</p>
<p>In order to reach young persons who have started experimenting with drugs, there must be an effective social safety net in school and in the local community, as well as structured co-operation between social services, the police, school, leisure-time activities and NGOs. The Drugs Commission has found, however, that social services in many quarters lack structured methods for working with these youngsters, and also that overarching cooperation between social services and the police is often lacking.</p>
<p>Curtailing young persons’ experimentation with drugs is a multi-stage process. Firstly, competence is needed to detect signals of drug use. Secondly, adequately dimensioned counselling activities are needed, and thirdly, there is a need for different treatment options. Parents whose children have become trapped in substance abuse, or are in the progress of becoming abusers, also need extensive support.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore proposes that all young persons and parents have access to local counselling on alcohol, drugs and abuse-related issues. These activities shall be purely advisory and shall be based on trust and voluntary participation.</p>
<p>Young persons who are experimenting with drugs or whose peers are doing so can also find themselves in situations where they are in more urgent need of counselling or assistance. The same also applies, of course, to parents and others closely connected with the youngsters themselves. It is important to be able to intercept young persons at this, a stage of things where they are motivated for changing their life-style and discontinuing their substance abuse.</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that a national helpline be set up to which questions concerning drugs and their abuse can be addressed free of charge and anonymously. The National Institute of Public Health should be commissioned to investigate how activities of this kind can be organised.</p>
<p>Younger people should not need to define themselves as substance abusers in order to get help and treatment. The Commission recommends that young people who need help in discontinuing</p>
<p>their substance abuse should be enabled to receive it at a reception adapted for young persons. A reception of this kind can be operated as a separate activity under the aegis of social services or be incorporated in the activities of youth receptions, which would then be reinforced by staff with special competence relating to young persons and drugs.</p>
<p>The Drugs Commission perceives a vital need, within the social services, for a reinforcement of specialist competence regarding young persons and substance abuse. Staff with specialist qualifications of this kind should take charge of investigative measures relating to young persons with possible substance abuse problems. The Commission therefore proposes that municipal social services, acting in close co-operation with local health care and medical services, develop and maintain special knowledge and competence relating to young persons and substance abuse. The National Board of Health and Welfare should support development of this kind within the framework of its development funding.</p>
<p>There are two basic principles applying to work with young persons who have started to abuse drugs, namely early discovery and clear reaction. Partly in order to facilitate early discovery, personal use of narcotic drugs was made a criminal offence in 1988, and in 1993 imprisonment for up to six months was added to the scale of penalties for the offence. In this way the police were enabled to take blood or urine samples in order to verify and secure evidence of a suspected drug offence. The Drugs Commission has commissioned a survey of measures taken by social services for young persons between the ages of 15 and 17 in connection with minor drug offences (personal use). The survey, including 288 individuals, showed that half of them were unknown to the social services or that their drug abuse was not known. Judging by the results of the survey, the decisions made by social services are appropriate and pragmatic.</p>
<p>One proposal often occurring in the course of debate is wider scope for compulsory drug testing. In the Commission’s opinion, drug tests can play an important part in the discovery of young persons who are heading for drug abuse, but it does not recommend any widening of the scope for compulsory drug testing of children under 15, i.e. children below the age for criminal liability. Nor has the Commission found it appropriate for such compulsory measures to be entrusted to school staff or to any other professional categories but the police. Finally, the Commission does not</p>
<p>favour legislation on the use of drug tests at work. In the Commission’s opinion, the feasibility of drug tests at work varies to such a great extent from one workplace and one sector of employment to another, that these activities should continue to be governed by collective agreements, not by law.</p>
<p>The Drugs Commission considers the care and treatment of drug abusers to be a necessary component of drug policy measures. Appropriate measures of treatment help to reduce drug abuse and serve to improve the situation of drug abusers. There are serious deficiencies in the design of drug abuser care today, and the volume of such care falls short of actual needs. Long-term initiatives are called for, above all as regards interaction and the development of methods and competence, but drug abuser care also needs to be given more resources. Deficiencies are especially great where heavy abuse is concerned, and methods are also lacking for responding to cases of incipient drug abuse. The Drugs Commission notes, however, that there is also a great deal of encouraging experience, and it expresses a basically positive view of the possibilities of influencing drug abuse and the situation for drug abusers through treatment measures of various kinds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission notes that statistics, follow-up and other documentation concerning drug abuser care is inadequate and hard to interpret, and in certain cases does not meet the documentation requirements laid down in the Social Services Act. This affects the legal security of the individual person seeking help, added to which, it impedes the planning and follow-up of public initiatives. The Commission has also found there to be considerable differences between municipalities, and even between different parts of the same municipality, as regards offering and conducting meaningful and long-term treatment measures for substance abusers.</p>
<p>The financial difficulties of municipalities and county councils are part of the reason for the inadequacy of drug abuser care in many quarters, though here again, the picture emerging is anything but uniform. To a great extent what seems to be involved is a combination of resource constraints and poor utilisation of the resources available, due among other things to bottlenecks, e.g. a shortage of detoxification places. In many places an infelicitous combination of economisation targets and division into progressively smaller performance units has thwarted the necessary holistic view of the individual abuser and of treatment initiatives.</p>
<p>Short-term, isolated decisions often take the place of interaction and examination of the abuser’s long-term needs.</p>
<p>There are indications to suggest that the number of heavy abusers has increased, and also that social service and other community agencies are less well informed about abusers than they used to be; at all events, there are fewer agencies involved per abuser. The documentation is also fairly unanimous in showing that the very heaviest category of abusers are faring badly and that, while admittedly receiving help in the form of emergency care, a certain amount of outpatient care, sheltered housing and to some extent periodic LVM care, they are more rarely the subject of long-term, co-ordinated initiatives.</p>
<p>One basic prerequisite for the efficacy and development of both care and outreach work is the availability within the municipality of personnel with in-depth knowledge of abuse problems and of the possibilities of long-term care and treatment The Commission wishes to underscore the importance of professional networks being built up and of different parts of community caring agencies together devising systems whereby long-term support can be provided even to those who are most at risk and least motivated. Models have to be found and applied which will prevent different agencies from ”passing the buck”, at the same time as responsibility for caring inputs and follow-up at every stage has to be clearly defined.</p>
<p>The Drugs Commission believes that properly adapted treatment for drug abuse generally has positive effects on the client’s drug habits and situation in life. But an individual initiative can never be expected to result in total rehabilitation. Generally a combination of several initiatives is needed. The abuser’s situation has to be viewed in a holistic perspective. If initiatives are carefully tailored to the needs and circumstances of the client, treatment outcomes can be considerably improved. Caring measures shall primarily emanate from and focus on the abusive behaviour, but at the same time, on a parallel basis, possibilities have to be created for processing the client’s other problems and difficulties. This generally requires the establishment of genuine co-operation between different care providers and community agencies with reference to individual persons.</p>
<p>The Drugs Commission wishes to underscore the importance of the support and initiatives devoted to the individual substance</p>
<p>abuser being adapted to his or her needs, circumstances and receptivity to care. Furthermore, true to the intentions of the Social Services Act, the measures taken must be planned and conducted in consensus with the individual and with respect for his or her personal integrity. Even in cases where the law sanctions coercive intervention, the measures taken must be based on analysis of the need and to the greatest possible extent in consultation with the abuser and/or his or her family.</p>
<p>On the basis of the national objectives, the Drugs Commission has formulated the following aims by which public measures of care and treatment for addition to and abuse of narcotic drugs should be guided.</p>
<p>All drug abusers shall be reached by an offer of help and, if necessary, care for the abuse.</p>
<p>Advice, support and assistance shall reach people at an early stage of abuse.</p>
<p>Measures of care shall be aimed at achieving a life free from substance abuse and illegal drugs.</p>
<p>Care and other measures on behalf of substance abusers shall be of good quality.</p>
<p>Measures to combat substance abuse shall be sustainable and long-term.</p>
<p>In keeping with the overarching aim of a drug-free society, the aim of measures of care and treatment is for abusers to be able to lead a life free of abuse and illegal drugs. The aim measures leading to the abuser’s discontinuation of the abuse must not, however, preclude the deployment of emergency or humanitarian measures.</p>
<p>The Drugs Commission is of the opinion that limited methadone medication, in common with other maintenance and blocking medication, does not pose any threat to the credibility of drug policy. So long as these activities form part of a sociopsychological whole and are amply documented, such programmes can play an important part in the control of transmissible diseases and in rehabilitation, for example.</p>
<p>The Commission also believes that other substitutes – buprenorphine preparations, for instance – should come under much the same rules as methadone when used as a substitute. It is generally essential, however, that more medically oriented drug abuser care should always be integrated with and supplemented by social welfare measures and follow-up.</p>
<p>Measures to combat supply</p>
<p>The Drugs Commission has not found any real deficiencies in the legislation or the working methods used by the authorities in the control sector. Co-operation between the authorities runs smoothly, and so too does international co-operation. In its report, however, the Drugs Commission refers to the imperative need for the authorities in the control sector to be allotted further resources with a view to reducing the supply of narcotic drugs.</p>
<p>The Commission’s report does not contain any proposals concerning such fundamental issues as the purpose, means and ends of drug prevention in the control sector. The proposals contained in chapter 5, relating to the control of both legal and illegal trading, are little more than minor adjustments to the system of rules and working methods which exists already and which the Commission has thus found appropriate.</p>
<p>Firstly , the Drugs Commission has reviewed the provisions governing the control of legal drug trading. Its proposals in this respect are aimed at reducing leakage into the illegal market.</p>
<p>First of all, the Commission recommends that the Medical Products Agency be instructed, acting in consultation with the authorities and organisations concerned, to construct a special reporting system for theft and other losses in transit to and from dispensaries and hospitals. No such coherent data are available at present.</p>
<p>The Drugs Commission finds it essential that the National Board of Health and Welfare should be able to investigate, more rapidly and effectively than at present, whether a physician is supplying the illegal market with narcotic drugs. At present the Board is compelled, in its supervisory capacity, to search manually among processed prescriptions at certain selected dispensaries, in order to investigate the pattern of a physician’s prescriptions. The Drugs Commission therefore proposes that the National Board of Health and Welfare be empowered, in the course of its supervisory activity, to obtain data from the Prescriptions Register concerning individual physicians’ prescription of narcotic medicinal preparations. Data referable to individual patients shall not, however, be eligible for collection.</p>
<p>The possibility of using the Prescriptions Registry for supervision in the above mentioned cases would achieve a significant time-saving and reduction of workload both for dispensary staff</p>
<p>and for the personnel of supervisory units within the National Board of Health and Welfare, added to which, the inclusion of all dispensations in the country would make the surveys more comprehensive.</p>
<p>To overcome the problem of drug abusers inducing several physicians, without one another’s knowledge, to each prescribe normal doses of narcotic medicinal preparations, the Commission proposes that dispensary staff be enabled to turn to prescribing physicians and inform them of this matter. A solution of this kind is at present precluded by the rules of secrecy, and the Commission therefore proposes that the matter be dealt with as part of the ongoing review of the Secrecy Act.</p>
<p>Secondly , the Drugs Commission has reviewed the legislation and working methods relating to the task of combating illegal drug trading.</p>
<p>The Drugs Commission has not gone into further detail concerning the best way for individual control authorities to organise their efforts to combat drugs. Where the police are concerned, however, the Commission has come across certain questions of an organisational nature, which are not easily ignored. This being so, the Commission proposes that the Government instruct the National Police Board to undertake, as part of its inspection activities, a special inspection of all police authorities to examine the interaction of different levels. Any shortcomings, which may be felt to exist, should be analysed and followed up. As part of such an inspection, the Commission proposes that the National Police Board analyse more closely, for example, the way in which the abolition of specialised drug squads has impacted on the quality of police investigations. One further circumstance, which the Commission feels should be studied more closely, is the compatibility of the age structure with the demands to be made on the organisation.</p>
<p>As regards the possibilities of preventing the spread of cannabis seeds, the Drugs Commission is of the opinion that the existing legislation can be said to afford scope for prosecuting anyone who sells, purchases or possesses such seeds for the purpose of using them for the production of narcotic drugs intended for abuse. In the Commission’s opinion, such actions ought to be classifiable as conspiring to commit a drug offence. In this way the provisions on seizure should also be applicable. Accordingly, no statutory</p>
<p>changes would appear necessary in order to prevent the sale of cannabis seeds.</p>
<p>In this connection the Commission underscores the importance of the Government working to maintain the Swedish ban on cultivation of the species Cannabis sativa.</p>
<p>”Swallowers” are a present-day problem. In street trading it happens that vendors of narcotic drugs keep their stock in their mouths and swallow it when approached by the police. To enable the police to secure evidence of a criminal offence, an order can at present be made for the suspect to be placed in a ”customs toilet”. In its report the Drugs Commission proposes the possibility of a person who is suspected on reasonable cause of having sold a narcotic drug and who can today be placed in a customs toilet instead being given an emetic or some other such medicament. An order to use a medicament shall be made by a prosecutor and only a physician shall be allowed to carry out the medication.</p>
<p>Where more serious drug crime is concerned, crime prevention authorities sometimes employ, among other things, what have come to be known as ”special investigation methods”. These include a working method such as controlled deliveries. Law does not regulate special investigation methods. The Drugs Commission sees no cause at present for introducing any such statutory regulation, but it is of the opinion that the Government should at the earliest possible opportunity appoint a special investigator who, together with representatives of the authorities concerned, will carry out a survey of the special investigation methods – as well as other working methods used in police investigation activities – and their current application. In addition, any points of uncertainty should be examined and clarified, and an inquiry should be made to ascertain whether there are additional working methods which can and should be developed with a view to further enhancing the efficacy of crime prevention. The Commission proposes that the Government, acting in the light of the findings thus obtained, instruct the relevant authorities to jointly draft guidelines on the subject.</p>
<p>Criminal welfare</p>
<p>The prison and probation system, not least in view of its intensive and close contact with a large number of drug abusers, has a pivotal bearing on society’s ability of combat, above all, the abuse of drugs. Both time spent in remand and in prison, and time on probation, must therefore be used to motivate abusers for treatment. The Commission finds, however, that the prison and probation system must take measures of this kind to a greater extent than at present.</p>
<p>The Drugs Commission sees an urgent need for the prison and probation system to be given resources, not only for the maintenance and improvement but also for an intensification of its measures to combat drug abuse. Activities in the prison and probation sector must as far as possible afford scope for the needs and capabilities of each individual. Methods for the planning of enforcement and treatment should be developed. Programme activities, methods development and competence development should be given priority, and activities in motivation and treatment units should be developed so as to permit greater involvement of the outside community.</p>
<p>The Drugs Commission has found that the economisation requirements of recent years have affected both the scale and the content of prison and probation activities. The effects of this include the high occupancy level of Sweden’s prisons, which in the Commission’s opinion stands in the way of an appropriate differentiation of prison inmates.</p>
<p>The Drugs Commission has further established that the socalled normalisation or mainstreaming principle, i.e. the principle whereby the social needs of convicted persons are to be provided for within the framework of society’s general welfare systems, just as for other citizens, cannot be said at present to have achieved sufficient impact. This is above all due to the municipalities having grown far more reluctant to finance care and treatment for drug abusers. In the Commission’s opinion, however, this is no reason for departing from the normalisation principle as such, and further efforts must be made, above all within the social services, to provide drug abusers with the care and treatment, as well as other support and assistance, which they may be in need of.</p>
<p>Under Section 34 of the Act on Correctional Treatment (1974:203), a prisoner can be given permission to leave the</p>
<p>institution if he can then be made a subject of special measures which will presumably facilitate his adjustment in the community, e.g. care and treatment for drug abuse. The cost of placing a prisoner in care outside the institution shall be borne by the prison and probation system. On the day of the prisoner’s release from prison, this financial liability passes to the municipality, which then defrays the cost until the treatment is concluded.</p>
<p>It is, however, difficult at present to obtain pledges from municipalities to cover expenditure of this kind. Despite these difficulties the Drugs Commission recommends that the current principles should continue to apply, but it proposes that the prison and probation authorities – in cases where they favour a Section 34 placement but for some reason a financial commitment is not forthcoming from the municipality – be empowered for a two-year experimental period to order such placement even if it continues beyond the prisoner’s release date.</p>
<p>Similar problems apply to contract treatment (a special form of probation). The Commission proposes that the National Prison and Probation Administration task the probation authorities with pursuing development in such a way that every region develops a number of alternative care models acceptable both to the prison and probation system and to the municipalities concerned, the aim being as far as possible to eliminate administrative and overarching questions in the individual treatment plans which have to be drawn up prior to placement in contract treatment.</p>
<p>Inmates and staff alike of remand centres and prisons are entitled to a drug-free environment. This being so, the obvious benchmarks, as the Drugs Commission sees it, are the inmates without drug problems shall not need to come into contact with drugs, that abusers shall be cut off from the supply of drugs and that inmates shall be prevented from trading in drugs within remand centres and prisons and in the community at large. The achievement of a drug-free environment demands in the first instance vigorous measures of motivation and treatment, but also judiciously balanced measures of control.</p>
<p>As regard the measures of control which can be taken in the prison and probation system, the Drugs Commission finds the provisions to be appropriately constructed in all essential respects. Thus they afford great opportunities for the prison and probation system to check the clients are not abusing drugs while serving their sentence and, in remand centres and presents, that drugs are</p>
<p>not present on or brought onto the premises. At the same time as the rules can be said to afford good opportunities for the exclusion of drugs by means of controls, drugs are in fact being taken above all into prisons, on quite a considerable scale in some quarters.</p>
<p>Although greater seclusion of prisons and remand centres could partly stem the inflow of drugs, this is not an expedient which the Drugs Commission advocates. Instead, as the Commission sees it, other possible ways of preventing such contraband will have to be tested, most immediately through the medium of care and treatment. This, however, does not prevent the Commission from making certain suggestions for the improvement of control opportunities in certain respects.</p>
<p>The Drugs Commission proposes that, if considerations of security or discipline at a particular remand centre or prison so demand, the National Prison and Probation Administration shall be empowered to order body searches of all visitors to the remand centre, the prison or a particular department of the same. Current provisions do not at present sanction a more routine control of this kind. The Commission further proposes that prison staff and other persons carrying out work or assignments within a remand centre or prison be subject to body search when entering, which is not possible at present.</p>
<p>To prevent a visitor transferring an illicit object - drugs, for example – to an inmate, visits can at present be supervised by prison or remand centre staff. The Drugs Commission proposes that, on certain conditions, it be made possible for a supervised visit of this kind to be replaced with a visit taking place under such conditions that inmate and visitor are prevented by delivering objects to one another, e.g. through the interposition of a glass screen.</p>
<p>Finally the Drugs Commission makes proposals concerning the consequences of refusal to furnish a blood or urine sample. At present, the consequences of such refusal, as regards disciplinary sanctions and the qualifying period for parole, are less severe than the consequences of the inmate’s urine sample testing positive. The Drugs Commission proposes that the consequences of refusal be equated with those of a urine specimen testing positive.</p>
<p>In its report the Drugs Commission also addresses the question of using sniffer dogs in prisons and remand centres, as well as certain other questions which, in the Commission’s opinion, should be specially followed up by the National Prison and Probation Administration.</p>
<p>Competence development and research</p>
<p>Questions with a bearing on drug policy measures need to be assessed not only on the basis of the presumable effects on drug supply and abuse but also with reference to their potential consequences for personal privacy, for equality and democracy etc. It is clear that decisions concerning both the direction of policy and measures affecting individual persons have to be taken without complete and unambiguous knowledge concerning the possible effects of the measures to be taken. Although we can never expect our knowledge to be complete, the improvement of knowledge concerning different aspects of narcotic drugs, measures to combat drug abuse and the effect of drug policy measures are clearly important.</p>
<p>Knowledge of the drug situation , i.e. the amount of drugs present in this country, the extent of drug abuse, the persons who abuse drugs and the effects of drug abuse, is needed for the planning and scaling of the measures to be taken. Knowledge of this kind is also important for judging the overall effects of drug policy.</p>
<p>Knowledge of laws and control measures  is important with a view to observing the effects of drug policy measures.</p>
<p>Knowledge of methods  relating both to prevention and to care and treatment has a vital bearing on the framing of policy measures.</p>
<p>Knowledge of the effects of  preventive measures and of measures of care and treatment has an important bearing, for example, on the selection of measures to be taken and on their evaluation.</p>
<p>The Drugs Commission finds both knowledge and methods in the above mentioned fields to be deficient at present. In the Commission’s opinion, measures to combat drug abuse need to be based more extensively on knowledge and documented experience.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposals are designed to facilitate a build-up of knowledge and competence within the bodies actively concerned with drug issues. The Commission sees several possible ways of achieving this. Staff training is one method. The Commission puts forward proposals for a specialist training programme in care of substance abusers and for a foundation training programme in preventive work.</p>
<p>Another method is the more general accumulation of a knowledge base founded on science and proven experience in the social welfare sector. The Commission indicates certain fields</p>
<p>where the need for this kind of competence development is particularly urgent. Its proposals refer mainly to the preventive sphere and to the care and treatment sector, these being the sectors where the Commission judges the shortcomings to be greatest.</p>
<p>Documentation, follow-up and evaluation should be improved, as regards both measures relating to individuals and work of a more overarching kind. The Drugs Commission proposes that the National Institute of Public Health take the initiative in framing models and systems for documenting local preventive work. The National Board of Health and Welfare should consider framing General Recommendations laying down guidelines for the documentation of measures by social services on behalf of substance abusers. The Commission also proposes that the National Board of Health and Welfare take the initiative in co-ordinating the development work now being undertaken in several different quarters with reference to standardised client analysis and evaluation instruments, which have proved to be good instruments for developing treatment activities and interaction between different care providers.</p>
<p>Both preventive measures and measures of care and treatment are generally of a highly complex nature, designed as they are to influence deep-rooted human behaviour, habits and vices which operate in complicated social contexts. The possibilities of influence open to assistive and supportive bodies in the community are relatively small by comparison with all the other factors influencing the individual. The Drugs Commission therefore wishes to point out, first of all, that neither in preventive work nor in care is there any possibility of developing one single method, which could be universally applied, and it wishes to warn against belief in simple solutions of the ”cookbook” variety.</p>
<p>The Drugs Commission favours priority for the development of methods for identifying different target groups and reaching them with preventive measures, and methods for systematically assisting sporadic drug abusers in the medical sector and social services.</p>
<p>As regards the care of drug abusers, methods urgently need to be developed for charting the abusers’ need of support and assistance and methods for combining several inputs. Support to and interaction with next-of-kin should be developed.</p>
<p>Within the portion of drug abuser care for which health and medical services are responsible, it is particularly vital that methods and models of interaction with socially oriented substance abuser</p>
<p>care should be strengthened. This applies, not least, to psychiatric care, but generally speaking, more medically oriented treatment measures should always be viewed in a socio-psychological perspective. The development of psychotherapeutic treatment methods is to some extent being inhibited by uncertainty as to whether the cost of such measures should be borne by social services or medical services, which in itself underlines the importance of interaction within the framework of local strategies.</p>
<p>The Drugs Commission recommends that the National Institute of Public Health be instructed to investigate the feasibility of drafting a foundation programme of further training in preventive work. The Institute shall also consider ways of strengthening elements of prevention and abuse-related questions in the foundation training of teachers and other professional categories working with children and young persons.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes the institution of a specialist training programme in the case of substance abusers, and also that more weight be allotted to abuser care questions in various foundation study programmes. It is proposed that the National Board of Health and Welfare and the national Agency for Higher Education together be commissioned to lay down guidelines for such a training programme.</p>
<p>The Drugs Commission considers it vitally important that knowledge and competence should be strengthened in the field of substance abuser care. Several different proposals capable of accelerating such development are presented in this report, but most of them will only take effect in the long term. As a means of also strengthening the influence of research and documented practice in the short term, it is proposed that a special Council on the Care of Substance Abusers be set up, under the mandatorship of the National Board of Health and Welfare.</p>
<p>The Council shall consist of persons with long experience and/or great knowledge of the treatment of substance abuse. Its task shall be to assess and evaluate measures proposed for individual persons in relation to the available knowledge concerning the potentialities of care. Care providers, officials and private individuals shall be able to initiate topics for discussion, but the Council itself shall have the possibility of deciding what matters are to be discussed, so that priority can be given to those judged to be of the greatest importance as precedent. Otherwise</p>
<p>there is a risk of the Council becoming so overburdened as to cause delays in its decision-making.</p>
<p>The Council shall state whether the measures proposed by the social services can be regarded as reasonable in proportion of the client’s need of care, having regard to what can be decided on the strength of scientifically proven experience. Its statements should not, however, have any legal status and should not be binding on the municipalities. A Council of this kind could contribute towards the development of precedent and proven experience on the basis of concrete cases, and could serve the county administrative courts in an advisory capacity in connection with appeals.</p>
<p>The Drugs Commission proposes that the National Board of Health and Welfare, acting in collaboration with the Medical Products Agency, be instructed to analyse and observe the development of young persons’ consumption of medicinal products and to propose measures for reversing the rising trend in consumption of, above all, somnifacients and analgesics.</p>
<p>A review of academic research initiatives reveals that several interest research approaches are being employed and that highly valuable research is in progress. The overall picture, however, is incoherent. Clinical therapy research particularly is a greatly neglected field. Research of this kind encounters great problems of method and has been beset with funding difficulties. In the preventive field there is a lack of research concerning many aspects of these initiatives.</p>
<p>The Commission refers to the importance of research and practice being tied more closely together, so as to eventually facilitate drug prevention measures founded on knowledge and proven experience. As a means of illuminating the state of knowledge in the field of substance abuser care, the Commission proposes that the National Board of Health and Welfare initiate conferences on the state of research, research needs and the allocation of tasks between municipal and county council R&D units on the one hand and universities and colleges on the other.</p>
<p>International co-operation</p>
<p>Parallel to the growth of drug problems all over the world, the need for global drug policy co-operation has also grown. Sweden</p>
<p>has channelled the greater part of its international involvement in the drugs issue through multilateral organisations, and is thus involved in all the bodies addressing drug problems.</p>
<p>The Drugs Commission take the view that Sweden’s international involvement should be strengthened, not least within the EU, and it therefore proposes that Sweden intensify its efforts, together with other countries, to develop strategies for alleviating drug problems.</p>
<p>As the Drugs Commission sees it, the Government should give priority to measures for strengthening international control of illegal drugs, to focus attention on the drugs question in Swedish international development co-operation, to streamline international drug control bodies and to work for a maintenance of respect for the UN conventions on drugs. Within the EU, the Drugs Commission proposes that Sweden above give priority to questions concerning illegal European production, preventive measures and questions relating to drug problems in the EU candidate countries.</p>
<p>Correct and objective presentation of Sweden’s drug policy is, in the Commission’s opinion, the Government’s responsibility. Furthermore, the Government must strengthen the co-ordination of Sweden’s actions through regular consultations with national authorities and others representing Swedish interests on the international scene.</p>
<p>The Drugs Commission attaches importance to Swedish participation, especially through experts, officials and NGOs, in the work of the international organisations and institutes existing in the drug sector, and it therefore proposes that the Government Offices assume responsibility for increasing the participation of Swedish experts in international projects. The same should apply concerning access for Swedish officials to appointments with such organisations and the international exchange of professionals. Finally the Drugs Commission recommends that the National Institute of Public Health be given the task of acting as Sweden’s point of contact vis-à-vis EU research-funding bodies and Swedish researchers, as a means of augmenting opportunities for Swedish experts to participate in international research work.</p>
