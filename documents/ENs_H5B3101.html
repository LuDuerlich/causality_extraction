<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s remit has been to conduct a review of the regulations governing parental leave and parental insurance. The aim has been to identify problems and propose measures that lead to the parental insurance system making a greater contribution than is currently the case to gender equality in the labour market, gender-equal parenthood and also continuing to make a contribution to providing children with good conditions in which to grow up. The inquiry published the interim report Begränsningar i föräldrapenningen för föräldrar som kommer till Sverige med barn  [Restrictions on parental benefit for parents who come to Sweden with children] (SOU 2016:73) in October 2016.</p>
<p>This report contains an account of the inquiry’s principal remit.</p>
<p>The inquiry has been tasked with analysing and proposing measures that result in a gender-equal distribution of parental leave and parental insurance benefits. Within the scope of this, the inquiry has had to specifically analyse the feasibility and consequences of reserving further months for which one parent cannot surrender their right to parental benefit to the other parent, including a complete reservation of parental benefit between the parents. The inquiry has also had to analyse whether the age limits for the right to parental leave are well balanced and whether there is a need for changes. The inquiry has also had the task of identifying and analysing how the parental insurance system needs to be modernised in order to stand up to new challenges in the labour market and in family life. As part of this, the inquiry has had to focus its survey and analysis of contemporary working life on the conditions of entrepreneurs and students and their opportunities to use parental insurance. The inquiry has also had to investigate whether the rules for pregnancy benefit are sufficiently well adapted to contemporary working life and whether they provide appropriate cover for those women who have a reduced work capacity at the end of their pregnancy. In addition, the inquiry has had to identify problems and investigate the feasibility of making it easier for different family constellations to use parental insurance. The inquiry’s remit has included conducting certain surveys and submitting, where necessary, proposals concerning changes and measures, including necessary proposed statutes. The inquiry has consistently had to analyse the need for simplifications and to work to streamline the regulations on the basis of the various aims of the parental insurance system.</p>
<p>In terms of the prerequisites for this work, the inquiry has had to be guided by the principle of what is best for the child and of the child’s right to care and contact with their parents and has also had to keep the principle of income replacement as one of the foundations of the parental insurance system.</p>
<h2>Challenges and opportunities – what does contemporary working life look like?</h2>
<p>The main purpose of parental insurance is to make it possible for parents to combine work with family life. The insurance system is designed as to encourage participation in the labour market. Consequently, women’s and men’s working lives and how the labour market functions are of central significance to the structure and function of the parental insurance system. The inquiry has surveyed the interaction between working life and parental insurance and what opportunities and challenges contemporary working life presents for parents’ potential to combine work and family.</p>
<p>The inquiry notes that the labour market is still highly gender segregated. Compared to men, women more often have temporary jobs, take, on average, more time off work in conjunction with becoming parents and are more likely to work part-time. Women also have a higher average rate of sick leave than men and one of the reasons for this is that women generally have greater responsibility for the family and domestic work. Despite women having, on average, a higher level of education than men, their average earnings are lower. There are also fewer women than men in senior management positions.</p>
<p>An important and sizeable section of the labour market is made up of entrepreneurs, a group in which the conditions and circumstances of work are very varied. The inquiry has carried out a survey of entrepreneurs’ conditions and opportunities to use parental insurance. It can be concluded that they make somewhat less use of parental insurance than employees. Within the context of this survey, the inquiry describes various factors that could explain this relationship. The inquiry also describes various proposals that have been submitted from the entrepreneur community that are intended to address those aspects of the parental insurance system that can be difficult for entrepreneurs to use in the same way as employees.</p>
<p>The inquiry has also surveyed students’ conditions and opportunities to use parental insurance. In the context of this survey, the inquiry describes how the parental insurance system is designed for students who become parents or for parents who start studying. The inquiry notes that students are a heterogeneous group and that the situation of parents who are students can vary greatly. The inquiry describes various proposals that have been submitted in order to resolve some of the difficulties encountered by students who want to use parental insurance.</p>
<p>The inquiry has also conducted a general review of the regulations for pregnancy benefit in relation to contemporary working life. One conclusion drawn by the inquiry is that there are certain problems with pregnancy benefit, which was designed at a time when physically taxing work was more common than it is today. According to previous reviews, for example, there is scope to grant more women pregnancy benefit pursuant to the current regulations than the interpretation of this entails. It is also the case that many of the women whose applications for pregnancy benefit are refused still receive compensation from the social insurance system. The inquiry sets out a number of alternative designs that could be used for pregnancy benefit.</p>
<p>The inquiry also describes how norms in society, family life and working life influence conditions and the prospects of combining working life and family life on equal terms.</p>
<h2>Family circumstances in Sweden</h2>
<p>The living circumstances of families with children and the view of parenthood have changed since parental insurance was introduced. Around 25 per cent of all children have parents who do not live together. Two in ten families consist of a single parent, most often a single mother. Just under one in ten families is a reconstituted family, i.e. a family in which one or both parents has children from a previous relationship. There are no official statistics on how common it is for children to have more than two adults exercising parenthood, for example when a single woman or a lesbian couple choose to share parenthood with a man or a male couple. It can be concluded that children have a variety of family situations and that these also vary over time.</p>
<p>The inquiry has conducted a review of the current regulations in order to see in which cases there are restrictions placed on the potential of different family constellations to use parental insurance benefits. It can be concluded that to some extent the legislator has taken into account the difficulties that may be present for family constellations other than the traditional nuclear family, but that the current regulatory framework nevertheless results in restrictions on the potential of some family constellations to use parental insurance benefits. These restrictions mainly apply to parental benefit.</p>
<h2>The inquiry’s deliberations and proposals in brief</h2>
<p>The report provides a number of proposals regarding parental allowance, temporary parental allowance and pregnancy allowance. The proposals presented are designed so that they are generally to be viewed as a whole and are largely interdependent when it comes to achieving the desired effects. The inquiry also makes certain assessments related to the remit.</p>
<h2>A new model for parental benefit</h2>
<p>A new model for parental benefit should be introduced</p>
<p>The inquiry is of the opinion that the current age limits that apply to parental benefit are not fit for purpose. Parental benefit should be further concentrated to the time of the child’s birth and the early years of the child’s life. This is consistent with the primary purpose of parental benefit; to make it possible for parents to combine family life and working life, partly by compensating them for loss of earnings from work as a result of taking leave in conjunction with the birth or adoption of a child. This is also consistent with the fact that the vast majority of parental benefit days should be provided in order to allow parents to take longer continuous periods of leave during the early part of a child’s life or immediately after a child joins a new family. Parental benefit days should subsequently be provided in order to enable shorter periods of leave to be taken. This is also judged to contribute to a more even distribution of parental benefit between the parents and means that men are encouraged to use a larger proportion of the parental benefit when the child is young. This has benefits in terms of how women and men distribute both unpaid and paid work within the household in both the short and the long term.</p>
<p>On the basis of that which is stated above, as well as to refine parental benefit in relation to its primary purpose of providing parents with the opportunity to care for a child in its early years, the inquiry proposes a new model for this benefit.</p>
<p>The new model</p>
<p>Under the new model, it will be possible to provide parental benefit to the parents for a combined total of up to 460 days, with an additional maximum of 170 days for each additional child in the event of multiple births or multiple adoptions. It will be possible to provide parental benefit up until the child’s tenth birthday and it will be distributed in a certain way during this period.</p>
<p>Up to and including the child’s third year, calculated from their birth or an equivalent point in time, it will be possible, as a general rule, to provide parental benefit for up to 390 of the maximum of 460 days, up to a further 142 of the additional maximum of 170 days for each additional child in the event of multiple births or multiple adoptions. The inquiry proposes that the time limit for taking the days reserved for the period in question be strict, i.e. it will not be possible to save days to use in the subsequent period. The inquiry’s overall assessments concerning the choice of limit for the majority of the parental benefit days and the number of parental benefit days that are allocated to this period are based on a number of factors. The inquiry thinks that there should be a strong emphasis on the child’s perspective. What is meant here by ‘the child’s perspective’ is that children are to be given the prerequisites for good conditions in which to grow up and a right to be taken care of by both parents and that children have different needs in terms of parents, attachment and care. Consequently, parents need to continue being allowed some flexibility in terms of how they use parental benefit. Reducing the limit as per the inquiry’s proposal still provides, both in itself, but primarily in combination with other proposals concerning the model for parental benefit, a strong incentive to concentrate the longer period of parental leave and to distribute the leave and parental benefit more evenly between the parents in the child’s early years.</p>
<p>The number of days as per the limit proposed by the inquiry in its interim report (SOU 2016:73) for parents who come to Sweden with children after the child’s first year or life is to be adjusted on the basis of the fact that these days can be used up until the child’s third birthday, instead of up until the child’s twelfth birthday. The inquiry has applied the same method to calculate the number of days as was used in the interim report, but with some adjustments due to uncertainty regarding some of the factors.</p>
<p>There should also continue to be an opportunity to receive parental insurance benefits for children who are older than three years. This is to provide genuine opportunities for parents to spend time at home with their children in this period of their children’s lives and to, in line with the principal aim of the parental insurance system, make it easier to combine family life and working life. The inquiry proposes as a principal rule that parental benefit be provided for a maximum of ten days per year in the period subsequent to the child’s third year and up to the child’s tenth birthday, with an additional maximum of four days per child per year available for every additional child in the event of multiple births and multiple adoptions. It will not be possible to save parental benefit from one year to the next. The inquiry has also made overall assessments based on a number of factors when deciding on the choice of the uppermost age limit for parental benefit and the distribution of parental benefit days for this period. The inquiry believes it is more important to create a system that provides more generous benefits during the period of a child’s life when the need for parental care is at its greatest, rather than extending the period for which parental benefit is available into a period of the child’s life when the need for parental care is generally not as high. To arrive at this position, the inquiry has examined the various requirements for leave that were identified and has used the prerequisites that are the foundation of the inquiry’s work as a basis, taking into account factors such as the estimated costs the proposed reforms will have when they are fully implemented. The proposed model, with its distribution of parental benefit days between different periods, means that benefits become more equal as all parents are guaranteed parental benefit throughout the entire benefit period without needing to save parental benefit days.</p>
<p>If parents have shared custody of the child, each parent will, as a principal rule, receive parental benefit for half of the maximum time for which parental benefit can be provided up to and including the child’s third year and half of the maximum time per year that parental benefit can be provided subsequent to the child’s third year up to the child’s tenth birthday.</p>
<h2>No amendments to the Parental Leave Act provisions concerning the opportunity to take leave without parental benefit</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s assessment is that a parent should continue to have the right to take full-time leave from work in order to care for a child until the child is 18 months old. Reducing the opportunity to take unpaid leave from 18 months to the age of, e.g. 12 months would not automatically result in a shorted period of leave. It is not the length of the parental leave that is problematic; it is how the leave is distributed between the parents.</p>
<p>The opportunity to reduce working hours in the child’s early years can allow parents more time with their children and family, reduce the time pressure on them and result in greater balance between working life and family life. The inquiry thus proposes an entirely new model for the provision of parental benefit. In light of the proposal and the potential need parents may have to reduce their working hours, the inquiry’s assessment is that a parent should continue to have the right to reduce their working hours by up to one quarter in order to care for children under the age of eight years or older children who have not yet completed their first year of school.</p>
<p>If a child who is older than 18 months is being looked after in a foster home, the foster parents only have the right to reduce their working hours by 25 per cent. In cases where the child has substantial care needs, this may be insufficient. Consequently, the inquiry’s assessment is that the question of whether foster parents’ right to full-time leave without parental benefit should be expanded to also cover children who are over the age of 18 months should be considered in another context.</p>
<h2>Removal of the minimum level of parental benefit</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the 90 days of parental benefit at the minimum level be scrapped. Parental benefit at the minimum level will thus be abolished. The compensation provided for the minimum level days is so low that in many cases it does not function as compensation for loss of earnings from work. The parental insurance system therefore does not provide all parents with the genuine financial opportunity to care for their children for the 90 days that the minimum level encompasses. The minimum level days are also usually those that are left to expire when the child reaches their eighth birthday. It is instead proposed that the total number of parental benefit days be 460 days with compensation at the sickness benefit or basic level.</p>
<p>The inquiry’s proposals does not differentiate between different multiple births or multiple adoptions, instead parental benefit is always provided at the sickness benefit or basic level. As a result of the minimum level being scrapped, the inquiry proposes that the specific provisions concerning the compensation level for the additional days that are allocated to parents in the event of multiple births be removed.</p>
<h2>Further reservation of time with parental benefit</h2>
<p>Distribution of parental benefit</p>
<p>A more equal distribution of both parental benefit and parental leave has major benefits for the situation of women in the labour market. If women and men take more equal amounts of parental leave, women’s absence from the labour market decreases in both the short and the long term because longer parental leave is associated with substantial future responsibility for domestic and care work and with part-time work. More time in the labour market provides better conditions for salary increases, career progression, lifetime earnings and pension contributions. Women’s financial independence is reinforced when their degree of self-sufficiency increases. At the same time, longer leave for men will have more detrimental labour market outcomes for them as a group. For men, longer parental leave may result in a somewhat lower salary trend that would have been the case if they continued with their relatively short absence from paid work. However, the likelihood of statistical discrimination, or that longer parental leave for men signals less orientation towards work, decreases when the length of parental leave is evened out between men and women and also among men as a group.</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that more days be reserved</p>
<p>The inquiry is of the opinion that parents need to be given greater incentives to share both parental benefit and parental leave more equally. However, the inquiry makes the assessment that, at present, there should not be a division of the parental benefit days in such a way that half of all the days are reserved for each of the legal guardians. It is the opinion of the inquiry that, because all families and children are different and have differing needs that may also change over time, it is important that the insurance system retain some degree of flexibility. Flexibility is highly valued by parents and makes it possible to adapt how care is organised for the child. There can also be major differences between sectors of the labour market in terms of what factors are important to allowing working life to be combined with family life, for example issues pertaining to the potential to work flexibly, the hours at which work take place, whether the parent is self-employed, etc. Accordingly, some flexibility needs to be retained in order to provide parents with the scope for such variation. A proposal for complete reservation would also result in families consisting of more than two legal guardians being excluded from using parental benefit unless some form of needs assessment is introduced, which is not in line with the rest of the inquiry’s remit. A completely equal distribution would also require major behavioural changes among both men and women, which would be difficult to achieve in the short term. Without the opportunity to gain a comprehensive overview of the long-term consequences, it is hard to justify major changes.</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the number of days for which one parent cannot hand over the right to parental benefit to any other person, i.e. ‘the reserved period’, be increased. For the period up to and including the child’s third year, calculated from the child’s birth or an equivalent point in time, 130 days for each child or for the children together in the event of multiple births or multiple adoptions will be reserved for each parent. For the period subsequent to the child’s third year, calculated from the child’s birth or an equivalent point in time, up until the child’s tenth birthday, three days per year per child or for the children together in the event of multiple births or multiple adoptions will be reserved for each parent.</p>
<h2>Reservation of days with parental benefit at the basic level</h2>
<p>The inquiry makes the assessment that days with parental benefit at the basic level are not currently encompassed by the regulation concerning the reserved period for each parent and that there is no justifiable reason for this. There are also benefits to be gained by encouraging an equal distribution of parental benefit use between women and men when it comes to the issue of basic level days. This is why the inquiry proposes that these days also be included in the time for which one parent may not hand over their right to parental benefit to anyone else. This proposal means that all parents who take parental benefit are covered by the regulation concerning the reserved period.</p>
<h2>Additional exemption from the distribution of parental benefit</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes one additional exemption from the principal rule of dividing the parental benefit days in half between parents who have joint custody. If one parent is permanently prevented from receiving parental benefit because they are serving a custodial sentence, the other parent will have the right to all the days with parental benefit. For a parent to be considered permanently prevented, their sentence is required to encompass the entire period during which they are entitled to parental benefit, based on the periods across which parental benefit is distributed in accordance with the proposed new model. Those custodial sentences that will be encompassed by this proposal are thus long, fixed-term sentences and life sentences.</p>
<h2>Improved opportunities for different family constellations to use parental insurance benefits</h2>
<p>A parent’s cohabiting partner is to be equated to a parent</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that a parent’s cohabiting partner be equated to a parent when applying the provisions concerning parental benefit without there being a requirement for the parent and the cohabiting partner to have been married to one another or to have or have had children together. The cohabiting partner will also be given the right to parental leave without a requirement for previous marriage or joint children. There are no specific requirements for a parent’s spouse to be equated to a parent, either for the right to parental benefit or the right to parental leave. It is the opinion of the inquiry that this difference appears to be unjustified.</p>
<p>Greater opportunity to transfer parental benefit entitlement</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that a legal guardian be permitted to transfer their parental benefit entitlement to a person who is not the child’s parent or equivalent to a parent. Greater opportunity for a legal guardian to transfer some of their own days with parental benefit to another person is deemed to provide single parents with an improved potential to obtain help and relief from the burden of caring for the child from someone close to them. In families where more than two people exercise a parental role, this provides an opportunity for more people to combine parenthood with working life and for the child to benefit from the care and supervision of more parents. Greater opportunity to transfer days to someone other than a parent or equivalent to a parent should also be of value to other family constellations and could simplify people’s everyday lives. The opportunity to transfer entitlement is deemed to have a positive outcome for those children who are encompassed by it and the inquiry believes that it is natural that only someone who has the parents’ trust will be able to take advantage of parental benefit in this way.</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that it be possible to make the transfer to someone who is insured for parental benefit. It will only be possible to transfer those days that are not reserved for each of the parents.</p>
<p>Up until the child’s third birthday, it will be possible to transfer up to 60 days for each child. Subsequent to this and up until the child’s tenth birthday, it will instead be possible to transfer a maximum of four days per child per year. A parent who has sole custody of a child will be entitled to transfer all the days. If the parents have joint custody of a child, each of the parents will instead be entitled to transfer half of the days. If the transferred days are not used, it will be possible to reclaim the entitlement to parental benefit for these. The provisions concerning parental benefit will also apply to the person who has received days following a transfer. However, it will not be possible for such a person in their turn to surrender or transfer days to someone else. An employee will be entitled to leave from work in the period during which they are receiving parental benefit as a result of a transfer.</p>
<p>The inquiry’s assessment is that the new opportunity for another insured person to take leave with compensation in the form of parental benefit should provide entitlement to holiday pay. The effects that the new opportunity to transfer entitlement may have on the pension should be followed up.</p>
<h2>Transfer of the entitlement to parental benefit in conjunction with the birth or adoption of a child</h2>
<p>Based on factors such as the needs that temporary parental benefit in conjunction with birth or adoption of a child is intended to meet and in light of the developments that have taken place in the regulations governing parental benefit and in society since these benefits were introduced, the inquiry makes the assessment that compensation for these purposes should instead be provided within the scope of parental benefit. A transfer of this type also results in an opportunity for reform in terms of prioritising other central changes in the parental insurance system.</p>
<p>Consequently, the inquiry proposes that a parent be entitled to parental benefit in conjunction with the birth or adoption of a child. No limit on the number of days is proposed, but it will only be possible to provide parental benefit for the period from delivery up to and including the fourteenth day after the child goes home following delivery. The calculation of the time period for withdrawing parental benefit in the event of adoption, as is the case under the current law, is based on the time at which the parents have taken the child into their care. The period during which it will be possible to provide parental benefit means that largely the same compensation level can be achieved as through the current compensation provided by temporary parental benefit. No additional days with parental benefit are proposed as a result of the transfer. Instead the entitlement to compensation will be encompassed by the entitlement to parental benefit as a whole, with the opportunities and limitations this involves. Days with parental benefit for these purposes will be deducted from the parent’s reserved period. It will also be possible to provide parental benefit to a parent who does not have custody of the child, for example to allow a non-birth parent to be present during delivery. Because the aim of this compensation is to make it possible for more than one parent to be present at the child’s arrival and early days in the family, it will be possible to provide this compensation to a parent for the same period during which parental benefit is provided to another parent for the same child.</p>
<p>The transfer of compensation entitlement has some consequences due to differences between the systems for parental benefit and temporary parental benefit. Nonetheless, it is the inquiry’s assessment that this does not mean that the compensation entitlement should remain within the temporary parental benefit system. If the purposes of the compensation are considered to belong more to the parental benefit system, it is logical that the entire systems of these benefits apply to the entitlement to compensation.</p>
<p>The provisions in the Parental Leave Act (1995:584) concerning the number of periods of leave and the time for the employee to notify their employer of leave differ between parental benefit and temporary parental benefit. However, the inquiry believes that no amendments to the Parental Leave Act’s provisions are required as a result of compensation for the purposes in question being moved over to parental benefit.</p>
<h2>Removal of the speed premium</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s assessment is that the protection for sickness benefit qualifying income when caring for children and the possibility to keep the same level of parental benefit for the period prior to the child’s second birthday should not be altered. The need for parental benefit and parental leave, on full or part-time basis, is great during the first two years of the child’s life, which is why the inquiry is of the opinion that it is reasonable to provide extensive protection for parental benefit and sickness benefit qualifying income in this period. However, the inquiry proposes that possibility to extended protection for parental benefit in the event of new pregnancy and adoption (the ‘speed premium’) be removed. The assessment is that removing this could lead to women working full-time more frequently between pregnancies, resulting in a more gender equal distribution between paid and unpaid work and an increase in women’s financial independence.</p>
<h2>Change to the 240-day condition</h2>
<p>Because the inquiry is proposing that the minimum level of parental benefit be scrapped, the qualification condition for entitlement to compensation at the sickness benefit level should also be changed. Compensation at the minimum level is currently equivalent to SEK 180 per day. The inquiry therefore proposes that the condition be changed so that the parent will have been entitled to sickness benefit that exceeds SEK 180 per day throughout the entire qualification period, instead of sickness benefit that exceeds the minimum level for parental benefit. This change will mean that the condition is the same as prior to the change.</p>
<h2>Entrepreneurs’ conditions and opportunities to use parental insurance</h2>
<p>It can be concluded that parents who are entrepreneurs, i.e. people who run companies of any form, generally take out less of compensation from the parental insurance system than employees, despite the fact that they may have the same basic entitlement to such compensation and in spite of the fact that they want to make use of parental insurance. If this results in the children of entrepreneurs having less access to their parents than they need, this is of course not a satisfactory situation from the child’s perspective.</p>
<p>A large part of the problem with using parental insurance described by entrepreneurs relates to the regulations concerning sickness benefit qualifying income. The search for solutions within the regulations requires a broader and more in-depth review of the provisions concerning sickness benefit qualifying income than the inquiry’s remit allows. In spite of this, the inquiry makes the assessment that there is need for a protective provision for sickness benefit qualifying income during the establishment phase of a company, not just for those who are self-employed, who already have such protection under the current regulations, but also for people who run limited companies. Because the Government has announced in the budget bill for 2018 that it intends to publish a government bill concerning financial protection during the establishment phase that covers all entrepreneurs, regardless of what legal form their enterprise takes, the inquiry is not issuing any proposals concerning such changes.</p>
<p>Within the scope of the general proposals the inquiry is issuing concerning changes within the parental benefit system, serious consideration has been given to the fact that parent’s circumstances vary in terms of taking parental leave and parental benefit. In particular, the proposal to provide greater opportunity to transfer parental benefit entitlement to another person should make it easier for entrepreneurs to combine family and working life. In general, it is difficult to see how changes to the conditions within the parental insurance system would solve the problems described, in any case without completely abandoning certain basic principles of the social insurance systems. The inquiry should therefore not issue any proposals concerning such changes that only have an entrepreneur’s perspective.</p>
<h2>Students’ conditions and opportunities to use parental insurance</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s assessment is that the general proposals being issued by the inquiry concerning changes to the parental insurance system will also benefit students. No changes that only have a student’s perspective should be made to the conditions for parental insurance benefits. Nor should the calculation of sickness benefit qualifying income for parental benefit and temporary parental benefit be altered only for students. Nevertheless, the inquiry agrees with the proposals that have been published in the memorandum Stärkt skydd av sjukpenninggrundande inkomst för studerande  [Greater protection for sickness benefit qualifying income for students] concerning expanding the general protection for sickness benefit qualifying income for students to also encompass the period in which a person is studying without student aid.</p>
<p>The inquiry’s assessment is also that there should be an investigation in another context into whether it should be possible to provide student aid in the form of a supplementary benefit for students when both parents are studying or the entitlement to such a benefit should be structured in an alternative manner in order to encourage gender equal parenting for parents who study. There should also be an investigation as to whether it should be possible to retain student aid during pregnancy for students who have risks in their study environment, for example during work placement periods, and where it is not feasible to adapt the work environment or duties or to relocate the student.</p>
<h2>Greater protection for women receiving pregnancy benefit</h2>
<p>Extension of the period with pregnancy benefit</p>
<p>The longest pregnancy benefit is currently provided up to and including the eleventh day prior to the estimated delivery date. However, the circumstances that give a woman an entitlement to pregnancy benefit do not expire simply because there are ten days remaining until the expected delivery date Consequently, the inquiry proposes that entitlement to pregnancy benefit is altered so that it can be provided up to and including the day prior to the expected delivery date, i.e. ten days longer than is currently the case.</p>
<p>The inquiry’s assessment is that it is desirable to further expand entitlement to pregnancy benefit to better align it with the needs of pregnant women. One appropriate expansion could be to make pregnancy benefit general so that it covers all pregnant women for the final ten days prior to the estimated delivery date. However, the inquiry has neither the time nor the financial resources to undertake the deliberations required in order to issue its own proposal. Extensive analysis must be carried out of what needs pregnant women actually have in terms of compensation for loss of earnings due to their work capacity being reduced as a result of pregnancy and these needs should be the decisive factors in the future design of pregnancy benefit. An inquiry of this type should primarily be conducted by the authorities that have specific knowledge of this area.</p>
<p>Raising the income ceiling used when calculating sickness benefit qualifying income</p>
<p>There is a proposal in the budget bill for 2018 to increase the income ceiling used when calculating sickness benefit qualifying income from 7.5 to 8.0 price base amounts as of 1 July 2018. There is an explicit exemption to this increase for benefits including pregnancy benefit. The inquiry is of the opinion that there is also justification for increasing the ceiling for pregnancy benefit. The inquiry proposes that the income ceiling used when calculating sickness benefit qualifying income for pregnancy benefit be the same as that used within the sickness insurance system and thus be increased from 7.5 to 8.0 price base amounts.</p>
<h2>Temporary parental benefit</h2>
<p>Raising the income ceiling used when calculating sickness benefit qualifying income</p>
<p>There is a proposal in the budget bill for 2018 to increase the income ceiling used when calculating sickness benefit qualifying income for the majority of sickness insurance benefits from 7.5 to 8.0 price base amounts as of 1 July 2018. There is an explicit exemption to this increase for benefits including temporary parental benefit. The inquiry is of the opinion that there is also justification for increasing the ceiling for temporary parental benefit. The inquiry proposes that the income ceiling used when calculating sickness benefit qualifying income for temporary parental benefit be the same as that used within the sickness insurance system and thus be increased from 7.5 to 8.0 price base amounts.</p>
<p>A need to review the regulations concerning temporary parental benefit</p>
<p>The regulations pertaining to temporary parental benefit are complicated and there are established problems with respect to where to the boundaries lie between this benefit and other support systems.</p>
<p>The inquiry’s assessment is that there needs to be a comprehensive review of the regulations in order to simplify and make these easier to interpret. However, there is not the scope to conduct such a review as part of the inquiry’s work.</p>
<h2>Other amendments</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes some minor amendments to various statutes including the Social Insurance Code and the Parental Leave Act. For example, we propose a codification of the regulation that has been established in case law that a parent may reclaim parental benefit entitlement that has been transferred to another parent for days that have not been used and amendments to the provisions concerning deducting foreign benefits that correspond to parental benefit as a result of a child’s birth.</p>
<h2>Greater knowledge about parental insurance, parental leave and parental benefit supplement and follow-up of the proposals</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the Government task Försäkringskassan (the Swedish Social Insurance Agency) with developing opportunities for parents to make a clear plan for their parental leave based on the new model for the parental insurance system. In addition, Försäkringskassan and the Swedish Pensions Agency will be tasked with continuing the work of disseminating information about the long and short-term consequences of distributing parental benefit and parental leave in a gender equal manner. In particular, entrepreneurs’ need for guidance with respect to matters such as calculation of sickness benefit qualifying income needs to be met.</p>
<p>Campaigns and other initiatives to encourage gender equal use of parental insurance benefits should be evaluated.</p>
<p>The inquiry’s assessment is that the social partners should be encouraged to continue providing good advice and information about existing parental benefit supplement and parental salary.</p>
<p>The inquiry’s assessment is that a follow-up should be conducted of the consequences of the proposals being issued.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes that all statutory amendments enter into force on 1 January 2019, with some transitional provisions. For example, the current model for parental benefit will apply with respect to children born prior to 1 January 2019 or, in the event of adoption, when adoptive parents have gained custody of the child prior to this date.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s assessment is that the proposals will contribute all in all to a more equal distribution of parental benefit, temporary paren- tal benefit and parental leave. It is also deemed that these proposals will contribute to achieving the gender equality policy target of financial gender equality and an equal distribution of unpaid domes- tic and care work.</p>
<p>The inquiry’s basic premise throughout is that children benefit from an early and close connection with their parents. The proposals that the inquiry is issuing are intended to result in a more equal distribution of parental leave and parental benefit between the child’s parents and are also expected to result in a more equal distribution of childcare, which encourages good contact between the child and more than one of their parents.</p>
<p>The inquiry makes the assessment that its proposals together lead to savings for the central government in the initial years after they enter into force, but that they involve somewhat increased expen- diture once they are completely phased in. However, the period of this forecast is long and there is thus a high degree of uncertainty.</p>
