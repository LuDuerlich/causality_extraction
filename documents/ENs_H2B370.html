<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In October 2013, the European Parliament and Council adopted a directive on amendments to the Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and Council on the harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market, the so called Transparency Directive. The Transparency Directive regulates which information should be published about companies whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market (issuers) within the EEA. The aim of the Directive is to secure good access to information in the securities market, which is a prerequisite for both market efficiency and investor protection.</p>
<p>The Transparency Directive regulates time limits for and the content of the financial information that must be published regularly by issuers (annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements, as well as interim management statements). The Directive also contains provisions concerning the publication of changes to major securities holdings (flagging rules) and certain other provisions concerning which information is to be filed by issuers. Furthermore, the Directive regulates the forms of publication – dissemination and language – and how information is to be stored. Compliance with the Directive is to be monitored by a competent authority in line with the principle of home country supervision. More detailed rules concerning some of the Directive’s provisions are stated in</p>
<p>Commission Directive 2007/14/EC on rules for the implementation of the Transparency Directive.</p>
<p>The amendments now being made to the Transparency Directive are aimed at simplifying the regulatory framework for small and medium-sized enterprises in particular and making it easier for these enterprises to finance their activities in the securities market. Other important reasons for the amendments now being made are to prevent ‘hidden takeovers’ through financial instruments that have previously not been subject to the flagging requirement, and to make the regulations more effective through the use of extended and tougher sanctions.</p>
<h2>Starting points for the Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>The Transparency Directive has been implemented in Swedish law through provisions in the Swedish Financial Instruments Trading Act (1991:980) and the Securities Market Act (2007:528). The Inquiry proposes that the legislative amendments needed to implement the amendments to the Transparency Directive in Swedish law be made to the above-mentioned acts.</p>
<p>The main starting point when the Transparency Directive was originally implemented in Swedish law was to place the regulations on a par with the Directive. Regulations that were stricter than those contained in the Directive were chosen only in the areas where there was reason to assume that the regulated area would not be subject to supplementary self-regulation and where there was a risk of lower standards in the provision of information. The Inquiry has not found reason to assume an approach that is different to that previously adopted. The Inquiry’s legislative proposals have thus mainly been kept on a par with the Directive. However, where the Inquiry considered it justified to maintain the current level of information provision and where legislation was considered to be the most effective option for achieving this, stricter regulations have been proposed.</p>
<h2>New provisions on home Member State</h2>
<p>The regulations contained in the Transparency Directive are based on the principle of home country supervision. This means that for every issuer the regulations in one EEA country apply, irrespective of whether the issuer’s securities are admitted to trading on regulated markets in more than one EEA country. The principle of home country supervision also means that the competent authority in the home Member State is responsible for checking that the issuer follows the provisions contained in the Directive. For issuers of debt securities with a denomination per unit of less than EUR 1 000 or of shares and that have their registered office in the EEA, the country in which the issuer has its registered office is the home Member State. Other issuers are to choose a home Member State.</p>
<p>The new provisions in the Transparency Directive clarify the regulatory framework concerning choice of home Member State for issuers of debt securities with a denomination per unit of less than EUR 1 000 or of shares and that have their registered office outside the EEA. A rule is also being introduced that aims to establish which country should be the home Member State in cases where an issuer that is required by the Directive to choose a home Member State neglects to make a choice. Provisions concerning the publication of choice of home Member State are also being introduced. In addition, the provisions concerning home Member State contained in Directive 2003/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market, (the Prospectus Directive), have been adapted to the new regulations contained in the Transparency Directive.</p>
<p>As a result of the amended provisions in the Transparency Directive, the Inquiry proposes that an issuer of debt securities with a denomination per unit of less than EUR 1 000 or of shares should be able to choose Sweden as home Member State if the securities have been admitted to trading on a regulated market in Sweden. Moreover, an issuer that has chosen Sweden as home</p>
<p>Member State should be able to alter this choice if the issuer’s securities are no longer admitted to trading on a regulated market in Sweden. The Inquiry also proposes that Sweden be home Member State for issuers that are required by the Transparency Directive to choose a home Member State and whose transferable securities have been admitted to trading on a regulated market in Sweden, if the issuer has not chosen another country as its home Member State within three months of 26 November 2015 or the day on which the issuer’s securities were first admitted to trading. Under the Inquiry’s proposals on amendments to the Securities</p>
<p>Market Act, the choice of home Member State should be published and reported to the relevant competent authorities.</p>
<h2>Changes to information requirements</h2>
<p>Information on changes to major securities holdings (flagging rules)</p>
<p>The provisions implementing the regulations in the Transparency Directive concerning information to be filed when major changes occur to securities holdings (flagging rules) are contained in the Swedish Financial Instruments Trading Act. The flagging rules that already apply under Swedish law are stricter in some areas than the rules laid down in the Transparency Directive. The Inquiry proposes that these stricter national rules be abolished in two areas: firstly, the current requirement for the aggregation of a person’s own holdings of shares with those of their spouse or cohabiting partner, any minor children and other close relatives; and secondly, the time limit for submitting a flagging notification. The Inquiry proposes that a flagging notification should be received by the issuer and the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority no later than four working days following the day on which the obligation to submit such a notification arose. The Inquiry’s reason for proposing an extension to the time limit is that the regulatory framework in this area should be harmonised, for competition reasons, with the rules in much of the rest of Europe. Moreover, as a result of the amendments to the Directive, the flagging requirement will be broadened to cover additional and more complicated instruments, which is another reason for extending the time limit for aggregating and calculating the proportion of all shares in the company or the number of voting rights for all shares in the company. The significantly increased penalty measures being introduced as a result of the amendments to the Directive (see below) are also a reason for extending the time limit.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes keeping the Swedish rule stating that flagging must occur at a ceiling of 90 per cent of all shares in the company or of voting rights for all shares in the company, partly because of the link with the provisions contained in the Swedish</p>
<p>Companies Act concerning majority owners’ buy-out obligation. The amending Directive introduces regulations aimed at preventing hidden acquisition strategies through transactions with certain types of financial instruments that have not previously been covered by the flagging requirement. This applies, for example, to certain types of swap agreements, repurchase agreements and contracts for differences. As a result of these amendments to the Directive, the Inquiry proposes that the provisions on the flagging requirement apply not just to shares but also to other financial instruments that have an economic impact equivalent to the right to acquire shares, irrespective of whether or not the financial instrument confers a right to a physical settlement. The Inquiry proposes that a special calculation rule be introduced by law for the calculation of the proportion of all shares in the company or voting rights for all shares in the company that derive from financial instruments that only confer a right to a cash settlement.</p>
<p>As a result of the changes to the Transparency Directive, the Inquiry also proposes that shares acquired with the aim of stabilising prices be exempt from the flagging requirement under certain conditions. The exception should only apply on the proviso that the owner ensures that the voting rights attached to the shares are not exercised or used in any other way in the management of the company.</p>
<p>Periodic financial information</p>
<p>The Transparency Directive’s requirement that issuers must regularly publish financial information has been implemented through provisions contained in the Securities Market Act. These rules essentially match those contained in the Transparency Directive. However, Swedish accounting regulations carry certain additional requirements concerning the content of annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and interim management statements.</p>
<p>The amendments to the Transparency Directive remove the requirement for quarterly reporting by issuers of shares via either interim management statements or quarterly reports. The possibility for Member States to introduce national requirements for more frequent financial reporting than biannually is also limited, particularly regarding small and medium-sized issuers. As a consequence of the amendments to the Transparency Directive, the Inquiry proposes removing the current requirement contained in the Securities Market Act stating that companies whose shares have been admitted to trading on a regulated market must publish an interim management statement during the first and second halves of the financial year, or a quarterly report. In the Inquiry’s view, reporting on a quarterly basis is better regulated within the framework of the regulations that each regulated market puts in place for the issuers whose securities have been admitted to trading.</p>
<p>Under the Transparency Directive, issuers of shares and debt securities must publish a biannual report. The amended provisions in the Directive extend the time limit for publishing the biannual report from two to three months. However, the Inquiry proposes retaining in Swedish law the current time limit of two months, which has long been established on the Swedish market and is considered to be advantageous for investor protection.</p>
<p>As a result of amendments to the EU’s Accounting Directive, companies operating in the extractive industry or in the logging of primary forests will be covered by the requirement to prepare an annual report on payments to governments starting from the first financial year that begins after 31 December 2015 or later. Under the current amendments to the Transparency Directive, if the company’s securities have been admitted to trading on a regulated market, the report must also be published in line with the provisions on publication laid down in the Directive. The Inquiry therefore proposes that issuers operating in the extractive industry or the logging of primary forests should publish an annual report on certain payments to governments no later than six months after the end of each financial year.</p>
<p>Through the amendments to the Transparency Directive, a provision is being introduced that requires issuers of shares, by 2020, to use a common electronic reporting format to prepare their annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements. The requirement is subject to the condition that ESMA carries out a costbenefit analysis. More detailed provisions on the reporting format that is to be used will be communicated in technical standards to be adopted by the Commission. The Inquiry proposes the introduction of a legal requirement for a single electronic reporting format with a delayed entry-into-force date. A decision on entry into force should be taken by the Government once ESMA’s cost-benefit analysis is complete. The provision is to be applied at the earliest to annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements prepared for the financial year that ends on 31 December 2019.</p>
<p>Other information requirements for issuers and access to information</p>
<p>With the amendments implemented in the Transparency Directive, the current requirement that an issuer must publish information about new loan issues has been removed. As a result, the Inquiry proposes that the corresponding provision in the Securities Market</p>
<p>Act be removed. In the Inquiry’s view, the market’s need for information about loan issues is met by other regulations.</p>
<p>The amendments to the Transparency Directive have also seen the removal of an earlier requirement stating that an issuer that proposes changes to the company’s articles of association or equivalent must inform the competent authority and the regulated market about the proposed change. The Inquiry has not found cause to keep the equivalent Swedish provision in the Securities Market Act and proposes therefore that this also be eliminated.</p>
<p>Flagging notifications, periodic financial information and other information published by issuers in line with the Transparency Directive, and information affecting prices that is published in line with the national regulations based on Directive 2003/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on insider dealing and market manipulation, (the Market Abuse Directive), must be filed with the competent authority (the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority) at the same time as it is published. The Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority is responsible for the electronic storage of this information and for making the information available for the public. Provisions concerning the publication and storage of information under the Transparency Directive are contained in the Securities Market Act and in agency regulations. As a result of the amendments to the Transparency Directive, the Inquiry proposes that it be made possible to obtain access to the Swedish Financial</p>
<p>Supervisory Authority’s storage function through a European electronic access point for information. More detailed regulations concerning the electronic access point will be contained in technical standards adopted by the Commission. Under the Directive, the European access point is to be established by 1 January 2018. In anticipation of the completion of the technical conditions for the access point, the Inquiry proposes that the coming into force of the rule on electronic access is postponed until the day the Government decides.</p>
<h2>New sanction provisions</h2>
<p>Amendments to the Transparency Directive have strengthened the sanctioning powers of the competent authority. In the event of breaches of the provisions on periodic financial information, flagging provisions and the Transparency Directive’s requirement concerning the publication of changes to rights attached to securities that have been admitted to trading on a regulated market, the competent authority is to have the power to make a public statement on the breach and who is responsible for it, to decide on an order requiring the party responsible to cease the conduct constituting the breach and to decide to impose administrative pecuniary sanctions. In addition to the above powers, the Member States must ensure that it is possible under national law to temporarily suspend voting rights for shares in the event of a breach of the flagging regulation.</p>
<p>In order for the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority to have the sanctioning powers provided for in the new wording of the</p>
<p>Transparency Directive, the Inquiry proposes that the Authority’s current powers for deciding to issue financial penalty orders and pecuniary sanctions be expanded to cover the provision in the Securities Market Act stating that issuers must publish information on changes to the rights attached to securities that have been admitted to trading on a regulated market. It is also proposed that these sanctioning powers cover the new provisions in the Securities Market Act proposed by the Inquiry that certain issuers must publish an annual report on payments to governments and that annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements must be prepared using a single electronic reporting format. In addition, the Inquiry proposes that – if there are exceptional grounds and if the flagging requirement has not been met – the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority should have the power to forbid the person or entity subject to the flagging requirement to represent shares to the extent that the proportion of ownership of all shares in the company or voting rights for all shares in the company is equal to or exceeds a value beyond which flagging notification is required. If there are special grounds, such as for the management of the company, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority is to have the possibility of applying to the district court for the latter to appoint an appropriate person to act as administrator to represent the shares that the owner is not permitted to represent.</p>
<p>Under the amended provisions in the Transparency Directive, all decisions on sanctions and measures relating to the provisions of the Transparency Directive – including information about the type and nature of the breach and the details of who was responsible for the breach – must be published without delay by the competent authority. Publication may be postponed or made anonymous in certain cases. As a result of the amended requirements in the Directive, the Inquiry proposes that regulations be introduced at ordinance level providing for an obligation on the part of the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority to publish decisions on sanctions and pecuniary sanctions without unnecessary delay.</p>
<p>Pecuniary sanctions</p>
<p>Through the amendments to the Transparency Directive, the Member States are obliged to introduce pecuniary sanctions of a certain amount. To implement these changes, the Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority have the powers to impose pecuniary sanctions on legal persons of up to SEK 88 774 000 or up to five per cent of annual turnover. In cases in which the amount is higher and can be calculated, the pecuniary sanction is to be an amount that corresponds to twice the profits made or the losses avoided as a result of the breach. For natural persons, the Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority have the power to impose sanctions of up to SEK 17 755 000 or, in cases in which the amount is higher and can be calculated, up to twice the amount that corresponds to the profits made or the losses avoided as a result of the breach.</p>
<p>The maximum amounts stated in the Directive are considerably higher than the maximum amounts that apply concerning special charges and penalty charges under existing law. There are arguments both for and against the pecuniary sanctions being equivalent in certain cases to criminal charges under the European Convention on Human Rights. If in a specific case a pecuniary sanction could be regarded as being tantamount to criminal charges under the European Convention on Human Rights and the act that was the cause of the sanction is also covered by a provision in the Swedish Penal Code or other criminal legislation, an individual assessment may be made as to whether a pecuniary sanction may be imposed by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority or whether it should be dealt with in criminal law proceedings.</p>
<p>Broader liability for natural persons</p>
<p>Under the amendments introduced in the Transparency Directive, in situations when a legal entity is in breach of their obligations under the Directive, it shall be possible to apply sanctions to members of the legal entity’s administrative, management or supervisory bodies and to other individuals who are responsible for the breach. The Inquiry therefore proposes that it should be possible to impose pecuniary sanctions on an individual member of the board of directors, a managing director and substitutes for any of these individuals if this person intentionally or through gross negligence has taken a decision or failed to take a decision, with the result that the legal entity has committed a serious breach of one of the provisions contained in the Transparency Directive.</p>
<p>So that examinations regarding natural persons can be dealt with as quickly as possible, the Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority investigate the issue of liability on the part of natural persons in connection with an investigation into the responsibility of the company.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that a system of strict liability is not appropriate for sanctions against liable natural persons in the event of breaches on the part of the company. In such cases, therefore, it should not be possible to impose sanctions and pecuniary sanctions in the absence of intent or gross negligence (subjective requisites).</p>
<p>Processing of matters involving sanctions</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority process and take decisions on matters involving sanctions, as has previously been the case. As regards examinations concerning sanctions against liable natural persons in the event of breaches on the part of the company, the Inquiry proposes that a subjective requisite requirement be introduced (see above), which means that the examination would have to take place in a court of law. However, the Inquiry considers that a system whereby the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority is obliged to initiate legal proceedings would delay processing and make the sanctions system less effective. The Inquiry therefore proposes a system whereby the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority first issues a sanctions order which, if approved, is the equivalent of a final and nonappealable judgment. If the order is not approved within a set period of time, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority would be permitted to apply to a general administrative court for the sanction to be imposed. A similar system has been proposed with regard to sanctions that are to be imposed by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority in accordance with related EU legal instruments in the financial markets area. However, the Inquiry’s proposal that an application be made to a general administrative court differs from the proposals made by previous inquiries. It is considered that transferring the examination to a general administrative court would help to establish precedents, promote due process and save money in terms of legal costs for both individuals and the public.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the legislative amendments enter into force on 26 November 2015. The stricter sanctions provisions are not to be applied with regard to breaches that occurred before entry into force. The provisions on the publication of a report on payments to governments are to be applied for the first time with regard to reports prepared for the first financial year that begins after 31 December 2015 or later.</p>
