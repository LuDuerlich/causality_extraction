<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Commission</h2>
<p>According to the inquiry’s terms of reference (Dir. 2016:34), its commission can be divided into three separate parts. 1. Review the conditions for waste incineration and analyse whether there is a need to introduce a tax on the incineration of waste. The aim is to make waste management more resourceefficient and  non-toxic in accordance with the Swedish</p>
<p>Government’s ambition for Sweden to become one of the world’s first fossil-free welfare countries. 2. Review whether the charge on emissions of nitrogen oxides can be made more effective from an environmental perspective and more economically efficient, primarily by turning it into a tax. 3. Submit proposals for how the price signal on emissions of fossil carbon dioxide within the EU Emissions Trading System can be supplemented with other economic instruments that apply to electricity and heat production.</p>
<p>The basic premise of economic instruments pertaining to the environment is that they be structured as far as is possible in a way that makes the polluter pay for their environmental impact. A new tax or altered economic instruments should also be cost-effective and economically efficient and carry the minimum possible administrative costs.</p>
<p>The Government decided on supplementary terms of reference (Dir. 2017:49) for the inquiry in May 2017. The supplementary terms of reference state that the inquiry is to submit proposals for the design of a tax on the incineration of waste.</p>
<p>This commission is described in more detail in the inquiry’s terms of reference, which can be found in Appendix 1 and Appendix 2.</p>
<h2>A minimum price for emissions of fossil carbon dioxide within the EU ETS?</h2>
<p>A tax that adds to the cost of emitting carbon dioxide from electricity and heat production plants within the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) would constitute a national minimum price. For those plants that are subject to the tax, this means that the cost of emitting one kilogramme of carbon dioxide is never lower than the size of the tax (the minimum price).</p>
<p>The aim of the EU ETS is to harmonise climate policy within the EU in order to make a larger dent in global emissions and utilise the potential gains achievable through synergies at the EU level. The EU ETS is being used to harmonise the level of ambition and the price of carbon dioxide throughout the EU. This allows the gains from collaboration within the EU to be used to minimise the cost of pursuing an ambitious climate policy. This ambition is undermined by national minimum prices.</p>
<p>At the EU level, the ETS is a zero-sum game in terms of climate policy. The cap on emissions is determined through a democratic decision-making process. Once the cap has been determined, total emissions from the system have also been determined. Consequently, national climate policy does not automatically have an impact on the quantity of emissions caused by the plants encompassed by the EU ETS. It also means that national minimum prices do not have any long-term effects on climate.</p>
<p>Simply introducing a minimum price for emissions from heat production in combined heat and power plants would have an extremely small impact on emissions of fossil carbon dioxide in Sweden. The reason for this is that Swedish combined heat and power plants have largely already transitioned from fossil fuels to biofuels.</p>
<p>The majority of the remaining fossil carbon dioxide emissions from combined heat and power plants come from the incineration of waste. However, any energy or carbon dioxide tax that is levied on fuels used to produce heat in combined heat and power plants would not hit the waste used as fuel as this is tax exempt under the</p>
<p>EU’s Energy Taxation Directive. A minimum price would therefore not encompass waste and would not have any great effect.</p>
<p>In summer 2017, the Riksdag decided on the climate objective that Sweden would have zero net emissions greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by 2045, at the latest, in order to subsequently achieve negative emissions. If this objective is to be achieved,</p>
<p>Sweden’s fossil carbon dioxide emissions, both those within and those outside of the EU ETS, must decrease sharply.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the inquiry’s assessment is that the issue of a national minimum price has been raised at too early a stage. The issue should be brought up again once the negotiations concerning the supply of emission allowances within the EU ETS have concluded. It is only then that there will be sufficient information for an analysis of what impact the EU ETS can be expected to have with a view to 2045 and what need for supplementary instruments there will be.</p>
<h2>Tax on waste incineration</h2>
<p>One fundamental rule of environmental policy is that instruments should be put in place as close to the source of the problem as possible. A tax on waste incineration involves a tax being introduced at the end of the waste stream, far removed from the actors who are the cause of the problem, i.e. those who supply hazardous chemicals that risk ending up in the environment, and who contribute to the consumption of natural resources.</p>
<p>Therefore, a tax on waste incineration would not influence decisions concerning product design that facilitates recycling, efforts to sort out specific materials, etc. Another problem is that all waste would be taxed equally hard, regardless of its environmental impact and potential to be processed in some other way that is more appropriate than incineration. In practical terms, making the taxation system more precise in its aim is a much more difficult prospect.</p>
<p>In Sweden, there is currently overcapacity for waste incineration in relation to the domestic waste supply. As a result, this excess capacity is filled using waste imported from other countries. This means there is de facto competition between plants over the waste.</p>
<p>Consequently, any tax on waste incineration will not be passed on by the incineration plants to the actors who generate the waste. Such a tax would instead lead to increased costs for the incineration plants, making them less profitable. The plants will pass on as much of these increased costs as possible to district heating customers. However, there would be very little impact on the costs of waste management for households and businesses.</p>
<p>In other words, a tax on waste that is incinerated would be purely fiscal, i.e. not a functional and cost-effective means by which to encourage more resource-efficient and non-toxic waste management. Therefore, the inquiry’s assessment is that it is more appropriate to review and, if necessary, tighten up the instruments that directly target the sorting out of particularly important waste fractions and product design. Examples of such instruments include licensing conditions and increasing the responsibility placed on producers.</p>
<p>In accordance with its supplementary terms of reference (Dir. 2017:49), the inquiry has, nonetheless, drawn up a proposal indicating how a tax on waste incineration could be designed. The inquiry’s tax proposal has been designed in accordance with a net taxation model. This means that tax is levied on all waste entering a plant on which the tax is levied and deductions are permitted for waste that leaves the plant. This type of model has the potential to encourage the plant to sort out material that can be reused or recycled.</p>
<p>A tax rate of SEK 100 per tonne of waste entails a cost of approximately SEK 500 million per year for the actors involved. Because the proposed tax is expected to be essentially ineffectual, it entails not only no (or very low) total costs, but also no environmental benefits.</p>
<p>The reason for a tax is not to reduce the environmental impact caused by the incineration plants on which the tax is levied, it is to reduce the environmental impact caused by the actors that generate the waste. Because the proposed tax will not be passed on to the actors who are responsible for producing and sorting the waste, the principle that the polluter pays is also not fulfilled.</p>
<h2>Tax on emissions of nitrogen oxides from incineration plants for energy production</h2>
<p>The current charge on emissions of nitrogen oxides from energy production involves those companies that have lower than average emissions of nitrogen oxides per unit of energy produced getting back more money than they have paid in via the charge.</p>
<p>The problem with a rebate on the charge is that this does not encourage a cost-effective reduction in emissions. Another disadvantage is that the polluter-pays principle is not fulfilled because some of those who are liable to pay the charge make a profit through the system. The charge incentivises companies to cost-effectively reduce their emissions only through purification measures, and does not provide the same incentive to reduce emissions via production changes. A tax purely on nitrogen oxides (without a rebate) would be more appropriate in this respect and would also be more consistent with the polluter-pays principle.</p>
<p>The emissions on which the charge is payable currently account for just over ten per cent of total emissions of nitrogen oxides. It is not possible to demonstrate any clear upward or downward trend in the level of these emissions. Nonetheless, the emissions per unit of energy produced has decreased sharply over the period 1992– 2015, as result of investments in investments in technical purification measures, increased energy efficiency, etc.</p>
<p>Not all sectors on which the charge is levied have the same potential to reduce nitrogen oxides emissions. On the whole, the waste incineration sector and other electricity and heat sectors are net recipients under the charge system. This means that many plants in these sectors actually receive money for each kilogramme of nitrogen oxides they emit in relation to their energy production. The pulp and paper industry and the timber industry are generally net payers into the system. This means that there is a tendency within the system for money to move from industries exposed to international competition to the heat and combined heat and power sector.</p>
<p>The efficacy and the cost-effectiveness of this instrument would increase if the charge on nitrogen oxides was turned into a tax through the removal of the rebate. Other reforms of the charge on nitrogen oxides that leave the rebate in place would not fulfil the</p>
<p>cost-effectiveness requirement set out in our terms of reference. Even though there is an economic justification for an environmental policy that entails higher costs for the companies that generate emissions, it is also important that the consequences for companies exposed to international competition are taken into account in a more detailed analysis of the environmental effects and consequences for redistribution policy.</p>
<p>The companies that are exposed to international competition have limited potential to pass on increased costs to their customers and there is thus a risk that domestic production is replaced by foreign production with a poorer environmental performance. Deciding between a charge or a tax therefore involves the difficult process of weighing up efficacy, cost-effectiveness and the consequences for redistribution policy. These considerations are highly political, which is why the inquiry is not adopting a position on whether the current charge should be replaced with a tax on emissions of nitrogen oxides.</p>
<p>In order to provide a basis for such considerations, the inquiry does set out two alternative proposals indicating how a tax on nitrogen oxides could be designed taking into account the competitiveness of industry. The intention is to illustrate to current and future decision makers which taxation models are most appropriate and what their consequences would be. In other words, it can be used when making decisions in any future reform of the charge on nitrogen oxides.</p>
<p>In these proposals, the tax has been expanded to also encompass sources of emissions that are not covered by the current charge. This expansion makes the instrument more effective and increases the cost-effectiveness of reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides.</p>
<p>The first option investigated is a flat-rate tax on emissions of nitrogen oxides from incineration plants used for energy production with a rated thermal input of 5 megawatts or more.</p>
<p>In the second option, the risk of leakage of nitrogen oxides is taken into account and industries exposed to competition are thus given a lower rate of tax via a percentage deduction in the excise duty return.</p>
<p>A tax rate of SEK 50 per kilogramme of nitrogen oxides, calculated as nitrogen dioxide, emitted by an incineration plant is proposed in both options. However, industries exposed to</p>
<p>competition only pay a tax of SEK 20 per kilogramme in the second option.</p>
<p>The inquiry’s calculations show that the first proposal would result in a reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxides of at least 1 600 tonnes (4.5 per cent), compared with the current level, while the second proposal, with a lower tax rate for industries exposed to competition, would result in a reduction of approximately 700 tonnes (1.9 per cent).</p>
<p>The results show that the largest reduction in emissions would probably take place within the manufacture of non-metallic mineral products, the iron and steel industry and the heat sector. The gross effect on the public finances is estimated at approximately SEK 1.6 billion for the first proposal and around SEK 0.8 billion for the second. The cost of these tax proposals for the economy as a whole is significantly lower than these amounts as the tax is mainly redistributed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, both proposals involve significant costs for companies that pollute. The cost is justified under the principle that the polluter has to pay for their emissions and thus compensate for the damage caused to health and the environment.</p>
