<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Why a coherent rural policy is needed</h2>
<p>Rural areas create opportunities as well as challenges. Rural areas are home to flourishing businesses with high production values that must be given every opportunity to engage with their future markets. Some of this industry is derived from location-dependent resources that are important for Sweden as a whole. Among other things, the natural resources of rural areas and their cultural environment are important for taking Sweden into a bio-based and fossil-free economy and for making Sweden a developed tourist nation. Populated, active and growing rural areas are therefore vitally important.</p>
<p>People who live and work in rural areas contribute towards building our society as a whole and have the right to good living conditions.</p>
<p>There is currently no coherent policy for rural areas that is clearly founded on the challenges and opportunities faced by society. One overarching ambition for the Committee is to present such a coherent rural development policy for the next 30 years. The aim of this policy is to foster optimism and faith in the future across the whole of Sweden.</p>
<p>Our most fundamental underlying assumption is that rural areas are to be given the same conditions to develop as other parts of Sweden and provide the people who live and work in rural areas with equal opportunities to lead good lives.</p>
<p>Rural development has long been headed in a direction that runs counter to this ambition. The result has been a failure to exploit business potential and greater discrepancies between access to public services in different parts of the country. Continued division of Sweden is unacceptable on economic, social, environmental and democratic grounds. Rural Sweden offers many of the solutions to the challenges of the future, not least in climate policy, but for it to do so, it must be possible to live and work there.</p>
<p>Sweden’s citizens operate within different social and economic contexts. Many of them have voluntarily signed up to these in what we term civil society. Other contexts are created in that citizenship involves obligations and rights in relation to the institutions of society. In our view, however, citizenship is not merely a formality; it is also an expression of a social contract between the citizens and the public sector in the form of the State, county councils and municipalities. If there is too great a gap between expected rights and actual reality, there is a risk that this social contract will fall apart. This may have far-reaching consequences for confidence in society and democracy.</p>
<p>We consider that the social contract should be developed further in order to ensure that business and the citizens in rural areas are afforded the same conditions as other parts of Sweden. In order to achieve this, the Parliamentary Rural Development Committee is submitting 75 proposals that in total lay the groundwork for a more cohesive Sweden in which everyone, wherever they live, is provided with what they essentially need in order to live their lives.</p>
<p>In our work to draw up a cohesive rural development policy, we have drawn on three overarching perspectives:</p>
<p>• Equal conditions for citizens to live and work in rural areas.</p>
<p>• Increasing the capacity of rural areas to exploit opportunities for entrepreneurship and employment in a manner that is sustainable in the long term.</p>
<p>• Increasing the opportunities of rural areas to contribute towards the positive development of the economy.</p>
<h2>The Committee’s proposals and objectives for rural development</h2>
<p>In this final report the Committee is submitting a large number of proposals that will contribute towards a coherent policy for the long-term sustainable development of Sweden’s rural communities.</p>
<p>The Committee has also set out an overarching objective for rural development over a 30-year period:</p>
<p>• Viable rural areas with equal opportunities for enterprise, work, housing and welfare.</p>
<p>The objectives and the proposals that the Committee sets out in this final report draw on the analyses and assumptions in principle made by the Committee in its interim report På väg mot en ny politik för Sveriges landsbygder – landsbygdernas utveckling , möjligheter och utmaningar (Towards a new policy for Sweden’s rural areas – rural development, opportunities and challenges)  (SOU 2016:26).</p>
<h2>A business policy for rural Sweden</h2>
<p>The assumption underlying the Committee’s business policy proposals is that there are important production values in rural areas that it is important to exploit. In the Committee’s analyses we can see that increasing globalisation and specialisation makes major demands in terms of business capacity for renewal. Companies must be able to interact with actors locally, nationally and globally, actors who are capable of contributing expertise and money towards developing products and services. For solo and small businesses in sparsely populated areas in particular, the way in which they develop long-distance partnerships is vital. Our proposals on good digital and physical communication opportunities are important in this respect. The same applies to good access to a skilled workforce.</p>
<p>Objective</p>
<p>According to the Committee, the objective for this area should be:</p>
<p>• for rural conditions to be taken into account to create a diversified, competitive and sustainable business community with a good capacity for renewal.</p>
<p>Proposals</p>
<p>We can state that there are additional needs for financial capital primarily in sparsely populated and very sparsely populated rural areas. The Committee is therefore submitting proposals that will reinforce the mandates of Almi Företagspartner AB, Saminvest AB and Vinnova to work for business development in these rural areas. (2.3.1 and 2.3.2).</p>
<p>Capacity for renewal is strengthened by important contacts being forged between research, other expertise, advisors and producers at an early stage of an innovation. Therefore the Committee proposes that current measures be expanded, including support for innovation groups and innovation networking within the remit of the Rural Development Programme (2.3.2). It is important that this support reaches more companies and branches in rural areas.</p>
<p>Increased exports are important for boosting business competitiveness. The Committee therefore proposes that the actors that work through regional export centres and Visit Sweden are charged with carrying out targeted initiatives for companies in rural areas (2.3.3). It is particularly important that small companies, particularly in sparsely and very sparsely populated rural areas, are able to benefit from the initiatives that export centres are able to offer.</p>
<p>The Committee finds that there are numerous pieces of legislation and rules being applied that make it more difficult for those who run location-specific activities in rural areas, and for operations that are seasonal in nature. The problems arise partly due to a lack of knowledge of the conditions under which rural enterprise operates. For this reason it is important that those drawing up policy and those applying it on the ground are better informed about enterprise in sparsely populated areas. Knowledge development is needed and the Committee proposes that this be achieved through a newly established research centre (2.3.5).</p>
<p>Business package in municipalities facing particularly tough challenges</p>
<p>The Committee finds that current initiatives in support area A need to be supplemented to meet the particularly tough challenges that certain labour markets and municipalities face because they are in local labour market regions whose populations are small but which cover a large geographical area. These municipalities have had population decline and a business structure that consists of a relatively limited number of industries, which further heightens the challenges. Therefore, the Committee proposes a package with a combination of measures to create synergies and a positive development spiral in 23 municipalities with these extra challenges (2.3.4). The package is to increase access to labour and free up capital for local businesses. This will help to ensure that the production values stay and are reinvested in these rural areas. This in turn will strengthen the production capacity in these regions and in the long term lead to both new and retained jobs.</p>
<p>Access to labour is to be improved through investments in training centres and relocating public sector jobs. Improved communications will mainly be attained through an expanded highcapacity digital infrastructure. The package can also include SEK 500 million that can be used to enhance production capacity in these regions. This can be used for measures such as a greater reduction in employer and self-employed taxes and to write off student loans. We propose that the Government investigate these measures further.</p>
<h2>Digitalisation and transport infrastructure is to contribute towards rural development</h2>
<p>Despite ambitious targets for expanding broadband, the Committee can state that there are still many households, mainly in sparsely populated areas, that lack rapid broadband.</p>
<p>The need for investment in all types of transport currently exceeds the funding allocated. Where investments are made, calculations of the regional consequences of the investment are rarely carried out, despite the fact that the same transport investment may have completely different impacts depending on where it is located. Some investments can thus cause negative effects for more territorial policy areas such as rural policy.</p>
<p>Well-functioning digital communication and well-functioning transport systems make life easier for residents in rural areas and are of the utmost importance to rural development. Good communication opportunities are also vital to citizens’ ability to commute to work and use public and private services.</p>
<p>Objectives</p>
<p>The Committee has drawn up two objectives for this area:</p>
<p>• The whole country will benefit from the opportunities of digitalisation.</p>
<p>• An infrastructure that guarantees passenger and goods transport to citizens and businesses in rural areas.</p>
<p>Proposals</p>
<p>To make sure that rural areas too have access to efficient and safe digital communication with a high transfer capacity, the Committee is submitting a number of proposals (3.1, 3.1.1, 3.1.2). The Committee proposes that the Government decide a new objective for broadband expansion in which the whole country is to have access to digital infrastructure with transfer capacity of at least 100 Mbit/s by 2025. The Committee also proposes that the Swedish Board of Agriculture be commissioned to shape broadband support within the Rural Development Programme 2021–2027 so that the county administrative boards together with those responsible for regional development and municipalities can procure broadband with high transfer capacity.</p>
<p>The Committee is also submitting a number of proposals that seek to improve passenger and goods transport in rural areas. Among other things the Committee proposes that the Government assess the consequences that a change in taxation, charges and deductions in the area of transport policy would have on the opportunities for achieving the objectives of rural development policy (3.2.1). The Committee also proposes that the Government take the initiative to launch an overview of the travel deduction system with the aim of making it based on distance (3.2.2).</p>
<h2>Skills supply that meets the labour requirements of rural areas</h2>
<p>Skills supply in rural areas faces major challenges. Many young people move away from the countryside to university and college towns for their education, and far too few of them return. Both the private and public sector are finding it difficult to recruit people with the right qualifications. There is also a lack of people with higher education, which makes it difficult to attract knowledgeintensive businesses to rural areas.</p>
<p>Skills are one of the cornerstones of economic growth and development. This is particularly true of rural areas. Access to higher education locally is therefore important for rural industry and for the public sector.</p>
<p>Objective</p>
<p>The Committee’s objective for this area is:</p>
<p>• for the education system to ensure a supply of skills and increase access to higher education throughout Sweden.</p>
<p>Proposals</p>
<p>The Committee is submitting several proposals to safeguard skills supply in rural areas. The proposals have two main areas of focus. Firstly, a number of our proposals seek to increase access to higher education across Sweden. It is proposed that this take the form of education run at universities and higher education institutions being able to be offered locally in partnership with municipalities in what will be known as education centres (4.3).</p>
<p>Secondly, the Committee proposes that the Government investigate the effects and consequences were the State to write off a proportion of the student loans of people who live and work in the 23 municipalities that the Committee proposes be the subject of special initiatives (4.4).</p>
<h2>Planning and housing policy that meets the needs of rural areas</h2>
<p>The Committee finds that there is a demand for housing in rural areas. The majority of rural municipalities currently have a shortage of housing, and not only in central locations.</p>
<p>Housing supply has a major impact on capacity for rural development. Good housing can be essential in attracting the labour that rural areas need to move to these locations. Homes are necessary if municipalities are to be able to retain young and newly arrived people and facilitate their education and entry into the labour market. More people living in rural areas also expands the basis for commercial and public services.</p>
<p>Municipal land-use planning that covers the rural areas is also important for ensuring that these areas are able to exploit their opportunities for development and housing.</p>
<p>Objectives</p>
<p>The objectives that the Committee has drawn up for the area are:</p>
<p>• Facilitating housing in rural areas.</p>
<p>• Planning that encourages rural development.</p>
<p>Proposals</p>
<p>In order to ensure that the municipalities use land-use planning to a greater extent as a tool to create good conditions for rural development, the Committee proposes that the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning be commissioned to draw up guidance for how rural values and development opportunities can be accounted for within the framework of municipal land-use planning (5.1).</p>
<p>The Committee is also submitting a number of proposals that seek to reduce certain restrictions that apply to building and development in rural areas. The proposals concern national interests, protection of beaches, and water and drainage legislation (5.1.1 – 5.1.3).</p>
<p>To increase the State’s commitment to building houses in rural areas, the Committee proposes that the Government take the initiative to investigate whether building can be facilitated by introducing special rural loans for self-builders, rentals, owned apartments, cooperative tenancies and tenant-ownership.</p>
<h2>Improved access to services, welfare and the arts in rural areas</h2>
<p>The Committee finds that commercial services in rural areas are tending to decline. For example, the number of supermarkets is in decline in all types of rural areas, as is access to payment services and cash handling.</p>
<p>Access to commercial services and welfare services is vital to rural development. If there are no schools or pre-schools, supermarkets, filling stations, post offices or pharmacies, etc. it is hard to attract new citizens, and to run businesses in particular. The arts also play an important role in creating attractive environments in which to live capable of contributing towards the vitality and development of rural areas.</p>
<p>Demographic trends pose the greatest challenge for welfare services. When a municipality’s population falls, the municipality faces difficulties funding their operations and recruiting staff.</p>
<p>Objectives</p>
<p>The objectives that the Committee has drawn up for this area are:</p>
<p>• Good access to commercial services.</p>
<p>• Equitable access to health care, education and care no matter where people live.</p>
<p>• Equitable opportunities to practice and experience culture no matter where people live.</p>
<p>Proposals</p>
<p>One underlying assumption for the Committee’s proposals is that the State has to take greater responsibility for commercial services, welfare services and the arts in rural areas.</p>
<p>In order to strengthen and develop commercial services, the Committee it submitting proposals that include seeking to safeguard access to post office and payment services (6.2.2, 6.2.3).</p>
<p>The Committee also proposes adapting the system that ensures equal financial conditions in municipalities to changed demographic and other circumstances and making earmarked government grants more general (6.4.1).</p>
<p>The Committee also proposes that the Swedish Arts Council and Swedish Agency for Cultural Policy Analysis be tasked with making the arts more accessible in rural areas (6.7.1).</p>
<h2>The State must have a greater presence in rural areas</h2>
<p>The Committee finds that the State has withdrawn from rural areas and increasingly concentrated its operations in densely populated areas and large towns. One starting point for the Committee’s proposals is therefore that the State must be more present throughout Sweden and that the State as an employer must take greater responsibility for rural development.</p>
<p>Objective</p>
<p>The Committee’s objective for this area is:</p>
<p>• for the State to be physically present in rural areas with jobs, government agency services and a police presence.</p>
<p>Proposals</p>
<p>The Committee is submitting a number of proposals that seek to strengthen State presence in rural areas.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the Swedish employment service stop planned cuts in its local office network until the consequences of the cuts and the introduction of alternative digital channels for job seekers have been evaluated (7.1.1).</p>
<p>A police presence in rural areas is a very important reassuring factor for the local population. The Committee proposes that the Government set requirements on a maximum intervention time for police cases where action must be taken immediately (7.1.2).</p>
<p>The Committee also proposes that a service organisation be set up tasked with responsibility for the local services that are currently performed by the Swedish social security agency Försäkringskassan, the Swedish Tax Agency and the Swedish Pensions Agency (7.1.3). Two alternative models for such an organisation are outlined. Where possible, the Swedish employment service, the Swedish Migration Agency and the Swedish Police will be co-located with the new service organisation.</p>
<p>The number of posts at government agencies in the Stockholm functional analysis region (FA region) increased by over 10,000 in the period 2008–2014. At the same time, the number of Government posts fell in many FA regions with a more vulnerable job market. The Committee therefore proposes that 10,000 posts at government agencies in Stockholm’s FA region be relocated to FA regions in need of public sector employment for a five-year period.</p>
<h2>Clearer steering and coordination of rural development policy</h2>
<p>Strong sectorisation on the part of the State is a problem for a cross-sectoral and complex policy area such as rural policy. The opportunities for development and growth that are based on actors at different levels working together, are poorer in a sector-based system compared with one in which geography is afforded significance.</p>
<p>One condition for successful rural development is that there are ways of working and tools that make it possible to coordinate measures in different policy areas.</p>
<p>Proposals</p>
<p>One underlying assumption behind the Committee’s proposal is that there is a need for clearer steering and coordination of rural policy. If this is to succeed, the roles of the different government actors need to be more clearly defined. The Committee is submitting a number of proposals to achieve this (8.1.1–8.1.6). We propose that:</p>
<p>The Committee Ordinance stipulates that, in their reports, committees are to state the consequences of their proposals for rural areas.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the Government’s joint preparation of Government bills and other Government decisions, a special assessment of the consequences of the decision for rural areas is introduced.</p>
<p>The responsibility of certain government agencies and Stateowned companies for rural policy is clearly set out in the agencies’ instructions and the companies’ directives.</p>
<p>In each county a strategic and operative coordination function is to be set up, known as the rural delegation. The delegations are to coordinate the activities of the government agencies in rural policy. The rural delegations are to be headed by the county governors and assisted by a secretariat at the county administrative boards.</p>
<h2>Better conditions for civil society to contribute towards rural development</h2>
<p>Sustainable development rests on human commitment and capacity to work together and organise. Rural areas also have a wealth of clubs and societies. In many rural areas civil society takes a major responsibility for local services and infrastructure through its organisations. A rural policy must therefore facilitate the contribution of civil society.</p>
<p>In rural areas it is particularly important that operations can be provided as small-scale solutions that offer synergies. It is therefore important for the public, private and voluntary sectors to work together. Through its organisations, civil society can also contribute towards a better basis for decision-making in the public sector. In the view of the Committee, arenas for dialogue and cooperation therefore need to be strengthened.</p>
<p>Local clubs and societies in rural areas need to be expanded. More young and new Swedes need to feel a sense of belonging and that they are important to the development of their areas to a greater extent. Their commitment is needed in order to strengthen rural development.</p>
<p>Objective</p>
<p>The Committee’s objective for civil society is:</p>
<p>• for the State to promote civil society involvement in rural development.</p>
<p>Proposals</p>
<p>The State can help to strengthen more arenas at different levels. Therefore, the Committee proposes that the Leader method be extended nationwide and that the State’s agreement with civil society at national level be expanded by also focusing on developing working methods for rural development (9.4, 9.5). Furthermore, the Committee proposes targeted support for non-formal adult education to strengthen, in particular, the opportunities and capacity of young people and people with an immigrant background to participate in rural development (9.3).</p>
<h2>Costs and financing the Committee’s proposals</h2>
<p>The Committee proposes a large number of measures to strengthen the impetus for development in rural areas. The positive economic effect of our proposals will come about by combining them. The consequences of our proposals should therefore be assessed in combination.</p>
<p>It has emerged that there are extensive deficiencies in today’s travel deduction system. Incorrect payments resulted in the State losing SEK 1.4 billion at today’s deduction levels. If the travel deduction, as the Committee proposes, is changed to be based on distance, scope will be created to make more effective development initiatives in rural areas.</p>
<p>The more important initiatives and their funding are set out below.</p>
<p>• The annual cost of a Government grant that seeks to create an infrastructure for education centres in FA regions that lack a university or higher education institution, or have few established municipal centres of learning in the region, is estimated at SEK 70 million. The financing is proposed to be secured by funds released through our proposal on distancebased travel deductions. The cost of the initiative to educational establishments should be able to be financed through existing appropriations.</p>
<p>• The cost of the Committee’s proposal for broadband expansion is estimated at approximately SEK 2 billion. The annual investments in continued broadband expansion concern about SEK 300 million over a period of five to ten years. The financing is proposed to be secured by funds released through our proposal on  distance-based travel deductions. This financing must be seen in relation to the Government already spending SEK 1 billion on continued broadband expansion.</p>
<p>• The Committee’s proposal that at least 10,000 posts in government agencies in the Stockholm FA region be relocated to FA regions in need of public sector employment over a  five-year period, may initially lead to certain costs that tie in with the move to new locations and new premises. These costs should, however, mainly be accommodated within the appropriations of the agencies concerned.</p>
<p>• The Committee’s proposal to carry out  locally-led development using the Leader method nationwide is estimated to cost a further approximately SEK 150 million seen over a seven-year period. The financing is expected to be met by reprioritisation within the Rural Development Programme, including through the resources released through our proposal for better coordinated broadband procurement that is more efficient in terms of resources.</p>
<p>• The Committee has also identified potential funding amounting to SEK 500 million. This funding can be used for growthenhancing measures in the package targeting the 23 municipalities</p>
<p>with particularly tough challenges. It can be used for measures such as a greater reduction in employer and self-employed taxes and to write off student loans. We propose that these measures be funded by funds released through our proposal on distancebased travel deductions.</p>
