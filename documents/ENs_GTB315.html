<p>The remit</p>
<p>The remit of the inquiry has been to take a position on how the sections considered to be obligatory of the Council Directive 2003/86 EC on the right to family reunification (referred to below as the Family Reunification Directive) are to be implemented in Swedish law and to take a position on how the Council Directive 2003/109/EC concerning the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents (referred to below as the Long-term Residents Directive) is to be implemented in Swedish law.</p>
<p>The Family Reunification Directive</p>
<p>One of the principles of the Family Reunification Directive is that a third country national who has a more permanent residence in an EU state (the so-called sponsor) is entitled to be reunited with members of his/her nuclear family. According to the Directive, the right to reunification is conditional on the family members also being third country nationals. In the case of Sweden, this means that the sponsor must firstly be a third country national who lives in Sweden with a permanent residence permit, or who has been granted such a permit. The sponsor may also be a person who has status as a longterm resident in another EU state and who has been granted a residence permit in Sweden or who has a residence permit here as a relative of such a person. “Nuclear family” refers to the spouse (including a registered partner), cohabitee and children (including adoptive children) under 18 years of age. In order to comply with the requirements of the Directive, the inquiry proposes that provisions be incorporated into the Aliens Act (1989:529) to the effect that a spouse or cohabitee is entitled to a residence permit on grounds of personal ties with the sponsor. Children under 18, who are unmarried and</p>
<p>children of the sponsor, spouse or cohabitee are also to have this right. The residence permit is to be valid for at least one year. With regard to newly established relationships, the inquiry proposes that the current procedure entailing deferral of immigrant status for socalled short-term ties continue to apply for third country nationals in the future. With reference to the Family Reunification Directive, the temporary residence permit given during the trial period must be valid for at least one year.</p>
<p>It is proposed to incorporate the provisions detailing the conditions for granting residence permits in the above cases by means of new wording in Chapter 2, Section 4, subsections 2 and 3 of the Aliens Act.</p>
<p>Special provisions are to apply to minor refugee children or children otherwise in need of protection staying in Sweden with residence permits under Chapter 3, Section 4 of the Aliens Act (cf. Chapter 3, Sections 2 and 3 of the same Act) and who are unaccompanied by an adult. The inquiry proposes that a provision be incorporated into Chapter 2, Section 4, subsection 4 of the Aliens Act to the effect that the parents of these children are entitled to be granted residence permits.</p>
<p>Certain exceptions to the principle rule in Chapter 2, Section 4 of the Aliens Act, to the effect that residence permits are to be given to relatives in the nuclear family, are to apply. These exceptional situations are detailed in a new rule, Chapter 2, Section 4 a of the Aliens Act. An application for a residence permit may be rejected if the sponsor does not cohabit with his/her spouse or cohabitee or does not intend to do so; if it is a matter of a polygamous household; if the sponsor, spouse or cohabitee is a minor; if the applicant for instance has misled or submitted incorrect information in the application for a residence permit; or if it is a matter of a marriage or partnership of convenience. In addition to these exceptions, permits may be refused if the applicant is considered to represent a threat to public order or security. The latter exception is given in a new wording of Chapter 2, Section 4 c of the Aliens Act. This concept replaces the examination that takes place under the current provision in Chapter 2, Section 4, subsection 4 of the same Act under which the applicant is required to lead a respectable life in order to be granted a residence permit.</p>
<p>A residence permit granted to a relative who is a third country national may be revoked under the current provisions of Chapter 2, Sections 9–12 of the Aliens Act. However, the inquiry proposes</p>
<p>that the possibility of revoking a residence permit on the grounds of the alien’s way of life, under Chapter 2, Section 11, subsection 1.2, be removed.</p>
<p>Under the Family Reunification Directive, certain procedural guarantees are to apply for processing cases relating to residence permits for third country nationals. Generally speaking the same rules of procedure under the Administrative Procedure Act (1986:223) and the Aliens Act are to apply as those currently applying to permit cases. However, the inquiry proposes that a provision be incorporated into Chapter 11, Section 3 of the Aliens Act under which the Swedish Migration Board must observe a nine-month time limit within which a decision on an application for a residence permit for family reunification must be notified to the applicant. It is also proposed that a provision be incorporated into the same Section to the effect that there must be written criteria for decisions regarding residence permits in general.</p>
<p>The inquiry’s proposals in connection with the implementation of the Family Reunification Directive are not considered to involve increased costs for society or for the individual.</p>
<p>The Long-term Residents Directive</p>
<p>This EC Directive introduces a new legal entity, that of long-term resident third country national, into Swedish law. If a third country national has permanently resided in an EU state for five years, he or she may, on application, be granted special status – that of a longterm resident in that country. With this status, a third country national is to be assured of certain rights in that country. Under this Directive, the long-term resident is also entitled to free movement in the EU. This means that new provisions must be introduced into Swedish law.</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that a new chapter, Chapter 1 a, is included in the Aliens Act, regulating the conditions for status of long-term resident in Sweden. The status of long-term resident must primarily be granted to a person who has a residence permit to reside in Sweden and who has lived here for at least five years, without a lengthy period of absence. For particular, specially defined categories an exception is made to the requirement for a residence permit to reside in this country. Refugees and other persons in need of protection are exempted from being able to obtain the status of long-term resident.</p>
<p>To be granted status as a long-term resident, an applicant must show that he/she is able to support him/herself. He or she may not constitute a threat to public order or security</p>
<p>Status of long-term resident in Sweden that has been granted may be revoked if the long-term resident has deliberately submitted incorrect information of significance for obtaining this status or has deliberately withheld information of significance. This status may also be revoked if the long-term resident has been expelled from the country; represents a threat to public order; settles outside the territory of Sweden for more than one year or outside the Union for more than six years; or is granted the status of long-term resident in another EU state.</p>
<p>According to the EC Directive, the rights that a long-term resident of Sweden shall enjoy so long as he or she lives in Sweden are in principle not more generous than those applying to a person with a permanent residence permit in Sweden. The difference is that a third country national is entitled to settle in another EU state, in order to work, for example.</p>
<p>Third country nationals who are granted the status of long-term resident in another EU state can likewise choose to move to Sweden. The inquiry proposes provisions to regulate the conditions under which they will be able to obtain a residence permit in Sweden. These provisions mean that third country nationals with the status of long-term residents in another EU state and their relatives will be given the same opportunities to obtain residence permits as EEA citizens. In this connection, it will be possible to refuse a residence permit if the alien represents a threat to public order or security.</p>
<p>Residence permits for long-term residents from another EU state may be revoked on the same grounds applying to the revocation of residence permits for EEA members. A new provision of the Aliens Act is proposed to the effect that a person having the status of longterm resident in another EU state may be expelled from the Union’s territory if he or she represents a serious threat to public order and security.</p>
<p>The Long-term Residents Directive prescribes certain procedural guarantees with regard to cases relating to status as a long-term resident in Sweden and residence permits for long-term residents in other EU states. In addition to the Administrative Procedure Act, the appropriate sections of the rules of the Aliens Act on the processing of residence permit cases should also apply to these new cases. The inquiry proposes that provisions are introduced into the</p>
<p>Aliens Act to the effect that the Swedish Migration Board must observe certain time limits for notification of a decision in these cases, that decisions should be given to the applicant in writing and contain the reasons for the decision.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Swedish Migration Board be the national contact point on issues relating to long-term residents, in accordance with the EC Directive.</p>
<p>The number of applications for the status of long-term resident in Sweden will not be high. The inquiry does not expect that immigration as a result of the new status will be so extensive that it will entail noticeable consequences for Swedish society. The increase in the number of persons immigrating to Sweden as a result of the Directive may be estimated at about 500 persons per year. This immigration may be expected to lead to a certain surplus in public finances.</p>
