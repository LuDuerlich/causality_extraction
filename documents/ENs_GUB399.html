<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit of the inquiry</h2>
<p>Our terms of reference require us to undertake an open-minded analysis of how current procedures under the Competition Act are working in order to identify factors that may be slowing down the system. Using this as a basis, we are to present proposals for changes aimed at reducing the processing time for cases under the Competition Act (particularly cartel cases). Our task is primarily to consider an arrangement by which the Swedish Competition Authority would be entitled to decide on financial penalties for infringing competition rules with the possibility of appeal directly to the Market Court. Secondly, we are to consider whether or not to introduce a leave to appeal procedure for the step between the Stockholm City Court and the Market Court.</p>
<p>We are also instructed to consider whether, in view of Community law, there is reason to amend the wording of Article 23a of the Competition Act relating to decisions regarding acceptance of commitments, and if so, to present proposals for amendments.</p>
<p>In view of the new EC Merger Regulation, we are also instructed to review the provisions of the Competition Act on mergers, and propose the necessary amendments to the Swedish regulatory system. We are to analyse in particular issues related to the substantive test, efficiency gains, the treatment of ancillary restraints, Swedish agencies’ assistance to the Commission in connection with inspections and notification of mergers. It is also clear from our terms of reference that the new EC Merger Regulation may mean that the Swedish regulations also need to be amended in other respects so as to achieve the requisite legal equivalence between Community law and Swedish legislation, or for other reasons. We are therefore free to take up other issues that we believe need to be considered and to propose amendments to the legislation that we deem necessary. In addition, we are also instructed to assess whether the Swedish</p>
<p>Competition Authority should be able to charge a fee for notifications of mergers.</p>
<p>Our terms of reference also require us to review the rules of the Competition Act on who is to be entitled to appeal certain of the Swedish Competition Authority’s decisions.</p>
<p>Our remit also includes proposing rules that express more clearly than hitherto the obligation to impose especially severe financial penalties for infringements of competition rules set in particularly serious cases. We are also required to examine the legislative proposals for criminalisation of cartel activities presented by the Inquiry on modernisation of competition rules in its report entitled Competitive crime: A legislative model  (SOU 2004:131).</p>
<p>Our remit also includes a review of the structure and clarity of the Competition Act.</p>
<p>Finally, we are required to present an account of the consequences of the proposals we have presented.</p>
<h2>Our proposals</h2>
<p>More effective procedures</p>
<p>We have not found support for any conclusion other than that the present system works relatively well. Some measures may be taken, however, to make procedures at the Swedish Competition Authority and in the courts more efficient, appropriate and legally secure. These measures should be taken regardless of whether or not the Authority is granted decision-making powers.</p>
<p>The Swedish Competition Authority should strive to continue to improve the standard of its investigations and litigation and actively pursue more formalised, and thus more predictable procedures at the Authority. It should be left to the Authority to determine the details of how and to what extent this should be done. In certain respects, however, we propose concrete changes that may help to raise the standards of the Swedish Competition Authority’s investigations and lead to more formalised and predictable procedures at the Authority.</p>
<p>With respect to the resources currently available to the courts, these appear to be sufficient to deal with matters and cases under the Competition Act at present. However, we consider that within the framework of the current reforms regarding the internal organisation of the courts, it should be quite possible to create an organisation that is better able to use the available resources. We do not propose any far-reaching changes in the procedural regulations. A necessary condition for procedures in courts to be efficient, appropriate and legally secure, however, is that courts make full use of the possibilities offered by the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure to exercise active formal and material procedural leadership. It should, however, be left to the courts to determine in detail how these quality assurance efforts should be managed in practice.</p>
<p>We also propose concrete measures to make procedures at the Swedish Competition Authority and in courts more effective.</p>
<p>• In order to make it easier for undertakings to make common cause with the Swedish Competition Authority, and to achieve more efficient use of courts’ resources, we propose an option for the courts to consolidate cases concerning damages on grounds of competition law with cases concerning financial penalties for infringements of competition rules.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Competition Authority should be enabled to combine decisions with a conditional penalty when the Authority accepts commitments in connection with a merger or in a case when the Swedish Competition Authority is considering requiring an undertaking to cease its infringement of one of the prohibitions in the Competition Act or the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>• Information that a witness or a party has presented at a hearing at the Swedish Competition Authority should be brought forward at a hearing in a court, if the information given by the person heard differs from that person’s previous statement or the person to be heard declares that he or she is not able or not willing to make a statement.</p>
<p>• The rules concerning legal costs should be amended so that the provisions of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure on disputes are applicable to matters and cases under the Competition Act. A special provision should also be inserted into the Act to the effect that where a damages case is being processed jointly with a case on financial penalties for infringements of competition law, the party bringing the action for damages is only to be responsible for the special costs that party has caused, and that the Swedish Competition Authority should not be held responsible for such costs.</p>
<p>• The rules of the Competition Act on statutory limitation with regard to financial penalties should be amended so that certain measures taken by the Swedish Competition Authority during its inquiry into a case mean that the period of statutory limitation is restarted. An absolute statutory limitation period of ten years should apply, however.</p>
<p>Should the Swedish Competition Authority be able to decide on financial penalties for infringements of competition rules?</p>
<p>We have not found sufficient reason for proposing that the Swedish Competition Authority should be generally authorised to take the first legally binding decision on financial penalties. However, there are decisive arguments in support of the Authority being allowed to take decisions on financial penalties in cases that are not contested. We therefore propose that the Swedish Competition Authority should be enabled, in these cases, to formulate a draft decision that will be legally binding if accepted by the undertaking concerned (an injunction to pay a penalty).</p>
<p>Leave to appeal in the step between the Stockholm City Court and the Market Court</p>
<p>We propose that all the decisions issued by the Stockholm City Court in competition cases and competition matters that may be appealed to the Market Court should be subject to the requirement of leave to appeal. Even for cross-appeals and appeals in damages cases that have been consolidated with cases concerning financial penalties for infringements of competition rules, leave to appeal should be required. Leave to appeal should, however, not be required when appealing decisions of the Stockholm City Court regarding the issue of setting aside an injunction to pay a penalty.</p>
<p>Grounds for exemption should be the same in the Market Court as in the court of appeal, when the reform of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure approved by the Riksdag (Swedish Parliament) enters into force. Leave to appeal should thus be granted if it is important for guidance in the application of the law that the appeal is heard by a higher court (precedent exemption); if there is reason to doubt the correctness of the conclusion reached by the Stockholm City Court (leave for reversal); if, without granting leave to appeal it is not possible to assess the correctness of the conclusions of the district court (examination exemption); or if there are otherwise special reasons for examining the appeal (extraordinary exemption). Partial leave to appeal should be available with regard to a part of the district court’s decision or judgment where the outcome cannot affect the rest of the decision.</p>
<p>In more straightforward cases, the chair of the Market Court should be able on his/her own to grant leave to appeal that is not limited to a specific part of a case or matter.</p>
<p>Commitments from undertakings</p>
<p>Under Article 23a of the Competition Act, the Swedish Competition Authority may accept commitments from undertakings. This provision should be amended so that it clearly states that the only legal consequence of the Authority accepting a commitment is that the Swedish Competition Authority, in view of the commitment made, no longer has cause to intervene against the conduct in question.</p>
<p>The new EC Merger Regulation and the provisions on mergers in the Competition Act</p>
<p>There are strong arguments in support of ensuring that concrete assessments of mergers are identical, regardless of whether an examination is undertaken under the Competition Act or the EC Merger Regulation.</p>
<p>If the provisions of the Competition Act are simplified in certain respects so as to more clearly reflect the actual meaning of Community law regulations, it should be possible to enhance the efficiency and predictability of their application. Such a reform of the regulatory system in the Competition Act could also meet reasonable demands for readability and intelligibility, at least with regard to the main features of the system.</p>
<p>With regard to the formal rules as well, there are strong reasons in favour of the main features of these systems being identical. However, the rules of the Competition Act should continue to reflect Swedish legal culture with regard to procedures at authorities and in the courts.</p>
<p>The merger concept</p>
<p>We propose that the Competition Act should state that a merger arises via transactions leading to a lasting change in control over one or several undertakings.</p>
<p>The Act should also state that the expression ‘party’ in a merger refers to the person(s) who acquire control over one or several undertakings or parts thereof, the undertaking itself or each and every one of the undertakings that are merged.</p>
<p>A special provision should also be included in the Competition Act making it clear that, if a merger consists of several transactions by which parts of one or several undertakings are acquired, these transactions should be treated as a single merger when estimating turnover. This rule should, however, only include transactions that take place within a two-year period.</p>
<p>Substantive tests</p>
<p>We consider that the provisions of the Competition Act prohibiting mergers should be amended to the effect that a prohibition be imposed with regard to mergers that are liable to significantly prevent the existence or development of effective competition in the country as a whole or a significant part of it, if a prohibition can be imposed without setting aside essential national security or supply interests.</p>
<p>The text of the Act must make it clear that, when assessing a case, particular account should be taken of whether a merger will lead to the creation or strengthening of a dominant position.</p>
<p>Claims of efficiency gains and that one of the undertakings concerned is threatened by bankruptcy</p>
<p>In our opinion, claims of efficiency gains and claims that one of the merging undertakings is threatened by bankruptcy should be assessed in the same manner under the Competition Act as under Community law. Explicit provisions that regulate such issues should not, however, be included in the Competition Act. As in Community law, such claims should be examined in the context of the substantive test.</p>
<p>Ancillary restraints and the special grounds for assessment that apply to independently functioning joint ventures in some cases</p>
<p>We propose that a provision be inserted into the Competition Act that makes it clear that an examination of a merger includes the judicial acts that are fundamental to the initiation of the merger and such competitive restraints as are directly connected with, and necessary for implementing the merger (“ancillary restraints”).</p>
<p>It should also be made clear in the Act that other competitive restraints that may occur in connection with a merger may be examined under the prohibitions of the Competition Act and the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>No other rules on ancillary restraints should be included in the Competition Act. Nor should the Swedish Competition Authority, in decisions under which the Authority takes no action against a merger, express an opinion on whether the agreements and procedures notified are to be regarded as ancillary or not.</p>
<p>The present provision in Article 34b, first paragraph of the Competition Act, which regulates a situation in which the creation of an independently functioning joint venture should in certain respects be appraised in accordance with Articles 6 and 8 of the same Act, should be moved so that it is clear from the Competition Act that this is a matter of special grounds for appraisal when examining the merger.</p>
<p>The present provision in the Competition Act concerning the procedural rules for mergers that are to be applied when examining ancillary restraints and joint ventures should be repealed.</p>
<p>Commitments</p>
<p>In our opinion, the right of the Swedish Competition Authority to accept commitments from undertakings in merger cases should be made explicitly clear in the Competition Act.</p>
<p>The point of time for notifications of mergers and the possibility of sanctions etc.</p>
<p>A provision should be incorporated into the Act requiring notification of a merger to be made as soon as the parties or other participants can show that they intend to implement the merger.</p>
<p>We also propose that it should be explicitly clear in the Competition Act that a merger that is subject to compulsory notification must be notified to the Swedish Competition Authority before it is implemented.</p>
<p>In addition, it should be made clear in the Competition Act that no later than 25 working days after receiving full notification, the Swedish Competition Authority must either issue a decision to undertake a special investigation of the merger or a decision not to take any action with regard to the merger.</p>
<p>In our opinion, there are at present no practical reasons for proposing rules on direct sanctions against failures to fully meet notification obligations. Nor have any other factors come to light that would indicate the need for closer consideration of whether the Swedish Competition Authority should have the same possibility to impose sanctions and investigatory powers as the Commission.</p>
<p>Extending time limits</p>
<p>A provision should be incorporated into the Competition Act to the effect that the time limit for a decision by the Swedish Competition Authority to conduct a special investigation of a merger or not to take action will be extended to 35 working days in cases where the parties have provided commitments.</p>
<p>Assistance to the Commission</p>
<p>We propose that the provision of Article 3, second paragraph of the Act on the application of EC competition and state aid rules, concerning the powers of the Swedish Competition Authority when the Authority is assisting the Commission in investigations, should be repealed. In other respects, the regulations concerning Swedish authorities’ assistance to the Commission when it is conducting an investigation in Sweden are considered to be appropriate.</p>
<p>Prohibitions pending final examination</p>
<p>We propose that in ongoing cases concerning mergers, the Market Court should also be empowered to forbid the parties and other participants in the merger to take any action to complete the merger.</p>
<p>Fees for notification of mergers</p>
<p>We have not found sufficient reasons for proposing that the Swedish Competition Authority should be entitled to charge a fee for notification of mergers.</p>
<p>Who should be entitled to appeal certain Swedish Competition Authority decisions?</p>
<p>In our opinion, the provision on the right to appeal in the present Article 60, second paragraph of the Competition Act should be amended so that the concept of ‘undertakings’ is removed. The text of the Act will then only prescribe that those who are affected by a decision of the Swedish Competition Authority have the right to appeal.</p>
<p>Provisions on the size of financial penalties for infringements of competition rules</p>
<p>We propose that new, more precise rules on the circumstances to be taken into account when determining the size of financial penalties for infringements are incorporated into the Competition Act. This is primarily intended to make it easier for parties and courts to identify infringements that are particularly damaging from the point of view of competition and that deserve heavy penalties. The proposal should also enhance the predictability and consistency of the application of the law.</p>
<p>Using penal law as a model, we propose the incorporation of a scheme of reasoning in the Competition Act to describe how courts should proceed when determining the size of penalties. The seriousness of the infringement and its duration should continue to be the point of departure when determining the size of the financial penalty, and should when considered in combination yield a starting value (sanction value). When the sanction value has been determined for an undertaking, this should be adjusted to take account of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Finally, the financial penalty for infringements of competition rules may need to be reduced in certain cases to take account of the provision on reductions of penalties.</p>
<p>We further propose that the limits to the penalties in the present Article 27 of the Competition Act are removed. The text of the Act will then only prescribe that financial penalties for infringements of competition rules may not exceed ten per cent of the undertaking’s turnover in the preceding financial year.</p>
<p>Criminalisation in the field of competition law and individual sanctions that may be an alternative to penalties</p>
<p>We consider that there are not sufficient reasons for proposing criminalisation in the field of competition law. As an alternative to penalties, however, we propose that the possibility of sanctions for certain serious infringements of competition rules should be extended to include provisions on disqualification orders.</p>
<p>It must be possible to impose disqualification orders on people who exercise legal or actual management of undertakings that enter into, or apply agreements that are forbidden under the Competition Act or the EC Treaty, which implies that undertakings at the same production or trade level fix sales prices, restrict or control production or divide markets up among themselves. As under the provisions of the current Disqualification Order Act, for a prohibition to be imposed, the person in question is required to have thereby grossly disregarded his/her obligations in his/her business operations, and a prohibition must be required in the public interest.</p>
<p>When examining whether a disqualification order is required in the public interest, special attention should be given to, inter alia, whether activities have been liable to seriously prevent, restrict or distort competition. A disqualification order shall not be regarded as required in the public interest if, for example, the person who might be subject to such a prohibition has provided significant assistance, personally or in the context of business operations, to facilitate the Swedish Competition Authority’s investigation of the infringement.</p>
<p>The structure and clarity of the Competition Act</p>
<p>In order to fulfil our terms of reference regarding the structure and clarity of the Competition Act, we propose an entirely new Competition Act.</p>
<p>We further propose that the remaining provisions of the Act on the application of EC competition and state aid rules that concern application of the EC competition regulations should be incorporated into the Competition Act.</p>
<p>Entry into force</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that a reasonable period must be allotted to the consultation procedures, further processing at the Government Offices and consideration in the Riksdag, we believe that the new Competition Act can enter into force on 1 January 2009 at the earliest. The other amendments to acts and ordinances that we propose should, in general, enter into force on the same date.</p>
<h2>Consequences of our proposals</h2>
<p>Overall, our proposals are considered to be cost-neutral from the perspective of central government finances.</p>
<p>Further, generally speaking, the proposals are not expected to lead to higher costs or a greater administrative burden for under- takings. For the competitiveness of small and medium sized enterprises relative to large undertakings, our proposals entail some improvements.</p>
