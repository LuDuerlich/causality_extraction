<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In accordance with the terms of reference for my enquiry, my mission has been to analyse the organisational status, structure and powers of the Air Navigation Services of Sweden (LFV) and where necessary to propose changes based on the liberalisation of the European market, on the EU regulations that regulate air navigation services and on the consequences for the integrated civilmilitary air navigation services. These terms of reference are given in Appendix 1.</p>
<h2>My starting-points</h2>
<p>Air navigation services are subject to demands from several different perspectives. The regulatory framework of the EU and civilmilitary integration are two of these perspectives. The Swedish decision to liberalise the market for local air traffic services adds a new dimension to operations and hence constitutes an additional perspective. Combining these different demands requires various public interests to be weighed against each other and potential trade-offs to be managed. No in-depth analyses of the potential efficiency gains of liberalisation or of the socioeconomic values of civil-military integration have been performed. It is hence very difficult to give precedence to any particular perspective and to find a balance between the different interests. Considering these challenges, the inquiry has worked on the basis the following starting points that the Swedish Government has given the mission:</p>
<p>• LFV shall continue to provide air navigation services in the upper controlled area on an exclusive basis.</p>
<p>• The system of integrated  civil-military air navigation services – both local services and those in the upper controlled airspace – shall remain in place.</p>
<p>• LFV’s operations should continue to be fully financed by charges and agreements respectively.</p>
<p>I have been able to ascertain that air navigation services are affected by several different policy areas. I have therefore chosen to highlight LFV’s operations from a public administration, competition and transport policy perspective and from a security and defence policy perspective. It has been possible however to define two main questions more precisely: 1. How shall LFV be organised in order to give the organisation the best possible prerequisites to deal with the implemented and ongoing changes in the field of air navigation services in Sweden and the EU? 2. What measures are required to ensure that the system of integrated air navigation services for civil and military aviation functions in all stages of preparedness?</p>
<p>In addition to these main questions, I have also found it necessary to review the forms of and legal support for the exercising of public authority within the framework of air navigation services and adjacent operations and to examine the public undertaking. In conclusion, I have chosen to review the definition of what is considered to constitute ‘local air traffic management services’.</p>
<h2>Air navigation services are a public undertaking</h2>
<p>Upon examination of the public undertaking, I have ascertained that en route air navigation services are a public undertaking that should be safeguarded by the Swedish state. The same is true for air navigation services adjacent to major airports with scheduled international and domestic commercial traffic. This is in line with Sweden’s undertakings under the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation and under EU legislation. Air navigation services are also of considerable importance to society and a part of the national public undertaking with regard to Sweden’s military defence.</p>
<p>One of the key aspects of my mission has been to propose measures to ensure that LFV has the best possible prerequisites for dealing with changes in the field of air navigation services that have already been and are continuing to be implemented in Sweden and the EU. I outline my proposals for LFV’s future organisation below.</p>
<h2>LFV’s deregulated operations should be reported separately</h2>
<p>As a first step, I propose that LFV’s deregulated operations be completely separated both organisationally and financially from its closed operations. In summary, I propose that the non-competitive side of LFV consist mainly of en route air navigation services and local air navigation services for military airfields, infrastructure, contingency planning, research and development and other public administration tasks.</p>
<h2>Corporatisation of LFV’s deregulated operations</h2>
<p>As a second step, I propose that LFV’s deregulated operations be corporatised but remain under the governance of the agency. I propose that operations within the Terminal business area and any other deregulated operations in other business areas be corporatised no later than 1 January 2015.</p>
<h2>LFV should be allowed to establish companies abroad</h2>
<p>An important precondition that must be satisfied before LFV can compete in the international arena is that it has the same financial prerequisites and room for manoeuvre as other market players. This includes the possibility of establishing subsidiaries in other countries. In my view, having the status of a public service company does not imply any limitations in this respect. I therefore propose that LFV be allowed to establish companies abroad within the context of its deregulated operations.</p>
<h2>Enhanced forms of integrated civil-military air navigation services</h2>
<p>My other main task has been to propose measures that would ensure the efficient functioning of the system of integrated air navigation services for civil and military aviation in all stages of preparedness. I outline my proposals for this below.</p>
<h2>Air navigation services in all stages of preparedness</h2>
<p>I can ascertain that LFV, as a central government agency, has a responsibility for air navigation services during all stages of preparedness. Considering the military function of air navigation services and the importance of LFV in satisfying the military needs, however, I feel that this responsibility needs to be further clarified. I propose that LFV’s instructions be amended to the effect that the agency is required to provide air navigation services in all stages of preparedness .</p>
<h2>LFV to have greater responsibility for contingency planning</h2>
<p>The operations of central government agencies to reduce vulnerability in society and to develop a sound capacity for fulfilling their tasks during emergency peacetime situations and states of heightened alert are regulated in the Ordinance on Emergency Preparedness and Heightened State of Alert. Certain agencies have extended responsibilities for emergency preparedness and prior to and during states of heightened alert. LFV does not currently have such extended responsibilities. I am of the opinion, however, that LFV’s operations are of such a nature that it is vital for the agency to make preparations so that it can handle both peacetime threats and risks and a state of heightened alert. I therefore propose that LFV’s responsibilities be in accordance with the abovementioned ordinance. This will involve LFV being included in the annexe to the ordinance as a government agency with extended responsebilities.</p>
<h2>Contingency planning – an obligation for all air navigation service providers</h2>
<p>Air navigation services fulfil a function that is critical to society, where there is a need for regularity and where continuous effort is required to minimise vulnerability and deal with different kinds of disturbances. The liberalisation of the market for local air traffic management services has therefore created a need for including all actors in contingency planning. It is my opinion that an air navigation service provider should be obliged to cooperate with LFV on planning and preparations for emergencies and heightened alert and I therefore propose that this obligation be incorporated into the Swedish Aviation Ordinance.</p>
<h2>Security of supply safeguarded for local air navigation services</h2>
<p>It is my assessment that air navigation services are so critical to society that they should be covered by a state undertaking. In a situation where the previous provider of air navigation services at an airport for some reason or other is no longer designated to provide such services on an exclusive basis, LFV should, at the request of the airport owner, take over air navigation service operations for a limited period. This will safeguard security of supply. The take-over of operations should be possible via a transfer of business and shall be financed by the airport owner so that LFV’s costs and required return on investment are covered. To underline this redundancy responsibility, I propose that LFV’s instructions be amended so that the agency is required to  provide air navigation services for civil and military aviation.</p>
<h2>LFV to be given the task of operating local air navigation services at military airfields</h2>
<p>I have been able to ascertain that LFV should continue to operate certain local air navigation services even after corporatisation of its deregulated operations. I have made the assessment that corporatisation requires measures to ensure that what’s left of LFV retains the capacity to perform government assignments, e.g. in the event of emergency peacetime situations or state of heightened alert. It is also a question of safeguarding adequate staffing of the Swedish</p>
<p>Armed Forces operational defence force, the arrangements for the Danish-Swedish cooperation on NUAC (Nordic Unified Airspace Traffic Control) and of ensuring it is possible to fulfil a redundancy responsibility. I therefore propose that LFV’s instructions be amended so that the agency is given the task to operate air traffic services at, and for airspace adjacent to, airfields run by the Swedish Armed Forces.</p>
<h2>Additional issues of importance to air navigation services The range of airspace adjacent to airport is limited in extent</h2>
<p>As part of my assignment, I have been able to ascertain that a general liberalisation of the air navigation services market has not become Community policy. Other cost control instruments have been chosen on the EU level. Several Member States have, however, deregulated the whole or parts of the local air navigation services market.</p>
<p>The decision and aim to deregulate the Swedish market for local air navigation services remain unchanged. I have noted however that deregulation of air navigation services in joint terminal areas may lead to different actors operating air navigation services within the same terminal area, although on an exclusive basis within the allocated sector. I consider that the risk of high transaction costs, suboptimisations and conflicts of interest in some cases are considerable when joint terminal areas are deregulated. I furthermore consider that it should be rational from an efficiency perspective to integrate air-traffic management in joint terminal areas with air-traffic management in the upper airspace, rather than with management in the control zone. My proposal is to supplement the Swedish Aviation Ordinance so that the range of the airspace adjacent to an airport is limited in extent so that other airports are not affected.</p>
<h2>An overall assessment of the need for air-traffic controller education is required</h2>
<p>In order to avoid a future lack of air-traffic controllers, it is important to ensure that there is a sufficiently large number of prospective controllers to recruit from. As a consequence of the liberalisation and the fact that there are several actors on the market, I have found that an assessment of the need for air-traffic control education is required on the national level. I therefore propose that the Swedish Transport Agency be given the task to perform such an assessment. Through its financial supervision of the cost-base for the national performance plan, the Swedish Transport Agency should ensure that the relevant costs are submitted once national performance requirements have been established.</p>
<h2>Access to infrastructure needs to be monitored</h2>
<p>All providers of local air navigation services should be offered access to the necessary infrastructure in e.g. radar information centres on equal terms. There is a need to monitor development as regards access to infrastructure, etc., and propose measures where necessary. I propose that the Swedish Transport Agency be instructed to monitor development as regards access to infrastructure, systems, methods, etc., and where necessary propose proportionate measures based on its assignment as the explicit supervisory authority.</p>
<h2>The issuing of local air-traffic controller licenses is the exercising of public authority.</h2>
<p>As part of my assignment, I have reviewed the forms and legal support for the exercising of public authority within the framework of air navigation services and adjacent operations. I can ascertain that the issuing of local licenses is a competence that is based on public law regulations and there are strong reasons for treating it as the exercising of public authority. I consider that there is a need for legal support for delegating the task of issuing local controller licenses. My proposal is that the Swedish Transport Agency be given the task of reporting on how such a regulation should be formulated.</p>
