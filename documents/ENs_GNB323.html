<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The European Social Fund, which is one of the EU’s Structural Funds, is used for measures to combat unemployment and develop human resources in working life. The Fund’s resources are allocated among the Member countries through programmes called Objectives and Community Initiatives. The commission’s work forms part of the preparations for Objective 3 and the associated Community Initiatives for the 2000–2006 programme period. Its task is to propose a focus for the next Objective 3 and Access in Sweden, a Community Initiative, as well as the shape of the new programme. Based on the experiences of the current programme period, the commission will also point to areas that should be given special attention in the new organisation for the programme.</p>
<p>Chapters one to five give an account of experience gained from the current Objectives 3 and 4, the Community Initiatives Adapt and Employment, as well as the prospects for the new programme period at EU and national levels. Chapter 6 raises a number of questions that should be given particular attention before the start of the new programme period. In the last chapter the commission presents its conclusions and proposals.</p>
<p>Focus on training</p>
<p>The commission’s proposals for the next Objective 3 concentrate largely on training in a broad sense. All proposals aim to raise the skills of the workforce and bridge the widening gap between the requirements of today’s labour market and the skills of workers. The proposals comprise six prioritised areas with a focus on occupational training. They expand on the work of the present programme period for Objectives 3 and 4, and complement these through measures aimed at removing the dividing line between the employed and the unemployed as well as at life-long learning.</p>
<p>The areas of priority proposed by the commission are:</p>
<p>§ Assistance for training, analyses of companies’ operations and the exchange of experience between companies through networks. On the whole, the proposal continues and expands on phases 1 and 3 of the current Objective 4.</p>
<p>§ Stimulating  work-related training for employees during the course of training programmes. The proposal involves co-financing the proposal for training presented in September 1998 by a working group in the Swedish Ministry of Labour consisting of union and employers’representatives.</p>
<p>§ Assistance aimed at training employees in conjunction with temporary positions, work experience, etc. for the unemployed. The proposal stresses that the regulatory system must be simple and based on the needs of businesses.</p>
<p>§ Assistance to local and regional training projects for the unemployed. These should not be centrally administered, but based on local and regional initiatives.</p>
<p>§ Integrated projects for greater equality in the implementation of aid measures.</p>
<p>§ A general programme of assistance for occupational training to local groups with simplified application procedures.</p>
<p>Co-operation between employers and unions in the preparatory work</p>
<p>The commission stresses the importance of an early start to the national process of producing a programme document for the next Objective 3. This should be begun as soon as possible after the government’s decision on the focus of the programme. The commission’s proposal is a first step in the work that leads on to a so-called Single Programme Document. The commission also stresses that the planning process must be closely co-ordinated with the national employment plan and the regional growth agreements.</p>
<p>A basic requirement for a comprehensive and well-founded programme document is that employers and unions, public authorities concerned with labour-market issues, local and regional agencies, and representatives for the social economy be given the opportunity to take an active part in the whole planning process. This requires that the process begin during spring 1999. The commission proposes that the organisations participating in the partnerships for the current Objectives 3 and 4 be invited to participate in the planning work both at central and regional levels.</p>
<p>The next objective 3 should be given a distinct identity</p>
<p>The commission has not been asked to present proposals on the organisation of the next Objective 3, but will present its views on areas in the new organisation that merit special attention. A decisive factor in building the organisation for the next Objective 3 should be the focus of the new programme. While basing the new organisation on the present organisation for Objectives 3 and 4 presents a number of problems, it is advantageous to expand on the knowledge and experience acquired in the existing organisational structures. The organisational issue is complicated by the absence of a clear national structure of public authorities dealing with work-related training. Responsibility lies with a number of different ministries and public bodies.</p>
<p>The commission presents four alternatives for the future organisation. Two these involve a continuation and development of the organisations responsible for the current Objectives 3 and 4. In different degrees, the other two alternatives involve independent authorities. The commission advocates a clear organisation that is adapted to the focus of the programme and that gives the next Objective 3 an independent character and distinct identity.</p>
<p>The commission also proposes that the organisational responsibility for Access, a Community Initiative aimed at counteracting labourmarket discrimination, be co-ordinated with the next Objective 3.</p>
<p>Irrespective of the chosen organisational alternative it is of key importance that the new authority be combined with an active partnership, which should be based on the existing partnerships for Objectives 3 and 4. In particular, the active participation of employers and unions in Objective 4 should be promoted. The commission therefore recommends that a regional partnership, which includes the social economy, constitute the advisory and administrative body at regional level. The formal decision-making process, on the other hand, should be handled by public authorities.</p>
