<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>A systemic change in the Swedish educational system occurred at the beginning of the 1990s. The principles of management by objectives and results would also apply to schools and two new national curricula were introduced – Lpo 94 for the compulsory school system and Lpf 94 for voluntary types of school. These curricula have now been in use for more than ten years and as regards compulsory schools, experience shows that the management system by objectives and results needs to be strengthened and developed to ensure that the quality of education is improved.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Inquiry on Objectives and Follow Up in Compulsory School is to create the conditions for better results by making the role of school clearer in response to, among other things, the difficulties in implementing today’s goal system, with its goals to aim for and goals to attain. One way of improving the results of compulsory schools is to state, early on in compulsory school, the achievement requirements that pupils need to fulfil. The remit of the inquiry therefore includes presenting proposals for a system in which progress checks are undertaken through the course of schooling more frequently than is the case at present. The remit also includes presenting proposals for adjusting the national curriculum to the other types of schools and activities falling under Lpo 94. To give substance to the proposals on how a new goal system should be designed, the inquiry is required to show how it can be applied to a selection of compulsory school syllabi.</p>
<h2>Problems in today’s goal system (Chapter 1)</h2>
<p>The introduction of Lpo 94 with its associated syllabi meant an enormous change for the school system. Researchers in other countries regarded Lpo 94 as a radical school reform. Management by objectives and results in schools meant not only a new way of managing the school system, but also a new method for monitoring its results. Both the national curriculum and syllabi contain educational goals expressed as goals to aim for and goals to attain. However, the grading system that was to be introduced in connection with the curriculum was altered in a subsequent Riksdag decision, after the change of government in 1994. From year 8, the grading scale uses the terms Pass, Pass with Distinction and Pass with Special Distinction.</p>
<h2>The goals</h2>
<p>Today’s goal system has had many problems from the start. One of them is that the system has not been understood by those who are to work with it, i.e., teachers and school heads. The problems involve several of the fundamental characteristics of the system, such as local and national responsibility in the use of the goals. The new goal concepts – goals to aim for and goals to attain – have meant that the number of goals in the curriculum and syllabi has become enormous. Teachers’ familiarity with all the goals and how they are to work with them is limited.</p>
<p>The links between the goals of the curriculum and the goals of the syllabi are often unclear and formulated so that they are often diffuse and therefore become difficult to work with. Two points of departure were particularly important in the National Agency for Education’s work on the curriculum before 2000. One was that the goals of the curriculum would be an integral part of the syllabi and the other, that anything related to subject content and working methods would be weeded out from syllabi. According to the preparatory material for the curriculum, the goals of the curriculum would be given substance – but not reiterated – in the syllabi. It can be concluded that, in several subjects, the goals of the curriculum have been reiterated, either completely or partially, in the syllabi and that the level of abstraction has remained unchanged. Based on evaluations and my conversations with teachers it can also be concluded that the number of goals in several of the syllabi bears no relation to teaching hours given in the timetable.</p>
<h2>The grading system</h2>
<p>The replacement of the previous relative grading system by a criteria-based system made results-based management of schools possible. The new grading system has brought the knowledge deficit of pupils out into the open. National Agency for Education statistics show that, during the period in which today’s grading system has existed, some 25 per cent of pupils have not attained a full schoolleaving certificate from compulsory school and some 10 per cent are not eligible for upper secondary school, i.e., have not achieved the Pass grade in one or more of the subjects Swedish/Swedish as a second language, English and mathematics. In many cases, pupils who would have received the lowest grades in the previous system would, in today’s grading system, not have achieved the standard of knowledge required for a Pass grade.</p>
<p>The construction of the grading system contributes, in my view, to the lack of understanding of results-based management of schools. At present, syllabus goals to attain are used as the criteria required for a Pass grade, while there are grading criteria for the rest of the grading scale. Goals to attain refer to the knowledge that all pupils are to attain and also act indirectly as “grading criteria” for the Pass grade. Since both goals and grading criteria define the level of achievement required for the different grades in the scale, management by objectives and results becomes unclear in its construction.</p>
<h2>Comments and references</h2>
<p>In government inquiries and Government Bill 1992/93:220 on the national curriculum, commentary and reference material was promised for the compulsory school curriculum and its syllabi, to explain the motives behind the goals in each of these steering documents. This supportive material has not been produced. Above all, there are no commentaries on the syllabi. This means that the syllabi have not been explained or justified and that teachers have not been informed about central government intentions for the syllabi.</p>
<h2>The syllabi</h2>
<p>Syllabus goals to aim for and goals to attain are differently designed. Goals to aim for are often more abstract in their design, but the reverse may also be true. The syllabi established in 1994 are considered to be relatively more concrete than those currently in place. The inquiry has not been able to find any documental evidence to explain this trend towards increasingly abstract syllabi. Nothing can be found in the Government’s terms of reference to the National Agency for Education to support this development.</p>
<p>The result of the work on the syllabi in 2000 was that in many cases, they lack substance and are considered to be unclear and often simply “woolly”. Imprecise and generally formulated expressions such as “develop the ability to reflect over and consciously take a position on different alternatives based on ecological thinking concerning the use of resource;” “develop the ability to formulate and work with problems concerning local, global and environmental survival issues;” “develop the ability to draw conclusions and make generalisations and to explain and argue in favour of one’s ideas and conclusions;” and “In the work process, both ethical, aesthetic and creative values are developed. Language and mathematical skills are used in concrete and meaningful contexts, where feedback is grounded in the pupil’s own actions and sense perceptions” dominate several syllabi to varying degrees. This is considered to be an unfortunate development. In future syllabi, syllabus goals should instead be understandable and subject-oriented.</p>
<h2>Work at the local level</h2>
<p>The lack of clarity and consistency in the central government message to the local level is considered to have contributed to teachers being reduced to their own solutions in their planning at the local level. Teachers have devoted an enormous amount of time to producing local syllabi and local grading criteria. No constitutional requirement or other decision by the Riksdag or the Government demands this, but in its information, the National Agency for Education states that the syllabi need to be defined locally through such expressions as “local syllabus work” and “participatory management by objectives”. Central government “signals”, such as statutory instruments and their background texts, have been saying one thing, while the National Agency for Education, referring to its own interpretation of the management system, has been saying another.</p>
<h2>National tests</h2>
<p>Within the school goal and follow-up system, national tests are a tool that can contribute to a better equivalence in assessing pupils’ knowledge. I consider that the lack of clarity in syllabi and above all the lack of subject content and commentary of the syllabi has also hindered the work of designing effective national tests. However, for many of the teachers I have met, these tests have given them the chance to see practical illustrations and examples of the levels required for different grades in the scale.</p>
<h2>Teaching materials and the products of external actors</h2>
<p>The lack of clarity of the national syllabi and lack of control over subject content have, in my view, led to schools being governed more by text books and consultant products than by syllabi. When working on local syllabi there are a number of examples – studied by the inquiry – where schools have engaged consultants marketing planning and assessment material in, for example, Swedish and mathematics. That schools use publisher products in teaching is not a problem in itself – the entire educational publishing industry is based on teachers’ assessments of what text books they consider best for their teaching. It is difficult to assess the extent to which different publishing products coincide with the goals of the national syllabi, but teaching aids containing material that conflicts with the fundamental values that schools are tasked with communicating exist, according to the Swedish National Agency for Education.</p>
<p>Since teachers are often uncertain about how syllabi should be interpreted, teaching is often dictated by the teachers’ own experiences of previous syllabi. There have been similar developments in</p>
<p>Finland. The 1994 Finnish national curriculum was relatively brief and the big variations in local curricula resulted in the introduction of a new, more detailed curriculum in 2004.</p>
<h2>Inadequate implementation</h2>
<p>Another important aspect of my analysis is that the state’s initiatives for implementing both the goal system and the grading system have failed. Insufficient knowledge on the part of teachers about the system and the steering documents that exist have primarily led to legal uncertainty for pupils. There has been no instruction, either in teachers education, school head training or teachers’ in-service training, on state systems of governance as expressed primarily in the Education Act, the national curriculum and the syllabi.</p>
<h2>To sum up</h2>
<p>To sum up, I consider that the lack of clarity on the part of the state in communicating its aims to schools has contributed to a lack of understanding of the principles of management by objectives and results. Insufficient control over the curriculum and syllabi have also contributed, in my view, to a large number of different local interpretations, which may be both positive and negative. What is positive is that the scope for interpretation at local level has probably contributed to positive developments in teaching, which has been shown, for example, from experience with pilot projects in teaching without timetables in compulsory school. What is negative is that all the various local syllabi and grading criteria have helped create such enormous differences in knowledge requirements that the equivalence of compulsory school may be called into question.</p>
<p>Somewhat drastically, my overall assessment can be summarised as follows: Goals related to norms and values in Lpo 94 have had an impact on compulsory school teaching, but it is the educational targets from Lgr 80, i.e. the 1980 syllabi or earlier curricula that have largely influenced the knowledge content of teaching.</p>
<h2>What shortcomings need to be rectified?</h2>
<p>My analysis of the reasons behind the lack of impact of today’s management system shows that there are shortcomings at all levels of the school system. The goal system as such is seen as being too complicated. The curriculum, and above all the syllabi have become too abstract, which has led to obvious difficulties for teachers who are to interpret and apply these steering documents. The state’s initiatives to “assist” the system have been inadequate – above all, there is no background material in the form of commentaries and reference material which could have guided school management and teachers. When the most recent syllabi began to apply as of autumn 2000, no implementation initiatives other than printed material and the National Agency for Education website were provided.</p>
<p>The National Agency for Education’s work on syllabi has been extensively influenced by an ideological approach with regard to the principles of management by objectives and results so that, for example, the syllabi would contain no mention of anything to do with subject content or method. In my view, there is nothing to indicate that syllabi with an explicitly stated subject content would conflict with a school system managed by objectives and results.</p>
<p>My proposals primarily aim at “rectifying” the above shortcomings.</p>
<h2>Proposals for the goal system (Chapter 2)</h2>
<h2>A change in the concept of curriculum</h2>
<p>The fact that the goals of syllabi should not reiterate those of the curriculum does not mean that the goals of the curriculum are less important. However, repetition may be seen as introducing the overall goals of the curriculum by the back door because the state had no faith in teachers’ knowledge of the curriculum’s goals. In order to make the connection between the overall goals of the curriculum and those of the syllabi clear, I propose abandoning today’s concept of a curriculum. The curriculum should, in my view, contain the overarching goals that state the values and general competencies that all pupils should have developed after completing their education at compulsory school, and define the subjectspecific competencies that are given in the syllabi comprising education at compulsory schools. If introduced, the proposal means that a curriculum refers to a steering document that corresponds to what our Nordic neighbours and other countries call a curriculum. The proposal also means reverting to the definition of a curriculum steering document that existed before Lpo 94 and that many teachers consider actually applies to today’s curriculum.</p>
<h2>The need for a revision of the curriculum</h2>
<p>According to its terms of reference, the inquiry is to propose adjustments to the curriculum as a result of the proposed changes in the goal system. However, in my view, substantial changes in the contents of today’s curriculum are required. These are considered to be so extensive that they cannot be dealt with under the terms of reference of this inquiry. It is therefore not appropriate to propose only minor adjustments to the curriculum. For this reason, only a rough outline of how the overall goals should be formulated will be given.</p>
<p>In all essentials, the overall goals should contain the basic values that are today found under the heading of Norms and values, but there should be a discussion of how the section on Knowledge should be formulated in the future. The overall goals of the curriculum should state the general competencies that all pupils should have developed when they leave compulsory school. In European cooperation, Sweden has committed itself to supporting the goals decided in the Lisbon agreement in 2000. In my view, this agreement should be reflected in the Swedish curricula. These involve pupils developing general competencies such as learning to explore, learn and work both independently and together with others and establishing the habit of independently formulating viewpoints based both on knowledge and on rational and ethical considerations.</p>
<p>With regard to subject-specific knowledge, it is logical to refer to the educational targets of the syllabi in the overall goals of the curriculum. This can be done using expressions making clear the links between the overall goals and the goals of the syllabi. At present there is, for example, a goal in the curriculum stating that after completing compulsory school, pupils must have a mastery of basic mathematical principles and be able to use them in everyday life. It is quite clear that such a knowledge objective must be given in the syllabus for mathematics and does not need to be specifically stated in the overall goals.</p>
<h2>Only one type of goal</h2>
<p>The goal system for compulsory school must be simple. Today’s system with two types of goals should, in my view, be removed. Instead, it is proposed that the syllabi should contain only one type of goal. Syllabi goals should refer to knowledge of subjects much more clearly than they do at present. The goals should therefore define the knowledge of the subject that teaching should be aimed at. Today’s reiteration of the overall curricula goals in syllabi must be avoided as far as possible.</p>
<p>The type of goal proposed should naturally not limit the development of pupils’ knowledge in the subject, but the goals of the syllabi should be realistic and adjusted to compulsory school teaching. The goals of compulsory school and those of upper secondary school should also be formulated so that together they show a progression of knowledge. Teaching at upper secondary schools should naturally be able to build further on the knowledge pupils have developed in compulsory school. Upper secondary school teaching must not become a repetition of compulsory school subjects.</p>
<h2>Subject syllabi</h2>
<p>There are several hundred different ways of formulating achievement requirements in today’s syllabi, which, in my view is not necessary. Goals should be described with a limited number of welldefined expressions specifying the knowledge that teaching in a particular subject should develop. It is important that the nuances of language in the syllabus are clear and easy to understand, which should be possible to achieve using fewer expressions than is the case at present. In order to make syllabi clearer, it is proposed that they should specify a main subject content. This means that the areas of knowledge covered by teaching in the subject should be clearly specified.</p>
<p>Syllabi should give teachers the freedom and responsibility together with pupils to plan their teaching based on local conditions and interests, but should also act as a guarantee that pupils, regardless of school, will acquire knowledge that is equivalent to that of pupils elsewhere. Here a balance must be struck in the management of teaching at schools. If syllabi are more clearly defined than they are at present, they will provide a better basis for those producing national tests, for educational publishers, etc.</p>
<h2>Syllabi should contain regulations on grading</h2>
<p>At present, syllabi and grading criteria are separate regulations, although this is not something that most people reflect on, because, for example, they are printed together in publications from the National Agency for Education. There is no objective reason for keeping them distinct and it is therefore proposed that regulations on assessments of pupils’ knowledge should be included as part of syllabi.</p>
<p>The type of goal proposed means that expressions such as “has achieved the goals” will no longer be relevant. Goals must define the knowledge at which teaching in a subject is directed. This means that knowledge requirements that describe the knowledge that pupils should be able to perform after completion of the course must be specified in other ways than those currently expressed as goals to attain. For school year 9, it may perhaps be natural to retain the concept of grading criteria as a support for setting grades. For years in which no grades are set, and that need to be comparable nationally, knowledge requirements need to be defined that correspond with today’s goals to attain. Even here, it should be possible to formulate criteria. Instead, it could be made simpler by specifying the knowledge requirement for acceptable achievement in the syllabus for the school year in question. The concept of grading criteria, in my view, should be eliminated and replaced by specific knowledge requirements for the grading scale of Pass, Pass with Distinction and Pass with Special Distinction.</p>
<p>The requirements for acceptable achievement and the various levels in the grading scale should be gathered under one heading in the syllabus, which is proposed to be called grounds for assessment. By listing goals and knowledge requirements in the syllabi, resultsbased management will also become clearer. Knowledge requirements in the syllabi are targeted at pupils but it is the school and its principal organiser that are responsible for the student fulfilling these knowledge requirements, i.e., these are the results required of the education provider.</p>
<h2>Syllabi must be supplemented with commentary material</h2>
<p>There are several factors of significance for the clarity of syllabi. Even if goals are more clearly formulated by using language and vocabulary more consistently and stringently, this is not sufficient. Statements explaining and clarifying the reasons for the goals are needed in special commentary material, including concrete examples of what a goal may entail.</p>
<p>The lack of explanation for the reasoning behind today’s syllabi and grading criteria is manifest. Future syllabi must be supplemented by comprehensive commentaries giving teachers a proper description of the ideas and motives behind the syllabus in a subject. Concrete assessment examples that give teachers support when interpreting the goals and requirements of the syllabi are needed. The state cannot govern the school system merely by giving clearer goals; its whole message must be clear. Goals, subject content, commentary material and concrete examples should together contribute to clearer state governance of the school system.</p>
<h2>Progress check points</h2>
<p>My terms of reference include presenting proposals for when progress should be checked nationally against targets, and particularly in earlier school years than is currently the case. At present, it is not before school year 5 that the syllabi define goals to attain. No national lists of goals for local planning of teaching are given for earlier school years. In instructions to the National Agency for Education in November 2006, the Government considers that a list of goals should exist for school year 3. The National Agency for Education has been instructed to formulate goals to attain for school year 3 in mathematics and Swedish, based on the present provisions.</p>
<p>In my view, there is no other early school year that is better suited to be a progress check point than school year 3. There is therefore no reason to differ from the Government and I therefore propose that school year 3 become the first occasion on which national progress checks are undertaken. I propose that the next time progress checks are made is in school year 6, in order, among other things, for there to be a suitable time period between school years 3 and 9 and because in the Budget Bill for 2007, the Government announced that grades would be given from school year 6. When this progress check is made in school year 6, the syllabi should stipulate subject content and the level of the knowledge requirement for acceptable achievement in all subjects, while in school year 3, this should primarily apply to mathematics and Swedish. If these national progress check points are introduced into compulsory school every three years, mobility for families with school age children will be facilitated since the risk of pupils studying different areas within subjects will be reduced.</p>
<p>I also consider it appropriate to make progress checks of some of the areas of knowledge in the natural sciences and social studies subject areas in school year 3, but in my view, this requires changes in the subjects offered by compulsory schools. I do not think that it should be taken for granted that the subjects now included in a block of subjects should be the same in the future. Nor should it be taken for granted that the same subjects should be taught at the early stages of compulsory school as those in later years. A review of the compulsory school curriculum is needed and in this connection, the need for possible changes in the subjects offered should be reviewed.</p>
<h2>The possibility of block grading should be removed</h2>
<p>In the natural sciences and social studies subject areas, teachers today can choose whether they want to grade by subject or by a block of subjects. Experience from this system reveals unfair consequences for pupils. In some cases, pupils can receive fewer credits on admission to upper secondary school if they have block grades, and in other cases, the reverse is true. This is why I propose that today’s option for giving block grades be removed.</p>
<h2>Proposals for the follow-up system (Chapter 3)</h2>
<p>My terms of reference include presenting proposals for adjustments to the follow-up system following my proposals for changes of the goal system. An important part of the follow-up system is the national tests. I propose obligatory national tests in Swedish, English and mathematics in the end of school year 6, above school year 9. I also propose obligatory national tests in Swedish and mathematics in the end of school year 3 to assess the pupils’ progress in knowledge. The National Agency for Education has been instructed to propose national tests in school year 3 in Swedish and mathematics, while today’s national tests in school year 5 are expected to be replaced by tests in school year 6. In order to be able to produce such tests, there must be national knowledge requirements determined for the years in which the tests are to be given. In school years 3 and 6, where no grades are given, this will with today’s grading system be a question of knowledge requirements for acceptable achievement, and in school year 9, knowledge requirements for the different grades in the scale. It has with the present syllabi been difficult to base test tasks on all pupils in a given school year having studied a given content. The proposal for a syllabus structure means that syllabi would contain details of subject content, which will make constructing the tests easier, since there will now be content on which to base the tests.</p>
<h2>National level</h2>
<p>At national level, more extensive collection of information from the national test system is considered valuable. As an example, a national collection of results from subject tests in school years 3 and 6 should comprise more schools than today’s tests in school year 5, which only comprises some 200 schools. Collection, both nationally and annually, of information about compulsory school pupils, their results in national tests and their final grades at individual level, should also be considered. This will make it easier to learn more about the different capacities of schools to achieve good results, based on the composition of their pupils.</p>
<p>The overall goals of a comprehensive curriculum should be followed up in periodical and systematic national evaluations. Our knowledge about how, and to what extent, the curriculum and syllabi are used in schools is limited, and should also be followed up in national evaluations.</p>
<h2>Municipal level</h2>
<p>Municipal follow-up of results should be improved. Every school and municipality should, in their regular quality assurance process, analyse and document how successful they have been in achieving the national knowledge requirements. The results of the improved national follow-up may provide support in this work.</p>
<h2>School level</h2>
<p>A systematic follow-up of the results at every school is a necessary element of management by objectives and results. Local follow-up is essential to be able to take remedial measures and to use resources better so as to improve results. This should be undertaken by different means. For school years where no nationally stipulated knowledge requirement is given, teachers and principals can agree on a suitable standardisation of form and content in the background material for development dialogues. This will make it possible, at school level, and perhaps also at the level of those responsible for the school, to obtain comprehensive documentation that can be used for analyses and conclusions on the development of pupils’ knowledge in relation to the goals of all subjects and school years. With regard to the results of the national tests and grades set, I regard it as self-evident that every principal takes the initiative for a systematic follow-up.</p>
<p>National tests should govern grading more extensively than is the case at present. The current substantial disparities between test results and grades set can be questioned. This is why teachers should be able to explain the reasons for the grade they have given and to show evidence to support this, such as how the grade has been affected by and are related to the results of the national test. This is a question that should be considered in the ongoing work at the Ministry of Education and Research on a new Education Act. A further means of improving the standards of knowledge assessment may be for two teachers – the person teaching the student, and a co-assessor – to cooperate when correcting the tests, which already takes place on a voluntary basis today.</p>
<h2>1.1 Other Lpo 94 activities and the connection with Lpf 94 (Chapter 4)</h2>
<p>My terms of reference include analysing the consequences for all organisations covered by Lpo 94, i.e., the compulsory school system, other compulsory school forms, pre-school classes and leisure-time centres. Consideration must be given to the needs of these types of school and activities in the proposals.</p>
<h2>Education for pupils with learning disabilities</h2>
<p>In view of the limited supporting information existing when the Government decided, in Government Bill 1992/93:220 on the curriculum, that education for pupils with learning disabilities should have their own syllabi, I consider that a more detailed review is required of how the need for syllabi can best be provided for. Are there to be special syllabi for education for pupils with learning disabilities or can compulsory school syllabi apply, provided that account is taken of the individual student’s learning disability? The grading system also needs to be examined, as well as needs for syllabi for education for children with severe learning disabilities. One means of testing whether it would work to have the same syllabi for schools for pupils with learning disabilities and compulsory schools is to start a pilot project. Such a pilot project requires, however, special regulations on how to apply compulsory school syllabi; for example, how individual account of the varying abilities of pupils is to be taken.</p>
<p>A comprehensive curriculum is proposed for compulsory school, containing both overall goals and syllabi. For similar reasons, a comprehensive curriculum for education for pupils with learning disabilities could be considered. The overall goals of compulsory school can largely be the same for schools for pupils with learning disabilities. The special goals that currently apply to education for pupils with learning disabilities in Lpo 94 could be integrated into a possible curriculum for education for pupils with learning disabilities. Like compulsory school, education for pupils with learning disabilities should be able to have a comprehensive curriculum containing syllabi or a similar steering document. An alternative would be for the syllabi of education for pupils with learning disabilities to be included in a comprehensive curriculum for compulsory school. Which alternative is selected depends on the results of a possible inquiry on the need for special syllabi for education for pupils with learning disabilities. I do not consider that my remit includes producing a basis for taking a position between these alternatives, and am therefore not presenting any proposals.</p>
<h2>Special schools for pupils with impaired hearing</h2>
<p>My proposal for a goal structure for compulsory school could also apply to special schools. The subjects that differ from those of compulsory school, i.e. sign language and movement and drama, are considered to be of such a nature that they can be compared with language and music and can therefore have syllabi based on the same principles that I propose for compulsory school. My proposal for a changed curriculum concept could also apply to special schools. Account should be taken of the present goal to attain in special schools for pupils with impaired hearing in Lpo 94, i.e., that pupils are bilingual and can communicate in writing in English, in the curriculum revision considered necessary for compulsory school.</p>
<h2>Sami school</h2>
<p>My proposal for a changed curriculum concept could also apply to Sami school. A curriculum revision should take account of today’s goal to attain in the Sami school in Lpo 94, i.e., that each pupil who has attended the Sami school should have a deep knowledge of the Sami cultural heritage and can speak, read and write the Sami language. Similarly, it should be possible to apply the syllabi set up for compulsory school to Sami school from this point on. The syllabus established by the National Agency for Education in Sami could, in my view, be revised along the same principles as in my proposals for compulsory school syllabi.</p>
<h2>Pre-school classes and leisure-time centres</h2>
<p>The vague management of pre-school classes and leisure-time centres in Lpo 94 is manifest. Although my terms of reference do not include proposals for changes in the curriculum in terms of contents, there is reason to point at the need for special written material that defines more clearly the role, purpose and contents of preschool classes and leisure-time centres. Such a reform can simultaneously provide better opportunities to evaluate the quality and results of these activities than there are today.</p>
<h2>Upper secondary school</h2>
<p>An inquiry chair was appointed on 1 February 2007, tasked with presenting proposals for a future structure for programmes at upper secondary school (ToR 2007:8). The inquiry is to present proposals on the programmes and branches that should be offered at upper secondary schools. The remit of the inquiry is considered to be so extensive and so radical that it seems inappropriate on my part to discuss the adjustments to Lpf 94 that may be necessary.</p>
<p>With regard to the contents of the curricula concerning norms and values and other goals and guidelines, there are a number of common issues. It should be possible to implement my proposals on principles with regard to Lpo 94 in the upper secondary school curriculum as well. This applies, for example, to general skills goals and the need for a comprehensive curriculum for the compulsory school. The fundamental points of departure for the proposal for a changed structure in compulsory school syllabi could also apply to upper secondary school syllabi. This is a matter, for example, of ensuring that syllabi at upper secondary schools contain a section describing a main subject content. In conclusion, it is considered inappropriate to propose adjustments on a more detailed level with regard to the goal documents of upper secondary school.</p>
