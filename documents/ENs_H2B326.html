<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>In its report, the Inquiry presents background material for assessing whether Sweden should accede to the Protocol of 3 June 1999 for the Modification of the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF 1999) of 9 May 1980. The Inquiry also presents proposals for the legislative amendments that such an accession requires.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes amendments and additions to the International Railway Transport Act (1985:193) and the Railways Act (2004:519). The Inquiry also proposes additions to the Railways Ordinance.</p>
<h2>Accession to COTIF 1999</h2>
<p>Sweden should accede to COTIF 1999</p>
<p>Sweden has long participated in international cooperation regarding railways and has acceded to COTIF 1980. The modification protocol has been signed by Sweden. On the whole, Sweden considers the revised Convention to be satisfactory. Much of what Sweden does in the area of railways is governed by the deeper cooperation in the EU. The EU itself has become a member of OTIF and acceded to the Protocol on 1 July 2011. Parts of COTIF 1999 are already part of Swedish legislation in that the Railway Passenger Regulation is applied, and that regulation incorporates large parts of CIV (appendix A of COTIF 1999). In effect, since 12 January 2007 Sweden has also applied RID (appendix C) as worded in COTIF 1999. This follows from</p>
<p>October 2007 on rail passengers’ rights and obligations.</p>
<p>Sweden’s obligations under the Council’s Directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by rail. However, Sweden cannot fully participate in the RID Committee of Experts until Sweden accedes to COTIF 1999.</p>
<p>In light of the above, the Inquiry considers that there are very compelling reasons for Sweden to accede to the Protocol of 3 June 1999 for the Modification of the Convention concerning International Carriage by Rail (COTIF) of 9 May 1980. The Inquiry proposes that Sweden should accede to the Protocol.</p>
<p>Sweden should accede without reservations</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that there are no reasons for Sweden to make reservations to COTIF 1999 and, accordingly, that Sweden should accede without reservations. Furthermore, the Inquiry considers that Sweden should not introduce exemptions for its own citizens or aliens habitually resident in Sweden from application of the regulations on the carrier’s liability in case of death of, or personal injury to, passengers (Article 2 CIV). Nor should Sweden make use of the corresponding possibility of exemptions in CUI (Article 2).</p>
<p>CIV and CIM services</p>
<p>Under Article 24(1) of the Convention, a Member State has the option of reporting certain maritime services to the SecretaryGeneral of OTIF. These services are then included in a CIV or CIM list. As a result of including a service on a list, the CIV or CIM also becomes applicable to a maritime service connected to a railway transport. However, this presupposes that the transport service as a whole is of an international nature and is the subject of a single contract (Article 1(3), CIV and Article 1(4) CIM). This may concern rail-ferry services in which entire railway vehicles with passengers or goods are transported, or rail-ferry services that only transport passengers or goods.</p>
<p>Sweden has already reported a number of CIV and CIM services under COTIF 1980. The Inquiry considers that there is nothing to indicate that these services should not be reported under COTIF 1999. Therefore, in connection with accession, Sweden should report certain maritime services as CIV and CIM services in accordance with Article 24(1) of the Convention. The Government or the authority designated by the Government shall inform OTIF which services are to be added and deleted from each list.</p>
<h2>Transposition of COTIF 1999 into Swedish law</h2>
<p>Incorporation into International Railway Transport Act</p>
<p>When transposing an international convention, Sweden can choose between incorporating or transforming it. The Inquiry considers that on balance, there are arguments in favour of incorporation. The Inquiry therefore proposes that the primary method of transposing COTIF 1999 into Swedish law should be incorporation.</p>
<p>The International Railway Transport Act (1985:193) will be amended so that it incorporates COTIF 1999 with the appendices CIV, CIM, CUV and CUI (A, B, D and E). The same applies to the provisions concerning lodging of security, execution of judgments, attachment, periods of limitation and enforcement in Articles 11, 12 and 32 of the Convention. All these provisions are regulations directed at individuals and public authorities. They must therefore be transposed into Swedish law. Previously, corresponding provisions had been transformed into Swedish legislation (the current Section 4 of the International Railway Transport Act). However, EU law (the Brussels I Regulation ) is to be applied with regard to these provisions. It is therefore the assessment of the Inquiry that the procedural law provisions of COTIF 1999 should no longer be transformed. The Inquiry considers that transposition of these provisions should be accomplished by means of incorporation.</p>
<p>The entire Convention text in the French and English versions is to be included as an annex to the International Railway</p>
<p>Transport Act. As previously, a Swedish translation is to be published together with the English and French versions of the Convention text. In the event of conflicts, the French version shall prevail.</p>
<p>Incorporation into the Railways Act and ordinances</p>
<p>Appendix ATMF (G) will be incorporated by means of an amendment to the Railways Act (2004:519), while appendix APTU (F) will be incorporated by means of an amendment to the Railways Ordinance (2004:526). In connection with this, a possibility will be introduced in the Railways Act for the Government or the authority designated by the Government to announce regulations on such technical standards and prescriptions, and such technical admission of railway material, as are referred to in APTU and ATMF.</p>
<p>Appendix RID (C) will be incorporated by means of an amendment to the Ordinance on the transport of dangerous goods (2006:311) so that the definition refers to RID in COTIF 1999.</p>
<p>Other changes</p>
<p>Article 30(2) of CIV and Article 14(2) of CUI state that damages for lost maintenance and loss of income, and increases in living costs, in connection with personal injuries, are to be determined in accordance with national law. However, such damages may not be set below 175 000 Special Drawing Rights (SDR).</p>
<p>Damages for such injuries in Swedish law are currently unlimited. However, the Inquiry considers it reasonable to set a monetary limit. A new provision will therefore be introduced into the International Railway Transport Act. The monetary limit regarding damages for loss of maintenance in connection with a death, and loss of income in connection with a personal injury, will be set at SDR 400 000 per person when applying Article 30(2) of CIV and 14(2) of CUI in Swedish law. This is an adjustment to what will apply in the maritime area law.</p>
<p>Furthermore, one provision of the Convention will be transposed by means of transformation. This concerns the provision on Special Drawing Rights. Provisions on Special Drawing Rights are already applied in that the Railway Passenger Regulation, which in turn transposed this provision in CIV, is applied. For this reason alone, there is cause to clarify in Swedish law what is meant by ‘Special Drawing Rights’.</p>
<p>Other provisions of the Convention are aimed at the State or regulate OTIF as an organisation. There is therefore no reason to transpose them into Swedish law.</p>
<p>Future amendments to COTIF 1999</p>
<p>In general, international agreements are adopted and amended at a diplomatic conference. For this kind of agreement or amendment to be binding on an individual State, some form of declaration of intent (ratification or the equivalent) by that State’s government is usually required. In addition, in Sweden, the Riksdag must approve the agreement or amendment if this requires the amendment or abrogation of Swedish law, or the enactment of a new law (Chapter 10, Article 3 of the Instrument of Government).</p>
<p>Some international agreements, including COTIF 1999, contain provisions on a simplified amendment procedure. The contracting States can adopt amendments to COTIF 1999 by means of majority decision. For Sweden, the simplified procedure previously meant that it was difficult to transfer an adopted amendment into Swedish law in time, as the Riksdag first had to decide whether Sweden would lodge an objection to the adopted amendment and thereafter consider the issue of transposing the amendments.</p>
<p>In light of this, Section 3a was introduced into the International Railway Transport Act, pursuant to the current Chapter 10, Article 9 of the Instrument of Government. Under the provision in the Instrument of Government, in issues regarding an international agreement that has been transposed into Swedish law by means of incorporation, the Riksdag may prescribe that future amendments to the agreement will apply automatically in Sweden.</p>
<p>So as not to complicate the process concerning future amendments, the Inquiry proposes that amendments to CIV, CIM, CUV, CUI and ATMF (appendixes A, B, D, E and G) that the Revision Committee adopts are to apply automatically here in Sweden.</p>
<p>Regarding APTU and RID, it is proposed that these appendixes be transposed into Swedish law via ordinances, which means it is not necessary to submit them to the Riksdag and thus the issue of early incorporation is not relevant.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>The proposed provisions presuppose accession to COTIF 1999. As it is not possible to predict when, exactly, Sweden will accede to the Convention, the Inquiry proposes that the new provisions enter into force on the date determined by the Government.</p>
<p>Regarding transport begun before entry into force, the Inquiry proposes that older provisions are to be applied. The Inquiry does not consider that any other transitional provisions are necessary.</p>
