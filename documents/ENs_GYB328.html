<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Technology Delegation was instructed by the Government to encourage greater interest in mathematics, natural sciences, technology and ICT. During the inquiry, the Delegation has conducted outreach work, implemented the ‘The Broad Line’ campaign, published background reports, organised a large number of conferences and roundtable talks, and taken an active role in the media and debates.</p>
<p>The work of the Technology Delegation has been guided by the following vision of the future:</p>
<p>• A Sweden that has a strong competitive advantage in the global knowledge economy and a stable national labour market.</p>
<p>• A Sweden that tackles the major common challenges ahead, e.g. in the areas of environment, demography and infrastructure.</p>
<p>• A Sweden that gives all citizens the skills required to understand and take advantage of opportunities, and to influence developments in a complex and technically advanced society.</p>
<p>This vision calls for very high levels of skill in mathematics, natural sciences, technology and ICT, both in the labour market and in everyday life. The Technology Delegation’s inquiry shows that currently, Sweden is poorly equipped to live up to these ambitions.</p>
<p>The problems that the Technology Delegation has identified are considerable. Student interest in specialising in science and technology is still too low. This poses a threat to future cuttingedge expertise. Under even greater threat are the wide-ranging skills that all citizens need. These should be secured through the school system.</p>
<p>The problems are complex, as their root causes can be found in the crisis of confidence that is currently affecting natural sciences and technology among young people throughout the western</p>
<p>world. Many young people seek relevance to societal issues and personal identity in their choice of education and career, but find it difficult to recognise these aspects in mathematics, natural sciences, technology and ICT. The problem is aggravated by the fact that the school system lacks the ability to harness the fundamental interest that most children and young people have; nor does the school system develop to a sufficient level the skills that everyone needs. We are now seeing the consequences in the form of declining pupil performance.</p>
<p>As regards the school system, the Technology Delegation has highlighted in particular that leadership, monitoring, teacher education and continuing education for teachers are not currently working for mathematics, natural sciences, and, in particular, technology. These subjects are extremely under-dimensioned in teacher education, despite the fact that the needs of schools are great. In their operations, far too few school authorities take their responsibility to strengthen these areas. The national resource centres that support subject development have limited resources and mandates.</p>
<p>The Technology Delegation also stresses that the link between school and higher education is weak. Higher education currently has a recruitment base that is much too small, as too few pupils leave upper secondary school with the appropriate entry qualifications and prior knowledge to go on to study in these fields. In some educational programmes, uneven gender distribution is a serious problem. The challenges facing higher education are many, and the knowledge standards required are rising apace with changes in society and the labour market. At the same time, there is a lack of coherent support structures at central level to develop teaching.</p>
<p>To overcome these problems, coordinated, long-term and broad efforts are needed that enjoy the full support of the municipalities, the business sector, stakeholder organisations and other key actors. Based on both Sweden’s host of problems and other comparable countries’ experiences, the Technology Delegation has presented a model for how future efforts should be planned.</p>
<p>The Technology Delegation proposes that the Government establish a national skills strategy for mathematics, natural sciences, technology and ICT, which should aim to increase interest and improve the level of knowledge in these areas. The strategy’s priority objectives should be that by 2020:</p>
<p>• all pupils at compulsory school have access to relevant technology teaching</p>
<p>• the Swedish results in all PISA and TIMSS studies are in the upper quartile in both mathematics and natural sciences</p>
<p>• the share of pupils completing a natural sciences or technology upper secondary school programme is at least 30 per cent</p>
<p>• the share of pupils beginning an engineering programme at higher education level is at least 10 per cent per age cohort</p>
<p>• the gender distribution in engineering programmes at higher education level is even (within the range of  40–60 per cent).</p>
<p>To achieve these objectives, the strategy should target the areas of teacher qualifications, teaching in schools, the transition between school and higher education, teaching at higher education institutions and collaboration and dialogue with society.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Technology Delegation proposes that the Government appoint and lead a national commission with a special focus on Sweden’s development in mathematics, natural sciences, technology and ICT. This commission should be responsible for the strategy, monitor its different parts, promote efforts at political level and mobilise the key actors that can make a contribution.</p>
<p>The Technology Delegation also proposes a number of initiatives relating to school, society and higher education that the Government should adopt and finance in the first stage of strategic work. These are:</p>
<p>• Technology and Science Municipalities</p>
<p>• Recruitment campaign for the new teacher education programmes</p>
<p>• Targeted continuing education for teachers and study and careers counsellors</p>
<p>• Shortened teacher education programmes for people with specialist subject knowledge</p>
<p>• Development of teaching in schools</p>
<p>• Marketing initiatives, such as ‘The Broad Line’</p>
<p>• Collaboration between schools and working life</p>
<p>• Initiatives and projects</p>
<p>• Transition between school and higher education</p>
<p>• Development of teaching in higher education institutions</p>
<p>To implement the strategy, the Technology Delegation proposes that the Government set up a Platform for Technology and Science with responsibility for coordination, allocation of funds, communication and analysis. The work should be conducted in partnership with the actors currently involved in these issues.</p>
<p>Finally, the Technology Delegation wishes to take a number of standpoints relating to current education policy reforms. Most of these have been communicated by the Technology Delegation in the course of its inquiry. They include:</p>
<p>• reforming the technical and natural sciences upper secondary programmes so that more pupils meet the entry requirements for higher education in these areas;</p>
<p>• reforming technology as a subject in compulsory school so as to strengthen its relevance and scientific basis;</p>
<p>• more stringent qualification requirements for teachers, including the requirement that they have both specialised knowledge of the subject and teaching skills;</p>
<p>• reforming teacher education so that future teachers have the necessary skills in mathematics, natural sciences, technology and ICT.</p>
