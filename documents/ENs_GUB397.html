<p>The assignment</p>
<p>On 26 October 2005, the Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council Directive on cross-border mergers of limited liability companies was adopted. The Directive regulates mergers between companies registered in different European Member States and is to be transposed into Swedish law no later than 15 December 2007.</p>
<p>Our task has been to propose how the provisions on reporting information to employees in Article 7 of the Directive and on the participation rights of employees in Article 16 thereof are to be transposed into Swedish law. A project is ongoing within the Swedish Ministry of Justice and the Swedish Ministry of Finance aimed at drawing up proposals for how the other sections of the Directive are to be transposed into Swedish law.</p>
<p>The Swedish Board Representation (Private Sector Employees) Act (1987:1245) only applies to employees working in Sweden. In addition to the transposition of the Directive, we have also been tasked to investigate whether the provisions on board representation should also apply to the foreign-based affiliates of Swedish enterprises.</p>
<p>The Directive</p>
<p>Article 7 of the Directive contains provisions obliging the management or similar administrative organ of any company participating in a merger to draw up a special report. This report shall explain both the legal and financial aspects that have been taken into consideration when determining the terms of the merger and the likely implications of the merger for members, creditors and employees. It shall be made available to the members or the repre-</p>
<p>sentatives of the employees, or, where there are no such representatives, to the employees themselves not less than a month before the general meeting that will decide on the terms of the merger.</p>
<p>Under Article 16, the company resulting from the cross-border merger is subject to the rules in force concerning employee participation, if any, in the Member State where it has its registered office. One of the main points in the Directive is that employee rights shall be protected in the event of a merger. To ensure that this main principle does not lead to the loss of or reduction in participation rights, the Directive sets out certain exceptions to it. The rules in force concerning employee participation in the Member State where the company has its registered office shall not apply:</p>
<p>‒ if they provide for a lower level of participation than the highest level in any of the companies concerned,</p>
<p>‒ if they do not provide for the same participation rights for employees in affiliates in other Member States as for the employees in the Member State where the company resulting from the merger has its registered office, or</p>
<p>‒ if one of the participating companies is of a certain size (more than 500 employees) and is covered by the rules on participation.</p>
<p>In the event of the rules in the Member State where the company resulting from the merger has its registered office not being applicable, the Directive specifies what shall apply instead. In this respect, the Directive often refers to the provisions in the Directive supplementing the Statute for a European company with regard to the involvement of employees (the SE Directive). One difference is however that the Directive on cross-border mergers does not regulate employee involvement in the form of information and consultation but only as regards participation.</p>
<p>The rules in the SE Directive, referred to in our directive, basically imply the following:</p>
<p>Employee participation rights shall be determined in negotiations between a negotiating body, consisting of representatives of the employees affected by the merger, and the companies participating in the merger.</p>
<p>The places on the negotiating body shall be allocated among the employees in the various Member States in proportion to the number of employees in each state. Appointees to these places are to be</p>
<p>regulated at the national level. The states shall however as far as possible ensure the inclusion of employee representatives from each participating company that has employees in the Member State in question. Company managements and the negotiating body are therefore expected to negotiate an agreement, according to which the parties shall discuss certain points. In accordance with the main principle, the negotiation delegation takes decisions by absolute majority. A qualified majority is needed for certain decisions, however.</p>
<p>Negotiations may continue for a maximum of six months unless the parties decide to extend the period for a further six months. If no agreement can be reached, the directive includes standard rules for participation, which stipulate what shall apply instead. Under the standard rules, employees have participation rights equal to the highest proportion of existing participation in any of the participating companies.</p>
<p>The Directive on cross-border mergers contains some provisions that deviate from the regulations laid down in the SE Directive.</p>
<p>One such provision is that the authorised representatives of the participating companies may choose to forego negotiations and instead apply the standard rules for participation as they are worded in the national legislation of the country where the company resulting from the cross-border merger is to have its registered office.</p>
<p>Another provision is that the negotiating body may decide not to open negotiations or terminate negotiations already open and instead follow the applicable participation rules in the country where the company has its registered office. A qualified majority is needed to take such a decision.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is special protection to ensure that the provisions in the Directive are not circumvented. It must be ensured that the employees do not lose their participation rights in the event of a new domestic merger occurring within three years of the cross-border merger coming into force.</p>
<p>Our proposal</p>
<p>Information to employees (Article 7)</p>
<p>We propose that the employer's obligation to inform in Article 7 of the Directive be transposed through provisions in the various acts governing the right of association that are intended to regulate the content of the report mentioned in the Article.</p>
<p>The proposals which the Ministry of Justice will put forward relating to the transposition of sections in the directive relating to the right of association are expected to cover new paragraphs in the Swedish Companies Act and the Swedish Cooperative Societies Act pertaining to information to shareholders or members. Similar proposals for provisions are expected to be included in the proposal being drawn up by the Ministry of Finance concerning financial companies. We propose that these provisions highlight the fact that the report referred to in the Directive must be drawn up as well as stipulate what it shall contain. We also propose that these provisions clarify the fact that the report must be made available to the representatives of the employees, or where there are no such representatives, the employees themselves, not less than one month before the date of the general meeting at which the merger plan shall be decided on.</p>
<p>Employee participation (Article 16)</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Article 16 mostly contains references to provisions laid down in the SE Directive, which has been transposed into Swedish law by means of the Act (2004:559) on the involvement of employees in European companies.</p>
<p>A point of departure for our work has therefore been that if our directive prescribes provisions that directly correspond to those in the Act on the involvement of employees in European companies, the provisions in the legislation we are proposing shall, as far as possible, have the same wording.</p>
<p>A new act on employee participation in conjunction with cross-border mergers</p>
<p>We propose that Article 16 shall be transposed into Swedish law by means of a new act regulating employee participation in conjunction with cross-border mergers.</p>
<p>This act shall apply to cross-border mergers if the employees in any of the companies participating in the merger are covered by the provisions on participation. It shall also apply if an acquiring company participates in a merger with a Swedish company within three years of the cross-border merger taking place. To a great extent, this act follows the same structure as the Act on the involvement of employees in European companies.</p>
<p>Employees' negotiation delegation</p>
<p>Under our proposal, an employees' negotiation delegation shall always be established. Most of the provisions that we are proposing concerning the negotiation delegation correspond to provisions laid down in the Act on the involvement of employees in European companies.</p>
<p>For a negotiation delegation to be established, the participating companies must take certain necessary measures as soon as possible. They shall inter alia submit information to employee representatives on the names and number of employees in the participating companies, concerned subsidiaries and affiliates. They shall also inform as to whether they intend to apply the standard rules for participation without prior negotiation.</p>
<p>The negotiation delegation shall be established no later than ten weeks after the participating companies have fulfilled their obligations. The delegation's main task is to represent the employees concerned in participation agreement negotiations.</p>
<p>The provisions in the proposal relating to the allocation of places on the negotiation delegation, its representative capacity and how the members in the Swedish establishments are to be appointed, correspond directly to provisions in the Act on the involvement of employees in European companies.</p>
<p>The employees in each EEA state shall be allocated a permanent place on the negotiation delegation for each whole tenth or part thereof they make up of the entire workforce in the participating</p>
<p>companies, concerned subsidiaries and affiliates in all EEA states. Moreover, the employees in the various Member States shall also be allocated extra places on the negotiation delegation if necessary so that at least one employee representative is appointed in each participating company put forward for closure as part of the crossborder merger.</p>
<p>If the number of employees significantly changes or other alterations are made to the company's structure that affect how the places on the negotiation delegation are allocated among the employees in the various Member States, these places must be reallocated.</p>
<p>The permanent places on the negotiation delegation allocated to employees in Sweden shall firstly be allocated among the employees in the participating companies in Sweden on a sliding scale according to the number of employees in the companies with one place per company and thereafter, should there be places left, among the employees in concerned subsidiaries and affiliates according to the same principle. Any places still remaining shall be allocated jointly among the employees in participating companies and concerned subsidiaries and affiliates, again on a sliding scale depending on the number of employees.</p>
<p>If the local employee organisations that are to appoint members from Sweden are in agreement on a different allocation of the permanent places, this allocation shall apply instead. In such a case, the companies shall, in their agreement ensure that, as far as possible, the employees at each participating company are allocated a place.</p>
<p>The extra places on the negotiation delegation that may be allocated to employees in Sweden are, under the proposal, to be allocated among employees in Swedish companies that have been put forward for closure as part of the merger. This shall also be done on a sliding scale depending on the number of employees in the companies. The places are only to be allocated among employees in companies that have not received permanent places.</p>
<p>Members from Sweden on the negotiation delegation shall primarily be appointed by the local employee organisation/s in Sweden that are bound by collective agreements in relation to the participating companies, concerned subsidiaries or affiliates in Sweden. If there are several local employee organisations bound by collective agreements, the rules governing the election of employee representatives as laid down in the Swedish Board Representation Act apply. If there is no organisation bound by a collective agree-</p>
<p>ment, the members shall be appointed by the local employee organisation that represents the largest number of employees in the companies and affiliates in Sweden. All this applies in the event of the local employee organisations failing to agree on a different arrangement. If there are no union-affiliated members, the members on the negotiation delegation are appointed by the employees in the companies and affiliates in Sweden.</p>
<p>Negotiations</p>
<p>According to our proposal, negotiations on a participation agreement in the acquiring company shall be opened as soon as the negotiation delegation has been established. The negotiating period is supposed to be six months but the parties may jointly extend it to up to one year. If the deadline of ten weeks for the establishment of a negotiation delegation is exceeded as a result of reasons assignable to the employees, the negotiating period will begin when the deadline has been exceeded.</p>
<p>The negotiation delegation may appoint experts to assist it in its work. These experts may attend the negotiations when appropriate in order to promote uniformity and consistency at the European level.</p>
<p>Under the Directive, negotiations don't always have to be held. The proposal therefore also contains a provision that provides scope for the participating companies to decide not to negotiate on a participation agreement but instead directly apply the standard rules on participation.</p>
<p>Moreover, the negotiation delegation may decide not to open negotiations on a participation agreement in the acquiring company. It may also decide to terminate negotiations already opened. If the negotiation delegation takes a decision of this nature, the Board Representation Act shall instead be applied in the acquiring company.</p>
<p>Agreements</p>
<p>In accordance with the directive, rules governing the form and content of a participation agreement are laid down in the legislative proposal. The agreement shall be in writing and shall deal with</p>
<p>certain specified points. There is, however, no requirement for the parties to agree on all the points.</p>
<p>Similar to the wording of the Act on the involvement of employees in European companies, we propose that the opinion supported by an absolute majority of the negotiation delegation's members shall constitute the delegation's decision on condition that the members also represent an absolute majority of the employees.</p>
<p>Approval of a draft agreement, which constitutes a reduction in the proportion of members in the acquiring company's board in relation to what has previously been the case for the employees in the participating companies with the highest degree of participation, requires in some cases a qualified majority. A qualified majority is also required for a decision to forego negotiations on a participation agreement.</p>
<p>When are the standard rules to apply?</p>
<p>Under our proposal, the standard rules shall apply:</p>
<p>‒ if the parties agree to apply them,</p>
<p>‒ if an agreement that fulfils the formal legislative requirements has not been reached upon expiry of the negotiating period and the negotiation delegation has not foregone negotiations on such an agreement, or</p>
<p>‒ if the participating companies choose to apply the standard rules directly without prior negotiation.</p>
<p>According to the directive, participation can take two main forms. The first gives the employees the right to select or appoint members to any body in the company. The second gives the employees the right to recommend candidates or oppose existing candidates.</p>
<p>If different forms of participation exist in the bodies of the participating companies, we propose, similar to the rules governing European companies, that the negotiation delegation shall be allowed to decide which form of participation is to be introduced in the acquiring company. If the negotiation delegation does not take such a decision, the participating companies may instead decide which form of participation is to be introduced in the acquiring company.</p>
<p>Under our proposal, the employees' right to elect, appoint, recommend or oppose the appointment of a number of members in the acquiring company, in accordance with the main principle, shall be equal to the highest proportion of employee participation in force in any of the participating companies before registration. Here, however, we have chosen to use the scope for limitation given in the directive. If the standard rules are to be applied subsequent to prior negotiations, employees shall not have the right to more members on the board than is equal to one third of the number of members on the board.</p>
<p>The standard rules for participation in the SE Directive presuppose that there is a special body responsible for implementing the participation provisions in practice. In the Act on the involvement of employees in European companies, this body is called the employees' council. The fact that the directive on cross-border mergers does not contain provisions on the establishment of such a body has been a problem for our inquiry. Our proposal is that the negotiation delegation, in addition to its tasks in accordance with the directive, shall also take care of participation issues which, under the Act on the involvement of employees in European companies, shall be handled by the employees' council.</p>
<p>The most important task for the negotiation delegation in this context is to decide how the places for employee representatives on the board of the acquiring company are to be allocated among members who represent employees from different states. Places shall be allocated in proportion to the number of employees in the acquiring company, its subsidiaries and affiliates employed in each EEA state. If the employees in all states are not represented, one place shall be excluded and allocated in a certain way. Moreover, the negotiation delegation shall appoint members to the places on the board, that have been allocated among the employees in different states, in the event of an EEA state not having national regulations governing the selection of employee members to the board or other company body.</p>
<p>According to the proposal, the members that will occupy the places on a company body allocated to employees in Sweden shall be appointed using the same procedure provided for under the Act on the involvement of employees in European companies, i.e. by the local employee organisations in Sweden, in the same way as they appoint members to the negotiation delegation. The employee</p>
<p>organisations may agree to delegate this task to the negotiation delegation, however.</p>
<p>When employee participation consists of the right to recommend or oppose the appointment of members to the board, the negotiation delegation decides which candidates are to be recommended or opposed.</p>
<p>Employee representatives on the board shall have the same rights and obligations as other board members who represent shareholders or association members. Certain disqualification rules are also proposed that have the same wording as those provided for under the Act on the involvement of employees in European companies.</p>
<p>Certain other provisions</p>
<p>Similar to the provisions of the Act on the involvement of employees in European companies, we propose that the negotiation delegation be a legal entity of its own and that the costs for its activities be met by the company. We also propose a confidentiality clause and a rule implying that some of the provisions in the Trade Union Representatives Act be applicable to employee representatives operating in Sweden and who carry out tasks in accordance with the proposed act.</p>
<p>When a European company is established, the negotiation delegation is normally dissolved and an employees' council set up. This is not the case under our directive. Our legislative proposal therefore includes a provision under which the negotiation delegation ceases to exist as a legal entity when it has carried out its tasks in accordance with the proposed act.</p>
<p>As a result of the negotiation delegation under our proposal having also been given the tasks that, under the SE directive, are incumbent on the employees' council, the negotiation delegation may continue to be needed after the merger process is complete. We therefore propose that it should be possible to re-establish the negotiation delegation when new employee representatives are to be elected, appointed, recommended or opposed.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we propose that financial damages be the sanctions to be imposed following violation of the act and that cases concerning the application of the act shall be dealt with in accordance with the Labour Disputes (Judicial Procedure) Act with the Swedish Labour Court as the first instance.</p>
<p>Participation rights over and above the requirements of the directive</p>
<p>In addition to transposing both the articles in the Directive into Swedish law, we have also been tasked to investigate whether Swedish provisions on board representation should apply more generally to the foreign-based affiliates of Swedish enterprises.</p>
<p>Extending the scope of the act in this manner could be achieved in a variety of ways. We have considered the following options:</p>
<p>‒ to propose an amendment to the Board Representation Act so that it covers employees at  foreign-based affiliates of Swedish enterprises,</p>
<p>‒ to allow the proposed act on employee participation in crossborder mergers to apply generally to Swedish companies with  foreign-based activities, and</p>
<p>‒ to propose an entirely new act to achieve board representation for employees of Swedish enterprises that conduct activities in  foreign-based affiliates.</p>
<p>As far as the Board Representation Act is concerned, we have ascertained that its wording is so deeply rooted in the Swedish model of employee representation as to make it very difficult to adapt to foreign conditions.</p>
<p>Neither have we found the extension of the proposed act on employee participation in cross-border mergers to apply generally to Swedish companies with foreign-based activities to be appropriate. The primary reason being that both the EU directives on which the act is based have been written to regulate a scenario in which a company has undergone fundamental change at the European level. In this scenario, there is in any case much for the company management, employees and their organisations to discuss. In other cases, the rules and regulations in the proposed act seem to be unreasonably complicated. We therefore believe that it would be difficult to gain understanding for such a system of participation among those who would be most affected by the provisions.</p>
<p>Finally, we have rejected the option of creating a new act that would give participation rights to employees in companies conducting operations in foreign-based affiliates. The reason being that this would create a third regulatory system for participation in addition to the existing Board Representation Act and the act we are proposing. We believe there would be a lack of support for this</p>
<p>both in Sweden and at the foreign-based affiliates where it would come into force.</p>
<p>In our conclusions, we have pointed out certain difficulties as regards extending the area of application. This is at least partly due to the fact that participation provisions do not exist in all countries and that the tenor of the provisions varies considerably in the countries where the legislation is in force. It would be beneficial if the EU could agree on a model for employees' participation rights in the same way as consensus has been reached as regards e.g. the right of employees to information and consultation. On the national level, it is difficult to create an internationally applicable act on employees' participation rights and perhaps even more difficult to make it work in practice. Furthermore, our impression, after discussing the matter with government officials in other EEA states, is that the transposition of the directive on cross-border mergers in other countries will not lead to an extension of national rights over and above the requirements laid down in the directive.</p>
