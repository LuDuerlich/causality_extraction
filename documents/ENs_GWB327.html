<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The assignment in brief</h2>
<p>The Upper Secondary Education Reform Commission’s assignment (dir. 2007:8), including the supplementary terms of reference (dir. 2007:143), is very extensive. It basically covers all upper secondary education issues, from eligibility rules to how qualifications and graduation from upper secondary school shall be designed, as well as issues relating to upper secondary adult education. The main task of the assignment is to propose a new structure for Swedish upper secondary education. The Commission has given particular emphasis to vocational education. The proposals shall lead to higher quality in both vocational programmes and programmes that prepare students for further study. An important prerequisite for the Commission has been to preserve the curriculum in its present form; its approach to knowledge shall form the basis of the proposals irrespective of study path. The task of upper secondary schools to prepare students for active participation in society applies to all study paths. The Commission’s legislative proposals have been formulated in relation to current legislation.</p>
<p>I see it as a prerequisite for my proposals that similar conditions shall prevail in both municipal and independent schools. The proposals I put forward in the commission report have therefore been formulated in such a way. I also put forward proposals for how currently applicable legislation should be amended to achieve similar conditions for the public school system and for independent schools.</p>
<p>The Commission has employed an open working method and has cooperated with seven focus municipalities and four institutes of higher education. A large number of professional organisations have also been consulted during the course of the work. The Commission has also had contact with employer and employee organisations on the central level, as well as with teacher and student organisations. Their approach and experiences have had considerable bearing on how the proposals have been formulated.</p>
<h2>The reform of the early-1990s</h2>
<p>Today’s upper secondary education is to all intents and purposes based on the reform proposed at the beginning of the 1990s in the Government’s Growing with knowledge (Växa med kunskap) TPF FPT  Bill. It is now 17 years since this bill was submitted and the reform is strongly influenced by the spirit of the era that urged a decentralised, programme-oriented and goal-driven upper secondary education system. The Government’s Responsibility of Schools (Ansvaret för skolan) TPF FPT  Bill, clarifying roles and responsibilities, was submitted at the same time. In brief, the national political level (the Swedish Riksdag and Government) was to adopt clear objectives for upper secondary education activities, and the municipalities as school governing bodies were to be responsible for implementing and organising these activities as well as providing the right conditions for the professionals (i.e. teachers and school principals) to design activities within this given framework. The explicit ambition was a nationally equitable upper secondary education system. Working life representatives were not given any clear role in the reform; instead, cooperation on vocational education and the new workplace-based education was voluntary and became the school’s responsibility.</p>
<p>All upper secondary programmes were given the same format; they were all three years long, had the same core subjects and were to provide basic eligibility for higher education studies. The reform led to vocationally oriented programmes being more theorised than previously. This happened partly as a result of an increased number of theoretical subjects and partly due to the programme-specific subjects themselves being theorised. The option of establishing specially designed programmes, local branches and local courses was seen as giving local school governing bodies the freedom to adapt the education to local labour market needs. Cooperation with upper secondary adult education was seen as both desirable and feasible. Individual programmes were established.</p>
<p>At that time – when the reform was implemented - there weren’t all that many independent schools and the regulatory framework established for them was underpinned by the idea that they shouldn’t be unnecessarily subject to the constraints of a national regulatory framework but could design their activities more freely.</p>
<h2>An international perspective with a Nordic focus</h2>
<p>The upper secondary education system introduced in the 1990s was substantially different from other Nordic countries. This is still true today. One clear difference is the far-reaching decentralisation implied by the design of upper secondary education and the division of responsibilities in the Swedish system. Other countries put more focus on a national regulatory framework and national equity compared to the Swedish, decentralised model with its substantial local freedom to design education. Another difference is that Sweden does not have an upper secondary diploma, which in other countries implies a nationally defined level often certified by external assessors. Sweden is one of only a few countries within the EU without such a well-defined educational objective.</p>
<p>Yet another difference is that Sweden has no fixed structure for cooperation with working life. This does not mean that we lack such cooperation in Sweden. There are many excellent examples where, for instance, working life representatives have initiated farreaching cooperation. It is however striking that this is not part of a national education policy and the strength of the link between school and working life can even be perceived as somewhat random. Some industries have had fixed structures for cooperation for a long time whereas others have none at all. The responsibility for finding workplaces for the workplace-based component of a vocational programme lies with the individual school without any support from the national level. If the school has problems finding workplaces, workplace-based components can instead be located at the school with an ensuing lack of contact with working life. This means that the content and quality of a vocational programme can vary substantially between different municipalities/school governing bodies. In this respect, the structure of Swedish upper secondary education differs from other countries, where the cooperation between schools and working life is more stringently regulated and where companies and organisations often take on a certification role.</p>
<p>Neither can we ignore the fact that upper secondary school offers different opportunities for young men and women. There are several male-dominated vocational programmes that are clearly defined and lead to employment. The opposite is true for femaledominated programmes, which is probably one reason why more women than men in our country go on to higher education.</p>
<p>How closely working life and schools cooperate is important for young people’s chances of establishing themselves on the labour market. International research into the importance of such cooperation is referred to in annexes to the report. One conclusion is that close cooperation during upper secondary school and participation by companies and organisations in the education provide good opportunities for young people to establish themselves on the labour market. The opposite is true of students on vocational programmes with weak links to working life - they risk encountering problems when trying to establish themselves. TPF FPT  It is interesting to note the absence of research based on Swedish conditions as regards the role of upper secondary vocational education in skills provision, in helping young people establish themselves and in combating social inequality. TPF FPT  There are a number of studies discussing the effects of no or incomplete upper secondary education but the research seldom considers the forms and organisation of vocational education.</p>
<p>In other countries, the compulsory school system (or equivalent) is given total responsibility for ensuring students gather the necessary prior knowledge in order to follow an upper secondary programme. The current Swedish system with its individual programmes allocates this task to upper secondary schools themselves.</p>
<h2>Some problem areas</h2>
<p>National equity versus local freedom</p>
<p>By way of introduction, I would like to point out the difficulty today in defining what an upper secondary educational programme is. They can vary almost indefinitely. Upper secondary education is formally defined as comprising 17 national programmes, but this is not the entire picture. According to the National Agency for Education, there are about 9 000 local courses and a large number of local branches. Within the Industry Programme alone, there are about 200 local branches and other programmes also have many variants. Students who attend an independent upper secondary school follow programmes that in type and level are similar to a national programme and the school may offer its own courses. The content of these can obviously vary and the competition for students has also forced municipal schools to offer different specially designed programmes and local branches. There are also programmes that combine vocationally oriented and studyoriented programmes, perceived by many to be confusing.</p>
<p>The result is considerable variation in the content of upper secondary education, even within programmes that are formally the same. The vast range of programmes on offer makes it difficult for students to gain an overview of the alternatives. The information given prior to young people choosing their upper secondary school is often more akin to marketing and does not always provide clear answers to what a programme includes and where it leads. There are also many students (12 percent) who switch programmes during their first year at upper secondary school.</p>
<p>Receivers (universities, companies and organisations, etc.) of students from this diversified upper secondary system find it difficult to assess the student’s capabilities and it does not make it any easier for students to get their first job after school. Receivers have also criticised the education for not being on the adequate level. This may well be the reason why working life representatives have involved themselves in the issue of access to education and its design. The development of Technical Colleges ( Teknikcollege ) and Healthcare Colleges ( Vård- och omsorgscollege ) is a case in point. Representatives of the higher education sector have also criticised the prior knowledge of students.</p>
<p>Whether all the variations of the 17 national programmes are necessary is a question the Commission has put to industries and other receivers and opinion as to the current trend is clearly critical. The answer to this question is no. The trend towards evergreater profiling in the face of increasing competition for students does not correspond to receivers’ needs. They would prefer to see things tightened up and a clearly defined level of education which they can accurately evaluate. Both working life representatives and institutes of higher education have also expressed an interest in cooperating on requirements and quality levels for upper secondary education.</p>
<p>In practice, the current situation implies very strong producer control instead of upper secondary schools performing a task formulated by the governmental political level as described when the reform was presented at the beginning of the 1990s. This also means that the conditions for formulating and implementing a national education policy have been weakened. Whether upper secondary education is nationally equitable is strongly debatable.</p>
<p>Results, goal fulfilment, throughput and poor efficiency</p>
<p>Another problem in today’s upper secondary schools is that there is no clear result indicator, which is a precondition of efficient goal-driven management. School-leaving certificates are currently used as a measure of results despite them not depicting what results a student has achieved. The certificate may contain many fail grades and it may have been issued from a reduced programme. Basic eligibility for higher education, which was a clear goal of the reform, is not formulated as an objective in any Swedish educational legislation. I am of the opinion that the percentage of students achieving basic eligibility in three years would be a better indicator for the existing upper secondary school system. Such an indicator makes it possible to study deviations and analyse upper secondary school results. The Upper Secondary Education Reform Commission - with the help of the National Agency for Education - has developed such an indicator and presents it later on in this report.</p>
<p>Another important part of the reform, for which there are no clear evaluation results either, is how the dimensioning principle works. The number of students who gain a place on their firstchoice programme is not measured nationally and the suitability of the chosen dimensioning principle cannot therefore be discussed based on an evaluation. There is no data on the number of students who receive a workplace-based education according to the regulatory framework despite the fact that it is essential for the quality of a vocational programme. An even more important area where there is a lack of information is the extent to which the student’s right to education, in accordance with the regulations on guaranteed teaching time, is satisfied. A conclusion I draw is that both clear result indicators and an improved evaluation system are needed.</p>
<p>The Upper Secondary Education Reform Commission has also examined the current throughput of upper secondary schools, particularly in light of the large number of students who drop out. There is also a surprisingly large number of eligible students in the individual programmes. There are what are known as “switchers and deferers” (those who want to switch programmes or defer their education) in individual programmes waiting to continue their studies. The indicator used by the Commission to measure throughput is the proportion of students who start their upper secondary education and who achieve basic eligibility for higher education within a stipulated period of time, namely three years. All deviations can be seen and discussed and the associated costs can also be estimated. According to these specially compiled statistics, only 62 percent of all students achieve this goal. A conclusion is that it should be possible to improve throughput, which would in turn incur substantially lower costs. There are also costs in upper secondary education that can be traced back to the current system of many different alternatives to choose from. Small class-sizes increase costs so a tightening-up of the system with fewer alternatives could lead to lower costs and higher efficiency to the benefit of both students and upper secondary schools.</p>
<p>I also see a considerable need for cooperation between upper secondary schools and the local community; upper secondary education is an important infrastructure issue that affects the prerequisites for growth and employment in a municipality and region. I put forward proposals to stimulate such cooperation but refrain from submitting proposals for how it should be organised. Cooperation is also brought to the fore by the existing overcapacity in upper secondary education and which will quickly get worse since student cohorts are set to fall from an extremely high level within a few years. In order to be able to guarantee a good supply of upper secondary education in the future, cooperation among different school governing bodies (including independent schools) is required.</p>
<h2>Upper secondary education in a new era proposals and assessments</h2>
<p>The Upper Secondary Educational Reform Commission’s analysis of the changes needed concentrates on three important issues: – The student’s right to a good education needs to be strengthened. – Responsibility, structure and regulations need to be clarified. – Greater cooperation in upper secondary education is needed between receivers and school governing bodies.</p>
<p>Large-scale changes are needed in these three areas. The student is the protagonist in upper secondary education and this should be made self-evident in the regulations and their application. Upper secondary education must build on a completed compulsory education and be the “way-in” to adult life. It must be clear to a student what a programme contains and where it leads. It is important that students are able to choose programmes based on their interests and it must be possible for both young women and men to find vocational programmes that enhance their employability and lead to recognised qualifications. A higher education preparatory programme must provide a good grounding for higher education studies. The legal rights of the student will be strengthened by my proposals and the right to education will be elucidated. My proposals also mean that the right of students on vocational programmes to achieve basic eligibility for higher education within the upper secondary school system will be clarified for the individual student. I create no “dead-end streets” with my proposals.</p>
<p>Both national equity and the prerequisites for decentralised, goal-driven upper secondary education need to be strengthened. My proposals therefore contain a clear, nationally established target level for all programmes that is to apply to both upper secondary school and upper secondary adult education. I propose the introduction of a diploma which involves the Government adopting specific diploma objectives for each programme. This will in turn involve the drawing-up of new policy documents for upper secondary education in order to enhance goal-driven management and provide the prerequisites for a more holistic approach to upper secondary education.</p>
<p>One important precondition for my proposals is that the future national objectives established by the Government as well as other regulatory components must apply equally to both municipal and independent schools so that they can operate on equivalent terms. I also put forward proposals on how this can be achieved. My proposals will also tighter restrictions as regards the right to establish specially designed programmes, local branches and local courses. Here, I make a clear choice in favour of a nationally equitable education system.</p>
<p>I consider access to upper secondary education and upper secondary adult education to be a strategic issue that should hence be seen as part of the infrastructure in a municipality, region or inter-municipal area of cooperation. It is important for working life, both private and public employers, to have access to a welleducated workforce and it is also important for growth issues, for industrial policy in a municipality or region and for the country as a whole. There are examples of some municipalities and cooperative bodies working in this way but there is nothing in the current regulatory framework that stimulates such a perspective. The result is potentially large differences between different parts of the country and between different upper secondary schools.</p>
<p>I therefore propose that the task of upper secondary schools to satisfy the skills supply needs of working life and the higher education sector be further clarified in the Swedish Education Act. I also propose a clear role for receivers, i.e. working life and the higher education sector, when it comes to formulating educational objectives. It is also valuable if they participate in ensuring the quality of the education. Knowledge as to skills supply issues in different parts of the country must be improved and I therefore propose that the National Agency for Education every year prepares a report on these issues to be submitted to the Government.</p>
<p>In light of this, the National Agency for Education will need additional competence to assist it in the assessment of these new issues. I therefore propose the establishment of a national council for the development of upper secondary education, the National Council for Education. This shall be connected to the National Agency for Education and not only play an advisory role in strategic issues concerning the development of upper secondary education but also have the right of initiative. A national council, on which receivers have representation, would make it possible to identify development needs and satisfy the forthcoming needs of future industries which currently lack established structures of cooperation. This would make it possible to continuously renew upper secondary education and ensure important development needs are satisfied.</p>
<p>I also propose that programme specific national councils be set up, one for each national programme. The programme councils will have an operative role compared to the National Council for Education which will concentrate on strategic development issues. The National Agency for Education will be responsible for the establishment of these programme councils and for their administration. Stakeholders, in the form of industrial representatives such as employers and trade unions, and relevant central government standard-setting agencies will be affiliated to a programme council. It is important that the programme councils make use of students’ experiences and views of the programmes. The National Agency for Education will appoint programme council members. I see broad representation and the fact that receivers, as well as in the National Council for Education, are given an important role in the work of the councils as beneficial.</p>
<p>I also propose that local programme councils be set up for cooperation between receivers of upper secondary vocational programme graduates and school governing bodies. In brief, this means that I envisage new institutional levels of cooperation both on the national strategic level and the national and local operational levels. This institutional cooperation on the national level covers both vocational programmes and higher education preparatory programmes.</p>
<p>New vocational programmes and higher education preparatory programmes</p>
<p>Upper secondary education leads to a working life or higher education studies and this shall influence the education from day one. During my assignment, I have therefore concentrated considerably on issues concerning transition from upper secondary school. What skills do students need to cope with their next step in life? This also explains my cooperation with receivers, those who “receive” upper secondary school students, when it comes to assessing what requirements are stipulated now and in the future.</p>
<p>I propose that all upper secondary programmes be three years in length and be worth 2 500 points. All programmes I propose shall be given a common basic structure. This provides plenty of scope for finding flexible forms for each programme within the basic framework that will satisfy the various needs the programme is to fulfil. This involves a key difference compared to the current structure, based on programme uniformity regardless of where they lead.</p>
<p>An important aim with this new structure is to recognise the different receiver requirements. Some industries are stringently regulated by international rules whilst others have virtually no such rules at all. My conclusion is that it must be possible for the programmes to be different. It is also important that the outcome, the diploma, is on an adequate level.</p>
<p>I propose that the current term “vocationally oriented programme” be replaced by “vocational programme”: The idea here is that a vocational programme should stretch further than today’s upper secondary school and lead to a vocational diploma that constitutes a recognised skill qualification and enhances employability. It shall be possible to implement a vocational programme either as a school-based programme or as an apprenticeship programme.</p>
<p>I propose that the term “study-oriented programme” be replaced by “higher education preparatory programme”, a term that more clearly specifies the aim of the programme. Higher education preparatory programmes lead to a higher education preparatory diploma.</p>
<p>The actual, detailed content of the programmes shall be established after a process prepared by the National Agency for Education. When the National Agency for Education prepares the issues, the stakeholders of each programme shall have a strong influence over the content via the proposed national programme councils.</p>
<p>A table illustrating the structure of both school-based vocational programmes and higher education preparatory programmes is presented below.</p>
<p>Some comments on the table: 1. One essential feature of the subjects that I propose should be common to all upper secondary education and be included in all programmes is that their scope and content can vary between the various programmes. I therefore suggest that the concept of “core subjects” should be removed from upper secondary education. I use instead the concept of  common upper secondary subjects . These shall be Swedish/Swedish as a second language, English, mathematics, history, religion, civics, science studies TPF FPT  and physical education and health. I see these subjects as constituting a common ground for all upper secondary school programmes. The common upper secondary subjects shall be established by the Swedish Riksdag. 2. Programme-specific subjects give the programme its character and are read by all students on the programme in question. 3. All programmes have national branches apart from the Health and Social Care Programme. The number of branches per programme varies. 4. In-depth programme studies provide scope for profiling albeit within a tighter framework than the current system. The National Agency for Education shall establish which courses and combinations of courses may be offered as in-depth programme studies and shall be given directives on restrictiveness. The education shall reward in-depth studies into the character of the programme. 5. Individual options will also be possible in the future but to a lesser extent. Some courses shall always be offered; arts course, a second course in physical education and health and - for vocational students - courses needed to provide basic eligibility for higher education. Current rules should be changed so that the school  may  offer students all the courses there are in the municipality, but this shall not be an obligation. In other words, the governing body decides the range of individual options over and above the courses that shall always be offered. 6. Vocational outcomes for vocational programmes correspond to the professions for which the students will be employable. I consider it important for students to be given clear information about the potential outcomes a programme can lead to.</p>
<p>Subject issues</p>
<p>Upper secondary school subjects shall, as they are today, be made up of courses. They shall however, in a clearer way, build on compulsory school subjects and continue from where compulsory school left off. This means that certain repetition elements in today’s general courses should be replaced by in-depth studies in the subject at upper secondary level. Courses are currently denoted by letters, but I propose they instead be denoted by figures.</p>
<p>I propose that subjects and courses shall be described more clearly than they are today. The aim of this added clarity is to strengthen equity.</p>
<p>According to my supplementary terms of reference, I am to highlight the core subjects and look particularly at the subject of Swedish and whether it should be one combined subject or be divided into two - one focusing on language and the other focusing on literature. I propose that courses in Swedish/Swedish as a second language continue to be one combined subject covering both language and literature.</p>
<p>New vocational education - two paths towards a vocational diploma</p>
<p>An important starting-point in the new upper secondary education system I propose is that students shall progress further as regards their preparation for a vocation or further studies in higher education. In other words, students shall be more specialised within their vocational or study area compared to today’s vocationally oriented programmes. I do not believe that this increased specialisation contradicts the idea that students shall also be prepared for active participation in society and be given the opportunity to develop general skills such as problem solving, the ability to cooperate and communication skills.</p>
<p>Through my proposals for a changed structure as regards upper secondary vocational education, I have designed a system that meets currently assessable needs based on what can be deduced from the continuously on-going changes in working life. As a result of my proposals in connection with the National Council for Education and national programme councils integrated with the National Agency for Education, I believe I have also created the conditions necessary for an ongoing dialogue with receivers on future needs for change as regards upper secondary vocational education.</p>
<p>A vocational programme leads to a vocational diploma that provides a recognised qualification that in turn enhances employability. The vocational education programmes I propose shall enhance employability and the upper secondary level will in future be defined by the established diploma objectives for each programme in cooperation with receivers. This is also a view supported by the industrial representatives the Commission has consulted. The defined level will be the one to which each industry will adapt its further education and training for possible certification.</p>
<p>I believe we must see learning in working life and what it provides in a broader perspective than the narrow syllabus-driven view of learning conveyed by workplace-based education and its definition. I therefore propose that the concept of “workplace learning” be used instead of the concept of “workplace-based education”. I propose that at least 15 weeks of workplace learning shall be compulsory for students on all school-based vocational programmes. The dispensation allowing workplace-based education to take place at school shall be removed. As regards apprenticeship programmes, at least half the period of education shall be located at the workplace.</p>
<p>I also propose that local programme councils for cooperation between school governing bodies and receivers on upper secondary vocational education be made compulsory. In other words, I am introducing a new element of upper secondary vocational education. Making workplace learning, with a qualitative level demanded by the receivers, compulsory means that the programme can only be offered if workplace learning places can be found. I see workplace learning as an entirely necessary component of a vocational programme; students without workplace learning do not have the same opportunities to establish themselves on the labour market and the education will not provide them with the right skills. The new national programme councils and local programme councils will provide an institutional level of cooperation at the national and local levels that is currently lacking. At present it is the school’s responsibility to find workplace learning places. As a result of the new requirements, I see the issue of workplace learning as a mutual undertaking where both the school and working life have an interest in generating a sufficient number of workplace learning places. This will require good cooperation between schools and working life and the issue will be monitored and reported on in the National Agency for Education’s annual report on skills provision to the Government.</p>
<p>During the workplace-located component of the programme, I propose that the student be supervised by a skilled company employee who should have undergone a supervisors’ course arranged by the school governing body in cooperation with receivers or who has the equivalent education. I propose that such education be made compulsory for apprenticeship programmes. The school governing body shall appoint one or more vocational teachers to be responsible for the contacts between the school, workplace and student and who, after consultation with the workplace/supervisor, grades the students.</p>
<p>It is my view that an agreement on workplace learning should be drawn up between the school governing body and the workplace/s that take on students. Such agreements will enable workplace learning and the undertakings of the various parties to be qualityassured in a completely different way to if there were no agreements. I am of the opinion that the amount of compensation given to workplaces that take on students on workplace learning programmes should not be regulated on the central level. I do however propose that the issue of compensation should always be discussed and regulated in connection with the drawing-up of an agreement on workplace learning between the school governing body and the workplace.</p>
<p>Vocational education at upper secondary schools therefore includes both school-based education and apprenticeship education. I see apprenticeship education as an alternative path to the same qualification - a vocational diploma. School-based vocational programmes followed by upper secondary apprenticeship programmes are presented below. The section on vocational education starts with a figure illustrating how these two educational paths are interrelated. * A maximum of 1 800 points provided that 200 points in Individual option is done as workplace learning.</p>
<p>School-based vocational programmes</p>
<p>The common upper secondary subjects of Swedish/ Swedish as a second language, English, mathematics, history, religion, civics, science studies and physical education and health are included in all vocational programmes and are worth 600 points.</p>
<p>In my proposals for vocational programmes, I have not specified which subjects and courses I deem should work as common programme-specific and common branch-specific subjects. I believe that this work should be done by the National Agency of Education in cooperation with relevant receivers. In my opinion, the National Agency for Education should, in addition to establishing the content of the programme-specific subjects and how they should be distributed among different courses, also establish the final number of points for the common programmespecific subjects, the common branch-specific subjects and indepth programme studies. The National Agency for Education also needs to establish, in consultation with receivers from working life, the programme-specific subjects that are to function as in-depth programme studies.</p>
<p>According to my proposals, the individual option is worth 200 points in all programmes. For students who so wish, the individual option can also be used for further in-depth study within the programme-specific subjects or to read other courses offered by the school governing body. Another course in physical education and health and at least one course in an arts subject shall always be offered.</p>
<p>Furthermore, students on vocational programmes shall always be offered the courses necessary for basic eligibility for higher education as an individual option and/or extended programme. These courses include a further 200 points in Swedish/Swedish as a second language and a further 100 points in English. One of the courses may be made compulsory on certain vocational programmes. The individual option, with its 200 points, will then be enough to achieve basic eligibility for higher education. On other programmes, students will have to study an extended programme. On vocational programmes, students shall be entitled to read an extended programme worth up to 300 points to achieve basic eligibility for higher education.</p>
<p>I propose that there shall be 14 vocational programmes with various national branches in the new upper secondary education system. These are:</p>
<p>Apprenticeship education</p>
<p>In my opinion, the prevailing norm when it comes to basic vocational education is, and will continue for a long time to be, a mainly school-based upper secondary vocational education. This is also the dominant view that has emerged from the Commission’s extensive contacts with various receivers. This is not to say, however, that upper secondary apprenticeship education cannot and should not have considerably greater scope than it has today. In my opinion, extensive learning at the workplace, with the right prerequisites and combined with some school-based education, can be a very good alternative to school-based vocational education. This is also true for upper secondary adult education and for vocational segments that are currently female-dominated.</p>
<p>For upper secondary apprenticeship education to be realised, close and well-developed regional and local cooperation is required between school governing bodies and the industries/companies that will take on and educate apprentices. I have arrived at the conclusion therefore that the home municipality cannot be under an obligation to offer apprenticeship education. However, all young people shall be entitled to apply to upper secondary apprenticeship programmes and the home municipality shall take sufficient measures to try to satisfy students’ choices.</p>
<p>Apprenticeship education shall lead to a vocational diploma with the same objectives as school-based vocational education. Apprenticeship education, according to my proposal, differs from school-based vocational education in its subject content and courses during the workplace-located components being structured differently in “programme blocks” and in that more of the learning takes place in the form of workplace learning. Workplace learning shall, regardless of whether it takes place in the form of workplace learning within a vocational programme or within an apprenticeship programme, be designed in accordance with the prevailing conditions in working life.</p>
<p>It is my assessment that a student who undergoes apprenticeship education probably will have student status to start with. If deemed appropriate, however, an employment relationship shall also be possible. A three-year trial of upper secondary apprenticeship education will start in 2008, in which it will be possible to combine upper secondary education with employment. The experiences gained from this trial will increase our understanding as regards the potential of employment with respect to apprenticeship programmes.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there are a number of legal issues that must be satisfactorily resolved as regards employment combined with upper secondary education. My opinion is that a double or shared responsibility (governorship) exists in this case. This may cause delimitation problems when it comes to determining who is responsible for the student/employee in different regards. Apprenticeship education combined with employment is furthermore a collective agreement issue. In light of this, I propose that it shall be possible to combine upper secondary apprenticeship programmes with employment but that this issue be further examined in connection with the evaluation of the abovementioned trial.</p>
<p>I propose that the design of the workplace-located component of an upper secondary apprenticeship programme be regulated with the help of a national education plan for apprenticeship programmes established by the National Agency for Education. The content of this plan is to be established on the local level in a local education plan for apprenticeship education. The workplace learning component of upper secondary apprenticeship programmes shall consist of the content of the programme-specific subject courses for the vocational programme in question. I propose that workplace learning within upper secondary apprenticeship education be structured in the form of programme blocks  each comprising 200 to 500 points.</p>
<p>My proposal also means that students on upper secondary apprenticeship programmes have the same opportunities as students on school-based vocational programmes to make choices that allow them to gain basic eligibility for higher education.</p>
<p>Higher education preparatory programmes</p>
<p>I propose five new higher education preparatory programmes. According to the terms of reference given to me, students shall be able to choose an education based on their interests. I believe that the new programmes, with their national branches, amply fulfil these requirements. Higher education preparatory programmes shall provide better preparation for higher-level studies than is currently the case. The programmes shall also encourage and provide opportunities for in-depth studies in subjects that are important for the students’ further studies. Because of their breadth, all programmes provide good preparation for further studies throughout the higher education sector and fulfil the requirements for a good grounding in all different kinds of higher education. The programmes are:</p>
<p>Just as there is to be well-developed cooperation between upper secondary schools and working life, there has also to be welldeveloped cooperation between upper secondary schools and institutes of higher education that reflects the entire higher education sector’s field of knowledge. Cooperation does currently exist but it normally covers teacher education or university departments of education. My proposal for the establishment of the National Council for Education will give the higher education sector the chance to influence how the requirements for higher education preparatory programmes will be formulated now and in the future. The new institutional level for cooperation between institutes of higher education and upper secondary schools, together with the introduction of a diploma, will strengthen the cooperation between the higher education sector and upper secondary schools.</p>
<p>The number of teachers with PhDs is currently very low in upper secondary education and links to the research community need to be developed. My proposals provide a good basis for closer cooperation between upper secondary schools, upper secondary adult education and the higher education sector on the teacher level as well. It is also important that this cooperation be broadened to include all parts of higher education.</p>
<p>The proposals I put forward also provide a platform for strengthening links with the research community in upper secondary education. The national programme councils will provide scope for continuous cooperation between subject representatives and the National Agency for Education when various policy documents are being formulated and important issues concerning subject development are being discussed. There is no such continuous cooperation at present despite requests from subject representatives.</p>
<p>It is also important for institutes of higher education to continue to be able to recruit students from upper secondary schools and combat the ever-present strong social segregation in Swedish higher education. This requires good information and guidance that reaches students when they are still at compulsory school prior to them choosing their preferred upper secondary education. I see the new programme councils playing an important role as regards information about the vocational options open to students if they go on to study in higher education.</p>
<p>Diploma to be introduced in upper secondary school</p>
<p>I propose the introduction of a Swedish upper secondary school diploma both for vocational and higher education preparatory programmes. There are several grounds for this; with a diploma, the Government can formulate clear national objectives for upper secondary education that not only are comprehensible to receivers in Sweden but also provide clarity internationally. The introduction of a diploma also provides opportunities to evaluate upper secondary education as a system.</p>
<p>My proposal involves the introduction of two types of diploma: a vocational diploma and a higher education preparatory diploma. The student must fulfil the requirements of the diploma to receive one. In other words, students must have grades worth 2 500 points, the equivalent of a complete programme, of which they must receive pass grades worth at least 2 250 points. Students must have pass grades in Swedish/Swedish as a second language, mathematics and English. The level the student must attain in these subjects to gain a pass grade may vary depending on the programme he or she follows. Furthermore, the student shall obtain pass grades in certain programme-specific subjects, to be established by the National Agency for Education after consultation with receivers. Furthermore, the student must gain a pass grade for his or her diploma project.</p>
<p>Vocational diplomas that can be obtained either via schoolbased vocational programmes or via apprenticeship programmes shall be designed in close consultation with the relevant industries.</p>
<p>A vocational diploma guarantees that the student is well prepared for the occupational sector at which the programme is aimed. The same is true of a higher education preparatory diploma; it shall be designed in close consultation with representatives of institutes of higher education.</p>
<p>Each programme shall have diploma objectives. The purpose of these is to describe the aims of the programme. As regards vocational programmes, the aim is to educate students for an occupational segment. The aim of higher education preparatory programmes is to prepare students for higher education studies. The diploma objectives shall be used by professionals at upper secondary schools as a policy document from the students’ entrance into a programme until their graduation. Their steering function shall be much clearer than current programme objectives. Diploma objectives and subject goals shall complement each other. The diploma objectives shall ensure that a holistic perspective is taken at programme level within upper secondary education.</p>
<p>The starting-point for the diploma objectives shall firstly be the curriculum and the basic aims applicable to each programme respectively, i.e. to make the students employable in a specific occupational segment or to prepare them for higher education.</p>
<p>Even though diploma objectives shall first and foremost be used by professional educationists, they are to be formulated in such a way so that students, parents and receivers can understand them.</p>
<p>Diploma objectives for each programme shall be drawn up jointly by central government and receivers. The receivers for vocational programmes are the respective industries and for the higher education preparatory programmes, they are primarily the institutes of higher education. However, representatives of working life may also be on the national councils for higher education preparatory programmes. The National Agency for Education shall, within the framework of the national programme councils, consult the relevant stakeholders to draw up draft diploma objectives for each programme.</p>
<p>The proposals are submitted by the National Agency for Education to the National Council for Education, which then passes comment on them. Based on discussions in the national programme councils and comments from the National Council for Education, the National Agency for Education submits draft diploma objectives for all programmes to the Government. The Council’s comments shall be enclosed with the National Agency for Education’s proposals to the Government, which then establishes the diploma objectives.</p>
<p>One of the tasks of the national programme councils is to follow and evaluate diploma issues relating to their specific programme. This task also includes taking initiatives to amend the diploma objectives when deemed appropriate. Such initiatives can also be taken by the National Agency for Education or the National Council for Education.</p>
<p>To gain a diploma, the student must complete a diploma project. Some of the diploma objectives are made up of a section called “Diploma project objectives”. The diploma project shows that the student has attained these objectives. In turn, this means that the diploma project on a vocational programme verifies whether the student is sufficiently competent to be employed in the relevant occupational segment and on a higher education preparatory programme whether the student is sufficiently competent to study at university/university college. The diploma project shall be completed during the final stages of the student’s upper secondary education.</p>
<p>Vocational programme diploma projects shall be clearly focused on the occupational segment at which the programme is aimed. The project shall comprise either one substantial coherent project or several shorter “vocational tests”. These vocational tests can already be found in certain industries, some on a level that can be described as upper secondary. The diploma projects shall always include some form of documentation. If they are of an explicit practical nature, however, this documentation can be brief.</p>
<p>Higher education preparatory programme diploma projects shall, to a large extent, be focused on the educational area at which the upper secondary programme is mainly aimed. Projects shall be specific not just to programmes but also to branches. They should, however, also verify whether the student has the general skills needed to cope successfully with any kind of higher education studies. A diploma project on a higher education preparatory programme shall consist of a substantial coherent assignment in the form of a survey, analysis or production, documented as a written report.</p>
<p>Every student shall be allocated a diploma project supervisor by the school principal after consultation with a diploma tutor, see below. This supervisor shall be a teacher who is well-skilled in the relevant subject area. Every diploma project shall be assessed by a co-assessor. This will strengthen the students’ legal rights.</p>
<p>The diploma project is worth 100 out of the total 2 500 points for a completed upper secondary programme. In relation to the total number of weeks upper secondary students have at their disposal in three academic years, about 100 weeks, 100 points is the equivalent of about four weeks.</p>
<p>Students shall receive a certain amount of supervision when doing their diploma projects. It is very important that students are given enough time to do the project. I propose that they are always guaranteed the equivalent of four full study weeks to complete the project. These four weeks can be allocated in different ways depending on the nature of the project and other factors. I propose that the time may be divided into a maximum of four periods. The project should preferably be done in the final stages of the programme.</p>
<p>A diploma project can be given either a pass or a fail grade. In other words, it is not graded on a scale of more than two marks. To receive a pass mark in their projects, students are required to attain all the diploma project objectives. It shall be possible within the upper secondary adult education system to obtain both higher education preparatory diplomas and vocational diplomas. The objectives in upper secondary education and in upper secondary adult education shall be the same but the path towards a diploma may vary. Flexibility and the use of validation are required for adult students.</p>
<p>If a student fails the diploma, he or she will receive a study certificate showing which grades he or she has attained during the programme. I propose that the current concept of “final grades” be abolished. It shall be possible for the student to sit or take the diploma in the upper secondary adult education system.</p>
<p>Diploma tutors in upper secondary education</p>
<p>I propose that there should be at least one diploma tutor for each programme at a school. He or she shall be responsible for practical diploma issues. This may be a question of approving the design of diploma projects and representing the school in discussions with industries, institutes of higher education and other upper secondary schools. The diploma tutor shall be able to assist the principal when appointing supervisors and responsible assessors of diploma projects and administrate implementation of the diploma.</p>
<p>A diploma tutor on a higher education preparatory programme shall if possible be a senior subject teacher with a PhD. One aim shall be to have at least one senior subject teacher per programme. Diploma tutors on vocational programmes shall be vocational teachers with good skills in the programme-specific subjects of the programme in question.</p>
<p>My proposals as regards diploma tutors mean that I see these teachers as being responsible for a national task to ensure the education is at the right level and meets the requirements set down in the diploma objectives. I also see them as an important resource in the efforts to attain national equity and to include teachers as a professional group in the national quality assurance system.</p>
<p>Eligibility, admission and selection</p>
<p>The current system of general eligibility requirements met in three subjects, Swedish, English and mathematics, for all programmes has been shown to have certain disadvantages. One such disadvantage is that students admitted to national programmes with very low admission qualifications have very little chance of success, according to statistics compiled by the National Agency for Education. TPF FPT  In extreme cases, some students who start a national programme have only achieved pass grades in English, mathematics and Swedish/Swedish as a second language. Starting a programme with very little chance of success is problematic. Students who drop out of upper secondary school have been shown to be a very vulnerable group on the labour market.</p>
<p>I therefore consider it important to create a system that ensures students admitted to national programmes have, as far as possible, a good chance of successfully completing the programme, which normally involves passing the diploma. It is on the other hand equally important not to exclude students, who actually have a good chance of taking the diploma, by specifying admission requirements that are too  tough.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of the current system is that for some students at the end of their compulsory education, there is too much concentration on the three essential qualification subjects to the detriment of other subjects. Broadening the qualification requirements to encompass more subjects may help to raise the status of other compulsory school subjects and to emphasise compulsory education as a broad education in good citizenship.</p>
<p>I propose the following eligibility requirements for vocational programmes, including apprenticeship programmes: Pass grades in at least eight subjects including Swedish/Swedish as a second language, mathematics and English. The school governing body is entitled to admit students who, for special reasons, lack the necessary eligibility in English if their chances of success on the programme are deemed to be good. Students admitted under this dispensation shall be guaranteed special support established in an action programme.</p>
<p>The following eligibility requirements are proposed for students on higher education preparatory programmes: Pass grades in at least 12 subjects including Swedish/Swedish as a second language, mathematics and English.</p>
<p>Programme-specific eligibility requirements: Pass grades in geography, history, religion and civics to do the Economics Programme, the Arts and Humanities Programme and the Social Science and Media Programme.</p>
<p>Pass grades in biology, physics and chemistry are required to study the Natural Science Programme and the Technology Programme.</p>
<p>Dispensation from the requirement for a pass grade in English can be given as above.</p>
<p>Eight and twelve subjects respectively</p>
<p>When choosing the minimum  number of subjects in which a student shall have attained at least a pass grade, I decided on eight for vocational programmes, which is half the lowest possible number of subjects read by a student at compulsory school. This requirement for a minimum number of eight grades, including grades in some specific subjects, is clearly more stringent than the current eligibility requirements.</p>
<p>As regards higher education preparatory programmes, I have decided on a requirement for twelve subject passes. This means that a student can fail four subjects (five if he or she has grades in optional foreign languages) without being excluded from admission to a higher education preparatory programme. I consider this to be reasonable from a legal rights point of view, since students might be skilled at certain subjects of special importance for the programme they have applied to, though having failed in some subjects that are not crucial to success in the same programme.</p>
<p>I am of the opinion that higher education preparatory programmes are more of a direct extension of compulsory school subjects than vocational programmes are. Most programmespecific subjects on vocational programmes have no direct link to compulsory school subjects, whilst most programme-specific subjects on higher education preparatory programmes do. Compulsory school grades therefore provide a better forecast of success on higher education preparatory programmes than on vocational programmes. This is why I have decided on a requirement for at least eight subjects for the latter programmes and twelve subjects for the former.</p>
<p>The Commission has performed impact analyses of these changes to the eligibility requirements with the help of the National Agency for Education. As regards the vocational programmes, the proposed change would probably only cause an increase of about 0.5 percentage unit in the number of ineligible students. The dispensation proposed by the Commission may even give more students the opportunity to start studying a national programme.</p>
<p>The impact of the changes on higher education preparatory programmes is more difficult to judge. The proportion of students who in 2006 would have been ineligible under the new rules for admission would have increased from 10.5 to about 12 percent. The commission report presents the results per programme. It is important to stress that a change in the eligibility rules has a signal value and should lead to students with very weak results, who are at present admitted to upper secondary school, becoming ineligible. Statistics show that students with very poor entrance qualifications are strongly over-represented among students who drop out of upper secondary school and have difficulties on the labour market. With my proposals, I want to ensure that students who start an upper secondary programme have a good chance of completing it and I believe that the new eligibility rules will also help to improve throughput.</p>
<p>Regarding admission and selection</p>
<p>I propose that the concept of “admission” replace that of “intake”. The reason for this is to use the same concepts as the higher education sector.</p>
<p>I also propose that students may be admitted to a branch at the beginning of upper secondary programmes. If a branch begins during the first academic year, admission and selection are to be done prior to the start of the programme.</p>
<p>Vocational programmes can be completed either as schoolbased programmes or as apprenticeship programmes. Upon admission, an apprenticeship programmes shall be the same as a branch. A student admitted in year 1 to a vocational programme without specifying branch or apprenticeship programme shall be deemed admitted to a school-based vocational programme.</p>
<p>As is the case today, selection to upper secondary school, in accordance with my proposals, shall mainly be made through admission qualifications, based on the students’ grades. For arts branches on the Arts and Humanities Programme and for programmes that recruit nationally, I propose the introduction of optional supplementary proficiency tests, though within a significantly tighter framework than is currently the case.</p>
<p>The responsibility of compulsory schools and individual alternatives to the national programmes</p>
<p>Today’s individual programmes have students with different backgrounds and needs. These students are often assigned to individual programmes that cannot satisfy their needs in the best way. I am of the opinion that the overarching objective of individual programmes - to make the students eligible to start a national programme - does not reflect all the needs of students currently on upper secondary individual programmes. More alternatives are needed and this is the underlying reasoning behind the proposals presented. I propose that individual programmes be abolished. Instead, I propose a preparatory year, individual alternatives and a programme induction. Another important aim is to improve throughput in upper secondary education and help students in different ways to complete their studies in order to avoid the problems that occur on the labour market for those who have not completed their upper secondary education.</p>
<p>The preparatory year</p>
<p>For students who are ineligible for a national programme, I propose the establishment of a preparatory year within the framework of the compulsory school system but which does not involve the student retaking year 9 (the last year of Swedish compulsory school). The target group for the preparatory year is students who, subsequent to an investigation, are deemed potentially able to become eligible for a national programme within a maximum of one year’s supplementary education. Compulsory school students who run the risk of not reaching the objectives and thereby becoming ineligible for the upper secondary programme they wish to attend must be informed in good time of the fact and of the options available to them as regards their continued education. The compulsory school principal shall initiate an investigation and it is then up to the home municipality to decide whether the student should be offered a preparatory year or not, a decision that can be appealed by the student.</p>
<p>The teaching in the preparatory year is intended to be something different to compulsory school education and may contain tuition as well as guidance and practical work. The objective is however to make the student eligible for upper secondary school within a maximum of one year. One very important reason for proposing the preparatory year is the new upper secondary eligibility rules. It is unreasonable for upper secondary schools to offer tuition in several compulsory school subjects. Compulsory schools themselves are better equipped for this. A procedure whereby the student becomes eligible for upper secondary school within the framework of compulsory school is also in line with how most other Nordic countries have arranged similar activities. I can also see that this sends a clear signal as to where the responsibility lies. It is the compulsory school’s responsibility to make the student eligible for upper secondary school. The terms of reference given to me also clearly stipulate that upper secondary education shall be based on a completed compulsory school education.</p>
<p>The individual alternative</p>
<p>For students who are still not deemed eligible for a national programme within one year or who are in need of special support, I propose that the municipality offers education in the form of an individual alternative. The individual alternative is not to be placed on a par with a national programme but the education and activities shall be implemented within an upper secondary school framework. The primary target group could be students who for different reasons are still not deemed to have achieved eligibility for a national programme within one year. It may also, in exceptional circumstances, be students who can achieve eligibility or already are eligible but who, for special reasons, need an individualised programme. For example, this may apply to students with neuropsychiatric diagnoses, whose educational prospects would be better catered for by an individual alternative.</p>
<p>The aim of individual alternatives is to offer students educational measures that are the best for them to further their personal development. Activities within an individual alternative shall help the student’s personal development towards future establishment on the labour market or provide a good grounding for further education. This may require cooperation with various care providers or social services. In my experience, the responsibility for students with major problems often falls between two stools, both between different committees in a municipality and between the municipality and other care providers or social services. The idea here is to find the individual measures that best benefit the student’s future knowledge development. Activities within an individual alternative can also, to a greater or lesser extent, comprise workplace learning or vocational work practice if this is the best solution for the student’s knowledge development. I do not however intend to use the term “apprentice” for these students, which would confuse them with students on the upper secondary apprenticeship programmes I am proposing as an alternative within vocational programmes.</p>
<p>I anticipate that the individual alternatives for some students will require substantial resources, but I consider this a much more effective solution than students not receiving education that is adapted to their needs and prerequisites. When the programme comprises elements of both a social and pedagogical nature, the costs should be shared between the school, social services and other care providers.</p>
<p>I believe that it should also be possible for independent schools to offer an individual alternative but this should be done in cooperation with one or more municipalities.</p>
<p>Programme induction</p>
<p>For students with a foreign background who come to Sweden during their upper secondary or late compulsory school years, an organisation is needed that quickly validates their knowledge and is responsible for them learning Swedish so that they can start an upper secondary programme in Sweden. After induction, these young people shall be given places in programmes according to their prerequisites. This may be continued studies within a national programme, or Swedish for migrants perhaps in combination with upper secondary school studies. Others can be offered studies on a preparatory year or an individual alternative. Upper secondary adult education may also be an option since I propose that the Government or government-appointed authority shall be permitted to issue regulations governing dispensations from the minimum age requirement of 20 years to be eligible for upper secondary adult education.</p>
<p>Switchers, drop-outs, students who have not applied to upper secondary school and deferers</p>
<p>My opinion is that students who want to switch or drop out of a programme should be offered support so that they continue to make headway in their education. The school should perform an investigation into suitable measures that are needed and where necessary establish a new study plan. In light of the municipality’s monitoring responsibility, it is important that schools report to the home municipality as soon as students discontinue their school studies. There are also students who are affected by personal crises and the like during their upper secondary years and they are entitled to support measures from the school where they are registered. If students despite such measures cannot continue their studies, they can today be offered a reduced programme with a maximum reduction of 10 percent. I propose that the 10 percent reduction limit be removed. Students can then complete their studies by extending their time at upper secondary school or by studying in the upper secondary adult education system.</p>
<p>Grades</p>
<p>I propose that the system with course grades be maintained. My argument in favour of this is that there must be very good reasons for a change from the current system to subject grades and I haven’t found any such reasons during my work. Neither have the students or teachers I have met expressed any strong desire to change the grading system. Course grades work much better in upper-secondary adult education and I see it as a major advantage to have the same grading system.</p>
<p>Consequences for higher education admission rules</p>
<p>I believe that a higher education preparatory diploma shall always constitute at least basic eligibility for higher education. For vocational programme students to gain basic eligibility for higher education, a vocational diploma must include a further 200 points in Swedish/Swedish as a second language and a further 100 points in English.</p>
<p>Upper secondary adult education</p>
<p>My proposals will bring upper secondary adult education and upper secondary school closer together. In other words, most of the proposals also apply to upper secondary adult education. A clear example is the proposals for diplomas that shall include the same requirements for both upper secondary school and upper secondary adult education. The path to the diploma can, however, vary since studies in the upper secondary adult education system are not designed as programmes. Validation will therefore be an important instrument in upper secondary adult education.</p>
<p>Another example where the two forms of education will come closer together is that an upper secondary student will be allowed to read upper secondary adult education courses. Dispensation from the minimum age limit of 20 for admission to upper secondary adult education shall also be possible under special circumstances.</p>
<p>I also see upper secondary adult education as important so that students can complete their upper secondary education. Students with a vocational diploma who have not achieved basic eligibility for higher education at upper secondary school shall be entitled to do so in the upper secondary adult education system. Students who have not achieved a diploma at upper secondary school shall, in accordance with my proposals, be a priority group for upper secondary adult education.</p>
<h2>Impact analysis regarding gender equality and flexible school start</h2>
<p>Gender equality</p>
<p>By way of introduction, there is reason to point out that upper secondary schools and programme construction cannot, in accordance with my assessment, solve the problem of distorted gender distribution in today’s upper secondary school system. Upper secondary school is a reflection of the labour market for which the students are educated and clear commitment from labour market parties is required as regards the issue of a more gender-neutral labour market in order to come to grips with the lack of gender equality. This does not mean that the programme structure in upper secondary education is of no significance and I have submitted proposals which I expect will have a positive impact on gender equality. In several of the new programmes, I expect gender distribution to be more equal than it is today. This is especially true of the new Leadership and Preventive Healthcare Programme. Important universal changes are the introduction of a diploma and requirements for qualitative workplace learning to give both young men and young women a clear vocational outcome that has been quality assured by receivers and good contacts with the labour market. This will provide students with a better chance to establish themselves on the labour market, a chance that will in particular benefit young women, who currently have fewer such options in upper secondary education.</p>
<p>Flexible school start</p>
<p>My assessment is that a flexible school start in the compulsory school system can cause substantial problems for upper secondary schools. My reasoning here is built on the premise that the students have both a flexible start and a flexible end to compulsory school. If pupils are to be admitted to upper secondary school several times a year, a larger organisation for admission and selection will be required. Tuition groups for each admission could be smaller and therefore involve higher costs per upper secondary school place. In a worst-case scenario, it could lead to a governing body not feeling it could afford to start the programme if the groups become too small. More teachers would need to be recruited and there is currently a shortage of vocational teachers, a shortage that could be exacerbated. For vocational programmes, which are already costly due to them often requiring special equipment and customised premises, the investment costs would probably rise as room would be needed for more classes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that if the introduction of a flexible school start were to necessitate upper secondary programmes starting several times a year, it would lead to substantially higher running costs and extensive administration. It is however uncertain whether the flexible school start really would lead to students also wanting to complete their compulsory school studies at a different time to other students.</p>
<h2>Other issues</h2>
<p>During the course of my work, I have heard a good deal of criticism as regards shortcomings in study and vocational guidance. In its evaluations, the National Agency for Education has also seen shortcomings in how study and vocational guidance is given. I propose that the student’s right to study and vocational guidance be clarified in the Education Act and that the issue of how study and vocational guidance shall be designed in future be further examined.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The upper secondary reform I propose implies major changes and during my work I have encountered both expectation and worry that its implementation will not be given the right prerequisites. Previous reforms provide a good deal of experience to fall back on and it is natural for this experience to form the basis of good implementation. It is, for example, a question of devoting both time and resources to implement the reform. It is important that work gets underway quickly, that there is a lot of information available and that there is funding for in-service training on the proposed changes.</p>
<p>I also present some critical factors in the commission report. The supply of vocational teachers and workplace supervisors is one such critical factor as is the supply of senior subject teachers with PhDs. More commission work examining these issues is being performed in parallel to my commission and, from what I have heard, this will result in separate proposals, which is why I have not presented any of my own. I give details as to the funding of the reform and also propose that the local government sector be allocated funds to cover the costs of introducing a new regulation on diplomas. I also point out that the proposals for new programme structures and a tightening-up of the regulatory framework provide opportunities for greater efficiency. These efficiency gains are greater than the costs incurred as a result of my proposals.</p>
