<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Proposals by the Committee of Inquiry</h2>
<p>The Committee’s definition of high-cost credit</p>
<p>The Committee has chosen to limit its main proposal to a particular form of lending that the Committee calls high-cost  credit . The definition of this type of credit is based on the annual percentage rate of charge (APR) of the loan. APR is a term that reflects both relatively high cost of credit and short repayment terms. The Committee has set the threshold for that considered a high-cost credit at 30 basis points above the reference rate according to the Interest Act, which is presently zero. The definition does not apply to credit purchases; that is, credit that finances the purchase of a good or service.</p>
<p>Proposed measures</p>
<p>The Committee proposes the following measures to strengthen consumer protection in the high-cost credit market.  Information in connection with marketing of  high-cost credit . Special information should be required in connection with marketing of  high-cost  credit. This information should be easy to see and contain a reference to further information on the website of a government agency. The information might, for example, apply to the consequences of going into debt and to options for seeking help with financial matters.  Interest cap and cost cap for  high-cost credits . The interest cap would involve limitation of the borrowing rate and the penalty interest that may be charged for a  high-cost  credit. The Committee proposes a maximum level of 40 basis points above the reference rate. The cost cap would mean that the consumer would not be obliged to pay a total cost of credit of more than 100 per cent of the amount borrowed. The total cost of credit includes loan costs, collection costs and penalty interest.  Limitation of rollovers of  high-cost credits . The lender may not roll over a loan after the original repayment date more than once. It should thus not be permitted to repeatedly roll over the loan unless the debt is simultaneously repaid.  A margin in the  left-to-live-on calculation . Lenders should apply wider margins when calculating the consumer’s repayment capacity when the consumer applies for a  high-cost  loan. If repayment of the loan would lead to the consumer having margins in their disposable income that are too narrow, the loan should not be written.  Credit checks for free loans.  Lenders should be obliged to run a credit check even for  short-term  loans that do not incur any costs.  Marketing of loans should be moderate . Higher standards should be imposed on the design of marketing to prevent marketing from persuading people to make thoughtless decisions to take out a loan.</p>
<h2>The Committee’s remit</h2>
<p>The Committee was directed to consider measures to achieve a more responsible consumer credit market. The aim of the remit has been to strengthen consumer protection and mitigate the risk that consumer loans will lead to excessive indebtedness.</p>
<p>The terms of reference of the Committee included consideration of the following measures:  a sanction rule under private law applicable to deficient credit checking  limitation of the borrowing rate and penalty interest that the lender may charge (interest cap)  limitation of the total cost of credit that a consumer may be obliged to pay (cost cap)  limitation of loan rollovers  a written contracts requirement  more stringent marketing and information requirements.</p>
<p>In addition to the specified measures, the Committee was free to consider other closely related measures.</p>
<p>The Committee’s primary remit was to propose measures aimed at “instant loans”.</p>
<p>According to the Committee’s terms of reference, the measures proposed by the Committee should be aimed at  reducing the risk that consumers will be offered and granted loans that they are unable to repay  reducing the risk that consumers will end up in a debt spiral due to granted loans  increasing consumer awareness of the consequences and risks associated with certain types of loans.</p>
<h2>Rationale for the Committee of Inquiry:</h2>
<h2>A criticised form of lending</h2>
<p>Instant loans have been a controversial and usually criticised form of lending ever since they were introduced in the Swedish consumer credit market in 2006.</p>
<p>Over the years, several different studies, reports and statistics have been published concerning instant loans. All of these indicate that consumers who take out instant loans are a vulnerable group of consumers with low incomes, low credit scores and no other options for access to credit. Other circumstances that have been brought to the fore are that the lending companies do not perform acceptable credit checks and that many consumers have difficulty repaying the instant loans they have taken out. As regards payment difficulties experienced by consumers, the number of applications for orders to pay submitted to the Enforcement Authority has been used as an argument that consumers have taken out instant loans even though they lacked repayment capacity. The number of applications for orders to pay has also increased over the years.</p>
<p>When a new Consumer Credit Act was enacted in 2010, there was discussion of consumer protection problems associated with instant loans and certain exceptions from the law, which had previously applied to smaller, more short-term loans, were eliminated. A new law was enacted in 2014 for companies that issue loans to consumers and which previously had not required special authorisation and were not under the supervision of Finansinspektionen. Consumer protection problems, especially in relation to instant loans, were the reason such legislation under commercial law was considered necessary.</p>
<h2>The instant loan market today</h2>
<p>What is an instant loan?</p>
<p>An initial question for the Committee was to determine the criteria that distinguish an instant loan. There is no accepted definition of this form of loan. The following rough description is usually used: instant loans are loans that are to be repaid quickly, often within one to three months, are loans for relatively small amounts, usually from one to a few thousand kronor, and the loans are easy to apply for via text message or online.</p>
<p>Loans of SEK 1,000 or up to a maximum of SEK 5,000 with a repayment term of one month were offered by about 30 companies while the Committee was in progress. Several of these companies also offer larger loans of up to about SEK 20,000, with repayment terms of less than one year. Based on the products available in the market, the Committee has found that an instant loan can be described as  a loan of a small amount, up to SEK 20,000  a loan that must be repaid within a short time, between one and ten months  a loan with a high APR, from 100 per cent to several thousand per cent.</p>
<p>The Committee has determined that the instant loan industry may be regarded as rapidly changing. During the course of the inquiry, several companies have altered their range of loan products in terms of amount, repayment terms and costs. The boundaries of that considered an instant loan may thus be regarded as fluid.</p>
<p>Terms and conditions in the instant loan market</p>
<p>As part of its process, the Committee has monitored and identified instant loan terms and conditions.</p>
<p>Borrowing rates for instant loans are much higher than for the rest of the credit market. Some lenders charge interest only, others charge interest and a fee. Because all lenders are permitted to charge fees but not all do so, the borrowing rates sometimes stated in current contractual terms and conditions may be misleadingly high. The Committee has assessed borrowing rate levels as being in the range of 20 to about 250 per cent. However, within that range, it is more common for borrowing rates to be at 50 per cent and up.</p>
<p>Some instant loan companies state that consumers may be eligible to borrow even if they have defaults, others do not. Some companies require applicants to have a minimum annual income or be of a minimum age – which may involve annual income of around SEK 100,000. Other companies do not apply any such fixed limits.</p>
<p>In theory, all instant loan companies obtain a credit report. The companies use various credit reporting companies.</p>
<p>Information and marketing</p>
<p>The internet is the primary channel for marketing instant loans. The Committee finds that most websites provide clear and objective information about the cost of credit. Otherwise, the information content of the websites varies, although on most sites it is easy to find information about other contractual terms and conditions, such as what happens if the borrower fails to pay on time. Many companies also provide information that can be considered as warning consumers against taking out a loan if there is risk that they will be unable to repay the loan.</p>
<p>In their marketing materials, instant loan companies often emphasise how easy it is to apply and that loans are paid out quickly. There are, however, several steps to the application process – customers must provide information about themselves and their financial circumstances and must be able to identify themselves.</p>
<p>Consideration of applications for authorisation and supervision by Finansinspektionen</p>
<p>The Certain Consumer Credit-related Operations Act (2014:275) went into effect in July 2014. Since that time, instant loan companies and other undertakings that are not banks or other credit institutions must be authorised by Finansinspektionen to conduct consumer credit-related operations. Companies that have been granted authorisation by Finansinspektionen are called consumer credit institutions . During the course of the inquiry, Finansinspektionen has considered the companies’ applications for authorisation and has successively granted these authorisations. Companies whose applications for authorisation have not yet been considered have also had the right to continue conducting operations. Almost 10 instant loan companies (of about 30 applicants) have not been granted authorisation by Finansinspektionen and as of the end of the inquiry, not all applications for authorisation by instant loan companies had yet been considered. Only companies that have been authorised are required to report information about their lending volumes, the number of loans written, interest income, etc., to Finansinspektionen.</p>
<p>An estimate from Finansinspektionen, which is based on reporting from instant loan companies that have been authorised to conduct operations, is that the issuance of instant loans during 2016 from authorised companies will comprise about 450,000 loans, with a total loan volume of SEK 1.8 billion. The size of an average loan is about SEK 4,000.</p>
<h2>Consumer protection problems today</h2>
<p>The instant loan market has changed over the years and certain phenomena previously criticised, such as that this form of loan primarily attracts young adults, no longer occur. Most of the knowledge about instant loans has been acquired from consumers who have difficulties repaying their instant loans. There is thus relatively little knowledge about consumers who take out instant loans and repay them on time. Based on the input material that the Committee has read and obtained, however, the Committee finds that consumer protection problems associated with instant loans can be described as follows.</p>
<p>Consumers who take out instant loans have limited access to other ways to borrow at lower cost, such as getting an ordinary bank loan or having a credit card. Consumers who take out instant loans are thus assessed as having lower credit scores than other consumers. A low credit score may be due to several different factors and the credit score is a weighted assessment of these factors. Low income, other credit obligations and defaults are factors that typically result in a lower credit score. The Committee concurs with the opinion expressed in our Committee Directive: instant loans target a group of consumers who can be considered high-risk  consumers . These consumers are at greater risk than others of not being able to repay their loans.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the Committee, however, instant loans are far from the only consumer protection problem in the credit market. At present, the entire credit market involves risks of problems related to household debt and over-indebtedness. The Committee considers the wide array of consumer credits available on the market and the possibility of taking out multiple loans from different lenders to be significant risk factors for more consumers than those who can be categorised as high-risk consumers. The material the Committee has studied from sources including the Enforcement Authority and budget and debt counsellors in Sweden indicates that the road to taking out an instant loan goes over other forms of consumption credit – other unsecured loans, purchases against invoice and hire purchases.</p>
<p>As a rationale for the Committee’s proposal, it has provided in its report a general account of various economic models that can explain consumer choices in the credit market. Research in behavioural economics describes how phenomena such as lack of self-control and unrealistic optimism can affect financial decisions. Although no behavioural economics studies of the Swedish credit market have thus far been performed, the Committee believes it is important to take into account that people in general do not always take decisions that can be considered as maximising their own economic utility as defined by classical economic theory.</p>
<h2>The Committee’s deliberations</h2>
<p>General information about the aim of the Committee’s proposal</p>
<p>All of the measures that the Committee has proposed contribute to the more general aim of the inquiry, but in various ways. The Committee believes that all are necessary to achieve a high level of consumer protection and to sufficiently mitigate the risks that consumers will apply for and be granted loans that they will not be able to repay as intended. The Committee’s proposal is thus intended to restrict lending to high-risk consumers, create more reasonable terms and conditions for consumers and protect consumers who, despite all, are granted loans that they have difficulty paying back.</p>
<p>Credit gives consumers opportunities to plan and arrange their finances and smooth their consumption over time. Credit thus contributes to economic growth and gives consumers the freedom to make choices. But when consumers take out loans that they are unable to repay, they end up in debt and in a situation in which they must pay very high costs – not only the original agreed cost of credit and penalty interest, but also the costs of collecting the debt. This entails risk that consumers will have to devote a large portion of their financial resources to the credit obligation, thus limiting their freedom and opportunity to plan their finances as they prefer. The Committee therefore finds it justified to introduce measures to achieve more restrictive lending.</p>
<p>The definition of high-cost credits</p>
<p>The Committee’s definition applies to a few other forms of credit in addition to what may be termed instant loans. The main reason for this is that there are other credits that can be presumed to be offered to high-risk consumers, especially people with defaults on their credit records, and which are distinguished by a relatively high APR, although not as high as for instant loans. One foreseeable effect of introducing regulation of a particular form of credit is also that lenders will change their product mix in order to circumvent the regulation. A definition should therefore, to the greatest possible extent, be drafted in such a way that lending to high-risk consumers cannot continue without being covered by the regulation.</p>
<p>The Committee’s definition does not cover credit purchases.</p>
<p>Regardless of the APR, a purchase against invoice or the use of a credit card cannot be considered a high-risk credit. The reason the Committee excluded credit purchases is that its remit was mainly to consider measures applicable to instant loans. The framework of the</p>
<p>Committee’s directive and the duration of the inquiry thus did not provide the conditions for identifying and analysing the credit purchase market in such a manner that the Committee’s main proposal can cover this form of credit.</p>
<p>Information in connection with marketing of high-cost credits</p>
<p>Information in connection with marketing of high-cost credits can increase consumers’ awareness of the risks associated with debt and give them an opportunity to examine their finances and their needs for a loan. This may encourage greater caution before consumers apply for loans and help reduce the number of consumers who apply for risky loans.</p>
<p>Interest cap and cost cap</p>
<p>The Committee finds that an information requirement is insufficient to strengthen consumer protection. Measures should therefore also be introduced that reduce the financial incentives to issue loans to high-risk consumers.</p>
<p>Lenders’ opportunities to charge high interest rates for their loans also generate high revenues, which can be used to compensate for credit losses. The effective Swedish debt collection system and the option to charge penalty interest are key conditions for a strict repayment norm and an efficient economy. However, they also mean that lenders’ risks are not as high even if they lend to consumers who are subsequently unable to pay on time. Thanks to penalty interest, even claims of this kind can generate relatively good returns. At present, penalty interest can theoretically accrue for an unlimited period of time. An interest cap and a cost cap are a combination of measures aimed at inducing lenders to give greater consideration to the risk that consumers will end up in payment difficulties and thus be more restrictive in their lending. An interest cap limits lenders’ opportunities to offset credit losses with high interest income, while the cost cap will mean that claims in default will have limited value. These provisions will also lead to more reasonable terms and conditions in the high-risk credit market.</p>
<p>Limitation of rollovers</p>
<p>A particular consumer protection problem in the high-cost credit market is that consumers are tempted to repeatedly roll over a shortterm loan. If rollovers are granted to consumers with insufficient repayment capacity, the rollovers lead to an increased cost of credit that impairs finances without leading to freedom from debt. Postponing repayment of the loan is probably especially appealing to consumers with narrow margins in their personal finances and the total cost of many rollovers can be particularly difficult to predict. Short-term loans, and thus the incentive to roll them over, will probably still exist even if an interest cap and cost cap are implemented. The Committee therefore proposes the introduction of a restriction on rollovers, although lenders should always be able to extend the loan duration so that the consumer can be given a reasonable repayment plan.</p>
<p>A margin in the left-to-live-on calculation</p>
<p>The Committee’s aforementioned proposals are aimed at more restrictive lending to high-risk consumers. As there will still be scope to issue risky loans, special requirements should be imposed for credit checking, which, in the Committee’s view, does not always guarantee that only consumers who genuinely have the capacity to repay are granted loans. At present, lenders cannot verify all the information upon which the “left-to-live-on” calculation is based. Nor is there any explicit obligation upon lenders to take into consideration the risk of errors in the basis for the credit check. If lenders cannot grant loans in cases when a consumer, according to the calculations performed, has very narrow margins left after the credit claim has been paid, this will reduce the risk that consumers will be granted loans that later lead to difficulties repaying the amount borrowed plus costs.</p>
<p>Credit checking of free loans</p>
<p>Several lenders offer instant loans that are completely free, but even a loan for which there are zero costs entails a risk to consumers of being dragged into debt problems. Lenders should therefore be legally required to perform a credit check before granting such loans.</p>
<p>Moderation in marketing</p>
<p>The consumer credit market as a whole entails risks of overindebtedness. Due to the wide array of different kinds of credit available, consumers may have multiple credit obligations and build up a larger and larger debt burden over time. Whether or not the debt burden leads to over-indebtedness may depend upon several factors, such as sudden changes in the consumer’s income. Greater consideration should be given to the risks of consumer credits when assessing the moderation of marketing so that marketing does not tempt consumers to take thoughtless decisions.</p>
<p>Measures that are not proposed – sanction under private law and written contracts requirement</p>
<p>A sanction under private law in connection with deficient credit checking is a legislative measure that has been previously considered on several occasions but which has not resulted in the introduction of a statutory provision. There is already some leeway to adjust an individual’s payment liability if a lender has been remiss in its responsibility to perform a credit check.</p>
<p>The Committee has determined that a legal rule imposing a sanction under private law would be complex and difficult to apply. Nor does the Committee believe that such a rule would be an effective means of bringing pressure to bear on lenders to perform more careful credit checks. It is more likely to lead to many unnecessary legal disputes.</p>
<p>As regards a requirement that all contracts must be made in writing, this could help give consumers more time and better opportunity to consider the terms and conditions before entering into a credit agreement. However, considering how a written contracts requirement might be drafted – where various forms of electronic documents might be considered written – the Committee’s view is that consumers would hardly be given more time before the contract is made. Nor does the Committee believe that a written contracts requirement would encourage consumers to consider the contents of the agreement or their own need to borrow more thoroughly than they do today. Consumers are already provided information about contractual terms and conditions, especially the cost of credit, and are free to take as much time as they wish to consider this information. Several lenders also already have procedures that essentially meet written contract requirements, either by electronic means or by requiring the consumer to sign a written document.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposals</h2>
<p>Consequences for consumers</p>
<p>The proposals are aimed at reducing the risk that consumers will take out loans that they cannot repay on time. Through the proposals, lending that entails such risks should decline in scope and fewer consumers would thus end up saddled with problematic debt. The proposals should also lead to market terms and conditions becoming more reasonable and to additional protection for consumers by ensuring that the debt cannot grow above a certain level.</p>
<p>More restrictive lending will probably also mean that certain consumers will no longer have access to credit. However, the Committee does not find that the proposals have the potential to create a larger illegal money lending market.</p>
<p>Consequences for lending companies</p>
<p>The proposals mainly affect instant loan companies, but also a few other lenders who offer credits that are covered by the Committee’s definition of high-cost credit. The interest cap, however, mainly affects instant loan companies.</p>
<p>The companies must adapt their product ranges and marketing to comply with the new regulation. Credit check requirements will mean that companies will have to implement new procedures in their lending process. This will entail certain administrative costs, such as for revising their websites and training their employees. These costs are of a non-recurring nature and have been assessed as minor costs for the companies.</p>
<p>The interest cap will reduce the interest income of instant loan companies. The main effect of the cost cap will be that companies that offer high-cost credits will not be able to generate the same revenues when consumers fall behind in their payments.</p>
<p>One probable effect of an interest cap is that some companies will offer forms of credit other than instant loans, such as credit lines or larger loans with longer repayment terms.</p>
<p>When opportunities to generate income are reduced, some companies may discontinue their lending operations and the number of market actors may go down.</p>
<p>The proposals are unlikely to generate either cost increases or savings for any government agency.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>The Committee recommends that the proposals enter into force on 1 July 2018.</p>
