<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In accordance with the Government’s directive, the inquiry has drawn up a broad-based evidence concerning municipal culture schools. This report describes the history of this activity and its current status, as well as the barriers that stand in the way of the participation of children and young people. It also addresses certain wider cultural trends and the tensions that have an impact on the conditions for municipal music and culture schools. The inquiry then illustrates its assessments and proposals against this overall background. The proposals in this report pertain to that which the inquiry judges to be the core activities of municipal culture schools, i.e. the teaching, the projects and other activities that are undertaken in children and young people’s free time.</p>
<h2>Legal framework desirable but not practicable</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s assessment is that a legal framework in the form of a culture schools act would be most effective as a basis for illustrating the national importance of culture schools. Against the background of the economic consequences of what is known as the financing principle, the inquiry’s assessment is that it is not possible to submit a draft bill to the Government. Nor does the inquiry consider culture schools financed entirely by central government, which is the consequence of the strict application of the aforementioned principle, as a goal in itself. Rather, what is deemed of pressing importance is municipal culture schools that are regulated by law.</p>
<p>Instead, the inquiry proposes national objectives to serve as guidance for municipal culture schools and a number of connected proposals. An evaluation should be undertaken after three years in order to establish what impact the proposals have had on children and young people’s access to inclusive culture schools that has an independent foundation. If the results of the evaluation indicate that there is still a lack of access to equal and accessible cultural education and if the financial situation permits, the Government should consider legislating to make municipal culture schools obligatory. Culture schools are, as is the case for other municipal activities, in the interests of the whole of society.</p>
<h2>New infrastructure for municipal culture schools</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes new infrastructure, the basis of which is national objectives for culture school, and a number of associated proposals that aim to give children and young people in the entire country, regardless of their background and the environment in which they are growing up, greater access to inclusive culture schools. Developing culture schools to make them more inclusive will remain a challenge. With these proposals, the inquiry would like to stipulate that this responsibility should not rest solely on the shoulders of the municipalities; instead, in the interests of the nation and the regions, this responsibility needs to be shared.</p>
<h2>National objectives</h2>
<p>Many municipalities have begun ambitious efforts to develop their culture schools in order to reinforce their relevance in a changed world. The inquiry is of the opinion that the introduction of national objectives gives this activity a clear direction, which can benefit this ongoing development. The inquiry proposes that the Government present the following objectives for municipal culture schools to the Riksdag:</p>
<p>Municipal culture schools shall  provide children and young people with the opportunity to learn, practice and experience artistic expression at first hand, in groups,  be carried out in children and young people’s free time,  be characterised by a high quality and be broad artistically and in terms of the genres covered, with activities in three or more types of artistic expression,  apply an educational philosophy that is based on the child’s own experiences and interests,  provide children and young people with good opportunities to have an influence on the structure and content of the activity,  have a high proportion of educationally and artistically trained staff,  take place in premises that are adapted to the activity and are appropriately equipped,  actively work to inform the municipality’s children and young people about the culture school and to provide them with the opportunity to participate in its activities, and  work in broad partnership and conduct outreach activities with and the community at large.</p>
<p>In order to monitor and support municipal efforts based on these objectives, the inquiry proposes the establishment of a national culture schools centre that has responsibility for national monitoring and statistics.</p>
<h2>National culture schools centre</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s assessment is that one of the biggest challenges of municipalities is meeting their cultural schools’ needs for knowledge development, experience exchange, collaboration and monitoring. If these needs are not met, there is a risk of the activity losing its strong position in society as a result of a lack of relevance from a citizen’s perspective.</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that a national culture schools centre be established to act as a special decision-making body within the Swedish Arts Council, with responsibility for national monitoring, promoting the exchanging of experience and collaboration, promoting knowledge related to culture schools with basic research and proven experience and allocating central government grants.</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that a national culture schools centre will allocate a development grant to culture schools, a temporary operating grant to culture schools and a grant to activities involving advanced cutting-edge expertise.</p>
<p>The national cultural education centre is, together with the municipal culture schools and greater coordination at the regional level, intended to be part of a collaborative chain that has the needs of municipalities at its forefront. The national cultural education centre is proposed as the link that closes this chain at the national level and it should be tasked with gathering, analysing and conveying these experiences, primarily to the municipal culture schools, but also to the wider community.</p>
<h2>Grants for regional coordination</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the grants regulated in ordinance (2010:2012) on certain central government grants to regional cultural activities be increased by SEK 10 million in order to strengthen the regional coordination of municipal culture schools. A new focus for this grant is dependent on an addendum to the grant’s ordinance that adds culture schools  as a new operational area. The amount proposed has been calculated on the basis of SEK 0.5 million for each of the country’s twenty county councils and Gotland</p>
<p>Municipality.</p>
<p>While the inquiry’s work has been ongoing, the municipalities have demonstrated their need for improved infrastructure, with a clear division of responsibility between central government, county council and municipality that can contribute to increased collaboration. A regional support mechanism for coordination, focused on the needs of cultural schools, can be achieved through a grant directed at the county councils. In a similar manner to how regional library activities have a major significance to public libraries, the inquiry believes that increased regional coordination can provide considerable encouragement to the development of cultural schools. Collaboration initiatives have been implemented between municipalities and with regional level involvement in several parts of the country. If this collaboration is to be lasting, the inquiry believes that structures involving permanent financing are required.</p>
<p>The sum total of the cultural resources in a county provided principally by the municipality, county council or central government and also cultural actors from the independent cultural sector is great. By making better use of this potential, children and young people’s access to a varied and wide range of cultural education can improve. The inquiry also sees the positive effects for the collaborating partners, for example improved opportunities to develop skills.</p>
<p>It is proposed that a national cultural education centre have a coordinating and supportive role in relation to the functions that the county councils choose to establish.</p>
<p>While it is certainly true that it is not the job of central government to control how municipalities and county councils work together, central government can still contribute to improving the conditions in which collaboration on a voluntary basis comes about. Central government finances regional cultural activities, together with the county councils and municipalities and tries to ensure the resources are used wisely. Paying particular attention to children and young people’s right to culture is also expressed in the national cultural policy objectives, which govern central government actions and guide those of municipalities and county councils.</p>
<h2>Development grants</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes that a new central government grant of SEK 200 million be established in order to foster the development of municipal cultural education. The sector as a whole is very varied, ranging from municipalities that provide no culture school at all to those that conduct systematic quality management. It is the inquiry’s belief that there are grounds to establish a central government stimulus grant that can meet the wide range of development needs municipalities currently have.</p>
<p>The three principal areas below can be said to summarise the fields in which the development needs are judged to be greatest, but there are other areas that should be entitled to grants:  Widening the area of visual arts  Inclusion and accessibility  Educational development</p>
<p>Within these areas, initiatives that increase participation by children and young people with intellectual or physical disabilities are to be prioritised. Otherwise, the local needs are to serve as a guide and the range of initiatives that are granted funding should be wide.</p>
<p>Allocation and monitoring of the central government grant should be a task for a national cultural education centre. It is proposed that one municipality or municipalities working together be able to apply for the grant. A coordinating function at the regional level should also be able to apply for development grants in partnership with municipalities. A strategic action plan shall be appended to applications. One further condition in order to take advantage of this support is that the culture school has to offer or have the intention of offering activities within at least three areas of the arts.</p>
<h2>Temporary operating grant for culture schools</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes a temporary operating grant to cultural schools of SEK 10 million be established. Municipalities with a small population and low population density are to have access to a grant of SEK 500 000, provided they make their own a financial commitment of 50 per cent of the amount applied for. It is proposed that the future national cultural education centre be responsible for allocating the grant.</p>
<p>Providing culture schools is a voluntary commitment that is within the scope of municipal self-government. The inquiry’s survey indicates that a certain type of municipality with a small population and low population density tends, for structural reasons, is less likely to provide cultural education activities than other municipalities. The grant should therefore contribute to starting or strengthening current culture schools in the municipalities that meet the grant’s criteria.</p>
<h2>Grant for national cutting-edge expertise</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes that a central government grant of SEK 5 million for cultural education activities with national cutting-edge expertise be established. It is proposed that allocation and monitoring of the central government grant be a task for the proposed national culture schools centre.</p>
<p>The aim of the grant is to provide especially interested young people with opportunities to meet professionally active people at an advanced level. The inquiry believes that initiatives in which artistic innovation are integrated are of particular interest. An activity of this type is to be based on a broad collaboration with other relevant actors and be open to especially interested young people from the entire country.</p>
<p>The applicant is to contribute through a financial commitment that is equivalent to the size of the grant applied for, the aim being to take responsibility at the local level and make an increase in volume possible.</p>
<h2>Reinforce educational pathways in order to achieve an inclusive culture schools sector that stands on an independent foundation</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s assessment is that the educational pathways into municipal culture schools should be reinforced in order to improve the supply of skilled staff. This issue is central to the cultural schools sector and has been highlighted as a priority during all consultations. Current higher education study programmes cover some parts of the municipalities’ recruitment needs.</p>
<p>Culture schools are in a transitional period that is characterised by a desire to broaden the range of forms of cultural expression offered and to increase the inclusion of children and young people. At the same time, municipalities are faced with the prospect in the years ahead of recruiting new staff due to the high average age of the teaching profession. The teachers currently being employed will put their stamp on the direction culture schools take for a long time to come.</p>
<p>Culture schools have much in common with schools, but culture schools also have their own characteristics such as voluntary participation, no curriculum and a flexibility with respect to children and young people’s own interests. Culture schools are also marked by their breadth in terms of the field of the arts and public activities. Culture schools are artistic meeting places that are given legitimacy by their voluntary nature and a democratic basic outlook on everyone’s right to culture. The inquiry is of the opinion that there is good reason to elucidate this distinctiveness on the basis of the educational foundations on which the culture schools sector rests and from this, build up expertise specific to a culture schools sector that stands on an independent foundation.</p>
<p>In order to provide sufficient qualified staff to meet municipalities’ needs, a teacher training programme that is built around a core that expresses the distinctiveness of culture schools. Culture schools require teaching skills in areas of the arts that are not found within the scope of any of the existing training programmes’ main fields of study.</p>
<p>New educational pathways can contribute to increasing the diversity of municipalities’ employees. Society should make better use of the skills people with an artistic background who have immigrated to Sweden have and who do not automatically fit into the Swedish academic context. Educators such as these would be able to contribute with another type of knowledge than that which is currently represented at our higher education institutions and is, this inquiry believes, important if culture schools are to better reflect contemporary Swedish society. The inquiry is of the opinion that municipal culture schools have a great potential to contribute to improved integration.</p>
<p>The concept of education must constantly be modified as society develops and the current challenge lies in adapting this concept to the pluralistic and multicultural society in which we live. Accordingly, the teaching provided in culture schools needs to find forms that, to a great extent, allow it to encounter children and young people in the culture in which they are, but also needs to allow children to encounter unfamiliar cultural manifestations. An aspiration such as this to increase inclusion is evident in many of today’s culture schools.</p>
<h2>Create the potential for bachelor’s degrees in more artistic subjects</h2>
<p>The inquiry has noted that several higher education institutions have in recent years established new undergraduate programmes in areas that are relevant to culture schools. All of these study programmes are worth 180 higher education credits and are based on the higher education institution’s degree-awarding powers in a main field of study. The inquiry sees a need for more and new fields of study to be developed at the higher education institutions in order to better meet culture schools’ current requirements for qualified staff, for example within film.</p>
<h2>Adapted teacher training programmes</h2>
<p>The investigation’s assessment is that an adaptation of teacher training programmes is required in order to better meet municipalities’ needs for qualified staff. Many municipalities require staff for combined posts, i.e. teaching staff that have the skills to work in both schools and culture schools. This means that municipalities often demand people with a teaching degree. As teacher training programmes are not intended for the activities of culture schools, these programmes should open themselves to culture schools be introducing courses that relate to the teaching that takes place in culture schools, with the same also being true for work placements.</p>
<h2>Culture school teacher a new vocational qualification</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes that a new vocational qualification of culture school teacher, worth 90 higher education credits, be established. The study programme is to be built around a core that expresses the distinctiveness of culture schools. A programme targeting the specific educational environment of culture schools is essential for many reasons, but especially in order to strengthen the educational foundations of the culture schools sector. Municipalities have a great need for teaching skills in areas of the arts that are not found within the scope of any of the existing training programmes’ main fields of study. Working in a culture school requires both artistic and teaching skills, which means that a culture schools teaching qualification should have a basis in educational science, but with artistic skills as an entry requirement.</p>
<p>This type of study programme can, on the basis of the artistic background applicants bring with them, encompass a wide range of contemporary artistic fields and genres, but can also be flexible to future fields that are not yet known. It can also provide space for artistic variation, depending on local requirements. The study programme proposes could be studied part time so as to allow teachers who are already working the opportunity to participate in parallel with their job in a culture school. A vocational qualification that leads to culture school teacher and is worth 90 higher education credits may be appropriate for people with a higher artistic education who want to gain access to a larger labour market. A vocational qualification like this may also be appropriate for people with artistic skills, but who do not have eligibility through higher artistic studies. Teachers such as this, and also those with an artistic background outside of Sweden, would be able to contribute with knowledge that is different to those who are currently represented at our higher education institutions. It is the inquiry’s opinion that a reinforcement such as this is important if culture schools are to reflect contemporary Swedish society better than they do currently.</p>
<h2>Culture school-related research</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposed that the Government charges the Swedish Research Council with issuing a call for proposals concerning SEK 20 million for 2018 to invest in research that is relevant to culture schools. The research should be focused on field of educational science. It is also proposed that the Government charge the Swedish Research Council with issuing a call for proposals concerning SEK 2 million per year over four years, beginning in 2019, for establishing a national research schools for Culture School Didactics  that leads to a degree of licentiate.</p>
<p>Research concerning young people’s learning in their free time is a multi-faceted area that is attracting growing interest, but only a few projects have been granted funding thus far. The Swedish Research Council is of the opinion that the investments made in Sweden in publicly organised recreational activities result in a need for further research. This is very much the case for the culture schools sector, which is need of research with greater continuity and scope than that being conducted today. Research into learning and teaching in aesthetic subjects is being conducted, but very little is based on the perspective and needs of municipal culture schools.</p>
<p>The inquiry argues that there needs to be stimulation measures of various types in order to bring about work that has a basis in research and proven experience, the volume, breadth and quality of which responds to needs municipalities have to meet the challenges with which culture schools are currently faced and will face in the future.</p>
<h2>The inquiry’s recommendations</h2>
<p>The inquiry has selected a number of exemplary working practices in the form of recommendations for municipalities that promote development towards an inclusive culture schools sector that stands on an independent foundation. A national culture schools centre is proposed that has the task of conducting various forms of promotional work that supports municipalities work with culture schools.</p>
