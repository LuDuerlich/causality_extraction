<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Committee was asked to review government grants to women's organisations. The assignment included inter alia  the evaluation of government grants to women's organisations as well as, where necessary, proposals for new objectives and measures that can improve the realisation of goals and effectiveness of these grants. The directive also required the Committee to discuss whether new forms of organisations, for example networks, should be granted support. Finally, the Committee was to examine the possibilities of allowing an existing authority other than the Government to allocate government grants.</p>
<p>Sweden's vibrant organisational culture was always and still is an asset to the development of society and enrichment of democracy. Naturally, women's organisations are an essential part of this and are particularly important for carrying gender equality work forward. The work of the women's organisations spans a wide field in practically every sector of society and is a vital force in society. The Committee's proposals are based on the aspects of democracy, gender equality and popular movements.</p>
<p>The Committee has met representatives of some 20 women's organisations that have applied for a government grant. Through these meetings, extensive material from the organisations concerning their activities, replies to questionnaires, journals and newspapers, web sites, letters and conversations, the Committee has been able to piece together a picture of women's organisations. Together with applications for grants and their supporting documentation, this material has formed the basis for an evaluation of government grants to women's organisations.</p>
<p>In the Committee's view it is essential that for its part the Government clarifies the purpose of grants to women's organisations. There are two aspects to this support, on the one hand grants to popular movements for women's organisations, on the other hand, support to gender equality work. The reason for the grant forms the basis for the definition of a women's organisation that is entitled to a government grant which is: an organisation of which at least half the members are women and whose main task is to promote the position of women in society for the purpose of realising equality between women and men. The Committee has found</p>
<p>no reason to reformulate this definition. In the light of the development of gender equality work in recent years and the establishment of men's organisations that work to achieve gender equality, the Committee proposes that men's organisations may also be entitled to support. A men's organisation is defined as an organisation of which at least half the members are men and whose main task is to promote the position of women in society for the purpose of realising equality between women and men, which is justified by the structurally subordinate position of women.</p>
<p>An essential aspect of the Committee's work was to propose changes to the present grants system in order to adapt it to today's social structure and to be better able to meet the needs of the organisations, at the same time as encouraging renewal. Like many other organisations, women's organisations have had to adapt their activities to new member patterns which has meant, among other things, a greater focus on projects, fewer local meetings and this combined with technological developments that have created new possibilities to communicate.</p>
<p>Our ambition has been to create a grants system in which the limited resources available are divided among women's organisations entitled to government grants as fairly, simply and clearly as possible. According to the proposal the grant should be divided into three parts: organisational support, operations support and project support. The organisational support is to be regarded as support to popular movements while operations support and project support mean more management by objectives in the context of government grants. Organisational support and operations support is reserved for organisations that fulfil the abovementioned criteria while project support may also be available to organisations and networks that want to carry out gender equality projects and methods development of national interest.</p>
<p>The Committee discussed the question as to whether "new" forms of organisations, for example networks, might be eligible for government grants. In this context it was established that the question of networks and their constitution is complicated and extensive. The Committee proposes a comprehensive study of the network issue in which an opinion is given as to whether they may be granted organisational support. At the same time, the Committee proposes that networks be given the opportunity to apply for project support. On the matter of the distribution of grants, the Committee contacted the Equal Opportunities Ombudsman. The Committee considers that should the remit of the Equal Opportunities Ombudsman be extended, distribution of government grants to women's organisations might be a relevant task for the Ombudsman.</p>
<p>The proposal for future government grants to women's organisations contains innovations in that more organisations will be entitled to support, inter alia  men's organisations. Project support has been opened so that considerably more organisations can apply for it, for example networks. The Committee also proposes that a continuous evaluation of this support be carried out. All in all this requires increased resources for grants to women's organisations.</p>
