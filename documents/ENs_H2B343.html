<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Our remit</h2>
<p>We have been instructed to consider and propose the amendments needed to bring about modern criminal law regulations for drug offences and drug smuggling offences that clearly express a strict, firm and consistent approach to all illegal handling of drugs. In this context, our task has been to:  survey and analyse the case law;  decide on the circumstances to which particular attention should be paid in assessing whether an offence is gross;  consider the need for amendments with regard to the graduation of drug offences and drug smuggling offences; and  otherwise consider the need for amendments in the scales of penalties for these offences.</p>
<h2>Our assessments and proposals</h2>
<p>Our assessment is that the scales of penalties for drug offences and drug smuggling offences of a normal degree of seriousness and the minor forms of these offences should not be amended. However, in our assessment there are grounds to divide the scales of penalties for gross drug offences and gross drug smuggling offences.</p>
<p>The current scale of penalties for gross drug offences and gross drug smuggling offences is relatively broad, with imprisonment ranging from two to ten years. The gross offences include many different types of offences of varying degrees of seriousness. In our view, it is possible to single out certain offences that are so serious that they should result in penalties at the upper end of the current</p>
<p>scale for gross offences. These include certain offences that concern the handling of very large quantities of drugs.</p>
<p>We therefore propose a division of the scales of penalties for gross drug offences and gross drug smuggling offences, which currently are imprisonment for a minimum of two years up to a maximum of ten years. Under our proposal, gross drug offences or gross drug smuggling offences will result in imprisonment for a minimum of two years and a maximum of seven years. Drug offences or drug smuggling offences that are regarded as excep- tionally gross will result in imprisonment for a minimum of six years and a maximum of ten years.</p>
<p>The purpose of the proposal to divide the scale of penalties is to make the legislation clearer and to create the conditions for the courts to fully take account of all circumstances of relevance to penal value in drug-related cases and to impose the appropriate sentence for a given offence. The intention is not to influence the levels of penalties in general. However, our proposal means that penalties will be tightened for certain offences that concern the handling of very large quantities of drugs. In this way, a strict approach to the illegal handling of drugs will be clearly expressed.</p>
<p>Our view is that the current criteria for classification as a ‘gross drug offence’ and a ‘gross drug smuggling offence’ adequately cover the cases for which the classification ‘gross offence’ should be reserved. These criteria have also proved to function well despite changes in society. It is therefore our assessment that the special criteria should not be amended.</p>
<p>We propose that the same criteria should apply to exceptionally gross offences and gross offences, as the circumstances enumerated are also appropriate and adequate when assessing whether the offence is exceptionally gross. If the circumstances given are sufficiently aggravating, the offence is to be assigned the scale of penalties for exceptionally gross offences.</p>
<p>We propose that the legislative amendments enter into force on 1 July 2015.</p>
