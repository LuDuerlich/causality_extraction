<p>The terms of reference</p>
<p>The original terms of reference of the Bankruptcy Administration Supervision Commission in 1997 have been – with the starting point that the supervision function shall be public and linked to the Enforcement Services (Kronofogdemyndigheterna – KFM) and that the National Tax Board's (Riksskatteverket – RSV's) central function should be retained – to investigate</p>
<p>– what aims and what detailed content public bankruptcy administration supervision shall have,</p>
<p>– what ought to apply for the appointment and payment of fees for bankruptcy administrators and</p>
<p>– whether bankruptcy expenses viewed overall can be reduced and, in that event, how this can be achieved.</p>
<p>The terms of reference have, by a supplementary directive in 1998 concerning expenses and administration in connection with bankruptcy, been defined in more detail to relate to</p>
<p>– the need for coordination of charges in bankruptcy together with certain issues about other expenses in connection with bankruptcy and</p>
<p>– certain questions concerning the administrator's reports, etc.</p>
<p>By a supplementary directive in 1999, the task has been extended so that the investigation, though still with the starting point that bankruptcy administration supervision ought to be public, should without preconceived views review the future structure of the supervisory function. The Commission should, when conducting this review, take into account the public statements that the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Civil-Law Legislation made in the report 1998/99:LU11 on the aims of a reform and the questions that were dealt with in the Private Members' Bill 1998/99:L301.</p>
<p>The main points of the report</p>
<p>A new, public bankruptcy administration supervision</p>
<p>The overall purpose of the public supervision shall be, according to the proposal, to monitor that the bankruptcy administration promotes the best possible outcome for the creditors and satisfies the interests of the community in connection with bankruptcy. Furthermore, it shall be monitored whether the administration is conducted in compliance with the Bankruptcy Act (1987:672, Konkurslagen – KL) and other statutes. The main part of the supervision should be at the economic level. The proposed formulation of the purposes provides that supervision also shall work to ensure that the winding up of a bankruptcy is not unnecessarily delayed.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the methods for public supervision are altered. Supervision shall be general in the sense that no bankruptcies are left outside of any control. However, supervision shall be selective and its scope adapted to the need of public control in the individual bankruptcy. The supervisory body shall, at an early stage, decide about the need for monitoring. This is simplified in the proposal by a requirement that the bankruptcy administrator, at the initial phase of the bankruptcy, should provide written notification about the scope and nature of the bankruptcy (bankruptcy administrator report). Guided by the report, the supervisory body shall plan the need for supervision.</p>
<p>A basic control shall be conducted in all bankruptcies. This involves a control of legality of a formal kind, i.e., monitoring that the bankruptcy administrator submits the prescribed documents on time and that these satisfy the requirements of the Act. In many bankruptcies involving uncomplicated circumstances, it should normally be sufficient with the basic control. This also serves as a documentary basis to determine whether a more extensive monitoring of the bankruptcy administration should be conducted.</p>
<p>An extended supervision may be appropriate, primarily in bankruptcies where there are assets of some value or which relate to a business operation that is not of a minor nature. How extensive such supervision should be is determined by the supervisory body in the individual case. The supervisory body may, in accordance with the proposal, limit supervision to that which is essential for control having regard to the scope of the bankruptcy and its nature. This means that the supervisory body is at liberty to restrict, according to the circumstances, the monitoring to a basic control also in somewhat larger bankruptcies.</p>
<p>In bankruptcies where supervision is from the outset restricted to a basic control, the supervisory body may transfer to an extended supervision, provided this is justified having regard to matters that have subsequently transpired. The supervisory body can also decide to subsequently examine in detail a number of bankruptcies selected at random on the basis of a particularly theme such as a particular district, administrator or business sector. Thus, by such a theme examination it will be possible, for example, to make a random check of how the bankruptcy administrator has managed the assets of a smaller business operation.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the public bankruptcy supervision is given a new structure. Today, the supervision is linked to KFM, the authority that according to the current wording of the Bankruptcy Act is the supervisory authority. According to the proposal, the supervision shall be exercised by an independent, national authority (The Bankruptcy Administration Supervisory Authority). This shall neither be placed structurally within the KFM's budget frame nor be subordinated to RSV. Besides the supervisory function, the new authority shall have an important information and training function in relation to the bankruptcy administrators (cf. that stated about the Bankruptcy Advisory Council below) and retain the role that is a duty of the supervisory authority under the Wages Guarantee Act (1992:497).</p>
<p>The Bankruptcy Administration Supervisory Authority shall, according to the proposal, have a regional presence. It is proposed that the authority be divided into seven units for the day-to-day operations in various regions. The offices of the units shall be located in Malmö, Jönköping, Gothenburg, Stockholm, Eskilstuna, Härnösand and Umeå. The authority shall have a central function located in Stockholm. The head of the authority, personnel administration and IT services shall be located in Stockholm. However, the authority will largely be able to determine how its internal structure is arranged.</p>
<p>The influence of creditors is strengthened</p>
<p>The Commission does not make any proposal that the creditors, viewed as a collective, should be given any formal influence in bankruptcy. However, the possibility of creditors to influence the bankruptcy proceedings is strengthened by participation in the so-called bankruptcy administrator recommendation councils and the Bankruptcy Advisory Council (see further about this below). Furthermore, it is proposed that a creditor shall be able to request that the bankruptcy court appoints a creditors' administration committee. An issue concerning the appointment of such a committee should already be considered in conjunction with the bankruptcy decision.</p>
<p>Among others, the bankruptcy administrator and the Bankruptcy Administration Supervisory Authority should be given an opportunity to express views. The committee shall be a consultative body in relation to the administrator but not have any decision-making powers.</p>
<p>As regards the influence of the creditors in connection with the appointment of the bankruptcy administrator in the individual bankruptcy, see below.</p>
<p>Decision-making functions are altered in the bankruptcy proceedings</p>
<p>Bankruptcy shall, according to the proposal, as hitherto be a continuous matter pending at the district court. However, it is proposed that certain decision-making functions are altered taking into account first the desire for clearly defining the operations of the courts, second the new selective nature of bankruptcy administration supervision. Therefore, a decision for the arrangement of proof of debt procedure shall be made by the bankruptcy administrator instead of by the court. Questions concerning respite with submission of the administrator's report shall be considered by the Bankruptcy Administration Supervisory Authority instead of by the court. Also, the present requirements for formal consent from the supervisory authority for certain measures on the part of the administrator shall be abandoned. This applies, for example, to private sale of pledged movable property (Chapter 8, Section 7, second paragraph KL).</p>
<p>It is proposed that the current arrangements with mandatory meetings for the taking of oaths before the district court are withdrawn. The debtor shall instead confirm in writing the correctness of the estate inventory for the bankruptcy administrator at the estate inventory preparation meeting. A creditor, the administrator and the Bankruptcy Administration Supervisory Authority are given an opportunity to call for the taking of oaths by the debtor before the court. The taking of oaths may be appropriate, for example, on the grounds that it is suspected that a crime may have been committed by the debtor or because the debtor refuses to confirm the correctness of the estate inventory for the administrator.</p>
<p>Amendment of the forms for appointment of bankruptcy administrator</p>
<p>The Commission proposes several changes as regards the forms of appointment of bankruptcy administrators. The most important are the following:</p>
<p>– The requirement for specialist skills imposed in connection with the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1979 should apply generally and be explicitly stated in the KL.</p>
<p>– Regional assessment bodies (bankruptcy administrator recommendation councils) are established with operational areas linked to the Bankruptcy Administration Supervisory Authority's regional units. The councils shall be composed of representatives of interested parties in the bankruptcy proceedings, including among others the creditors and the Supervisory Authority. The task of the councils shall be to determine, at periodically recurring times, the circle of people who may, upon application, be considered suitable to be given assignments as administrator. The councils prepare schedules of these people. The schedules shall serve to guide the court when it appoints an administrator in the particular bankruptcy. There will be no opportunity to appeal against the decisions of the councils concerning the schedules.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy administrator recommendation councils shall conduct these assessments at specific intervals of time, for example, every three years. Those who wish to be listed in the councils' schedules shall, through an application procedure, provide information concerning his/her skills in the field, using documentation provided by the councils as a basis.</p>
<p>When making its assessment, the bankruptcy administrator recommendation councils shall take into account the development with bankruptcy that may be expected during the forthcoming years and, among other things, in this way limit the size of the circle of administrators. The possibility should hereby be created to counteract the risk of having a far too large group of administrators and to maintain the requirement of specialisation.</p>
<p>– The court should normally select a bankruptcy administrator from the circle that is included in the bankruptcy administrator recommendation councils' schedules. When making its choice, the court should take into account whether any special kind of knowledge is required concerning, for example, a particular branch in order to be able to deal with the administration. The cost aspects should also be taken into account. A provision is to be introduced to the KL providing that the court should preferably appoint the person whose engagement may be assumed to involve the best outcome for the creditors.</p>
<p>The Bankruptcy Administration Supervisory Authority shall be given an opportunity to express its views in connection with the appointment of the bankruptcy administrator. Bearing in mind the new, selective nature of</p>
<p>supervision, the authority may itself determine, in the particular case, whether it has anything to state concerning the choice of administrator.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind the proposed participation of creditors in both the bankruptcy administrator recommendation councils and the Bankruptcy Advisory Council (see further concerning this below), the Commission considers that special rules are not needed in the case where a creditor makes a proposal for a bankruptcy administrator. If a creditor has proposed someone who, in the view of the court, is suitable and who is furthermore listed in the bankruptcy administrator recommendation council's schedule, there is no reason not to appoint this person as administrator. This will also apply if the proposal has been made by the debtor. If someone is proposed who is not listed in the schedule, the court shall, after having given the Supervisory Authority an opportunity to express its views, determine whether it is appropriate to appoint the person proposed. One reason for appointing this person may be that he/she has attained better skills than those known to the bankruptcy administrator recommendation council.</p>
<p>A central, advisory body – the Bankruptcy Advisory Council – is established</p>
<p>In line with developments in Finland and Norway, the Commission is of the view that Sweden should establish a central, advisory body to promote good bankruptcy practice together with efficiency and uniformity in the administration of bankruptcy. An appropriate name for the body is the Bankruptcy Advisory Council. The Council shall, when it is appropriate, issue recommendations on matters concerning bankruptcy administration, public supervision of this and questions connected thereto. The Council shall not express views on individual bankruptcy matters.</p>
<p>The Bankruptcy Advisory Council shall be composed of representatives of various interested parties in bankruptcy proceedings, such as the Bankruptcy Administration Supervisory Authority, the bankruptcy administrators, the creditors, prosecutors and the National Courts Administration. The members shall have special knowledge and experience concerning questions relating to bankruptcy. The Council shall have at most ten members. One of them shall be the chairman and also the head of the Council. The members shall be appointed by the Government and for a fixed term.</p>
<p>The Bankruptcy Advisory Council shall for its operations hold periodically recurring meetings. It needs to have access to a clerical service and a secretary. It should be possible for the Bankruptcy Administration Supervisory Authority to be used as host authority for the clerical services.</p>
<p>Amendments to the rules concerning fees for bankruptcy administrator</p>
<p>As previously, the court shall decide the fees for the bankruptcy administrator. The court shall give the Bankruptcy Administration Supervisory Authority an opportunity to express its views on the issue of fees, but the Authority may – taking into account the new, selective nature – itself determine whether it wishes to state anything concerning the matter. The possibility of appointing a special fees board mentioned in the Commission's terms of reference does not appear to be an appropriate alternative to consideration by the court, in the view of the Commission.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind fees in bankruptcies with assets sufficient to make a distribution, it is proposed that a rule is included in the KL that the bankruptcy administrator shall – when it is necessary in order to assess the reasonableness of the fees requested – specify the time that has been used to fulfil the assignment, split according to the various administrative measures. Both the court and the Bankruptcy Administration Supervisory Authority can request such a specification of times.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the content and scope of bankruptcy administration tariffs are altered. The fees for the bankruptcy administrator in bankruptcies that are written off in accordance with Chapter 10, Section 1 KL shall still be determined according to a tariff. This shall normally comprise remuneration for</p>
<p>– taking care of the debtor's estate with the accounting information and other documents concerning the estate,</p>
<p>– preparation of an estate inventory and administration of an estate inventory meeting,</p>
<p>– attending any taking of oaths,</p>
<p>– preparation of an administrator's report and final documents, and also</p>
<p>– in simple cases, realisation of assets,  winding-up of business operation and investigation of any suspicions of crime.</p>
<p>It is proposed to increase the level of the tariff from the current (year 2000) SEK 8,600 to SEK 10,000. The preconditions for exceeding the tariff should be the same as today. The limit for exceeding shall thus be reasonable remuneration amounting to at least SEK 15,000. Even if only a further couple of hundred bankruptcies fall within the scope of the tariff, this involves some gain for the state.</p>
<p>Amendments concerning costs liability in bankruptcy</p>
<p>As previously, the bankruptcy expenses are paid for by the bankruptcy estate, before any distribution to the creditors comes into question.</p>
<p>If a bankruptcy has occurred on the application of some other creditor than the state or a creditor whose claim is subject to the salary guarantee in accordance with the Salary Guarantee Act, and the bankruptcy is written-off in accordance with Chapter 10, Section 1 KL, the creditor shall – to the extent the costs cannot be taken out of the estate – bear these costs up to an amount that corresponds to 15 (today 10) per cent of the price base amount applicable at the time of the application under the National Insurance Act (1962:381).</p>
<p>The expenses of the state for supervision, public notices and notices of meetings relating to bankruptcy are today covered to some extent by three different charges. In the view of the Commission, one should as an economic objective endeavour to achieve full cover for expenses in respect to those costs that are considered referable to the individual bankruptcy.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the current supervision, public notice and notice of meeting charges are combined into a single charge, referred to as bankruptcy charge. The bankruptcy charge shall in bankruptcies that are concluded by writing off or discontinuing the bankruptcy or if the bankruptcy decision is revoked or if a composition with creditors has been approved in the bankruptcy, be charged at a fixed amount computed on the basis of first the current public notice and notice of meetings charges (total SEK 3,250) and second the charge for basic control (SEK 1,100). In bankruptcies that are concluded in other ways, the bankruptcy charge should be imposed first as a fixed amount corresponding to the expense for public notice and notice of meetings and the basic control (together SEK 4,350), second an amount that corresponds to 5 per cent of the administrator's fees up to SEK 200,000 and 2 per cent of the fees thereover.</p>
<p>It is proposed to increase the application charge in connection with a bankruptcy application from SEK 500 to SEK 1,000.</p>
<p>Special costs issues, etc.</p>
<p>In accordance with its directives, the Commission has dealt with a number of special issues concerning expenses in bankruptcy, etc., for example, the opportunity for the bankruptcy administrator to charge and collect a special fee in relation to a particular item of property or be provisionally reimbursed for advance payments of value added tax due to the tax authority even though the fee is not finally fixed.</p>
<p>The proposed reform presented by the Commission concerning reinforcement of the competence of the bankruptcy administrators, for a new orientation of the public bankruptcy administration supervision, for a new, independent supervisory authority and the establishment of a Bankruptcy Advisory Council should satisfy the desire that administrators make the necessary investigations concerning economic crime in connection with bankruptcy. The Commission does not propose any special rules concerning the function of the Supervisory Authority in this connection.</p>
<p>The financial consequences of the proposed reform</p>
<p>The Commission estimates that the running costs for a new Bankruptcy Administration Supervisory Authority will be less than the costs for the current supervisory authorities. The difference is estimated to be, in SEK: (44 ./. 42.1 mill. =) 1.9 mill. The increase in the liability of the creditors seeking bankruptcy and the application fees are estimated to provide revenue of (0.6 + 0.3 mill. =) 0.9 mill. Additional costs for the Bankruptcy Advisory Council and the bankruptcy administrator recommendation councils are estimated at (0.75 + 0.35 mill.=) 1.1 mill. The total savings are therefore 1.7 mill.</p>
<p>Enter into force of the reform</p>
<p>The proposed Bankruptcy Advisory Council ought to be established independently of when the other parts of the reform enter into force.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy administrator recommendation councils should be established in good time before the proposed amendments to the KL enter into force. The councils should – possibly with the support of the Bankruptcy Advisory Council – become operational in such time that the courts can get the guidance of the councils' schedules of bankruptcy administrators in connection with appointments of administrators in the individual bankruptcies already when the amendments to the Act enter into force.</p>
<p>The preparations for the establishment of the new Bankruptcy Administration Supervisory Authority are not insubstantial, both as regards recruitment of staff and acquisition of premises, etc.</p>
<p>The reform calls for the application of resources for information and training.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that stated, the reform may enter into force at the turn of the year 2001/2002, at the earliest.</p>
