<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Our remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry was tasked with analysing the need and making proposals for the legislative amendments required for Sweden to be able to accede to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and its Additional Protocol.</p>
<p>In supplementary terms of reference, we were also tasked with analysing the need and making proposals for the legislative amendments needed to implement the draft (not yet formally adopted) Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on attacks against information systems, repealing Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA.</p>
<p>The remit also included considering the need for tougher penalties for breaches of postal or telecommunication secrecy, or data security, in order to allow greater scope to take more nuanced account of the seriousness of large-scale attacks on information systems.</p>
<h2>The need for legislative amendments in light of the Convention and Additional Protocol</h2>
<p>The Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime has three main aims. The first is to bring national penal law provisions concerning certain offences more closely into alignment. The second is to ensure that there are national procedural law provisions that meet the need to investigate and take legal action against the offences dealt with in the Convention and other offences committed using computers, and to be able to utilise evidence in electronic form. The third is to pave the way for rapid and effective international cooperation to combat cybercrime.</p>
<p>The Convention was opened for signature on 23 November 2001 and entered into force on 1 July 2004. So far, 51 states have signed the Convention and 39 states have ratified it. The majority of the EU Member States have ratified the Convention, along with the other Nordic countries. Sweden signed the Convention on the day it was drawn up, but has not yet ratified it.</p>
<p>Several issues emerged during work on the Convention that were not settled. These were taken up in an Additional Protocol to the Convention. The Additional Protocol concerns the criminalisation of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed through computer systems.</p>
<p>The Additional Protocol was opened for signature on 28 January 2003 and entered into force on 1 March 2006. So far, 37 states have signed the Additional Protocol and 20 states have ratified it. Sweden signed the Additional Protocol on the day it was drawn up, but has not yet ratified it.</p>
<p>In our assessment, Swedish law already fulfils the requirements of both the Convention and the Additional Protocol with regard to penal law  provisions, as long as the proposals in Government bill 2012/13:74 Falsification offences and offences against the truth  are adopted by the Riksdag, and Sweden uses the possibility to set certain additional criminal liability requirements with regard to denial, gross minimisation, approval or justification of genocide or crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>With regard to the procedural law  provisions of the Convention, to which the Additional Protocol refers, we consider that legislative measures are needed in order for Swedish law to conform to the requirements in Articles 16 and 17 of the Convention. The articles concern expedited preservation of stored computer data and expedited preservation and partial disclosure of traffic data. We also consider that there are grounds to consider introducing the kind of possibility to order the disclosure of information as part of a search referred to in Article 19.4 of the Convention, even though, in formal terms, Swedish law can be considered to already fulfil the requirements set. In other respects we consider that Swedish law already fulfils the requirements set, given the possibilities for reservations.</p>
<p>With regard to the provisions of the Convention concerning international cooperation , to which the Additional Protocol refers in the same way as for the procedural law provisions, we consider that legislative measures are needed in order for Swedish law to conform to the requirements in Articles 29 and 30 of the Convention concerning judicial assistance for the expedited preservation of stored computer data and expedited disclosure of preserved traffic data (which correspond to Articles 16 and 17 in the area of judicial assistance). In other respects we consider that Swedish law already fulfils the requirements set.</p>
<h2>Implementation of the Convention and Additional</h2>
<h2>Protocol in Swedish law</h2>
<p>Article 16 of the Convention states that it should be possible to obtain the expeditious preservation of specified computer data. Preservation means that data is stored securely. The term ‘data’ refers to any kind of data, i.e. traffic data, content data or subscriber information. The basic idea behind the article is that the preservation of data should be achieved less intrusively than by search and seizure. Furthermore, the intention is that it should be possible to preserve data from both natural and legal persons, including service providers. It should be applicable both to offences that are punishable under the Convention and other offences committed using a computer system, and generally to the collection of electronic evidence concerning an offence.</p>
<p>In order to meet the requirements contained in the article, we propose that a possibility to order a person to preserve electronic data for a given period be introduced into the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure. Anyone who has certain data stored in electronic form that can reasonably be assumed to be of significance to the investigation of an offence could thereby be ordered to preserve that data. The order should specify how long the data must be preserved. The time period may not be longer than necessary, and no longer than 90 days in any case. If there are special grounds to do so, it should be possible to extend the time period by a maximum of 30 days. If possible the order should be issued in writing. Otherwise the person who is the subject of the order should receive written evidence of the decision as soon as possible. Communications concerning the measure may not be forwarded without authorisation. The order should contain information to this effect.</p>
<p>According to our proposal, a preservation order may not be issued to anyone who might reasonably be suspected of the offence or anyone closely associated with the suspect. Decisions to issue a preservation order should be communicated by the leader of the investigation or the prosecutor. A person to whom a preservation order is issued should be able to demand a judicial review of the order. Such judicial reviews should, where appropriate, be subject to the rules that apply to reviews of seizures.</p>
<p>If a preservation order is issued to a service provider that is liable to store traffic data under the Electronic Communications Act (2003:389), we propose that the same rules that apply for measures to protect data to be stored should also apply to data covered by the order. Furthermore, corresponding rules on the right to compensation for costs and on adaptation for disclosure of data that apply to traffic data storage should apply to data to be preserved.</p>
<p>In our view, in certain situations it should be possible to hold anyone who fails to comply with a preservation order criminally liable under the provisions on breaches of official orders contained in Chapter 17, Section 13 of the Penal Code. Under Chapter 9, Section 6 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure criminal liability may be enforced against anyone who, without authorisation, breaches an obligation to conceal the fact that a preservation measure has been taken.</p>
<p>In order to meet the requirements contained in Article 29 of the Convention, we propose that the possibility to order anyone who has certain data stored in electronic form that can reasonably be assumed to be of significance to the investigation of an offence to preserve that data should count as one of the measures covered by judicial assistance under the Act on International Judicial Assistance in Criminal Matters (2000:562).</p>
<p>Under Article 17, the expeditious preservation of traffic data referred to in Article 16 should be possible regardless of whether one or more service providers were involved in the transmission of a communication. In many cases, several service providers are involved when electronic data is transmitted. It is therefore not necessarily sufficient to preserve traffic data from just one of the service providers in the chain of transmission. For it to be possible to order all service providers involved in the transmission to preserve traffic data, it must first be possible to identify them. For it to be possible to preserve data from those service providers that have been involved in the transmission, Article 17 states that it must be possible to gain expeditious access to the data required to trace the service providers and the path through which the communication was transmitted. Preservation under Article 17 should also be applicable both to offences that are punishable under the Convention and other offences committed using a computer system, and generally to the collection of electronic evidence concerning an offence.</p>
<p>In order to meet the requirements contained in Article 17, we propose that an obligation be introduced into the Electronic Communications Act for service providers to submit information concerning the other providers involved in transmission of the communication that is the subject of the preservation order to the authority that has decided to issue the order. In our assessment, no other legislative measures are needed in order to meet the requirements contained in Article 30 of the Convention concerning judicial assistance for the expedited disclosure of certain traffic data.</p>
<p>Under Article 19.4 of the Convention, national legislation must empower the competent authorities to order any person who has knowledge about the functioning of a computer system or measures applied to protect the computer data therein to provide, as is reasonable, the necessary information to enable searches of the IT environment to be undertaken. In our view, although the Swedish rules on the examination of witnesses in court can certainly be considered to meet the requirements of the article in formal terms, there are still grounds to introduce a specific possibility to order the disclosure of information into Swedish law with the aim of facilitating searches in IT environments. This is because there is, according to the criminal investigation authorities, a practical need to introduce the possibility to issue this kind of order.</p>
<p>We therefore propose a new provision in the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure stating that anyone who can be assumed to be familiar with the functions of a given computer system or other requirements for accessing it and examining the data in it may be ordered to provide the necessary instructions for a search to be conducted. A decision to issue an order may be communicated by the investigation leader or the prosecutor. The order must be documented.</p>
<p>Under our proposal, if anyone can reasonably be suspected of the offence, the order cannot be issued to the suspect. Nor may an order be issued to anyone who, if prosecution proceedings are initiated, would not be obliged to testify in the case or with regard to the data that the criminal investigation authorities wish to access. If the subject of the order refuses to disclose information, the investigation leader or prosecutor may demand that they be examined before a court. This examination should be subject to the appropriate parts of the rules that apply to the taking of evidence outside of a main hearing. A suspect may be given the opportunity to attend the examination if this will not harm the investigation.</p>
<p>Article 6.1 of the Additional Protocol requires the criminalisation of acts whereby a person intentionally, and without right, uses a computer system to distribute or otherwise make available to the public material which denies, grossly minimises, approves or justifies acts constituting genocide or crimes against humanity, as defined in international law or certain international courts. We propose that Sweden take the opportunity to declare a requirement that the offences of denial or gross minimisation are committed with intent to incite hatred, discrimination or violence against an individual or group on grounds of race, skin colour, origin, national or ethnic roots, or faith, because Swedish law would then meet the criminalisation requirements contained in the article, primarily through the provisions on agitation against a national or ethnic group and incitement to rebellion.</p>
<p>Articles 20 and 21 of the Convention concern the real-time collection of traffic data and the interception of content data respectively. We propose that Sweden enter a reservation of substance to the effect that the measures in Article 20 should only apply to offences for which secret surveillance of electronic communications can be used, and that a reservation of substance be entered to the effect that the measures in Articles 20 and 21 should not apply to communications transmitted solely through an electronic communications network that is relatively insignificant from a general communication standpoint.</p>
<h2>Need for legislative amendments in light of the Directive</h2>
<p>In 2005, a framework decision concerning attacks on information systems was adopted within the EU. The Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on attacks against information systems, repealing Council Framework Decision 2005/222/JHA, aims to bring the Member States’ criminal legislation into greater alignment in the area of attacks on information systems, and to amend and expand the provisions in the framework decision. A further aim is to improve cooperation between authorities and law enforcement bodies in the Member States. The negotiations on the Directive have, in essence, been concluded. It remains for the EU institutions to formally adopt the text that has been approved by representatives in the Council and the European Parliament. Once the Directive is adopted the Member States have two years to implement it.</p>
<p>The central point of the Directive consists of material criminal law provisions. These provisions largely correspond to those found in the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. Unlike the Convention, however, the Directive sets specific requirements for the penalties that can be imposed for certain offences outlined in the text.</p>
<p>Under Articles 9(3) and 9(4), the offences of illegal system interference and illegal data interference should, in some cases, respectively be punishable by a maximum penalty of at least three years’ or five years’ imprisonment. Primarily through the provisions on data security breaches, Swedish law meets the requirements contained in the Directive with regard to the actions that should be punishable as illegal system interference and illegal data interference. The scale of penalties for data security breaches is a fine or a maximum of two years’ imprisonment. We therefore consider that the scale of penalties for data security breaches must be tougher in order for Sweden to be able to implement the Directive. Furthermore, Article 9(2) states that certain the criminal use of various tools should be punishable by a maximum penalty of two years’ imprisonment. Swedish law meets the punishability requirement, primarily through the provisions on preparation to commit an offence, including preparation to commit a data security breach. However, preparation to commit a data security breach cannot be punished by two years’ imprisonment. This is another reason why the scale of penalties for data security breaches needs to be tougher.</p>
<p>In other respects we consider that Swedish law fulfils the requirements set out in the Directive.</p>
<h2>A special scale of penalties for gross breaches of data security</h2>
<p>The scale of penalties for breaches of postal or telecommunication secrecy ranges from fines to two years’ imprisonment. In our view, the current scale of penalties is still well-balanced. There is therefore no reason to introduce a tougher scale of penalties for breaches of postal or telecommunication secrecy.</p>
<p>The scale of penalties for breaches of data security also ranges from fines to two years’ imprisonment. In our view, however, the current penalty scale for data security breaches does not allow sufficient scope to take account of the seriousness of large-scale attacks on information systems. For various reasons, in the case of such attacks on information systems it is not always possible to apply other penalty provisions involving higher penalty scales, such as those concerning sabotage, gross vandalism or terrorist offences. In our view therefore, even aside from the Directive there are criminal policy grounds to introduce a tougher scale of penalties for data security breaches.</p>
<p>We therefore propose the introduction of a special scale of penalties for gross breaches of data security. The scale should range from six months’ to six years’ imprisonment. When assessing whether a breach of data security is gross, special attention should be paid to whether the act caused, or could have caused, serious damage, targeted a large volume of data or was otherwise of a particularly dangerous nature.</p>
<p>The provision on breaches of data security should no longer be subsidiary to the penalty provisions concerning breaches of postal or telecommunication secrecy and intrusion into a safe depository. Attempts and preparations to commit gross breaches of data security should be punishable offences.</p>
