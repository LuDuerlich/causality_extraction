<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Committee’s remit</h2>
<p>The overall task for the Committee is to review the export controls on military equipment and propose how the control system should be designed in the future. The remit has two main parts: the question of stronger export controls with respect to non-democratic states, and the question of introducing financial penalties in the Military Equipment Act and the Act on Controls of Dual-Use Products and Technical Assistance. The Committee has chosen to address the latter part in this interim report. The first question – that of stronger export controls with respect to non-democratic states – will be addressed in the Committee’s final report.</p>
<p>The Committee has taken a broader approach to the question of penalties than simply examining the appropriateness of replacing criminal penalties with financial penalties in the Military Equipment Act and the Act on Controls of Dual-Use Products and Technical Assistance. The Committee also examined whether criminal penalties should be retained but a greater number of punishable infringements should be pursued with administrative penalties other than financial penalties. The Committee has used the term ‘penalty-shift’ to describe its proposed shift from criminal penalties to administrative penalties (financial or other repressive penalties).</p>
<p>In assessing whether a system of financial penalties should be introduced in the Military Equipment Act and the Act on Controls of Dual-Use Products and Technical Assistance, the Committee paid particular attention to the guidelines and viewpoints on when financial penalties can be used, outlined in Government Bill 1981/82:142. Moreover, the Committee took account of the views on this issue of the Inquiry on the use of criminal law (SOU 2013:38).</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Export controls of strategic products, i.e. military equipment and dual-use products, as well as technical assistance with respect to such controlled products, ultimately aim to prevent these products ending up in the hands of the wrong end-users. One important instrument in ensuring that the export control regulations are followed by the relevant natural persons and legal entities is the existence of effective, dissuasive penalties. Effective penalties therefore contribute to greater compliance with the regulations. Effective penalties are also a prerequisite if Sweden is to be considered to have fulfilled its international obligations and commitments in this area. A further aspect is that effective export controls can be a prerequisite to allow Swedish companies to get access to controlled products from other states.</p>
<h2>The current penalty system</h2>
<p>The penalty system laid down in the Military Equipment Act and the Act on Controls of Dual-Use Products and Technical Assistance is mainly criminal in nature. It therefore primarily targets natural persons. In addition, the Military Equipment Act and the Act on Controls of Dual-Use Products and Technical Assistance also include certain possibilities to issue administrative penalties, which can also target legal entities. These include the withdrawal of licences or prohibitions on using general licences already granted. Pursuant to the Swedish Penal Code, it is also possible to punish a business operator via corporate fines for offences committed in the exercise of business activities. Such matters are examined by a general court on the application of a prosecutor.</p>
<p>Are there flaws?</p>
<p>The Committee observes that the possibilities to pursue detected infringements of the Military Equipment Act and the Act on Controls of Dual-Use Products and Technical Assistance are limited. The system of penalties in its current form is not applicable to such infringements. This circumstance in itself carries an obvious risk of undermining confidence in and compliance with the regulatory framework.</p>
<p>With the aim of learning about any flaws in the current system of penalties, the Committee gathered information and statistics from the supervisory authorities – the Swedish Agency for NonProliferation and Export Controls and the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority – and from other relevant agencies. These accounts indicate that since 1993 there have been at least a few hundred suspected infringements of the Military Equipment Act and the Act on Controls of Dual-Use Products and Technical Assistance. Only a few of these have led to a prosecution, and fewer still have resulted in legal proceedings. This is partly due to the fact that the majority of the suspected infringements were insignificant in nature and were deemed minor offences by the law enforcement authorities. Minor offences are exempt from criminal liability under the regulations. Another reason is that it has been difficult for police and prosecutors to demonstrate that offenders in specific cases have acted negligently or intentionally contravened the regulations.</p>
<p>The authorities’ accounts also indicate a lack of uniformity in the processing and investigation of infringements of the Military Equipment Act and the Act on Controls of Dual-Use Products and Technical Assistance. One reason for this is that several law enforcement authorities are authorised to conduct police investigations, and such matters can be handled by both general and specialist prosecutors. The accounts from the supervisory authorities also indicate that existing administrative penalties have only been imposed for infringements in exceptional cases.</p>
<p>The Committee’s conclusions</p>
<p>The Committee has found that the current penalty system under the Military Equipment Act and the Act on Controls of Dual-Use Products and Technical Assistance are not fit for the purpose of pursuing the infringements that occur. The penalty system therefore needs to be overhauled to make it more applicable, particularly with respect to less serious infringements.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that a penalty-shift be implemented in the Military Equipment Act and the Act on Controls of Dual-Use Products and Technical Assistance. This shift consists in criminal penalties being replaced or supplemented with administrative penalties. In the assessment of the Committee, the proposed change will lead to improved confidence in and compliance with export control legislation.</p>
<p>At first glance, the proposed change might be thought to make the penalty system in the export control regulatory framework less incisive. However, in practice the penalty-shift means that infringements of a less serious nature, which today cannot be pursued because they are deemed minor offences, will be pursued to a greater extent in the future. The actual result of the penaltyshift will therefore be a tightening of the penalty system, because it will be possible to issue administrative penalties even for minor infringements. A further advantage of administrative penalties is that they can target legal entities, which will in turn have a greater incentive to improve export controls and devote adequate resources to them. This will, in itself, limit the number of infringements. The penalty-shift will therefore bring about a de facto  tightening of the export controls on military equipment and dualuse products.</p>
<h2>Basis for the penalty-shift</h2>
<p>One starting point for the Committee’s deliberations is that the changes proposed to the penalty system should contribute both to improved stakeholder compliance with export control legislation and to Sweden fulfilling its international obligations and commitments in this area. To achieve this, it must be possible to use the proposed penalties when infringements occur, even if they are less serious offences. It is desirable that the penalty system be designed to be effective and to dissuade infringements of the regulations. Less serious infringements that are deemed minor offences are often due to carelessness, oversights, etc. on the part of the actors. It can be assumed that these infringements are, to a significant extent, the result of the actors in question not devoting sufficient resources to export controls. Effective export controls of controlled products require companies to have good knowledge of the export control regulations. One risk in this context is that carelessness etc. that is deemed a minor offence can have serious consequences and that controlled products end up in the wrong hands. Even minor offences can, therefore, lead to the aim of export controls not being fulfilled.</p>
<p>Another starting point for the Committee’s proposal of a penalty-shift is the legislator’s explicit aim of seeking more moderate use of criminal law, including in special criminal law branches. The assessment of whether a penalty-shift should take place therefore includes an examination of whether the criminal penalty for a certain type of conduct should be abolished or not. In examining whether conduct should be criminalised or not, the Committee considered the criteria outlined by the Inquiry on the use of criminal law. These criteria do not constitute absolute rules, but rather were the basis for the reasoning employed by the Committee when examining the question of a penalty-shift. The criteria are as follows:  The intended criminal penalty must concern an identified and concrete interest that is worthy of protection (acceptable protection interest).  The action that is to be criminalised must be capable of causing damage or a risk of damage to the protection interest.  Only those who have proved to be at fault – acted in a blameworthy fashion – should be criminally liable, which means that criminalisation is not permitted to jeopardise the application of the fault principle.  There must not be any sufficiently valuable opposing interest.  There must not be any sufficiently effective alternative method for addressing the undesirable conduct. The following should be considered with respect to this criterion: a) Are there already any binding rules of conduct that are sufficiently effective to combat the undesirable conduct? b) If it is necessary to introduce a binding rule of conduct – can the conduct be combated sufficiently effectively with a rule that is not repressive (e.g. a civil law rule on damages)? c) If it is necessary to introduce a repressive binding rule of conduct to combat the undesirable conduct, fines, financial penalties or the withdrawal of licences should be considered first. Criminal penalties should be the last resort.</p>
<h2>The implementation of the penalty-shift</h2>
<p>The Committee proposes that the penalty-shift be implemented in two ways. Firstly, certain criminal penalties should be abolished and replaced with financial penalties. Secondly, additional administrative penalties should be introduced in the Military Equipment Act and the Act on Controls of Dual-Use Products and Technical Assistance (fines and warnings) and these proposed additional administrative penalties, along with the existing ones, should be used more than is currently the case.</p>
<p>Reasons for the proposal</p>
<p>The majority of the infringements that occur are deemed to be minor offences and are, therefore, exempt from criminal liability. Replacing the criminal penalties with financial penalties or supplementing the criminal penalties with other administrative penalties offers better opportunities to pursue this type of infringement. Another effect of an increased use of administrative penalties is that they can be imposed on legal entities. An expanded “toolbox” of administrative penalties for the supervisory authorities increases the possibilities for them to pursue infringements committed within the framework of a legal entity’s activities, and to do so as soon as the infringement is detected. In the Committee’s assessment, this can help ensure that legal entities devote adequate resources to export control activities to a greater extent than at present.</p>
<p>Which criminal penalties should be replaced with financial penalties?</p>
<p>Criminal penalties send a strong signal, and the penalties themselves signal that society takes a serious view of the conduct being punished. In the view of the Committee, this means there can be no question of scrapping criminal penalties for those actions that cause or may cause damage to something that is deemed to have an interest that is particularly worthy of protection. This means that actions that lead to controlled products and technical assistance relating to such products ending up in the hands of end-users deemed unacceptable by Sweden should continue to be subject to criminal penalties. However, actions that cause or may cause damage to an interest worthy of protection with lower relative safeguards could be the subject of a penalty-shift, meaning that criminal penalties are replaced with financial penalties. This includes actions such as failing to submit requested information to the Swedish Agency for Non-Proliferation and Export Controls or the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority within the prescribed time. This kind of failure has for the most part no direct effect on the licence-issuing process itself.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the criminal penalties be dropped from Section 27, first paragraph, points 1, 4 and 6 of the Military Equipment Act and from Section 22, first paragraph, points 2–7 of the Act on Controls of Dual-Use Products and Technical Assistance.</p>
<p>Introduction of additional administrative penalties</p>
<p>In parallel with the change proposed above, the Committee also proposes that increased use be made of administrative penalties other than financial penalties. These administrative penalties can be used for both actions that are subject to criminal penalties and those subject to financial penalties.</p>
<p>With the aim of creating greater prospects for the Swedish Agency for Non-Proliferation and Export Controls and the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority to pursue infringements via administrative penalties, two new penalties should be introduced in the Military Equipment Act and the Act on Controls of Dual-Use Products and Technical Assistance, in the form of a general possibility to issue fines and warnings. The supervisory authorities should also, within the framework of their supervision under the Act on Controls of Dual-Use Products and Technical Assistance, be given the right to issue regulations in the same way as already follows from the Military Equipment Act. These new administrative penalties should, like the existing ones (licence withdrawal and prohibition), be applicable alongside a criminal penalty or financial penalty. The Swedish Agency for Non-Proliferation and Export Controls and the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority will therefore be able to choose between enforcing a measure via a fine or levying a financial penalty afterwards (in the case of an action subject to that kind of penalty) or initiating a notification of prosecution which might result in a criminal penalty (in the case of an action subject to that kind of penalty).</p>
<p>It is not possible to issue several different penalties for the same action (prohibition of double jeopardy).</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that financial penalties should amount to a minimum of SEK 10 000 and a maximum of SEK 200 000. This range was chosen in light of the financial penalties that exist in other supervisory areas in which supervisory authorities impose penalties, and also in light of the type of conduct for which this kind of penalty is proposed and how such conduct should be assessed compared with other conduct that is subject to criminal penalties under the relevant legislation. To create clarity and predictability, financial penalties of set amounts should be imposed. The precise amount for each type of conduct punishable by financial penalty should be set by the Government.</p>
<p>The decision to impose a financial penalty should be taken by the relevant supervisory authority. Liability to pay a financial penalty is based on the principle of liability without fault. In light of this, and also to allow consideration for special circumstances, there should be an option for the supervisory authorities to adjust the penalty or, in certain cases, set it aside entirely. Before a financial penalty order is issued, the subject of the financial penalty should be given an opportunity to comment. A financial penalty order can be appealed to a court of law.</p>
<h2>Liability via reference to other regulations</h2>
<p>When the Committee reviewed the provisions in the Military Equipment Act and the Act on Controls of Dual-Use Products and Technical Assistance, the Committee observed that there are a number of uncertainties regarding some penalty provisions involving liability via reference to other regulations, where these include imprisonment in the scale of penalties and are supplemented by regulations issued by Swedish Customs, the Swedish Agency for Non-Proliferation and Export Controls and the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority. The uncertainty consisted in the fact that was not possible to establish the extent to which the authorities’ regulations on these issues constituted a essential part of the penalty provisions. It was therefore impossible to rule out the fact that the current provisions, with their liability via reference to other regulations, may be incompatible with the regulations in the Instrument of Government concerning standard-setting. In light of this, the Committee proposes that the current provisions encompassing liability via reference to other regulations be addressed. The Committee propose that this be done by replacing some of the penalty provisions with financial penalties, and by the Government, rather than the administrative authorities under it, issuing regulations in cases where no penalty-shift is implemented.</p>
<h2>Expanded licence requirements</h2>
<p>The Committee proposes that the exemption from the licence requirement for the manufacture and supply of military equipment that applies to Swedish government agencies be abolished. Moreover, the Committee proposes that the exemption from the licence requirement for the supply of military equipment that applies to actors other than government agencies also be abolished.</p>
<p>Government agencies</p>
<p>Under the current regulations, certain Swedish government agencies are not subject to ongoing supervision by the Swedish Agency for Non-Proliferation and Export Controls. The lack of ongoing supervision by the Swedish Agency for Non-Proliferation and Export Controls means that it is not possible for the Agency to obtain a complete picture of who handles military equipment in Sweden and what equipment is handled. The exemption from the licences required to manufacture military equipment (Section 3, third paragraph of the Military Equipment Act) and supply military equipment (Section 4, third paragraph of the Military Equipment Act) also means that the agencies in question can, without outside knowledge, manufacture military equipment, but also freely sell, lend or mediate in the supply of military equipment in Sweden to another party in Sweden. The Committee sees no compelling reason why these exemptions should continue. In the Committee’s view, there is a risk that a discrepancy may arise between the assessment the Swedish Agency for Non-Proliferation and Export Controls would have made (if it had examined the issue of manufacture/supply) and the assessments made by the agencies in question. It should also be noted that the self-financing requirement gradually and increasingly imposed on certain defence agencies has meant that they have started to conduct operations that may be considered commercial in nature. This circumstance in itself suggests that their activities should require a licence. Furthermore, the Committee considers that mass media coverage of certain defence agencies in recent years has clearly demonstrated the need for continuous monitoring of these agencies’ activities in this area. The Committee’s overall assessment is that there are no compelling reasons to exempt government agencies from the licence requirement to manufacture or supply military equipment.</p>
<p>Other actors</p>
<p>The exemptions to the licence requirement for the supply of military equipment (Section 4, fourth paragraph of the Military Equipment Act) for certain actors other than government agencies is relatively comprehensive. However, the provision is partially unclear, not least with regard to its real scope, which can create uncertainty among the actors concerned. The provision states, for example, that a company that supplies military equipment to a government agency or to an actor that holds a licence to manufacture the equipment concerned is exempt from the licence requirement. However, if the company in question also supplies equipment to a party other than those mentioned above within Sweden, it must have a licence. Whether the company requires a licence is therefore dependent on various external factors that are not directly linked to the company in question. The uncertainty this creates does not tally with Sweden’s ambition of being considered a leader in efforts to exercise controls in the area of military equipment.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s view, in order to be in a position to maintain good export controls, the Swedish Agency for NonProliferation and Export Controls – in its capacity as control authority in this area – should have good knowledge of the companies conducting operations involving military equipment. In the Committee’s opinion it is desirable that the regulatory framework is simple and clear, and that controls in the area of military equipment are as extensive as possible. In light of this, the Committee finds that this exemption too should be abolished. Once consequence of this will be the introduction of a general licence requirement for the supply of military equipment within Sweden.</p>
<p>The proposed change will involve some increase in the administrative workload of both the Swedish Agency for NonProliferation and Export Controls and the companies concerned. Not least, the workload will increase initially, as more licence applications will have to be submitted, and the Agency will have to process and examine them. Nonetheless, the Committee believes that the additional administrative workload should be limited in the majority of cases. It should, for example, be possible to allow licences for manufacture and supply to be examined under a single application.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and consequences</h2>
<p>The Committee proposes that the legislative amendments enter into force on 1 July 2015. The changes do not entail any need for transitional provisions. The Committee proposes that the Government issue certain regulations, which should enter into force on the same date as the legislative amendments.</p>
<p>The Committee estimates that the proposal will involve an increase in work for both the Swedish Agency for Non-Proliferation and Export Controls and the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority – in the form of more administration and expanded supervisory activities – and that both agencies will require increased resources as a result. Measured in terms of full-year equivalent positions, the Committee estimates that the Swedish Agency for Non- Proliferation and Export Controls needs two full-year equivalent positions, while the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority needs half a full-year equivalent position. The proposed penalty-shift will, in the initial stages, also cause a certain amount of extra administration for the agencies. This extra work should diminish over time as the agencies develop their routines. The increase in costs for the agencies should be split between the private actors and central government, with central government bearing the additional cost engendered by the proposal that government agencies be included in the licence and supervision activities of the Swedish Agency for Non-Proliferation and Export Controls under the Military Equipment Act.</p>
<p>For the judicial system as a whole, the proposed penalty-shift is likely to cause extra work. The Committee estimates that the number of penalty orders appealed to the administrative courts will be greater than the number of reports concerning such conduct currently handled by police/prosecutors and the general courts. The number of additional cases for the administrative courts will depend on several factors. The scale of supervisory activities on the part of the Swedish Agency for Non-Proliferation and Export Controls and the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority will have an influence, for example. The more comprehensive the supervisory activities, the greater the number of infringements that can be expected to be detected and punished with administrative penalties, which in turn can be expected to bring an increased number of cases before the administrative courts. It is also difficult to predict how burdensome the extra work will be for the administrative courts, as this depends on several different parameters. One such parameter is whether the appellant demands an oral hearing before the court. But regardless of how burdensome the additional work is for the administrative courts, the additional costs it causes are likely to be greater than the central government savings from the</p>
<p>infringements in question no longer being handled by police, prosecutors and general courts. The overall assessment is therefore that, at least in the short term, the proposal will engender additional costs for the judicial system as a whole. If developments in this supervisory area are equivalent to those in other supervisory areas in which the legislator has introduced financial penalties, however, improved regulatory compliance among the relevant actors can be expected over time. In the longer term, such developments would reduce the additional workload described above.</p>
<p>For companies and other actors in the military equipment area, the proposed expansion of the licence requirement will entail some increase in the administrative workload. By developing routines, however, it should be possible to limit the additional administrative workload. For those actors that comply with the export control legislation, the proposed penalty-shift will not entail any other extra costs or changes. The proposal will only entail increased costs for actors that commit infringements, which is one of the aims of the Committee’s proposal. To avoid such costs, it can be expected that actors will need to improve their export controls, which will, in time, contribute to improved regulatory compliance. In this sense, the penalty-shift will serve as a crime prevention measure.</p>
