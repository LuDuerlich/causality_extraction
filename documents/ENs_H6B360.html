<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>In its report, the Inquiry presents background material for assessing whether Sweden should accede to the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea of 11 December 2008 (Rotterdam Rules). The Inquiry also presents proposals for the legislative amendments to the Swedish Maritime Code that such an accession requires. Moreover, the Inquiry presents consequential amendments to other acts, including the Sale of Goods Act.</p>
<p>Finally, the Inquiry proposes that the reference in the Swedish Maritime Code’s provisions on general average should refer to the York-Antwerp Rules 2016 instead of the York-Antwerp Rules 1994.</p>
<h2>Accession to the Rotterdam Rules</h2>
<p>The current regulations</p>
<p>The Swedish provisions on the carriage of goods by sea are found in Chapter 13 of the Swedish Maritime Code. These provisions are based on the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law Relating to Bills of Lading from 1924 with the amending protocol from 1968 (Hague-Visby Rules) and the United Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea from 1978 (Hamburg Rules).</p>
<p>Rotterdam Rules</p>
<p>The Rotterdam Rules are the most recent convention in the area of maritime transport. The Convention has been signed by 25 States, including Sweden. However, it has not yet entered into force. A sufficient number of States have not yet acceded to the Convention.</p>
<p>The Rotterdam Rules aim at creating a modern and uniform regulation of international carriage of goods by sea. The provisions of the Rotterdam Rules not only apply to maritime transport but also to connecting transports. By regulating connecting transports as well, greater predictability is created regarding liability for loss of or damage to the goods that occurs in connection with maritime transport. The Rotterdam Rules also include a more holistic view of the maritime transport agreement as a form of cooperation between the shipper and the carrier. In addition, the Rotterdam Rules provide greater opportunities than at present for the parties to themselves determine the terms and conditions for their dealings. It can also be assumed that the Rotterdam Rules contribute to greater uniformity of the international regulatory framework, as States that accede to the Convention are to denounce the Hague-Visby Rules and the Hamburg Rules. This means that these rules can gradually be phased out as more countries accede to the Rotterdam Rules.</p>
<p>Issue of accession</p>
<p>The Inquiry is positive to the modernisation of the international regulatory framework that the Rotterdam Rules entail. However, in comparison with the current Swedish regulations, this modernisation does not constitute a sufficiently strong ground for Sweden to accede to the Rules. Instead, the crucial issue regarding accession is the opportunity that the Rotterdam Rules presents to create a uniform regulation, viewed from an international perspective. However, for the Rotterdam Rules to contribute to greater uniformity, accession to them must be broad. A Swedish accession must therefore be considered from an international perspective. A crucial matter in this issue is how other countries of importance in terms of trading choose to act in relation to the Rotterdam Rules. The Inquiry considers that Sweden should not accede until it is clear that accession to the Rotterdam Rules is relatively broad.</p>
<p>After acceding to the Rotterdam Rules, Sweden will be bound under international law to apply the provisions of the Rotterdam Rules on transport agreements that come under the scope of the Convention. This, however, is on condition that Swedish law applies. The Inquiry therefore considers that EU conflict-of-law rules do not constitute an obstacle to Sweden acceding to the Rotterdam Rules.</p>
<p>Transposition of the Rotterdam Rules into Swedish law</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the method of transposing the Rotterdam Rules into Swedish law should be transformation. Therefore, the Inquiry proposes recasting the Rotterdam Rules as Swedish legislative text and entering this into the Swedish Maritime Code as a new Chapter 13. At the same time, the current Chapter 13 will cease to apply.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that certain provisions of the current Chapter 13 which lack equivalents in the Rotterdam Rules be included in the new Chapter 13.</p>
<p>Rotterdam Rules’ provisions on jurisdiction and arbitration</p>
<p>The Rotterdam Rules contain provisions on jurisdiction and arbitration. These provisions are found in Chapters 14 and 15 of the Rotterdam Rules.</p>
<p>Application of the jurisdiction provisions requires a special declaration from the acceding State (see Article 74). Following a special declaration, a State can also commit itself to applying the provisions of the Rotterdam Rules on arbitration proceedings (see Article 78).</p>
<p>The Inquiry has concluded that Sweden should refrain from declaring that it will be bound by the provisions of Chapters 14 and 15. Instead, the Inquiry recommends a regulation based on the current regulations concerning jurisdiction and arbitration, although with certain adjustments to the Rotterdam Rules. When formulating the provisions, account was taken of the regulations under EU law.</p>
<p>Scope of the new regulations</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the regulations concerning the carriage of goods should be applicable to both domestic maritime transports and transports that comes under the scope of the Rotterdam Rules, and international transports outside the scope of the Rotterdam Rules, except that the scope of international shipping should be formulated based on the Rotterdam Rules being applicable to both transports taking place wholly by sea and transports taking place partly by sea. Regarding domestic transports, the regulation should only cover carriage taking place wholly by sea.</p>
<p>Mandatory rules</p>
<p>The proposed regulations will be mandatory with no restrictions as to the geographic shipping concerned. This differs from applicable law. At present, the rules in Chapter 13 are optional regarding certain types of international transport outside the scope of the Haag-Visby rules. The amendment contributes to regulatory simplification and helps to create uniform rules.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the mandatory provisions of the Rotterdam Rules are of fundamental importance for protecting cargo owners as the weaker party in the contractual relationship and for the economic structure of shipping in Sweden. The mandatory provisions should therefore be applicable on shipping under the Rotterdam Rules, unless the parties have agreed that the transport is to be governed by the law of another specified Contracting State and, regarding domestic transport in Sweden, also when another country’s law otherwise applies to the agreement. This assessment is consistent with the assessment that currently applies regarding the scope of the mandatory rules in the current Chapter 13 of the Swedish Maritime Code.</p>
<p>Transport documents</p>
<p>The Rotterdam Rules does not use the term ‘bill of lading’. Instead, the term ‘negotiable transport document’ is used. A negotiable transport document refers to a transport document that indicates, by wording such as ‘to order’, ‘negotiable’, or other equivalent wording, that the goods have been consigned to the order of the shipper, to the order of the consignee, or to the bearer, and is not explicitly stated as being ‘non-negotiable or ‘not negotiable’.</p>
<p>In light of the new terminology in the Rotterdam Rules, the Inquiry proposes that the term ‘bill of lading’ be removed from the Swedish Maritime Code and other legislation.</p>
<h2>General average</h2>
<p>The principle of general average is based on the idea of a common interest between vessel, freight and cargo, i.e. to arrive safely at the port of destination. The key element of the principle is to share the costs that arise in order to save the property from a common peril. This principle is set out in the York-Antwerp Rules.</p>
<p>The Swedish Maritime Code makes reference to the YorkAntwerp Rules in two respects. The Rules are to apply with regard to the significance of the general average, and to the distribution of the general average between vessel, freight and cargo. However, the parties are free to agree on a different order. Following amendments in 1995, the Swedish Maritime Code refers to a version of the Rules from 1994.</p>
<p>The York-Antwerp Rules have been updated twice since 1994. The most recent version is from 2016 and has been well received. This positive reception supports the view that the 2016 version of the Rules will also be used by Swedish stakeholders. There is therefore a reason for Sweden to update the reference to the YorkAntwerp Rules. Once the reference in the Swedish Maritime Code has been changed, the Government can announce that the wording of the York-Antwerp Rules 2016 applies.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions</h2>
<p>The part of the Inquiry’s proposals that entails changing the reference to the York-Antwerp Rules is independent in relation to the Rotterdam Rules. The Inquiry proposes that the Government move forward with this proposal regardless of what is decided concerning</p>
<p>the Rotterdam Rules. The Inquiry proposes that the legislative amendment enter into force on 1 July 2019.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has proposed that Sweden should not accede the Rotterdam Rules until it is clear that accession to the rules is relatively broad. The Inquiry’s proposed legislative amendments in this part presuppose accession to the Rotterdam Rules. As it is not possible to predict when or if Sweden will accede to the Convention, the Inquiry proposes that the other provisions enter into force on the date determined by the Government.</p>
<p>Regarding agreements entered into prior to entry into force, the Inquiry proposes that older provisions are to be applied. The Inquiry does not consider that any other transitional provisions are necessary.</p>
