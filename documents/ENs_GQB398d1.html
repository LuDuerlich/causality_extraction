<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Following a Government resolution on 12 October 2000, a commission was set up to review Swedish legislation on criminal responsibility for international crimes and jurisdiction over such crimes. The assignment was extended to include a review of Swedish legislation on criminal jurisdiction in general.</p>
<p>Supreme Court Justice Dag Victor was appointed Commissioner, to be assisted by a group of advisory experts. The group so composed adopted the name the Commission on International Criminal Law ( Internationella straffrättsutredningen ). The following is a summary of the report International Crimes and Swedish Jurisdiction ( Internationella brott och svensk jurisdiction ), submitted by the Commission in November 2002.</p>
<h2>The proposals in short</h2>
<p>The Commission puts forward a proposal for a new Act on International Crimes. The proposed Act introduces new provisions on criminal responsibility for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. According to the proposal, Swedish courts shall have the competence to try these crimes regardless of where or by whom they have been committed. Genocide, crimes against humanity and serious war crimes shall not be subject to statutes of limitation.</p>
<p>The report also contains a proposal for a new wording of Chapter 2 of the Swedish Penal Code concerning the competence of Swedish courts in criminal cases. The proposal is a result of a general review of the present legislation and primarily aims at making the law clearer and easier to apply. The review has also given rise to proposals for revision of other parts of the legislation.</p>
<h2>Criminal responsibility for international crimes</h2>
<p>On 17 July 1998 the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) was adopted. Following the ratification of the Statute by 60 States – among them Sweden – it entered into force on 1 July 2002. The Statute establishes the International Criminal Court as a permanent institution, with the power to try individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.</p>
<p>Against the background of Sweden’s ratification of the Rome Statute, the Commission was asked to review Swedish legislation concerning those international crimes which, under international law, entail individual criminal responsibility.</p>
<p>The Rome Statute contains provisions on crimes and other provisions which concern the activities of the International Criminal Court. It does not per se require the inclusion of these provisions into national legislation. However, as has been underlined in the Commission’s terms of reference, Sweden has a strong interest in making its legislation permit prosecution for serious international crimes to the same extent as will be possible under the international system which Sweden has promoted. With the provisions of the Rome Statute as its primary model, the Commission therefore proposes a new Swedish Act on International Crimes. The Act will make it possible to hold individuals responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The scope of the proposed Act is however somewhat wider than the Rome Statute, i.a. as regards responsibility for war crimes during non-international armed conflicts.</p>
<p>Apart from provisions on crimes, the Rome Statute contains a number of provisions under the heading “General Principles of Criminal Law”. They concern, i.a, inchoate forms of crimes, general conditions for criminal responsibility and various forms of defences. These provisions are to a large extent compatible with the equivalent Swedish law. There are, however, some substantial exceptions. The Commission proposes amendments to Swedish legislation in accordance with the rules in the Rome Statute. Thus, it is proposed that special provisions on military and other commanders´ responsibility be introduced. Furthermore, it is proposed that genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes be exempt from the normal statutes of limitation.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the proposal on a new Act on International Crimes, it is proposed that the present Swedish Genocide Act and the provision on crimes against international law in Ch. 22 sec. 6 of the Penal Code be repealed.</p>
<h2>Competence of Swedish courts</h2>
<p>Rules on competence or jurisdiction exist in international as well as national law. While international law determines the permissible limits of a state’s jurisdiction, it is a matter for the national legislator to decide to what extent, within these limits, it wishes to assert its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The central provisions on criminal jurisdiction in Swedish law are to be found in Ch. 2 of the Penal Code. The provisions have been changed and supplemented on several occasions and have now become quite difficult to grasp. Furthermore, an increasing number of provisions on jurisdiction have been introduced in criminal law legislation outside the Penal Code. The present legislation provides for a very wide jurisdiction over crimes committed abroad. In some aspects, at least formally, it extends beyond the limits of international law. This is one of the reasons for the present principal rule, requiring the leave of the Government or the Prosecutor-General to prosecute crimes committed abroad. In addition, the courts are obliged to observe the rules on jurisdiction that follow from international law.</p>
<p>The Commission’s task has been to make a systematic survey of the provisions on Swedish jurisdiction in criminal cases, in order to accomplish a collected regulation which is easy to grasp and apply. To this end, it is proposed that the wording of Ch. 2 of the Penal Code is changed completely. The provisions of the new wording are as far as possible made applicable in cases which today are regulated outside the Penal Code. The provisions regarding the competence of Swedish courts are based on the traditional principles of international law allowing for state jurisdiction. The formal limits of competence are made narrower and more precise.</p>
<p>The system requiring leave to prosecute crimes committed abroad will be retained. The competence to grant leaves is moved from the Government to the Prosecutor-General. In individual cases, however, the Prosecutor-General may hand over the case to</p>
<p>the Government. Provisions are introduced regarding what circumstances should be taken into consideration when deciding on prosecuting a crime which has been committed abroad.</p>
<p>It was also part of the Commission’s assignment to look into Swedish legislation on jurisdiction over international crimes. It is proposed that Swedish courts shall have universal jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, i.e. be competent to try charges on such crimes regardless of where or by whom they have been committed. The proposal in this part also encompasses acts of torture under the UN Convention of 1984 against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Furthermore, a special provision is proposed regarding crimes under international treaties that are binding on Sweden. If a treaty obliges Sweden to try the question of prosecution if the alleged offender is not extradited, Swedish courts shall be competent to try the crime in question.</p>
