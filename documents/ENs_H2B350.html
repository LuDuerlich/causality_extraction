<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>We have been given the task of drawing up a strategy for long-term sustainable land use (ToR 2011:91) and a strategy for a cohesive and sustainable water policy (ToR 2012:95). A final report is due in June 2014.</p>
<p>Since land and water are closely interconnected, it is neither possible nor appropriate to draw a sharp line between the strategies. Instead, we see the strategies as integral parts of the endeavour to achieve the environmental quality objectives, and we therefore present them together in this report.</p>
<p>The strategy for long-term sustainable land use extends over a total of three reports, with this report being the final report. In</p>
<p>Plan for development of a strategy for long-term sustainable land use (SOU 2012:15), we conducted an overall problem analysis and identified a number of difficult issues that require long-term political trade-offs. These issues are addressed partly in the interim report Long-term  sustainable land use – part 1  (SOU 2013:43), and partly in this report.</p>
<p>In this report we focus on how the governance of land use can be developed to promote a more holistic perspective, paying particular attention to the need of society to adapt to a changing climate, and to the promotion of a green infrastructure. We also discuss the issue of how to achieve sustainable use of agricultural land. Previously adopted and proposed milestone targets relating to land use are incorporated in the strategy.</p>
<p>Sustainable land use is also a prerequisite for achieving our water policy objectives. By the same token, water is of great importance to land use.</p>
<p>The focus of water environment work should be on the implementation and follow-up of measures. The strategy for a cohesive and sustainable water policy focuses on managing water resources for the future, paying particular attention to hazardous substances, the protection and restoration of water areas, a sustainable nutrient load and sustainable fish management. We also discuss the issue of clearer governance in the marine and water environment area. Previously adopted and proposed interim targets relating to water are an integral part of the strategy.</p>
<p>To achieve long-term sustainable land use and a cohesive and sustainable water policy, different interests and demands must be taken into account and we have to balance different societal objectives. The purpose of our proposed strategies for land and water is to make these long-term political trade-offs.</p>
<h2>Our proposals: sustainable use of land and water focusing on the environmental objectives</h2>
<p>Sustainable use of agricultural land</p>
<p>The values represented by agricultural land are partly dependent on the way in which the land is actually used. One of the prerequisites for achieving long-term sustainable land use is therefore that Swedish agriculture continues in a manner that enables negative environmental impacts to be managed within the framework of ongoing production. As the demands on land increase, we consider it very important to preserve agricultural land and to create conditions for competitive agriculture. As Swedish agricultural policy is part of the Common Agricultural Policy, action is also needed at EU level to achieve long-term sustainable use of agricultural land.</p>
<p>Land use is also important for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. By reducing emissions from organogenic soils and increasing carbon storage, agriculture and forestry can contribute towards meeting both national and international commitments.</p>
<p>Organic production is an important complement to conventional agriculture in achieving sustainable use of agricultural land. Organic production is particularly advantageous for biodiversity, since chemical pesticides are not permitted and more varied crop rotations are used.</p>
<p>We therefore propose:  An interim target for the preservation of agricultural land.  An interim target for a Common Agricultural Policy that promotes  long-term sustainable use of agricultural land.</p>
<p>We also raise three particularly important issues through assessments:  Prerequisites for preserving and enhancing an open and richly varied landscape.  A robust Swedish agricultural sector can enhance the natural and cultural values represented by farmland.  Creating conditions for reduced emissions of greenhouse gases from forestry and agricultural land.</p>
<p>Green infrastructure</p>
<p>Biodiversity is vital to ecosystems and their ability to deliver ecosystem services. In order to preserve biodiversity in the longer term, the countryside needs structures and functions, i.e. green infrastructure, that enable species to spread and move from one area to another. We consider that work on green infrastructure should be strengthened so as to make it possible to achieve more of the environmental quality objectives, bearing in mind not least the impact of climate change on the distribution, species composition and resilience of ecosystems.</p>
<p>We therefore propose:  An interim target for greater consideration of green infrastructure.</p>
<p>Enhanced climate adaptation</p>
<p>One of the great challenges facing society in the future is how to adapt land and water use to a changing climate. Climate adaptation involves identifying risks and vulnerabilities so as to avoid future disturbances in the functioning of society and costs for damages, but also taking advantage of the opportunities that a changing climate may bring. We consider that increased adaptation to climate change is needed to reach the environmental quality objectives. By ‘climate adaptation’ we mean measures designed to protect the environment and people’s lives, health and property by adapting society to the consequences that a changing climate may entail for land, water and human settlements.</p>
<p>We therefore propose:  An interim target for better conditions to adapt to a changing climate.  An interim target for  long-term sustainable management of surface runoff in built environments (drainage water) and in nature.</p>
<p>Sustainable use of water resources</p>
<p>In view of the various emissions to and physical changes in aquatic environments, the use of aquatic resources, and the increased demands on water, we need long-term sustainable management of our water. A sustainable water policy must help ensure good water quality and access to water, as well as the preservation of biodiversity and cultural environments. It must also contribute to the longterm sustainable development of aquaculture, agriculture and forestry, other forms of business activity, transport, tourism and regional development.</p>
<p>Even though many measures have been implemented that have improved the aquatic environment, in our opinion it is important that more action is taken, both internationally and nationally. To achieve this, a holistic approach must be taken to the marine and aquatic environment and different actors must cooperate effectively.</p>
<p>We therefore propose:   An interim target for sustainable fish management.</p>
<p>Here we also raise four particularly important issues through assessments:  Measures should be taken to deal with direct emissions of hazardous substances to aquatic environments.  Extended and stronger protection of marine areas.  Better conditions for restoration of coastal and freshwater environments.  Further measures are necessary to achieve a sustainable nutrient load.</p>
<p>Effective governance in the marine and aquatic environment area</p>
<p>Water-related environmental problems are managed in a number of parallel processes, both nationally and internationally. These constitute a complex and partially overlapping system that probably hampers the implementation of measures. There is extensive legislation in the water area, with governance at different levels. This has resulted in regulatory systems that are hard to oversee and understand. Applying the rules correctly demands resources, which risks diverting time and energy from the actual implementation of measures. We consider that governance needs clarifying and streamlining in various ways so as to strengthen the prospects of achieving the waterrelated environmental quality objectives.</p>
<p>We therefore propose:   An interim target for good status for Sweden’s waters.</p>
<p>We also raise one particularly important issue through an assessment:  Enhanced coordination of work on a programme of measures in the marine and aquatic environment area.</p>
<p>The environmental quality objectives related to water are very challenging. The proposed milestone targets and assessments we present in this report should be seen as steps along the way to achieving a cohesive and sustainable water policy.</p>
<h2>Overall impact assessment</h2>
<p>We present an overall impact assessment of our strategies. We also provide specific impact analyses linked to the different proposals.</p>
<p>Our proposals are based on the fact that efforts are required from the whole of society if the generational goal and the environmental quality objectives are to be achieved. The interim targets we propose aim to achieve more effective public admin- istration focusing on the environment, clearer environmental require- ments for operations that affect land and water, and more effective policy instruments for voluntary efforts.</p>
<p>The proposed interim targets do not conflict with Sweden’s commitments as a member of the EU or Sweden’s international commitments.</p>
<p>One vital factor for achieving the environmental quality object- ives is an efficient and coordinated public administration focusing on the environment. We have identified several areas where there is reason to develop working structures and methods. The data that government agencies and local authorities need for their work must be improved for more effective and efficient environmental action. In certain areas, there is a need to clarify the roles and responsibilities of administrative agencies and local authorities, and to develop structures for cooperation.</p>
<p>A fundamental principle in Swedish and European environ- mental legislation is that the operator is to pay the costs of the preventive measures required to protect the environment. Another type of economic policy instrument involves paying the operator for measures taken that benefit the environment over and above what is required by current regulations. This creates financial incentives for the operator to ‘produce’ environmental values. In the strategy for sustainable land use, this type of economic policy instrument is included in three of the milestone targets.</p>
<p>Knowledge about the values of ecosystem services and costs of environmental damage are essential conditions for cost-effective measures to achieve the environmental quality objectives. Know- ledge creation, advice and dissemination of knowledge are key elements in four of the interim targets we propose. Our assessment is that the measures we propose linked to these interim targets will contribute to increased cost-effectiveness in environmental work.</p>
<p>In our view, the proposed land and water strategies for achiev- ing the environmental objectives support the goal of a society that is sustainable in the long term from ecological, social and economic perspectives.</p>
