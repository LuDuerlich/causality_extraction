<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Committee proposes a new law on trade secrets, to replace the current Act (1990:409) on the protection of trade secrets (lagen [1990:409] om skydd för företagshemligheter, hereinafter FHL). The background for the proposal is that changes in the Swedish legislation are necessary to implement an EU directive on the protection of trade secrets. The Committee also proposes – independently from the EU Directive – a provision on criminal liability for individuals who attack a trade secret to which they have had lawful access due to employment or other similar basis.</p>
<h2>The Remit and its background</h2>
<p>8 June 2016 the EU adopted a Directive (EU) 2016/943 on the protection of undisclosed know-how and business information (trade secrets) against their unlawful acquisition, use and disclosure (hereinafter the EU Directive). The purpose of the EU Directive is to harmonise Member States' protection in civil law against unlawful acquisition, use and disclosure of trade secrets. The EU Directive does not prevent Member States from providing for stronger protection of trade secrets than the directive requires, provided that certain Articles of the EU Directive is complied with. Member States shall have implemented the EU Directive latest by 9 June 2018. The EU Directive does not contain any penal provisions.</p>
<p>The current Swedish criminal law concerning attacks on trade secrets does not prohibit someone with lawful access to a trade secret from disclosing or using the information. A previous committee concerning the strengthening of protection of trade secrets (SOU 2008:63) proposed that criminal liability should be introduced regarding such cases. A referral based on the committee’s proposal has, after some criticism from the Council on Legislation (Lagrådet), not been made into law.</p>
<p>The Committee has been instructed to consider the legislative changes necessary to implement the EU Directive and to consider how a criminal liability can be constructed for an employee who unlawfully uses or discloses a trade secret that he or she has had access to due to the employment.</p>
<h2>The Committee’s proposals in outline</h2>
<p>The current protection of trade secrets in Swedish law is mainly found in the 1990’s act on the protection of trade secrets. To a large extent this law responds to the requirements of the EU directive, and does also contain penal provisions relating to attacks on trade secrets. Although the Committee thus to a great degree have been able to depart from the rules provided in FHL and let the essence of these remain unchanged, the Committee has nevertheless suggested such a number of changes and supplements, which together justify a proposal for a new law on trade secrets.</p>
<p>In order to implement the EU Directive's requirements on the protection of trade secrets during and after court proceedings, the Committee has furthermore proposed changes in the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (offentlighets- och sekretesslagen [2009:400], hereinafter OSL), and also, inter alia, changes in the Code of Judicial Procedure (rättegångsbalken, hereinafter RB).</p>
<h2>The definition of a trade secret</h2>
<p>The Committee proposes that the definition of a trade secret in Swedish law is changed so that it more closely follows the definition of the EU Directive. The current requirement in Swedish law that the disclosure of the information must be likely to cause competitive damage shall be maintained. The current requirement in Swedish law that the information must concern the holder’s business activities should however be removed. The law shall explicitly state that also assemblages of information may constitute trade secrets. The Committee further proposes that it is made clear in law that information about what constitutes a crime or other serious irregularities can never legally constitute a trade secret and further that the law shall clearly state that workers' personal experience and skills do not constitute trade secrets.</p>
<h2>Legal and illegal acquisition, use and disclosure of trade secrets</h2>
<p>The meaning of “attack”</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the law should use the term “attack” for actions today referred to as acquisition, use or disclosure of trade secrets. In addition, the term attack shall also include import, export and storage of infringing goods with the purpose of exploiting these. An attack in the meaning of the law shall not require intent or negligence. It will instead suffice that it occurred without the rightful holder’s consent.</p>
<p>The law concerns unlawful attacks</p>
<p>It should still be stated that protection under the law only applies to unlawful attacks on trade secrets and that it is not considered unlawful for someone to attack a trade secret to make public, or reveal before an authority or other competent institution, anything that could reasonably be believed to be a crime, punishable by imprisonment, or that can otherwise be believed to be a serious irregularity. An attack shall in some cases be able to be lawful even if it does not concern irregularities adhering to the business of the holder of the attacked trade secret.</p>
<h2>Penal provisions</h2>
<p>The current provisions on industrial espionage ( företagsspioneri ) shall be kept, with the modification that the minimum penalty for grave cases of industrial espionage should be increased to six month imprisonment. As currently is the case, anyone who acquires a trade secret from someone who has committed industrial espionage shall be liable for unlawful handling of a trade secret ( olovlig befatting med företagshemlighet ).</p>
<p>The Committee proposes new provisions on penalties for unauthorised use of a trade secret or unauthorised disclosure of a trade secret ( olovligt utnyttjande av företagshemlighet  och olovligt röjande av företagshemlighet ). The rules apply to use or disclosure of a trade secret by a person who had lawful access to the trade secret as a result of that person’s participation in the trade secret holder’s business due to employment or other similar basis. Criminal liability should not apply if the attack can be deemed justifiable, even if it does not qualify as lawful. An example of this could be when an employee exposes his employer’s false marketing by disclosing trade secrets. An attack should also not be penalised if it in any other way can be deemed less serious. Criminal liability shall not apply for unlawful use or disclosure that occurs later than two years from when the participation in the trade secret holder’s business (i.e. normally the employment), has ceased. Attempts of and preparations for unlawful use or disclosure shall be punishable.</p>
<p>A person who acquires a trade secret from a person guilty of unauthorised disclosure of a trade secret under the new provision shall also be guilty of unlawful handling with a trade secret. Justifiable or otherwise less serious deeds shall not be penalised. A two year limitation period shall apply also in these cases.</p>
<p>Unauthorised use or disclosure under the proposed provision shall be punishable by a fine or imprisonment not exceeding two years. Grave offences shall be punishable by imprisonment for between six months and six years. In assessing whether the offence is grave, particular attention shall be payed to whether the act has been of a particularly dangerous nature, concerned significant value or resulted in considerably noticeable damage.</p>
<h2>Damages</h2>
<p>Anyone who is found guilty of a crime according to the new law shall compensate for damages caused.</p>
<p>As according to the current law anyone who uses or discloses a trade secret that that person has taken part of in business negotiations, shall be liable for damages.</p>
<p>According to the current law, an employee who intentionally or through negligence uses or discloses a trade secret held by the employer, of which the employee has taken part in his or her employment and under such conditions that the employee knew or should have realised that he or she was not allowed to disclose it, must compensate for the damage caused by the disclosure. The Committee proposes that this provision shall remain essentially unchanged.</p>
<p>Liability for damages shall, as is currently the case, apply for anyone who attacks a trade secret as a subsequent attacker. The provision regarding such liability is proposed to state that it will not be possible to escape liability on the ground that the trade secret was obtained from someone who acted in good faith.</p>
<p>A new provision is proposed on liability for damages for anyone who negligently acquires a trade secret.</p>
<p>Another new provision is proposed creating liability for damages for anyone who attacks a trade secret that a party or a party’s representative has been given access to due to a court decision.</p>
<p>The new law shall, as the current one, contain a provision on calculation of damages. As is currently the case, pecuniary as well as non-material damages shall be possible. It is proposed that the provision makes clear that regard shall be taken to the unlawful profit gained by the attacker. As is currently the case damages shall be able to be adjusted.</p>
<h2>Preservation of confidentiality of trade secrets in the course of legal proceedings</h2>
<p>A new and important addition in the proposed law concerns the protection of trade secrets during and after court proceedings. The Committee proposes a change in the OSL to establish absolute confidentiality for trade secrets during court proceedings. Such confidentiality is proposed to apply without limitation in time, although not after it has been finally decided that the information in question does not constitute a trade secret.</p>
<p>Trade secrets are often handled by the Enforcement Service and the Customs Service in conjunction with legal proceedings closely linked to court proceedings concerning infringements on trade secrets. The Committee proposes that the provisions on classification of trade secrets that apply for these authorities should apply without limitation in time, in the same way as for judicial confidentiality of trade secrets during court proceedings.</p>
<p>Liability for damages shall apply for anyone who intentionally or negligently discloses or uses a trade secret he or she realises or should realise has been disclosed in violation of OSL or a confidentiality order that has been issued under OSL.</p>
<h2>Measures against attacks</h2>
<p>Prohibitions and corrective measures</p>
<p>According to the proposed law a court shall be able to prohibit an attacker to continue the attack under penalty of a fine. The provision shall apply not only in case of usage or disclosure, but also in case of acquisition of a trade secret, since it can also be necessary to prohibit an ongoing acquisition, for example when someone continuously gathers secret information. A novelty in the proposal is that prohibition under penalty of a fine shall be possible in cases of attempts of or preparations for an attack, even if the conduct is not criminal.</p>
<p>Prohibitions and other measures shall be possible even if the attacker lacked of intent or negligence. Whether the attacker acted with intent or negligence can however have significance in the assessment of whether prohibitions and other measures in the individual case can be deemed reasonable and proportionate.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes a new provision making it possible for a court to decide that economic compensation is payed to the injured party instead of, for example, prohibition on continued usage, in cases when the attacker has acquired the trade secret in good faith. Such a decision shall require that other measures would lead to a disproportionately great damage and that the economic compensation to the injured party appears reasonable. The compensation cannot exceed the amount of royalties or fees which would have been due, had the attacker requested authorisation to use the trade secret in question.</p>
<p>As is the case today, a court shall be able to decide that objects or documents that contain the trade secret shall be given up to the holder, be destroyed, changed or be subject to other measures aimed at preventing misuse. The court shall also be able to decide that an infringing object is withdrawn from the market. Such decisions shall be possible also in cases of attempts of or preparations for an attack.</p>
<p>Measures must, as today, be decided according to what is reasonable. According to the EU Directive it shall be possible to prohibit a person who has disclosed a trade secret to the effect that the information is no longer secret, to use the information for a certain period of time, under penalty of a fine. The Swedish legislation needs to be supplemented with a provision making such a prohibition possible.</p>
<p>Provisional and precautionary measures</p>
<p>Provisional and precautionary measures shall be possible also when an action for a final judgement has not been brought. It shall suffice that such an action is brought within the limitation period of one month set in RB.</p>
<p>It is proposed that also attempts of or preparations for an attack shall be able to lead to provisional prohibitions and other precautionary measures.</p>
<h2>Publication of judicial decisions</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the new law shall contain a provision stating that the court shall be allowed to decide that a person who has committed or participated in an attack on trade secrets shall pay for the appropriate measures to disseminate information about the judgment. This shall also apply in cases of attempts of or preparations for an attack.</p>
