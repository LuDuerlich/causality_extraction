<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>Background</p>
<p>District heating has expanded greatly in recent years and is the dominant form of heating for multi-family apartment buildings and commercial premises in our urban areas. The number of detached houses heated by district heating is also increasing steadily.</p>
<p>Since 1996 the state has followed developments on the district heating market closely so that measures could be taken if necessary. The follow-ups that have been done have shown that customers, particularly private consumers, are in a weak position in relation to the district heating companies.</p>
<p>There were several bankruptcies of district heating companies at the turn of the year 2004/2005, entailing a risk of interruptions in supply. An interruption in the supply of such a vital utility as district heating could cause great inconveniences for individuals and could lead to damage to the water supply systems in buildings, particularly in the wintertime. As a rule, customers do not have any other district heating company to turn to if the bankruptcy estate decides not to continue operating the bankrupt entity. These bankruptcies have revealed the need for further review of the position of the district heating customers and the need to protect them from a cut in the district heating supply in the event of the bankruptcy of a district heating company.</p>
<p>The assignment</p>
<p>The Commission’s assignment has been to investigate and submit proposals to the Government for the purpose of guaranteeing supplies of thermal energy to district heating customers in the event of an insolvency situation in a district heating company.</p>
<p>The assignment includes making a detailed analysis of alternative forms for such a customer protection mechanism, for example that the district heating company pledges security, allocates money to a fund, or takes out compulsory insurance. Proposals for such regulation are presented in this report.</p>
<p>Goals of the proposals</p>
<p>The primary goals of the proposals presented in this report are to improve the customers’ situation and prevent a cut in the district heating supply due to bankruptcy of the entity that runs the district heating operation. The regulation I have now proposed is intended to be used to guarantee a continuation in the district heating supply when a district heating company has gone bankrupt.</p>
<p>A district heating fund should be created</p>
<p>In this report the Commission presents a proposal that a special fund be created, the District Heating Fund . It should be possible to disburse money from the fund to pay the necessary costs for continued operation of a bankrupt district heating operation for at most one year from the date of bankruptcy of the district heating company. If special reasons exist for a longer period of support, money can be disbursed from the fund for a period longer than one year. It should also be possible to use the fund to pay the costs of fund management and administration, review of cases concerning disbursement of support from and repayment to the fund, as well as enforcement of the law. The District Heating Fund should contain at least SEK 50 million.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the fund be financed by fees  levied on entities that run district heating operations, according to the District Heating Act previously proposed by the Commission. By “district heating operation” is meant an operation where hot water or another heat carrier is distributed for heating purposes, but only if the operation targets an indeterminate circle of customers within a given geographical area. District heating operators who run their operation in the form of a municipal administration or only temporarily are exempted from paying the fee. The fee shall be paid every year at a rate of 0.03 per cent of the district heating operation’s</p>
<p>turnover, unless the balance in the fund amounts to at least SEK 50 million. The Swedish Energy Agency is proposed to be the feecollecting authority.</p>
<p>The proposed law sets up certain conditions for obtaining support from the fund . Support can be paid provided that the entity that runs the district heating operation has gone bankrupt. In addition, the law requires that the bankruptcy estate follow the customers the bankrupt entity’s priceagreement on the bankruptcy date in order to receive support from the fund. Finally, the bankruptcy estate must also continue to distribute district heating to the bankrupt entity’s customers.</p>
<p>Support from the District Heating Fund is only payable for necessary costs . Such costs are costs that are necessary for the continuation of the bankrupt entity’s district heating operation, e.g. costs for fuel, purchase of waste heat, personnel, premises, operating electricity, normal operating and maintenance measures and for the bankruptcy estate’s continued running of the operation.</p>
<p>When it comes to the amount of the support , only that portion of the necessary costs that corresponds to the loss that arises in the continued running of a bankrupt district heating operation shall be reimbursed. The loss is calculated as the difference between the revenues from the district heating operation and the necessary costs for the continued running of this operation.</p>
<p>Granted and paid support  from the District Heating Fund shall be kept separate from the bankruptcy estate’s own assets and may only be used for the intended purpose. The bankruptcy estate shall give an accounting of the use of this money and, on request, furnish the documentation needed for verification. In the event the support has not been used in the intended manner, or has not been spent in accordance with the budget on which the disbursements from the fund were based, or if incorrect information has been furnished as a result of which support has incorrectly been disbursed from the fund, the bankruptcy estate can be held liable for repayment.</p>
<p>Management of the fund</p>
<p>In my opinion, management of the District Heating Fund’s assets should be entrusted to the Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency. The fund’s assets shall be managed as a special</p>
<p>fund. The return that is earned on the assets shall be added to the capital. In view of what kind of situation the fund’s assets are to be used in, it is important that the assets be managed in such a manner that good ability to pay is ensured. The cost of management of the District Heating Fund by the Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency shall be paid from the fund’s assets.</p>
<p>Reviewing authority</p>
<p>Questions concerning disbursement and repayment of granted and received support shall be reviewed by an authority designated by the Government. I recommend that the Swedish Energy Agency be appointed as the reviewing authority for the District Heating Fund. A procedure where a council or a board within the Swedish Energy Agency reviews disbursements of support from the fund would also limit the organizational consequences which the fund solution might otherwise lead to.</p>
<p>Supervision and enforcement</p>
<p>In order for the purposes of the new law I propose to be achieved, it is necessary to have effective supervision with means to verify compliance with the rules stemming from the proposed law and sanctions that can be imposed in the event of non-compliance. I therefore propose that rules of supervision and enforcement be introduced.</p>
<p>I further propose that an authority be designated to exercise the supervision that is required to verify compliance with the proposed law or regulations issued pursuant to it. I do not propose requiring that the supervisory function be exercised by one and the same authority. It should be up to the Government to determine which authority or authorities are to exercise this supervision. I do, however, propose that supervision of the bankruptcy estate’s use of money from the District Heating Fund undergo scrutiny by the enforcement services’ units for supervision in bankruptcies and that supervision to ensure that prescribed fees to the District Heating Fund are paid in time be carried out by the Swedish Energy Agency.</p>
<p>Consequences</p>
<p>For the median district heating company with a turnover of SEK 31 million, the fee to the District Heating Fund represents an annual cost of SEK 9,300. I cannot see that this would have an adverse effect on the competitive situation of small district heating companies. Nor is there any appreciable increase in the district heating companies’ administrative burden, since the proposed regulation only entails calculation and payment of the fee.</p>
<p>The measures that follow from my proposals will entail certain costs for the state. I propose that the cost for the state’s supervisory tasks, fee administration, case review and the administration entailed by the proposed district heating fund law be financed via the District Heating Fund.</p>
