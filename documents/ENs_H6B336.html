<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>If our society is to develop and if we are to be able to solve various problems, we need research. We need research and research organisations in various disciplinary areas that produce results that can be used for our common good.</p>
<p>Sweden has a world-leading position in terms of statistics about living conditions and health. Our individual-based registers provide good possibilities of successful research based on them. This means our country is also attractive for researchers in other countries. More effective use of existing registers and databases is needed to be able to benefit fully from our unique situation.</p>
<p>The Government stated in our terms of reference that better conditions are needed for register-based research and tasked us with proposing long-term regulation of research databases.</p>
<p>In addition to this remit, we have also had, in this part of the inquiry, the remit of analysing:</p>
<p>• whether there is a  long-term need for special regulation of a forensic psychiatry research register;</p>
<p>• what regulation is needed of a national biobank register;</p>
<p>• what legal regulation is needed to enable Statistics Sweden (SCB) to release information about the income situation of individuals to the Luxembourg Income Study (LIS);</p>
<p>• whether stronger protection is needed for data about deceased persons in forensic research; and</p>
<p>• what legal possibilities the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation provides for the processing of personal data by the National Library of Sweden and other research libraries.</p>
<p>The final part of our remit was reported to the Ministry of Education and Research in a memorandum in autumn 2017 (annex 5).</p>
<h2>Our interim report</h2>
<p>In our interim report  Processing of personal data for research purposes 3  we analysed what regulation of the processing of personal data for research purposes is possible and may be required on account of that the Data Protection Regulation will be applicable as from 25 May 2018.</p>
<p>In connection with that work we defined a need to pass a research data act with the purpose of enabling the processing of personal data for research purposes while protecting the rights and freedoms of the individual. In our interim report we therefore proposed a research data act that would be applicable to all processing of personal data for research purposes irrespective of the legal basis.</p>
<p>We also reached the conclusion that an examination under the Act (2003:460) concerning the Ethical Review of Research Involving Humans (the Ethical Review Act) constitutes such a suitable and specific safeguard that is required for personal data processing for research purposes of sensitive personal data or personal data concerning criminal offences, etc. to be permitted.</p>
<p>In addition, we found that there is reason to further investigate the need for changes to the ethical review procedure. In our view, the full ethical review should be limited to processing of personal data that formally requires extensive protection of that kind. Current ethical review requirements also cover processing of personal data that can generally be regarded as less of a risk for the individual, but that still requires a suitable safeguard. Against this background it is not reasonable and proportionate to apply the same ethical review procedure to all kinds of processing of personal data covered by the Ethical</p>
<p>Review Act. If the procedure cannot be geared to the need for protection, this also risks eroding confidence in ethical review as a safeguard. In the light of the restrictions on our mandate and the rest of the framework for our work, we proposed that a differentiated ethical review procedure should be investigated further in a separate form.</p>
<h2>Our approach</h2>
<p>A research database is a collection of personal data that has been collected from individuals or from other sources and which is a national resource that supplies data for several different research projects.</p>
<p>The time during which a research database is in existence in the activities of a research organisation – the lifecycle of the database – can be divided into different stages. Some activities in the research database run continuously, while others have a stronger link to a certain period. The lifecycle perspective can be used to analyse what activities need to be regulated in order to achieve secure processing of personal data in the database. We describe the lifecycle of a research database in the following five stages:</p>
<p>In our assessment, regulation that only covers a few fields of research, identified centrally, and a small number of research organisations would not be sufficient to provide for safe handling of personal data in research databases. We therefore propose general regulation covering as many databases as possible. In practice there are also already a large quantity of different kinds of research databases in several different types of research organisations.</p>
<p>We conclude that the principle of the freedom of research means that the initiative to create a research database should come from research organisations and not from the Government. In our view, the needs for collections of data can best be identified and formulated in research activities. Our proposal for long-term regulation therefore assumes that it is research organisations that will assess what research databases are needed.</p>
<p>According to our remit, the regulation we propose also has to include good protection for personal privacy – in addition to meeting the needs of research. In our view, there is good protection of privacy when this right is in balance with other fundamental rights and legitimate public interests. We therefore propose suitable and secure regulation of research databases that both meets the needs of research and includes good protection of personal privacy.</p>
<h2>Long-term regulation of research databases</h2>
<p>We propose regulating the processing of personal data in a research database in a separate act, the act on research databases .  This act regulates what research organisations will be allowed to be responsible for research databases and what safeguards are required for a research database to be compliant with the law.</p>
<p>Under our proposal, both state higher education institutions and universities and the private higher education institutions that are covered by the principle of public access to information and have a right to award qualifications will be allowed to process personal data in research databases. Public authorities other than those that conduct education will be allowed to be responsible for research databases if their mission includes research. This applies to both central and local government authorities.</p>
<p>One fundamental safeguard that we propose is that a research database must be approved under the Ethical Review Act. In this process, the scientific value of the research database must be assessed and weighed in relation to its potential risks with respect to the health, security and privacy of the included research subjects. In addition, we propose that all research that will use data in a research database will have to have ethical approval. We propose amendments to the Ethical Review Act that make these safeguards possible.</p>
<p>Another important safeguard that we propose is a new provision on research secrecy in the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400) and a corresponding provision on an obligation to observe professional secrecy at private research organisations in the research databases act. The data in a research database as well as the research projects that use these data will therefore be covered by either research secrecy or an obligation to observe secrecy.</p>
<p>In addition, the research databases act makes requirements concerning organisational safeguards. Such requirements also follow directly from the Data Protection Regulation. We specify them in more detail by requiring principal research organisations to have a head of operations with operational responsibility for a research database. There also has to be an organisational unit that is responsible for the security and privacy protection in the research database. In addition, the activities of the principal research organisation have to include risk-based information security work.</p>
<p>The research databases act contains requirements concerning technical safeguards. The research organisation has to determine conditions for the allocation of authorisation for electronic access to personal data in a research database. The research organisation also has to check that access is used in the right way.</p>
<p>The processing of personal data in a research database will come under the supervision of the Swedish Data Protection Authority in the same way as other processing of personal data. In addition to a research database being subject to supervision, we propose giving the Swedish Research Council the task of monitoring databases created under the new act. We consider that legislators must be kept informed about the effect of the act on the handling of personal data in research databases. Moreover, we propose giving the Swedish Research Council the task of initiating and supporting work to draft a code of conduct for the processing of personal data in research databases.</p>
<p>A further important safeguard we propose is to give research subjects the possibility of insight into how their own data are handled in the research database. A research organisation will be able to grant the individual direct access to their own directly identifiable data.</p>
<p>Taken together, the proposals we present will make up a package of safeguards for personal privacy. In addition to the requirements that apply under the regulation of data protection , personal data in a research database will be protected by, for example:</p>
<p>• limitation of which research organisations are allowed to be responsible for a research database;</p>
<p>• the research organisation’s responsibility for personal data;</p>
<p>• conditions for the creation of a research database;</p>
<p>• requirement of ethical review of the research database;</p>
<p>• requirement of ethical review of the research projects that are to use the personal data;</p>
<p>• secrecy and obligation to observe secrecy;</p>
<p>• internal secrecy;</p>
<p>• organisational measures;</p>
<p>• technical measures;</p>
<p>• codes of conduct;</p>
<p>• requirements concerning financing of the research database; and</p>
<p>• monitoring.</p>
<h2>Forensic psychiatry research register</h2>
<p>In certain cases special laws already make research databases possible. One such law is the Act on Forensic Psychiatry Research Register (1999:353) (called the Register Act below).</p>
<p>The National Board of Forensic Medicine is the controller of personal data for the forensic psychiatry research register. The register may be used for two purposes: first, processing of personal data for research in forensic psychiatry, if the research and processing has been approved under the Ethical Review Act and, second, for monitoring, evaluation and quality assurance in forensic psychiatry by the Board.</p>
<p>In a report to the Government the Board has pointed out that the Register Act does not provide adequate support for research in forensic psychiatry. This is because current issues in forensic psychiatry cannot be resolved with the aid of the limited information that is allowed to be registered in the register. According to information we have obtained the register has not been maintained since 2005.</p>
<p>Our assessment is that there is no long-term need for special regulation of a forensic psychiatry research register and we therefore propose the repeal of the Register Act.</p>
<h2>A national biobank register</h2>
<p>Our remit has been to continue the preparation of the proposal for a central register for traceability of tissue samples in Sweden’s biobanks presented by the Register-based Research Inquiry .</p>
<p>The Register-based Research Inquiry proposed converting the Swedish Biobank Register into a national system for registration of biobank samples (the National Biobank Register) with the National Board of Health and Welfare as the body responsible and controller of personal data.</p>
<p>In parallel with this Inquiry, the Inquiry on the Regulation of Biobanks has been tasked with investigating certain aspects of a national register for traceability of tissue samples. That Inquiry proposed establishing a national biobank register for research needs, while retaining the Swedish Biobank Register. That register would meet healthcare needs of traceability of samples taken in connection with care and treatment. The data would be made available to healthcare providers and be reached by direct access in systems for keeping integrated medical records under Chapter 6 of the Patient Data Act (2008:355). The National Board of Health and Welfare is proposed as the body responsible for, and controller of personal data of, a national biobank register of samples taken for research purposes.</p>
<p>We mainly concur with the proposals of the Inquiry on the Regulation of Biobanks for a national register for traceability of samples in biobanks to be used for research, quality assurance and the production of statistics.</p>
<p>The Inquiry on the Regulation of Biobanks made the assessment that the data in the national biobank register will be covered by statistics secrecy. To guarantee acceptable protection for the data in the register, we instead propose a special secrecy provision referring to data about an individual in a national biobank register. This secrecy would apply unless it is clear that the data can be disclosed without damage to the individual or someone close to them (reverse requirement of damage). So secrecy will be the general rule for these data. This is the same secrecy protection as applies to these data when they are handled in healthcare.</p>
<h2>Research databases in Europe</h2>
<p>We have the remit of analysing what legal regulation is needed to enable Statistics Sweden (SCB) to release information on the income situation of individuals from its registers to the European database called the Luxemburg Income Study (LIS) and to present the necessary legislative proposals.</p>
<p>However, it is not only the LIS that is of interest for our remit of making it possible to process personal data in research databases. In the EU there are several examples of research cooperation in which Sweden is participating along with other countries.</p>
<p>We propose a secrecy override applicable not only to the LIS but also to all research databases operated by research organisations covered by the Data Protection Regulation. This override would mean that, under certain conditions, data that is subject to secrecy may be disclosed to a research organisation outside Sweden that is covered by the Data Protection Regulation. If it would be possible to release the data to Swedish research database in corresponding cases, and if the research organisation is subject to secrecy rules corresponding to those that apply under the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act and the research databases act, the releasing authority may examine whether the data can be released.</p>
<p>We consider that such a provision enables desirable research cooperation in the EU and includes good protection for personal privacy. The protection for the data would have to meet the requirements concerning security in the processing of personal data set in the Data Protection Regulation. Under these conditions the purpose of the Regulation can also be met: i.e. protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data at the same time as the free movement of data in the Union is not restricted.</p>
<p>It will be a demanding task for a Swedish authority to determine whether a research database in the EU meets the conditions set for the disclosure of the data. Authorities will need information about how the receiving research database processes personal data and what safeguards are applied. The Inquiry finds that it is appropriate for a government agency, for example the Swedish Research Council, to be commissioned by the Government to assist authorities with information of that kind. The agency that is given this commission should consult with the Swedish Data Protection Authority.</p>
<h2>Processing of data about deceased persons in research</h2>
<p>We have examined the current protection of data about deceased persons in research and whether there is a need to increase it.</p>
<p>Our assessment is that the existing legislation along with our proposal for research secrecy and an obligation to observe secrecy provides sufficient protection for data about deceased persons. In making this assessment we have also taken account of the fact that the protection for survivors also protects the deceased person indirectly. We consider that no further protection should be introduced for data about deceased persons.</p>
