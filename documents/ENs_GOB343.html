<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>The principal task was to examine the responsibility on the part of the public and private sectors for safe road traffic. The Committee of Inquiry was also to propose new or revised regulations, sanctions and systems of inspection emanating from the outcome of the inquiry. Further, the Committee was to conduct an inquiry into the establishment of an independent road traffic inspectorate, including recommendations concerning how such a body should be organised, its tasks and powers of authority and how it should be financed.</p>
<p>The inquiry has taken the name: Committee of Inquiry into Road Traffic Responsibility.</p>
<p>Traffic injury trend</p>
<p>Up until the beginning of the 1970’s, the trend in traffic injuries was directly related to developments in automobile traffic; i.e., more cars on the road led to an increase in traffic fatalities and injuries. At the beginning of the 70’s, this trend was broken and even reversed. During the 80’s, the reduction in the number of persons killed or seriously injured stood at a standstill, and towards the end of the decade, there was an increase in the number of fatalities. The first half of the 90’s witnessed another decline in the number of persons killed or seriously injured in traffic. However, the situation in the latter half of the decade up until the present time is extremely disquieting. The number of deaths and</p>
<p>serious injuries in traffic is not decreasing at the pace stipulated in the goals in traffic policy (maximum 400 fatalities by the year 2000 and 250 by 2007). On the contrary, the number of traffic fatalities is tending to increase.</p>
<p>Despite the long-range positive trend in traffic injuries, the risk of being killed in the road transport system is substantially higher than in other modes of transport.</p>
<p>Political attention on the traffic safety problem</p>
<p>Traffic safety has been the subject of several different inquires, government bills and parliamentary decisions over the past decades. 1982 was the first year in which goals were established by the Swedish Parliament concerning traffic injuries. In October 1997 Parliament decided that the long-term goal for traffic safety was no deaths or serious injuries as a result of traffic accidents in the road transport system (”Vision Zero”) and that the design and performance of the road transport system was to be adapted to the demands emanating from this. In June 1998 Parliament supported the Government’s proposal that ”Vision Zero” was to apply as a long-range goal not only for road traffic, but for all modes of traffic. In connection with this, Parliament also approved an interim goal, which as far as road traffic was concerned, entailed that the number of persons killed as a result of a road traffic accident was to be reduced by 50% by the year 2007, calculated from the figures for 1996.</p>
<p>Public and private sector responsibility for safe road traffic</p>
<p>On the basis of ”Vision Zero”, the Committee of Inquiry into Road Traffic Responsibility has analysed the shortcomings in today’s legislation concerning the system designers’ responsibility for a safe road transport system.</p>
<p>Although traffic safety as such is a recurrent subject in road traffic legislation, it is still doubtful whether it – and the responsibility for it – can be assumed to be the actual main purpose of the different bodies of regulations. Several of the statutes serve as a guide for different processes within the road transport system, (such as the planning, construction and maintenance of roads, vehicle inspection, administration and maintenance of the national driving licence system, vehicle registration and establishment within the commercial traffic industry) and put their emphasis on regulating the different administrative procedures.</p>
<p>The system designer’s responsibility concerning safety has not been made clear in the traffic legislation in force today.</p>
<p>Product safety</p>
<p>Regulations concerning product safety and product responsibility are intended to counteract any dangerous goods and services provided by business and industry from causing harm to people or property. The manufacturer essentially bears full responsibility for the safety of his products, and has an obligation not only to eliminate risks and potentially injurious situations beforehand, but also to undertake various counteractive measures even in those cases where a product has passed from production onto the market. The authorities can exercise coercive interference, but the desirable changes in behaviour on the part of a business or industrial enterprise should be implemented as far as possible on the basis of voluntary undertakings initiated by the company itself. Internal control has thus been assigned a prominent role.</p>
<p>The area of application of product safety legislation is limited compared with special productoriented legislation. It can be ascertained that, to a large extent, special provisions do exist for the goods and services provided in the road transport system. Thus, it is not a question of applying the provisions in product safety legislation to the road transport system. On the other hand, product safety legislation ought to cover the possible gaps</p>
<p>concerning the safety of goods and services that can exist in special legislation.</p>
<p>Safety responsibility within other sectors of society</p>
<p>The Committee of Inquiry has also conducted a survey of the regulations concerning the safety of products and services that apply within other modes of transport as well as in the working environment.</p>
<p>Within railway traffic, aviation and shipping and navigation, it can be said that a ”Vision Zero” has been well on the way for a long time, even if not expressed in the way formally decided by Parliament in June 1998. Long-term, systematic work on safety has been conducted within these modes of transport for quite some time, which is why the safety level is generally already quite high. Continued safety endeavours concentrate on maintaining and improving this level.</p>
<p>The ”Vision Zero” idea also exists within the working environment area, even if it has not been clearly articulated that no one is to be killed or seriously injured as a result of an accident at work. Instead, the aim is to achieve steady improvement through providing action against accidents at work, promoting general well-being and otherwise attain a good working environment. On the whole, the responsibility for the different components in the activities intended to produce a better working environment can be said to have been carefully specified in this area as well.</p>
<p>Development issues within other sectors of society</p>
<p>During the 1990’s, the educational system moved from detailed control to goal and result management, and in the opinion of the Committee, there is much of value to be learned from the experience gained through this development. The Committee has therefore chosen to illuminate the educational sector as well, not because it works specifically with safety and safety responsibility</p>
<p>issues, but rather because the Committee feels that the way in which this system is being run demonstrates an approach that is of interest for achieving a fast and steady improvement of the road transport system as well.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the Committee, the educational system has come a long way in the development process, which the Committee also recommends for the road transport system: substantially less detailed control, and in its place, goal and result management in combination with quality systems and internal control.</p>
<p>”Vision Zero” – an important principle in the development of the road transport sector</p>
<p>Just as we cannot accept people being killed or seriously injured at work or in any other sector of society, we cannot accept this happening in road traffic. ”Vision Zero”, which is a long-term goal with respect to safety in the transport sector, is nothing other than an expression of this important principle and an approach to the development of the transport sector. The physiological tolerance level of human beings in combination with actual human behaviour must therefore be the basic parameter in the overall design of the road traffic system. This means that the road transport system must be designed so that everyone, both young and old as well as physically disabled persons, can travel safely.</p>
<p>System designers’ responsibility to be regulated by law</p>
<p>Legislation within the road transport system, which puts the sole responsibility for traffic accidents and traffic injuries onto the indvidual, in all probability contributes to an erroneous outlook on how we can develop road safety, and is actually counteractive to traffic safety endeavours. Those who build up the traffic system,</p>
<p>such as road managers, vehicle manufacturers, those legislating rules and regulations and those who use the system professionally, also exert a considerable influence on road safety. In order to achieve a safe road transport system, there must be a change in our views concerning responsibility, to the extent that system designers are given a clearly defined responsibility for designing the road transport system on the basis of human capabilities, thereby preventing the occurrence of those cases of death and serious injury that are possible to predict and prevent. In light of this, the Committee proposes that the parliamentary decision based on the principle of ”Vision Zero” and the responsibility of the system designers for safety in road traffic be regulated by law.</p>
<p>System designers be required to manage a systematic quality programme intended to improve road safety</p>
<p>According to the law proposal, requirements would be imposed on the system designers to manage a systematic quality programme for the purpose of improving road safety.</p>
<p>If a serious accident occurs, it is urgent from a safety perspective to clarify the causes so that similar accidents or mishaps can be avoided in the future. Within the framework of modern quality assurance systems, it is fundamental to know where the problems lies within the area of operation, solve them, and learn from the past and prevent the problems from arising again. The Committee recommends that the system designers themselves study fatal accidents and likewise present their own proposals about what should be done to prevent reoccurrence.</p>
<p>Recommendation for the establishment of a road traffic inspectorate</p>
<p>The law proposal is a so-called framework act. Thus, a special body is needed that would be commissioned to elucidate and follow up the implementation of the intention of the law, and reinforce the prerequisites for safe road traffic. This is to be accomplished through inducing the system designers to assume responsibility for steadily improving and upholding safe road traffic so that human life and health is not placed in jeopardy. The Committee recommends that a special supervisory authority, a road traffic inspectorate, be set up and commissioned to uphold the purpose of the new law.</p>
<p>The tasks of the road traffic inspectorate are:</p>
<p>• to carry out general and specific evaluations and inquiries</p>
<p>• to ensure that the system designers conduct accident inquiries of high standard and make decisions on undertaking adequate and effective measures.</p>
<p>• to draw up rules and regulations concerning requirements on a quality assurance system for road traffic safety</p>
<p>• to initiate a certain degree of research and development.</p>
<p>The Committee of Inquiry is of the opinion that only relatively limited resources, 20–30 people, would be needed to conduct effective evaluations and inquiries. This would be possible under the condition that those employed to do so were highly competent all rounders, and that these operations were carried out openly, through a dialogue with the system designers and in co-operation with other supervisory authorities, and that advantage be taken of the opportunity to engage both national and international expertise. The requirement on competence on the part of those employed is far more important than the size of the authority.</p>
<p>One question on which the Committee has had to take a stand is whether such an inspectorate would have the authority to order the system designers to undertake different measures with or without penalty, or otherwise forbid certain activities if</p>
<p>shortcoming were discoverd in road traffic safety. There are arguments that both speak for and against providing the inspectorate with such an instrument of authority. The Committee chooses to propose however that the inspectorate should not be given a mandate entailing having coercive measures. This standpoint is based on the following assessment.</p>
<p>• pointing out responsibility through legislation, as the Committee is doing, is something entirely new, and we are therefore unable to comment on how the system designers will live up to this responsibility.</p>
<p>• if the inspectorate is given the power to order the system designers to undertake different measures or to forbid certain activities, it would be difficult to assert that the inspectorate is not in fact a system designer itself.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasise that it is the system designers who are responsible for remedial action in the face of deficiencies and shortcomings. This lies at the core of a modern quality programme.</p>
<p>The road traffic inspectorate should, moreover, be a public authority that uses the potential in modern technology to full advantage and develops an efficient work procedure based on a geographically spread network and a common goal.</p>
<p>A network-oriented manner of conducting work would provide the conditions for recruiting people with high, all-round competence, establishing good contact with universities and institutes of technology while making it relatively easy to interact with system designers in their current arena.</p>
<p>The Committee therefore proposes that the road traffic inspectorate should have offices in Umeå, Borlänge, Stockholm, Gothenburg and Lund. Apart from the head office, each branch office should have a staff of between four and five persons.</p>
<p>The Stockholm office should be the hub in the network organisation and it is proposed that the top inspectorate management be placed there. This would enable good contact with the other offices and many of the most important system designers.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Stockholm office be comprised of about nine to ten people. If an alternative location for top management is advocated for other reasons, the Committee has no definite objection to this.</p>
<p>Impact on road traffic safety</p>
<p>The ultimate aim of the proposals we are presenting in this Inquiry is eventually to eliminate those deaths and serious injuries in the road transport system that system designers can predict and prevent. The system we are proposing is largely similar to those that apply in other modes of transport and in the working environment. Hence, a reasonable ambition could be that developments at least follow those that have occurred in the working world, i.e., a 50 % reduction in the number of persons killed within a ten-year period.</p>
<p>Economical effects</p>
<p>A new public authority, the requirement concerning accident inquiries as well as a quality assurance system will entail direct costs for the Government, municipal authorities and companies.</p>
<p>The Committee estimates that the cost of its proposals will amount to between SEK 50 and 60 million per year. Of this, SEK 30 million should be redistributed within the traffic safety budget and SEK 10 million (5+5) should be redistributed from traffic safety to state and local authority negotiations. The remaining SEK 10 to 20 million per year is a cost to be assumed by the private sector and certain national authorities.</p>
