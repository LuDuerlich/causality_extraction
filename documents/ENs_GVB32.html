<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The volume and development of financial assistance largely reflects the situation in the labour market and actions and developments in other policy areas. In the course of our inquiry, we have therefore touched upon many different areas of society and have presented proposals for changes in several policy areas. This has been necessary because dependence on assistance is caused by many different factors. By the same token, the tools for achieving change are also to be found in a range of policy areas. Our starting point has been that people in the target group must be given the support they need on the basis of the established structures of society. Accordingly, our proposals seek to clarify the responsibility that different authorities bear for the target group.</p>
<p>The inquiry’s proposals focus on the great majority of people who are currently receiving financial assistance for labour market reasons, since it is almost impossible to define the target group in more detail. This approach has strong support in the existing research TPF FPT  and in the in-depth studies occasioned by the inquiry.</p>
<p>One of the ambitions of the inquiry has been to base its proposals, as far as possible, on the individual person’s opinions and views of the changes needed to strengthen his or her links to the labour market, since a lasting change can only be achieved if it strengthens the individual’s own motivation and is based on each person’s own circumstances.</p>
<p>It is also important that a common socio-economic approach runs through the work of the different responsible authorities. Priorities must be more generally seen from a cross-sectoral perspective and long-term considerations must have greater influence, at both central and local levels. More attention should be paid to the socio-economic benefits that result when the need for overall social support declines in a range of social arenas.</p>
<h2>Changed methods at public employment services</h2>
<p>In this section, we mainly discuss proposals for changes that affect the activities of the public employment services and the Swedish Labour Market Administration.</p>
<p>External suppliers</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that ten per cent (SEK 320 million) of the Swedish Labour Market Administration’s appropriation 22:3</p>
<p>Purchases of employment training and other costs be set aside for procuring services from external suppliers for jobseekers who have a weak foothold in the labour market. Examples of such external suppliers may be employment agencies, education companies, organisations or social and work cooperatives. TPF FPT</p>
<p>One of the advantages of such a change is that external suppliers do not need to take the public authority role into account, a consideration that can sometimes limit the creativity of public employment services. Instead, external suppliers can concentrate on supporting and coaching jobseekers and leave official responsibilities to the public employment service. Another advantage is that external suppliers often have access to strategic networks other than those of the public employment services.</p>
<p>Job agents – a new professional capacity at public employment services</p>
<p>Some 6 000 people currently work at the public employment services. Wage costs for these employees amount to close to SEK 2 billion. A relatively small proportion of the resources of the public employment services goes to employer contacts and to job vacancy matching.</p>
<p>We propose that the Government instruct the National Labour Market Board to restructure the human resources of the public employment services so that greater attention can be given to the service needs of employers. A new professional capacity should be introduced at the public employment services – that of ‘job agent’ – whose task will be to focus on employer contacts and business sector organisations.</p>
<p>Job agents must be well acquainted with employers’ conditions, have documented knowledge of business economics and marketing, have a good knowledge of specific industries, possess good business intelligence skills and have a good knowledge of the regional labour market in the business and public sectors. Closer employer contacts will increase the confidence employers have in the public employment services, which in time may lead to the registration of more vacancies. Job agents will also be able to assist in individual recruitment assignments if the employer, for reasons of time, is unable to go through a large number of job applications. In this way, job agents can facilitate the recruitment process for the employer and help minimise vacancy durations.</p>
<p>We also propose that the Government instruct the National Labour Market Board to reintroduce targeted employment services, which give officials an opportunity to specialise in specific industries and professions. This would give both employers and jobseekers a better prospect of obtaining good services from the public employment services.</p>
<p>Foothold jobs for new jobseekers – a supplement to new start jobs</p>
<p>The ‘new start jobs’ programme was introduced on 1 January 2007. These new start jobs aim to give people who have become very detached from the labour market greater opportunities to return to work. As regards new labour market entrants who are dependent on financial assistance, it will be possible to offer some of them new start jobs at an early stage while others may have to wait a year.</p>
<p>We consider it important to take steps at an early stage for all jobseekers who are new labour market entrants and are dependent on financial assistance. These people often lack the contacts and references acquired by more experienced workers in the course of their work, making it harder for them to compete for available jobs. Their limited contact networks also make them more dependent on the opportunities and abilities of the public employment services to interest employers in their services. This mainly applies to young people and people born abroad who have not gained a foothold in the labour market, and for that reason are dependent on financial assistance.</p>
<p>People who are obliged to rely on the last-resort safety net provided by society are also a particularly vulnerable group, since they are not only excluded from working life but are often also excluded from the income-related components of the general welfare system.</p>
<p>We propose that ‘foothold jobs’ be introduced as a supplement to new start jobs. Foothold jobs may be made available to people who are not covered by the new start jobs programme.</p>
<p>Foothold jobs will be positions for which employers receive a tax reduction of up to 50 per cent of total wage costs, though no more than SEK 350 per day. This subsidy will be available for a maximum of six months, and will be applicable to fullor part-time employment with a private or public sector employer or non-profit organisation.</p>
<p>The conditions required for a jobseeker to be offered a foothold job are that the person in question has limited experience of Swedish working life, has been registered with the public employment services for at least six months, has not earned any income by working during this period and has been dependent on financial assistance for his or her support.</p>
<p>The foothold jobs proposal entails higher subsidies for employers than new start jobs. This in turn means that it is fair to demand more of the employer. Consequently, for an employer to be able to employ someone under the rules proposed for foothold jobs, it is proposed as a necessary condition that the employer is able to offer the employee a personal mentor during the period of employment, and, if needed, offer personal in-service training.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the introduction of foothold jobs be regulated by statute and that incentives to employers for foothold jobs approved by the Swedish Labour Market Administration would be provided to the employer in the form of tax credits.</p>
<p>Mentoring schemes</p>
<p>Individual support in the form of a mentor can be beneficial when taking the first step into working life. One of the measures lacking today is the opportunity to give unemployed individuals personal support during work experience placement or participation in a labour market programme. Personal support may, for example, involve a workmate being selected to support the unemployed person’s introduction to the workplace. The inquiry proposes the introduction of mentorship in the form of personal support during work experience placements or participation in other labour market programmes. It is proposed that mentorship be regulated in the Labour Market Policy Programmes Ordinance (2000:634).</p>
<p>Rehabilitation through work in social and work cooperatives</p>
<p>The added value that social and work cooperatives are able to contribute both to the individual and society should be more widely used in work-oriented rehabilitation. The strength of social and work cooperatives is that they are based on participation, selfhelp and giving people opportunities to develop and regain control over their own lives, which is in itself a rehabilitating experience. In this way, employment in a social and work cooperative becomes a form of rehabilitation in itself.</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the ‘developing employment’ (utvecklingsanställning) and ‘secure employment’ (trygghetsanställning) labour market policy programmes for people with disabilities concentrate more on social and work cooperatives.</p>
<p>To enable more developing and secure employment positions to be channelled to social and work cooperatives, it is important that the public employment services learn more systematically from the experience of local cooperative development agencies and municipalities. It is therefore proposed that public employment services be instructed, together with the cooperative development agencies and municipal representatives, to make an inventory of local social and work cooperatives and to develop methods and routines for local matching of developing and secure employment positions at social and work cooperatives.</p>
<p>If more social and work cooperatives are given an opportunity to start up, a more inclusive working life can be created. To further encourage the establishment of more social and work cooperatives, it is proposed that the allowance given as financial support to those providing developing and secure employment positions may, in certain cases, amount to as much as SEK 300 per day per employee. It is proposed that to qualify for this higher allowance, a social and work cooperative must be able to start activities that offer rehabilitating programmes to people who are at present excluded from working life and who need work-oriented rehabilitation. The goal must be that working at the social and work cooperative will enable these people to move from social exclusion to an inclusive working life.</p>
<p>We also propose that half of the funds allocated to NUTEK for information and advisory services be used to promote social and work cooperatives running non-profit, work-integration programmes.</p>
<h2>Distribution of funds to labour market policy</h2>
<p>We consider that greater regard should be had to the activity rate among people of working age in different regions when funds are distributed within the Swedish Labour Market Administration. The reason for this is that the activity rate is a better indicator of the attachment of a region to the labour market than unemployment. In some deprived areas in the metropolitan regions, there are groups of unemployed people who do not consider it worthwhile even to register as unemployed with the public employment services, since they believe that such registration is pointless and will not lead to employment. This resignation, in turn, may lead to the perception that unemployment is low in that area. Low unemployment figures may, however, conceal a low activity rate, which instead indicates a high level of exclusion. Some deprived areas risk receiving a smaller share of resources if this is not brought to light. This is particularly unfortunate since some of these areas may, in fact, need a larger share in order to reduce exclusion and improve attachment to the labour market.</p>
<h2>Social Services Act to clarify responsibility for measures targeting young people receiving social welfare allowance</h2>
<p>We propose an amendment to Chapter 4, Section 4 of the Social Services Act to clarify the authority responsible for the measures that social welfare committees may require recipients of welfare allowances to participate in for a certain time. The Swedish Labour Market Administration is to be responsible for work experience placement and other labour market measures. The measures to which social welfare committees assign people receiving financial assistance are to be skills-enhancing measures of a social character and aim to strengthen the individual’s capacity to take part in work experience or other labour market programmes, or, when appropriate, further education. The Swedish Labour Market Administration will continue to be entitled to procure services from municipalities, but municipal measures must serve as a supplement to central government action.</p>
<h2>Improved opportunities for financial coordination</h2>
<p>When a person has several types of problems, and when his or her needs are complex, diffuse and difficult to classify, coordinated action is required from several authorities. To be able to offer people in need of coordinated action measures from several parties, long-term financing is necessary.</p>
<p>We propose that ten per cent of the budgeted costs of sickness benefit should be available for use in financial coordination, instead of the current five per cent. We further propose to allow agreements on financial coordination involving fewer than four parties. The reason for this is to avoid situations where one authority is able to prevent a joint initiative that the other actors are interested in. Under present requirements, there must be agreement to coordinate economic resources, under a set financial coordination arrangement, between a public employment service, a social insurance office, a municipality and a county council. If there are fewer than four parties, we also propose that the parties be given the opportunity to agree on a different distribution of the financial budget if this would facilitate local coordination. Local agreements may, for example, provide a basis both for the type of activities to be conducted and for financing arrangements.</p>
<p>Further, we believe that this financial coordination should be able to lead to new ideas and new forms of welfare services at the local level. An objective of this type is not described in the current legislation on financial coordination. It is important that opportunities are provided at local level to try out different forms of organisation and new combinations of measures. We therefore propose that Section 2 of the Act on Financial Coordination of Rehabilitation Measures (2003:1210) be reworded to clarify that the coordination of rehabilitation is to serve the purpose of developing new types of measures.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Swedish Social Insurance Agency be instructed to follow up and support the development of financial coordination.</p>
<h2>Better rehabilitation for people receiving financial assistance</h2>
<p>The need for rehabilitation measures for people who are dependent on financial assistance has been neglected, which adds to the risk of people becoming more or less permanently excluded. Diffuse health problems often lie behind dependence on benefits and it can be difficult to identify the measures that an individual needs. A more in-depth analysis may make it possible to identify rehabilitation needs and clarify the responsibilities that fall to different public authorities. We consider that there should be more structured arrangements for allowing the social services to benefit from the expertise of the Swedish Social Insurance Agency with regard to examining people’s needs for rehabilitation. We therefore propose that a new provision be included in Chapter 22 of the Social Insurance Act (1962:381), making it clear that the Swedish Social Insurance Agency is to initiate a rehabilitation investigation no later than four weeks after reception of a referral from the social services. It is proposed that the referral procedure should require the consent of the person concerned.</p>
<p>Although much has already been done to improve rehabilitation efforts and increase cooperation in the field of rehabilitation, there is much to indicate that people who are excluded from the sickness insurance system still risk ending up last priority when deciding who should be considered for rehabilitation measures. It is therefore proposed that the Swedish Social Insurance Agency be instructed to establish, together with the public employment services, municipalities and primary care, an organisational framework for cooperation on people who lack a qualifying income for sickness benefits. The aim of this cooperation is to facilitate the transition from allowances to employment for people in need of financial assistance and coordinated rehabilitation measures. It is proposed that SEK 160 million be allocated for this purpose.</p>
<h2>A common goal – a higher employment rate</h2>
<p>To facilitate entry into the labour market for people who are dependent on financial assistance, it is important that all the actors at local level have the same overall goal for their efforts. Otherwise, in the worst case, the authorities’ different goals may be counterproductive. Increasing the employment rate has long been an important political objective and we consider that this should be reflected at agency level as well. We therefore propose that a new overall common goal be included in the appropriation directions of the Swedish Labour Market Administration and the Swedish Social Insurance Agency. This goal will be to increase the employment rate for everyone of working age. This will make it natural for measures to focus on reducing the growing exclusion. It will also increase the chances that people who are severely detached from the labour market will be considered for different types of measures. This goal can also be regarded as a social investment ahead of possible future labour shortages. However, the new overall goal must be adapted to the activities of the various authorities and agencies and to local self-government, so as to enable local adjustment and analysis at a later stage.</p>
<h2>A common and cohesive welfare organisation</h2>
<p>In our proposals we clarify in various ways where responsibility for the inquiry’s target group lies and create conditions for smoother cooperation. However, our terms of reference have not included proposing any major organisational change in welfare services.</p>
<p>We believe, however, that like many other European countries, Sweden could reap positive results from a more coherent welfare organisation at local level. In a number of countries, a coherent organisation – a one-stop portal – for society’s support to all unemployed people either already exists or is being prepared. Not infrequently, authorities with rehabilitation duties have an explicit role in these new types of organisation.</p>
<p>We propose a more comprehensive future analysis of this issue than it has been possible for this inquiry to make. There are a number of arguments for developing coordination and bringing the support provided to individual people under a single umbrella. The most common reasons mentioned are:</p>
<p>• For the individual, it is an advantage, both financially and  health-wise, to have access to active, coherent rehabilitation measures.</p>
<p>• It reduces toing and froing and the duplication of labour.</p>
<p>• It requires fewer resources.</p>
<p>Various reports read by the inquiry, as well as the local contacts it has had, show that individual people are often referred to another authority as its responsibility. In this way, people are sent round and round from one place to the next, with no one being held responsible.</p>
<p>Of course, an organisational reform will not, in itself, solve all the difficulties involved in getting more people into work. The availability of work and the extent to which the labour market can be made more accessible are naturally of vital importance. However, a change in organisation may provide better organisational conditions for facilitating entry into the labour market for people currently outside working life.</p>
<h2>Assessment of jobseekers’ qualifications</h2>
<p>Among those who are now dependent on financial assistance, many were born abroad and many are young unemployed people with limited experience of Swedish working life. Their formal qualifications are either incomplete or difficult to translate to Swedish conditions. It is also a fact that municipalities and public employment services often disagree as to whether or not people receiving financial assistance are at the disposal of the labour market.</p>
<p>For the sake of relevant and early assessment of a person’s ability to work, we propose that new jobseekers who have been registered with the public employment services for at least two months be offered validation. It is proposed that this change be regulated in the Labour Market Policy Programmes Ordinance (2000:634).</p>
<p>We also propose that a working group made up of representatives of the Swedish Labour Market Administration, the National Board of Health and Welfare, the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions and the Swedish Social Insurance Agency be instructed to design in more detail a common instrument for assessing an unemployed person’s capacity for work. This new instrument is to build on the different instruments that already exist for assessing a jobseeker’s qualifications.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we propose that the Swedish Labour Market Administration continue its work on developing statistical models aimed at ensuring that the right action is taken for the right jobseeker.</p>
<p>The three instruments – statistical models, validation and instruments to assess capacity for work – can be used to complement each other, depending on the status and needs of individuals, and can be an aid to the public employment services, the Swedish Social Insurance Agency and municipalities alike.</p>
<h2>Better economic incentives for individuals</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s terms of reference have included analysing the influence of the design of maintenance support on economic inducements to go from social assistance to employment. We propose two changes in this area.</p>
<p>Introduction of an activity incentive</p>
<p>Financial assistance is the last-resort safety net provided by society, which means that all income must be deducted in its entirety before making an assessment of the need for assistance. Further, the Social Services Act (2001:453) states that no one has a right to financial assistance if their needs can be provided for in any other way (Chapter 4, Section 1). This means, for example, that increases in compensation levels in other welfare systems do not automatically lead to an increase in disposable income, since needs have then been provided for in another way. It also means that in practice, income from a person’s own work makes no difference as long as the income remains at a level that leaves that person still dependent on financial assistance, since the income reduces the amount of assistance paid. Social services welfare allowances thus have a 100 per cent marginal effect, which means that it is not always financially advantageous to go from assistance to employment. In the long run, this can lead to people in getting stuck in prolonged dependence on assistance.</p>
<p>It is important that society signals that it pays to work. It is also important to use financial assistance as a means of encouraging individuals to make their way into working life, even if their income from work may initially be relatively low. We have therefore concluded that there may be grounds for making certain essential exceptions from financial assistance serving as society’s last-resort safety net. In our opinion, exceptions may be warranted if the result is reduced dependence on assistance and strengthened ties to the labour market.</p>
<p>To encourage the transition from assistance to employment, we propose that an activity incentive be introduced for people who have received financial assistance for a period of six months under the Social Services Act and who have found work, increased their working hours or changed jobs and thereby increased their income from work. Under the activity incentive, when calculating a reasonable standard of living under the Social Services Act, the increased income from work is to be disregarded, up to an amount not exceeding SEK 1 500 per month.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the activity incentive be in effect for six months if the person otherwise fulfils the requirements for receiving financial assistance.</p>
<p>Income from young people’s holiday work</p>
<p>We propose an additional exception to the basic principle for calculating financial assistance. Under this exception, young people working in school holidays and living in a household that is dependent on financial assistance will be allowed to keep their earnings up to a certain limit. This proposal is based on our view that it is important for these young people to be able to feel that it pays to work during school holidays and vacations. Such work also puts them in touch with working life. We propose that when calculating a reasonable living standard for families who are dependent on financial assistance, income up to half a price base amount (as defined in the National Insurance Act) per calendar year should be disregarded for young people working on the side while engaged in education. It is proposed that this rule cover households receiving financial assistance where the parents are responsible for the support of children living at home and attending compulsory school and young people below the age of 21 who are studying at upper secondary level.</p>
<h2>Proposals relating to upper secondary education</h2>
<p>Under its terms of reference, the inquiry is to consider the significance of educational measures, particularly for young people. In general, young people with gaps in their education have greater difficulty gaining a foothold in the labour market and this increases the risk that they will become dependent on assistance. The inquiry would therefore like to draw attention to the role of education in putting young people in a good position to obtain work and reducing the future need of action on the part of society.</p>
<p>Better profiling of vocationally oriented programmes</p>
<p>In our opinion, in many parts of the country, vocational programmes are under-represented in the range of educational programmes available. The education that students receive in upper secondary school does not always match later demand in the labour market. In many municipalities, for example, student volumes at upper secondary level are too small in programmes with a focus on technology, manufacturing, construction and health and social services. We propose that the Swedish National Agency for School Improvement be instructed to make a more detailed analysis of the necessary conditions for raising the profile of vocationally oriented programmes in upper secondary school.</p>
<p>Apprenticeship training</p>
<p>We also consider that apprenticeship training should be available in the upper secondary school system. We propose that the Swedish National Agency for School Improvement place particular emphasis on apprenticeship training in its ongoing development work and that it, in cooperation with authorities concerned, make proposals on arrangements for apprenticeship training in upper secondary school.</p>
<p>Better access to study and vocational guidance</p>
<p>We believe that all young people must have access to expert study and vocational guidance, provided in cooperation between public authorities, the private business sector and the voluntary sector. We propose that a new chapter be introduced in the Education Act (1985:1100) to regulate study and vocational guidance in compulsory (primary and secondary) schools, upper secondary schools, special schools, upper secondary special schools and Sami schools. This proposal is motivated by various reports from the National Agency for Education that have revealed the great disparity and lack of equality between and within municipalities in terms of access to study and vocational guidance. It is also important that all young people are offered guidance, even without a strict connection with their schools.</p>
<p>Further development of trial activities at Navigator Centres</p>
<p>At present there are around twenty trial projects involving coordination offices known as Navigator Centres. These projects bring together public employment services, municipalities and local business, as well as voluntary actors, in efforts to provide assistance and advice to young people at risk. The purpose of the Navigator Centre is to break the exclusion of young people from the labour market. We propose further development of these trial activities at Navigator Centres in ten municipalities and that the National Board for Youth Affairs be instructed to define more detailed arrangements and conditions for these activities.</p>
<p>The principal reason for our proposal is that young people often meet with support from a variety of unconnected sources, without the necessary coordination required to improve their prospects of obtaining work. These trial activities improve opportunities to combine educational measures, language support, work experience and labour market measures. It is therefore important that local authorities are given an opportunity to try out quite new forms of coordinated support from society to young people, on the basis of the differing local conditions. Our proposal involves a form of cooperation that will enable coordination of resources from the public employment service, the municipality, the voluntary sector and business.</p>
<p>Three weeks of work experience for everyone in upper secondary school</p>
<p>The very most important factor for increasing the chances of obtaining a job is perhaps work experience. We know from previous experience that people who have taken educational programmes that include work experience more quickly gain a foothold in the labour market. The significance of work experience is also apparent from a survey that the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise has conducted among 21-year-olds in Sweden. The survey shows that 69 per cent of those asked consider that their period of work experience during upper secondary education had a great or considerable influence on their decisions concerning employment and the future after upper secondary school. In our opinion, contact with working life must also be expanded for students other than those taking vocationally oriented courses. We therefore propose that all students be offered three weeks of work experience during their total time in upper secondary school.</p>
<h2>Better knowledge of the causes of financial assistance</h2>
<p>During our inquiry we have had great difficulty obtaining information about the composition, size and other features of the target group from municipalities and public employment services. Since financial assistance is the last-resort financial safety net provided by society, it is a clear indicator of how failings in the welfare system affect people’s need for such support. The shortage of job opportunities, for instance, is a crucial factor. Consequently, it is essential to obtain a better understanding of what causes the need for financial assistance and how this changes over time. Great efforts must be dedicated to creating nationwide knowledge about why people need financial assistance. In our view, the National Board of Health and Welfare should be instructed, together with the National Labour Market Board, the Institute for Labour Market Policy Evaluation and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions, to design a system for following up the causes of dependence on financial assistance and the effects and costs of different measures for people receiving financial assistance.</p>
<h2>New jobs are needed</h2>
<p>A closer analysis should be made of the possibilities of opening up new arenas of work for people currently outside the labour market, with a view to achieving a more inclusive working life. We support the proposal to introduce a tax reduction for household-related services and believe there is reason to further develop services that can be offered to both private people and companies. It should also be possible to develop services in the environmental area. We primarily have in mind:</p>
<p>• Services related to  home-help services, enabling private people to obtain help with lawn-mowing and simple maintenance.</p>
<p>• Company-related services, enabling companies to order simple services, say, from a pool of providers.</p>
<p>• Environment-related services, of a ‘green jobs’ nature, providing maintenance of beaches, nature reserves and the like.</p>
<h2>Economic implications</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes a number of changes that will mainly be financed by reallocation of existing resources. With regard to the proposals on changes in working methods at the public employment services, for example, the proposals are financed by reallocation of existing appropriations to the Swedish Labour Market Administration.</p>
<p>There will be new additional costs for work by young people alongside their studies. These costs are estimated at between SEK 20 million and SEK 40 million. More than half of all municipalities</p>
<p>already apply the principle we propose, so that the real new costs will be between SEK 10 million and SEK 20 million. We propose that these increased costs be financed under expenditure area 9 by means of a reallocation of appropriation 18:1 Grants to development of social work, etc. This appropriation includes resources for developing social work and grants to organisations working on behalf of children at risk and their families. In the Budget Bill for 2007, the Government proposes allocating just over SEK 613 million to this appropriation, which means an increase of approximately SEK 200 million over 2006. An estimated SEK 261 million is anticipated for this appropriation in 2008.</p>
