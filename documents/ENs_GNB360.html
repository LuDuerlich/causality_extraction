<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>st</p>
<p>Sweden deregulated the taxi market the 1 of July 1990. Among other things this meant that the operators no longer had to be members of dispatch centrals. Today about 30 percentage of the operators are so called free-wheelers, which means they do not belong to any dispatch central. Most of them operates in the larger cities.</p>
<p>The deregulation has been good for the customers in many ways, mainly due to the increased competition within the trade. However, the deregulation also has had some negative effects.</p>
<p>In February 1998, the Swedish government decided to initiate a special inquiry for the purpose of evaluate the present situation within the taxi trade and, with that evaluation as a point of departure, to assess the need for a compulsory association for operators to a taxi organisation (i.e. a dispatch central) or some other joint organisation as well as looking into the preconditions for such an association. A judge assisted by a panel of experts was appointed to conduct the inquiry.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of the report of the Governmental Commission on Taxi Services entitled, in translation from the original Swedish, ”The aim towards making taxi more customerfriendly”. The report is identified as SOU 1999:60.</p>
<h2>The present situation</h2>
<p>The Commission has carried out a broad inquiry into the problems, visiting and conferring with representatives for organisations of the trade, dispatch centrals, terminals, authorities and manufacturers of meters. The problems most commonly mentioned are the over all irregularities within the trade, problems regarding the fixing of fares and problems for customers to make contact with the taxi company after a ride in order to launch a complaint. Various problems are aggravated at terminals and there are also problems concerning the laws on competition, deficiencies in the public bidding procedure and shortcomings in the control and supervision by the authorities.</p>
<p>The Commission has concluded that the taxi trade itself and the authorities both regard irregularities within the trade, mainly in the form of incomes not accounted for, as the largest problem. These irregularities bring, among other things, about a twisting of the competitive conditions. Another large field of problems is the fixing of fares. The ways in which fares are fixed and information on fares are given today, makes it very difficult for the customers to calculate the fare. These problems are discussed further in section 3 and 8.1.4.</p>
<h2>Dispatch centrals</h2>
<p>What is a dispatch central?</p>
<p>The term “dispatch central” has been in use for a long time and goes back to the days when operators started to join organisations in order to, among other things, co-ordinate bookings.</p>
<p>A dispatch central of today fulfils many different tasks. These tasks vary from one central to another. Apart from functions related to bookings, the central often takes care of administrative tasks such as the handling of credit card slips and invoicing. It also takes care of marketing and the negotiation of contracts regarding public paid rides and business customers. Many dispatch centrals has a system for handling complaints from customers and also exercise a certain control over associated operators. Fares are, as a rule, fixed jointly at the centrals. Some centrals are storing the information from the operators’meters.</p>
<p>Forms of organisation vary. Mostly the dispatch central is organised as an incorporated association or a limited company. There are many different structures of ownership – you may find dispatch centrals jointly owned by the operators, centrals owned by one independent agent and various structures in between.</p>
<p>Are dispatch centrals beneficial to consumers?</p>
<p>Dispatch centrals has several advantages. They provide taxi companies with an opportunity to show their profile and thus makes it easier for the customers to choose taxi company as well as to order a car. Furthermore, dispatch centrals are easily accessible for customers who want to launch a complaint or claim items forgotten and left behind. The cooperation in dispatch centrals also facilitates the supervision and control of the trade by the authorities. This ought to increase the motivation of the operators to go straight and live up to current standards.</p>
<p>Regarding the fixing of fares it appears that the centrals can contribute in making fare schedules more transparent and in making sudden raises of fares more rare.</p>
<p>As far as society is concerned it is generally more easy to supervise operators associated with a central than individual operators since the centrals can provide information on their operators.</p>
<p>Thus, it can be established that dispatch centrals, in general, further the conducting of the taxitrade along more serious lines and maintains service at a higher level, mainly because one has a common fund of goodwill to safeguard.</p>
<p>What would be the consequences of a compulsory system?</p>
<p>The over all intentions behind a compulsory system are, among other things, that the customer will find it easier to choose the kind of journey he wants to make (i.e. regarding service, price etc.) and to complain, should the journey prove unsatisfactory. Another great advantage is that the dispatch centrals can take over some of the responsibility for the supervision over the trade from the authorities.</p>
<p>The Commission is of the opinion that a demand for all operators to be associated with a dispatch central has to be linked with a public authorisation for the centrals themselves. There must be persons at the dispatch centrals whose suitability has been approved by the authorities as well as continuos supervision over the centrals by the authorities.</p>
<p>Otherwise there will be a danger of operators joining into loosely formed centrals where no one exercises control over the activities, which in turn could bring about that the positive effects would not be forthcoming.</p>
<p>The area of responsibility for the dispatch centrals must be carefully defined. If, for instance, there is a demand for around the clock service, the central has to state within which area of traffic it is operating. Otherwise the authorities cannot control whether the service is properly maintained. For the same reason rosters probably have to be set up at the centrals.</p>
<p>Within a compulsory system everybody with a taxi operator’s license must have the right to join a dispatch central. Hence the compulsory system has to involve an obligation on behalf of existing centrals to accept those operators who are willing to recognise and uphold the statutes and other rules of the central. Furthermore no central should be allowed to exclude any associated operator on any other grounds than those objectively acceptable.</p>
<p>As a dispatch central will have a certain responsibility for the behaviour of the associated operators, no operator should be allowed to belong to more than one central at a time. This could lead to difficulties for seasonal taxi business at, for instance, tourist resorts to function efficiently.</p>
<p>Association to a dispatch central should be voluntary</p>
<p>There are great advantages connected with the dispatch centrals, both for consumers and the authorities responsible of supervising the taxi trade. Operators associated with a central do, of course, find the co-operation advantageous as well. There are, however, many disadvantages connected with what has been said in the previous section.</p>
<p>During its work the Commission has got the impression that developments within the taxi trade run towards an increasing number of operators join in dispatch centrals. It is usually necessary to belong to a central in order to be allowed to pick up customers at the terminals or, at least, it constitutes an advantage to belong to one. Furthermore there is usually a demand for co-operation in a central for the operators to obtain contracts about publicly paid rides and business customers.</p>
<p>It is also the view of the Commission that centrals on the whole are more and more realising that quality and service do pay off and hence are, voluntarily, raising their own standards of service and business ethics. This has very much to do with the customer’s increased awareness of the trade’s conditions which means that customers more often and actively choose their rides, i.e. prefer to use some dispatch central in which they have confidence. In this context the active work performed by organisations of the taxi trade to improve upon quality and raise the level of service within the trade and thus further sounder business morale, should also be mentioned. Thus, the Commission finds that the taxi trade already – very much on it’s own initiative – is steering in a direction of sounder conditions. There has to be very strong reasons to do anything to jeopardise this development. The Commission’s conclusion is that there are no such reasons and that it, under those conditions, would be wrong to propose such drastic measures as introducing compulsory association to a dispatch central.</p>
<h2>Are there other measures that can reduce the problems?</h2>
<p>Although the taxi trade as a whole seems to be moving towards sounder conditions, there still are things to improve upon. The main problems concern the existence of incomes not accounted for, black labour and the twisted competition which is a result of this behaviour. The Commission is of the opinion that something must be done to increase the risk of exposure, which in turn would lead to a decrease in irregularities.</p>
<p>Another area of problems is the fixing of fares and overcharging.</p>
<p>Yet other areas within which improvements can be made are taxi stands at terminal sites and taxi stands on municipal ground.</p>
<p>De-tanking centrals</p>
<p>The Governmental Commission on Taxi Services is of the opinion that the information from the meters should be secured and stored in order to function as a controlling-material for the authorities in their regular supervision. It is important that the system for handling this information is trustworthy, which among other things means that the material normally should be transferred from the meters and be stored in such a way that it cannot be manipulated or simply cleared away. On that account the Commission proposes special de-tanking centrals – approved by the authorities – to be set up.</p>
<p>From the point of view of security a system of separate de-tanking centrals is to prefer. There are, however, some arguments against such an arrangement. De-tanking and storing of information already take place at larger dispatch centrals, service companies etc. to be used in their work with invoicing and following up on business etc. A regulation stating that de-tanking centrals be separate would mean either that operators in these situations in addition to this would have to de-tank at the separate central or that the separate central would have to deliver corresponding materials to the dispatch central or the service company, after having received it. To build up an organisation with separate detanking centrals would furthermore prove difficult to motivate economically. Because of this the Commission is of the opinion that even others than separate centrals should be able to get an approval as detanking centrals.</p>
<p>De-tanking centrals, of course, must have the technical equipment necessary for receiving and storing information from the meters. Also there has to be proper storing facilities. Material received and stored must be handled in such a way that no individual operator can manipulate it. To make the system secure a de-tanking central should serve a certain number of vehicles, as an recommendation no less than twenty. In exceptional cases, de-tanking centrals serving fewer vehicles could be</p>
<p>accepted, for instance when it comes to small centrals in sparsely populated areas.</p>
<p>The Commission considers the County Government Boards suitable organs for licensing and supervision.</p>
<p>Anyone, who deliberately destroys or in any other way clears away data that should be stored in the de-tanking central, should be punished. The penalty should be the same as for illegal professional traffic, i.e. a fine or prison for no more than one year. Often such a crime also can be regarded as an aid in crimes concerning fraudulent bookkeeping or tax evasion. In these cases the regulations in the criminal code and the law on tax evasion will apply. The crime should normally lead to a revocation of the de-tanking central licence.</p>
<p>Failure on behalf of the operator to empty the meter as prescribed should lead to a fine or imprisonment for no more than one year. Furthermore this failure should normally lead to a revocation of his operators licence.</p>
<p>The proposal on de-tanking centrals is discussed in more detail in section 8.3.2.</p>
<p>Registration of fares</p>
<p>One problem, which is often called attention to, is the overcharging of customers. Even if a customer has a receipt for the fare and launches a complaint afterwards with the receipt supporting it, the customer has found it difficult to prove that he has had to pay too much since it is hard to establish what was stated in the information on fares originally given. The Commission has studied the system for registration of fares applied in New Zealand and has found that it apparently functions well without noticeably burdening neither the operators nor the authorities. The Commission thinks that such a system even in Sweden could mean that a customer would be able to substantiate his claim versus an operator more easily and, conversely, that an operator more easily could refute an unsubstantiated claim. Check-ups after a complaint from a customer would become much easier and it would also simplify the</p>
<p>County Government Board’s general supervision of the taxi trade.</p>
<p>Only fares offered to the general public need to be registered. The use of other rates than the registered ones, except for previously agreed lower fares, would not be allowed. The operator have to report the rates he intends to apply to that County Government Board who acts as licensing authority regarding his operator licence. This could preferably be done in the form of a duplicate of the fare schedule presented in the car.</p>
<p>The County Government Board is not supposed to approve the report of fares, only register it. When the report has been registered the County Government Board will send a confirmation back to the operator. The operator will then be able to apply the new fares. This procedure is intended to be swift and simple and could be done by faxing the documents back and forth between the operator and the County Government Board.</p>
<p>Failure to register fares should be punishable with a fine. If the nonobservance continues the County Government Board should be able to reconsider the suitability of the license holder for running a taxi business.</p>
<p>The proposal on registration of fares is discussed further in section 8.3.3.</p>
<p>Fare schedules</p>
<p>Today the fare schedules are difficult to understand for customers. This is partly because the customer does not have any opportunity to compare fares since the way of presenting them differs from one company to another, partly because there is such a large number of fare categories that a customer often finds it difficult to conclude exactly which kind of fare that applies to the ride he plans to do. The Commission holds the view that it would be for the good of the customers if the information about the fares looked identical on taxi vehicles throughout the country. Information would then be much easier to understand. Also, it would be easier to compare fares of different companies. To accomplish this the Commission proposes that the Swedish National Road Administration, after consulting the Swedish Consumer Agency, issue rules with such a content. In these rules it should be made mandatory that comparable fares be presented. Furthermore the Commission is of the opinion that too many different categories of fares make the information difficult to understand. Because of this the Swedish National Road Administration should, in it’s rules, limit the number of fare categories allowed.</p>
<p>This proposal is discussed further in section 8.3.3.</p>
<p>Terminals</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, some of the problems within the taxi trade are most noticeable at terminals where demand for taxi services is large and where there are many travellers unfamiliar with the local conditions and</p>
<p>the knowledge of the local taxi market. These problems have been considered important to solve. Thus, one of the tasks for the Commission has been to investigate how the situation at different terminals appear today and if those responsible for the terminals could try to improve the conditions. The investigation made, shows that those in charge of the terminals often have found acceptable solutions and that there are different ways of handling the issues depending on the specific characters of different terminals. These solutions have furthermore been approved by the Competition Authority.</p>
<p>Solutions at the terminals often mean that agreements are made with dispatch centrals or that it at least is to the operator’s advantage to belong to one. This means that there is an incentive for operators to join dispatch centrals on a voluntary basis, which is a positive development. As a rule the terminals’ demands in the agreements are comparatively stern which raises the level of service and the over all quality, improves order and reduces risk for customers to be overcharged. Risks for customers to be exposed to harassment or other pushy behaviour by drivers are also reduced. The contract conditions also lead to an increased internal control within the dispatch centrals.</p>
<p>A survey of solutions implemented at different terminals is to be found in section 6. In section 8.3.4 is mentioned how the situations on municipal street ground could be improved.</p>
