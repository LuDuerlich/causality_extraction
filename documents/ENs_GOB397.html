<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The assignment</h2>
<p>The Commission’s assignment was to review the possibility of increasing electronic information exchange between social insurance offices, the National Social Insurance Board, the National Board of Student Aid (referred to below as ”the agencies”), county labour boards and employment benefit offices. The purpose of increasing information exchange would be to improve service to the individual, ensure accurate decision support data and prevent inappropriate payments.</p>
<h2>Issues addressed by the Commission</h2>
<p>The main issue addressed by the Commission was whether increased electronic information exchange between the agencies mentioned above, social insurance offices and unemployment benefit offices can be reconciled with the need to protect the individual against unacceptable infringements of privacy. Apart from this, the Commission addressed the following three important questions.</p>
<p>The first question was whether unemployment benefit offices should be permitted to increase their information exchange with the agencies and social insurance offices.</p>
<p>The second question was whether the electronic transmission of information which already takes place should be regulated in statutory provisions where such provisions do not already exist.</p>
<p>The third question was whether computerized records should be made available to the other partners in information exchanges by direct access.</p>
<h2>Our proposals</h2>
<p>We propose that the rules on public access to documents and confidentiality should apply to the unemployment benefit system and that social insurance offices, the National Social Insurance Board, the National Board of Student Aid and county labour boards should be required to disclose data to supply unemployment benefit offices with data. This would meet the unemployment benefit offices’ need of increased information exchange.</p>
<p>We also propose that legislation be adopted concerning the unregulated information transmissions that already take place today, i.e. of information from county labour boards to unemployment benefit offices and from unemployment benefit offices to social insurance offices, the National Social Insurance Board and the National Board of Student Aid.</p>
<p>Finally, we propose that the organizations concerned should be permitted to exchange computerized data by allowing the recipient direct access to information from the discloser.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The legislation relating to various benefits is based on the assumption that whoever makes decisions about benefits or allowances – whether it is a public authority, a social insurance office or an unemployment benefit office – has access to the data necessary for decision-making. Often these data are submitted by applicants. But the decision-maker often needs to obtain information from elsewhere too. Therefore, information is already transmitted between the agencies, social insurance offices and unemployment benefit offices.</p>
<p>The Secrecy Act does not apply to unemployment benefit offices. The main obstacle to transmitting information to the offices is that there is no guarantee that it will be treated confidentially. Consequently, the offices have very limited access to computerized information sources.</p>
<p>The great need of information in the agencies, social insurance offices and unemployment benefit offices has gradually made it necessary to transmit information of various kinds. These transmissions have usually been made without reference to any regulatory framework. Some kinds of information are therefore transmitted without legislative support and, as regards the data transmitted by unemployment benefit offices, on a voluntary basis.</p>
<h2>The need to increase information exchange</h2>
<p>Efficient workflow management</p>
<p>In recent years, Parliament and the Government have on several occasions mentioned the need for more efficient workflow management, particularly in the social insurance system, but also in the study support and unemployment benefit systems. To achieve this, the relevant data in individual cases must be accurate, applications must be processed quickly and the decisions taken must be correct. Those who allocate government funds must therefore be in a position to obtain information from both individuals and others in a rational and simple manner. The development of information technology and electronic services via the Internet has opened up new possibilities of improving workflow management. The present trend is towards workflow management systems that allow electronic storage of all the relevant documents in individual cases. It is not easy to reconcile this trend with current procedures, under which written certificates are often issued by a public authority and then submitted by the applicant to the reviewing authority. Advantage should be taken of the potential for electronic information exchange offered by modern technology.</p>
<p>Improved service for the individual</p>
<p>Increased information exchange could help to shorten processing times and make it possible to take decisions more quickly on various benefits. Short processing times are particularly desirable when it comes to applications for benefits and allowances. It may be extremely inconvenient for applicants to have to wait several weeks for the first payment of sickness benefit, parental benefit, unemployment benefit or study support. If the scope for information exchange were extended, applicants would not personally have to see to it that the data available to the agencies, social insurance offices and unemployment benefit offices are complete and up to date. The procedure whereby the individual applicant has to obtain documents from one authority and submit them to another will appear increasingly anachronistic as people become accustomed to very different channels of communication.</p>
<p>Control of government funds</p>
<p>In recent years, Parliament and the Government have repeatedly and in various contexts called attention to the need for better control of payments from government funds, particularly in the social insurance system but also in the unemployment benefit and study support systems. These demands have been made in response to the inadequate control of these systems.</p>
<p>The Swedish National Audit Office has estimated that inappropriate payments due to fraud, improper benefit claims and systemic shortcomings in the social insurance and unemployment benefit systems amount to SEK 5–7 billion per year. The main type of fraud consists in individuals collecting a benefit at the same time as they receive a salary. The information exchanges that are the subject of this inquiry will not help to detect and prevent this kind of fraud.</p>
<p>The main kind of fraud that could be prevented by increasing electronic information exchange is duplicate payments. None of the studies that have been performed of this kind of fraud deal with all the systems that are reviewed in the inquiry.</p>
<p>About SEK 300 billion is paid out annually from the systems covered by the inquiry, and this corresponds to about 40 per cent of the Government’s expenditure budget, including the old-age pension system. The unemployment benefit system accounts for about 10 per cent of these payments. According to some studies, fraud involving duplicate payments from the unemployment insurance system accounts for about 0.2 per cent of the amounts paid out, or SEK 65–80 million per year.</p>
<p>But increased information exchange would not only help to prevent duplicate payments. Payment errors may also be caused by errors in the processing of applications due to the fact that the data exchanged in various systems are not comparable or that individuals inadvertently submit inaccurate information. Payment errors may also be due to a change of a person’s circumstances in a system where no benefits are paid. For example, an applicant may start studying while receiving unemployment benefit, although this means that he/she is no longer eligible for the benefit. Errors may also occur where the particulars submitted are not continuously updated. This does not necessarily mean that the applicant obtains benefit payments by fraudulent means; it may simply be due to forgetfulness, careless, laziness or ignorance.</p>
<p>In systems where millions of decisions are taken and which pay out about SEK 300 billion every year, preventing even a very small percentage of inappropriate payments would save substantial sums of money.</p>
<p>Fraud is obviously unacceptable to those who are eligible for benefits and to the general public. It is essential for maintenance of public respect for the systems and public morale in general that benefits are only paid to those who are entitled to them. It is therefore important to increase the possibility of making checks and to minimize the scope for both deliberate and unintentional exploitation of the system. Indeed, widespread fraud could in the long run undermine the financing of social security systems.</p>
<p>Increased information exchange is essential as a means of preventing the types of payment errors mentioned above. Unemployment benefit is a case in point.</p>
<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>Privacy – not an absolute right</p>
<p>Increased information exchange may cause problems from the point of view of privacy, and this is the case especially in connection with the exercise of authority. The fact that the agencies process large amounts of information that are stored in such a way as to be easily retrievable by electronic means exposes the individual to the risk of unacceptable infringements of privacy. However, privacy is not an absolute right. As in other legislation, privacy must be balanced against other interests.</p>
<p>Ongoing information exchanges be must taken into account</p>
<p>The main objective in this connection is to find ways and means for unemployment benefit offices to gain access to an information system similar to that which already exists between the agencies and between the agencies and the social insurance offices. Extending the scope of the present information exchanges to include unemployment benefit offices would not, in our view, represent an unacceptable infringement of privacy.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of explicit statutory provisions in this field, information is already transmitted electronically by county labour boards and sometimes by the National Board of Student Aid to unemployment benefit offices. Moreover, these offices themselves transmit large amounts of information by electronic means, in particular to social insurance offices and the National Social Insurance Board, but also to the National Board of Student Aid. There is no legislation concerning such transmissions of information, and they are made by the offices on a voluntary basis. The offices’ disclosure of information is not subject to the customary review of privacy and secrecy aspects. Legislation in this field would enhance the protection of privacy.</p>
<p>The rules concerning benefits provide for the cross-referencing</p>
<p>The need of information exchange between the systems covered by the inquiry is a consequence of the regulatory framework relating to the benefits concerned. In our view, administrative procedures that are a necessary consequence of the way benefit systems are designed do not represent an unacceptable infringement of privacy.</p>
<p>Information exchanges involve a limited number of data in individual cases</p>
<p>The kind of information exchange with which we are concerned here involves a limited number of data in each individual case. Exchanges relate primarily to the submission of applications for benefits, the granting of specified benefit payments and data on the amounts paid out. Data that are more sensitive from the point of view of privacy, for example the health status of the applicant, the reason why a person is unemployed or has decided to take up studies, must not be disclosed.</p>
<p>According to our proposals, only data specified in statutory provisions could be legally transmitted despite their confidential nature. Other information could only be transmitted following a review procedure under the Secrecy Act.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>There are weighty reasons for increasing information exchange. There is great scope for improving the efficiency of the systems investigated by this inquiry by increasing information exchange. This would improve the service provided to individuals, strengthen the control of government funds and prevent inappropriate payments. We have attached great importance to these important public interests in striking a balance between these interests and privacy.</p>
<p>In our view, a regulatory framework must be established for the transmission of information. This would also represent an improvement from the point of view of privacy. The individual concerned must be informed of the nature of information before a decision is taken to disclose it. Electronic information exchange might indeed be preferable to manual information exchange since all the data involved would be pre-programmed data. Since the data subject would be informed in advance, he/she would know exactly what data were being transmitted from one authority to another.</p>
<p>Increased information exchange can in our opinion be reconciled with the need of protection against unacceptable infringements of privacy.</p>
<h2>Necessary legislative amendments</h2>
<p>Extending the scope of electronic information exchange would require extensive legislative amendments in various fields. To start with, confidentiality must be guaranteed with respect to the unemployment benefit offices’ administration of the unemployment insurance system. Provisions concerning the obligation to supply information must also be adopted, the transmission of information must be consistent with the requirements of the Personal Data Act, and, lastly, legislation on direct access will also be necessary.</p>
<h2>Public access to documents and confidentiality in the unemployment insurance system</h2>
<p>Steps must be taken to ensure that information is only disclosed by social insurance offices, the National Social Insurance Board, the National Board of Student Aid and county labour boards to unemployment benefit offices subject to a guarantee that it will be treated confidentially.</p>
<p>We propose that this be achieved by making the rules concerning public access to documents and confidentiality applicable to administration of unemployment benefit. More than 90 per cent of the unemployment insurance system is financed out of government funds and administration of this benefit represents exercise of authority. Adopting the proposed rules would ensure public access to information while retaining the present organization, i.e. the unemployment benefit offices would continue to administer unemployment benefit independently of the Government.</p>
<p>In legislative terms, the rules concerning public access to documents and confidentiality would be made applicable to administration of unemployment benefit by including the unemployment benefit offices in an annex to the Secrecy Act. The bodies mentioned in the annex would be deemed to have the status of public authorities for the purposes of application of the Secrecy Act.</p>
<p>Data relating to membership of an unemployment insurance fund are not subject to the rules concerning public access to documents and confidentiality.</p>
<p>The need of confidentiality as regards data relating to unemployment benefit would be met by our proposal that the data concerning individuals’ personal and financial circumstances in applications for unemployment benefit should be treated confidentially. A necessary condition for the confidentiality of information should be the risk of damage, which would mean that in most cases information would be public. Information would only be treated confidentially where there was a possibility that disclosure of the information would be detrimental to the person concerned.</p>
<p>Data relating to applications for unemployment benefit should always be public.</p>
<h2>The obligation to supply information</h2>
<p>We propose that information exchange between social insurance offices, the National Social Insurance Board, the National Board of Student Aid and county labour boards, on the one hand, and unemployment benefit offices on the other should be based on explicit provisions concerning the obligation to supply information in the Unemployment Insurance Act. These provisions should lay down that information must be disclosed even if it is to be treated confidentially.</p>
<p>The information that must be disclosed would be defined in an Ordinance. Such information would consist, inter alia, of the individual’s name, information concerning the submission of an application for benefit, the granting of the benefit, the amount involved and the period of eligibility for the benefit.</p>
<p>The information requirement that we propose would mean that the present transmission of information would be governed by law. Our proposals would also increase information exchange since social insurance offices, the National Social Insurance Board and the National Board of Student Aid would be required to transmit information to unemployment benefit offices despite the provisions concerning confidentiality. The ongoing transmission of information between the systems concerned is basically restricted to supplying the data needed to take decisions on eligibility for a certain benefit or allowance. Our proposals would also permit exchanges of information for the purpose of carrying out checks designed to prevent duplicate or inappropriate payments.</p>
<h2>Treatment of personal data</h2>
<p>At present, special legislation is applicable to the treatment of personal data by county labour boards and by social insurance offices and the National Social Insurance Board. We propose the introduction of provisions in this legislation defining the purpose for which the data are to be used when transmitted to the other bodies concerned as a basis for decisions on and checks of benefits and allowances.</p>
<p>The current legislation should be reviewed for the purpose of adapting it to the requirements of the Personal Data Act.</p>
<p>As regards the treatment of personal data by the National Board of Student Aid and unemployment benefit offices, the rules applying to these bodies will expire on October 1 2001, from which date the Personal Data Act will apply to them too. The treatment of personal data by the National Board of Student Aid and unemployment benefit offices should, in our view, be adapted to the Personal Data Act by that date.</p>
<p>Modifications to meet the requirements of the Personal Data Act are necessary in order to increase information exchange.</p>
<h2>Direct access to computerized records</h2>
<p>The meaning of direct access</p>
<p>Direct access means that the user himself can search a file without being able to change its content. Traditionally, this has permitted access to all the data in a file. In recent years new technologies have been developed that allow direct access to specific sets of data. This means that a person who is entitled to see the data in a file is only given access to the set of data specified for that particular individual. This is the kind of direct access proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p>Need of direct access</p>
<p>Direct access allows the official dealing with an application to obtain information in a simple and rational manner from another system and</p>
<p>can help to make workflow management more efficient than it is with the present computerized transmission system. It would also improve service to the individual since correct decision could be taken quickly and claims for repayments and additional payments could be avoided. Direct access could also help to prevent duplicate and inappropriate payments, which is scarcely possible today. It would make it possible to obtain updated information from another system before a benefit is paid out. Such continuous checks are not feasible with the current system of computerized transmissions and, with a few exceptions, they do not occur between the systems concerned.</p>
<p>The discloser’s control over data</p>
<p>Direct access has been considered particularly sensitive from the point of view of privacy since the discloser has no control over the data that are disclosed in individual cases. However, comparisons between the computerized data transmissions that are currently made show that it is impossible, except in theory, to control the data that are transferred to the recipient in an individual case. Information exchange between the systems concerned is and should be based on detailed rules concerning the obligation to supply information. A decision must be taken on what data the discloser is required to give the recipient. Such a decision is taken, irrespective of whether the data are to be made available by direct access or by the type of electronic transmission currently used for information exchanges, in connection with the setting up of an electronic procedure for the transmission of information. The fact that the discloser has no control over the information that is disclosed in individual cases has not been considered an obstacle to disclosing data by electronic means other than by direct access. Consequently it cannot be considered an obstacle to disclosing data via direct access.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>Since direct access to data would promote more efficient workflow management, improve the service offered to the individual and improve payment control, and since there are no weighty arguments against direct access, we propose that the data involved in the information exchanges concerned should be disclosed via direct access.</p>
