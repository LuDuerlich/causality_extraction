<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Research, innovation and economic growth (Chapter 1)</h2>
<p>Research and innovation in firms have had a decisive significance for societal development throughout history. Research and development (R&D) and other forms of intangible capital that are important for producing innovations, are also significant for longterm economic growth. Sweden devotes relatively large resources to R&D, in particular in the corporate sector, and firms seem in general to have good conditions for R&D. To enable Sweden to retain its position as one of the leading research and innovation nations and thus be able to utilise the benefits of this in the form of higher economic growth and higher living standards, there must be a constant stream of resources and effort on many levels. In other words, Sweden’s capacity to continuously generate innovation is central to maintaining living standards. At the same time increased investments in R&D and innovation mean that resources, which have an alternative use in the form of production or other investments, are appropriated. Consequently, investments in R&D and innovation do not generate growth per se  but assume that the return on the investments, for example in the form of better products or more efficient production processes, will be greater than on the alternative uses of the resources that the firms – and for that matter society as a whole – appropriate.</p>
<p>Countries that are more R&D intensive have had higher productivity growth in the period 1995-2010. But this does not mean that the relation between productivity growth and R&D expenditures is causal. Nor is R&D the only factor that explains why some countries show higher growth in multifactor productivity. Sweden shows productivity growth approximately in parity with expectations, given the R&D intensity. Sweden has had comparatively rapid growth in productivity since the middle of the 1990s. What marks out Swedish productivity growth is that it, to a greater extent than in other OECD countries, is driven by total factor productivity rather than by the labour force continually having access to more capital (known as capital deepening).</p>
<p>In several OECD countries the productivity growth trend has slowed in the last ten-year period compared with the immediately preceding ten-year period. This observation has given rise to an international debate on the conditions for long-term productivity growth in economically advanced countries. The debate is largely, but not exclusively, concerned with how significant innovations and new technology will be in the coming decades. The weakening productivity growth trend could be an indication that the most ground-breaking innovations have quite simply come to an end, that the economically developed part of the world has reached “peak innovation”. Despite the fact that the debate is supported by constantly improving data and more research, it is difficult to give any definitive “verdict” on the contribution of innovation to future economic growth. It can, however, be noted that historically new technology breakthroughs have often been preceded by a period of weak productivity growth. In addition resource utilisation in many OECD countries is still low as a result of recent years’ financial and debt crises, which makes it difficult to determine how much of the weak productivity growth that is cyclical.</p>
<p>Countries with good prospects of allocating resources to innovative environments, perhaps particularly to firms, and where these environments function well, are also in a better position to achieve high productivity growth in the long term. How Sweden’s innovative capacity  compares with other countries’ is therefore a central issue for economic policy. However, innovations can be produced by either spending more on innovations or by using existing resources more effectively. In this report to the Long Term Survey innovative capacity  is used to capture – and measure – the resources that a society makes available in order to generate new innovations. Central in this context are the R&D resources that companies can have at their disposal and use in the production of new ideas and new technology. The term innovation efficiency  expresses instead how efficient countries are when it comes to transforming a given amount of resources to innovation outputs.</p>
<p>Innovation efficiency is closely associated with factors that create incentives to use R&D resources effectively. Examples of such factors are conditions of competition in the market or protection of intellectual property rights. Even if these factors in many cases may fall outside of the firms’ direct control, they influence firms’ internal organisation of innovation activities. In both the economic policy debate and economic research on innovation climate, there is seldom any differentiation between capacity and effectiveness, which may lead to incorrect conclusions being drawn about the measures that best promote increased innovative capacity.</p>
<h2>Business sector R&D investments (Chapter 2)</h2>
<p>The corporate sector – the business sector – accounts for about 70 per cent of total expenditure on research and development in Sweden. Different industries vary in the intensity of their R&D use and it is therefore important to take industry structure into consideration when comparing R&D intensity between countries. A number of conclusions can be drawn on the basis of available statistics on both development of the Swedish business sector’s R&D expenditure over time, and how Swedish firms’ R&D expenditures compares with other OECD countries’:  The Swedish business sector is one of the most R&D intensive in the OECD. R&D intensity has gradually increased since the beginning of the 1980s. In the 2000s Swedish firms continued to increase their R&D intensity, but at a slower rate than in the 1990s. Since the end of the 1990s and until 2012, R&D intensity in the Swedish business sector has even decreased slightly.  More than half of all R&D in the business sector can be found in the following industries: “Computers, electronic and optical products”, “Trucks, other heavy motor vehicles and other transport equipment” and “Basic pharmaceutical products, pharmaceutical preparations”. These industries are also the most research intensive.  Sweden distinguishes itself by having comparatively high R&D intensity in the private service sector. This may be an indication that the upgrading of, and specialisation in, research intensive services has gone further in Sweden than in comparable countries. Another explanation may be that hiving off and outsourcing of services has taken place to a greater extent (or earlier) in Sweden.  High tech industries have the highest R&D intensity in all OECD countries. However, in Sweden the significance of high tech industries is less than in Finland, the USA and the UK.  Specialisation into a number of R&D intensive industries is not unique to Sweden but a general pattern. The most R&D intensive industries may, however, vary from country to country. Countries with a high degree of specialisation (as regards industries) also generally have higher R&D intensity.  Sweden has a positive “R&D gap” in relation to comparable countries. This gap derives from the Swedish business sector being specialised towards industries with high R&D intensity, but above all the high overall Swedish R&D intensity.  In Sweden, as in many other countries with an R&D intensive business sector, large companies account for the majority of all R&D in the business sector. Differences in corporate structure play a part in explaining differences in R&D intensity (the R&D gap) between countries. The fact that a smaller number of large firms account for the lion’s share of the business sector's (and the country's) R&D and on to three firms may account for almost all R&D at industry level makes it tricky to compare countries on the basis of aggregate measures. An  all-round description both of how R&D investments develop and how they are affected by various measures should therefore also look at the firm level (micro data) or even at individual company groups.  There is a negative correlation between R&D intensity and company size. The positive R&D gap in the USA relative to the EU does not seem to depend solely on the USA being more specialised towards industries with higher R&D intensity, but also on the country having a (somewhat) more even distribution of R&D intensity as regards company size than the EU. Above all the USA has been successful in producing  mid-size R&D intensive companies in fast-growing industries.</p>
<h2>Specialisation, trade and internationalisation of R&D (Chapter 3)</h2>
<p>Sweden’s standard of living has long been dependent on trade and other external economic relations. These relations have made possible a more effective resource use, while facilitating the utilisation of ideas and new technology. In that way it has been possible to raise productivity, generating higher real wages and higher employment levels, though not necessarily in exactly the industries that have met increased international competition.</p>
<p>Despite a substantial volume increase in world trade and the relative free movement across national borders, mainly of financial capital, but also to an increasing extent of labour, the production of new technology seems to be relatively deeply rooted in the multinational enterprises’ countries of origin. However, even if firms’ R&D investments are slow-moving across borders, significant changes in multinational enterprises’ localisation of R&D have taken place. In the long term this will probably influence conditions of production and employment and thus living standards. Firms’ R&D also became less geographically concentrated in the early 2000s, which is an indication that firms’ R&D investments have become more globalised.</p>
<p>Access to R&D capital and a skilled labour force has become an increasingly important factor in explaining international specialisation and trading patterns. There is also increasing trade in R&D services, either directly through service exports from R&D service firms, but also indirectly through intra-group payments (between countries) for R&D performed in one country but used in production abroad. Another important driving factor behind the increasing globalisation of R&D is that more countries are integrated in the world economy, thus becoming interesting as research nations. A local R&D presence in these new markets is increasingly important for adapting products to local requirements and preferences. As international ownership of companies has increased, a greater proportion of R&D falls under foreign control.</p>
<p>It is difficult, using existing data, to satisfactorily describe all the driving forces and effects associated with this form of internationalisation. The factors that firms take into consideration when deciding where to locate their production and their R&D are in many cases complex and vary not only from industry to industry, but probably also from firm to firm. Despite limited possibilities of identifying these often complex correlations, a few conclusions emerge:  There is a positive correlation between R&D intensity and measures of the Swedish business sector’s comparative advantages in a number of industries. Overall, Sweden does not show comparative advantages in high tech exports. R&D intensity affects the focus of Swedish goods exports, but R&D intensity is far from the only factor of significance in explaining the international specialisation of the business sector.  Swedish service exports have increased substantially in the 2000s. This is in some part due to an increase in exports of R&D services, but growth has also taken place as a consequence of an increase in remuneration to Swedish headquarters for R&D used in production abroad. R&D intensity is significant for the international competitiveness of the service sector. In addition Sweden receives considerable revenues from exporting patents, licenses, royalties etc. and reports a positive technological trade balance.  Firms’ R&D investments have become more mobile across national borders. Despite more and larger countries, such as China and India, having been integrated into the world economy and become significant R&D countries, the majority of firms' R&D investments are still made in  high-income countries.  Economies of scale (market potential), access to skilled labour and the scope and quality of a country's innovation systems seem to be the most important factors behind the localisation decisions of multinational enterprises. Relative cost differences have a minor impact, but the design of the tax system and the existence of targeted subsidies affect the R&D firms’ localisation decisions.  As a consequence of falling trading and coordination costs multinational enterprises have greater opportunities to separate production and R&D geographically and locate different parts of the value chain where conditions are the best. However, there is no  clear-cut evidence that production and R&D are separated in all industries or that separation is becoming increasingly common. Rather there are some indications that production and R&D are being localised together to a greater extent. The degree of co-location of production and R&D seems to vary relatively sharply between different industries.  Relocation of R&D seems to be a complement to, rather than a substitute for, domestic R&D. Relocation of R&D can increase demand for R&D services in the home country as firms expand abroad. Domestic R&D may also derive benefit from R&D conducted in other countries, either by the firm itself or through good research environments in the host countries.  China’s importance as a host country for large, Swedish groups’ R&D has increased considerably. In the 2000s Asia has overtaken North America as the next most important (after Europe) recipient region for large Swedish international groups’ R&D.  Foreign firms’ establishment of R&D brings several potentially positive effects for R&D in the host country. Domestic firms can be stimulated to increase their R&D to remain competitive, they can gain access to greater financial resources for R&D activities, and structural transformation towards an expansion of high tech industries can be speeded up.  Cross-border mergers and acquisitions, if anything, seem to be positive for R&D in the (domestic) acquired companies. The fears that the domestic research base would be undermined as a result of increased foreign control seem to be exaggerated or at least not founded on solid empirical evidence. However, there are few systematic studies, in particular of the long-term effects, of foreign mergers and acquisitions on the domestic R&D base.</p>
<h2>Sweden’s innovative capacity in an international perspective (Chapter 4)</h2>
<p>It is difficult to give a clear-cut picture of Sweden’s innovative capacity, not least since it is difficult to measure satisfactorily the output of innovation activities. Patents are often used as a measurement in studies of the output of the innovation process, but for several reasons this is only a rough measure and is more suitable for studies of innovations in manufacturing than in the fast-growing service and consumer goods industries. Besides patents other, more appropriate measures of innovations have been developed, such as the share of new products in total turnover. One problem in using these measurements is partly that only short time series exist, and partly that they seem to have a weak covariance with common macroeconomic measures of innovations (such as R&D intensity). Despite the problems some conclusions can nevertheless be drawn:  Sweden has a high level of innovation capacity according to available measurements and indicators.  Firms’ total R&D expenditure has a positive impact on innovation capacity, measured as patent rate, even taking into account the existing patent stock, both in the home country and abroad. The econometric estimates made in this report show that the foreign patent stock is particularly important for generating (domestic) innovations. In addition, densely populated countries, all else equal, seem to be more inclined towards patents than more sparsely populated countries. This result may indicate that access to a large domestic market benefits innovative capacity. However, the results should be interpreted with caution.  In terms of the “raw” relation between input factors, above all R&D expenditure, Sweden seems to generate few innovations (in terms of patents) relative to many other, comparable countries. However, it is worth pointing out that Sweden’s relatively high R&D expenditure also fulfils the function of being able to assimilate and use innovations generated in other countries. More sophisticated statistical analyses of the correlations between R&D initiatives and results in the form of patents indicate that Sweden is a country with high innovation efficiency close to or at the technology frontier.  Studies show that innovation efficiency is affected by the design of both national innovation systems and framework conditions. This means that it is possible to support a more effective innovation process using political measures.</p>
<h2>Effects of direct measures to stimulate R&D and innovation (Chapter 5)</h2>
<p>The market for innovations is not perfect in a number of aspects. The public nature of knowledge and the existence of spillover effects (or externalities) drive a “wedge” between the microeconomic and macro-economic return on investment in R&D to develop new methods and new technology. This wedge is assumed to lead to an unregulated market underinvesting in R&D compared with the economic optimal; which gives an argument for public intervention in the market for R&D and innovation.</p>
<p>The public sector has played an important role in research and innovation in firms for a long time. Public commitment varies between different countries both regarding scope and choice of initiatives. However, over time most OECD countries have decided to invest an increasing amount of public resources on R&D in relation to the size of the economy. Compared with other OECD countries, public sector agencies in Sweden invest large resources in R&D in relation to the size of the economy (GDP).</p>
<p>Market failures are in practice difficult to identify and differ between markets and industries, but above all between different types of research. Nor is the existence of market failures a sufficient  condition for public intervention, particularly not when it comes to R&D and innovation activities in profit-making companies. Public intervention may also lead to resources being used inefficiently and, in the worst case, lead to a worse outcome than would otherwise have been the case without the intervention.</p>
<p>Extensive fiscal incentives , above all in the form of tax incentives, and high R&D intensity, exist in South Korea, the USA and, to a lesser extent, in Japan. Sweden, together with Denmark, Finland, Israel, Switzerland and to some extent Germany, have relatively limited fiscal incentives, but nevertheless report high R&D intensity. This indicates that the causality between fiscal incentives and R&D intensity may go the other way: extensive fiscal incentives may be an indication of deficiencies in other parts of the innovation system or of weak framework conditions that make return on R&D lower. This may mean that the governments in these countries instead decide to compensate for the weak framework conditions by offering generous subsidies and/or tax incentives.</p>
<p>The fiscal incentives seem overall to give the desired effect in the form of increased R&D expenditure in firms (called resource additionality) and, though to a lesser extent, higher innovation intensity (called output additionality). The effects of direct research support varies between different types of firm or research focus respectively; support to basic research (in firms) seems to bring higher macroeconomic return than support to more applied research, since spillover effects of the former type are greater. Several studies show, however, that cost effectiveness of fiscal measures is in many cases low. To achieve any significant increase – so that the effects are visible in macro data – in firms’ R&D or innovations requires fairly extensive reductions in income or increases in expenditure. These must then be weighed against other important objectives that require public financing.</p>
<p>The role of education and research institutions , not least universities, for innovations in firms seems to have increased over time. Of European firms, Swedish, together with Danish and Finnish, firms are those that consider that universities and research institutions have contributed the most to their innovations. Publicly financed and performed academic research should in most cases probably stimulate R&D and innovation in firms. Academic research constitutes a kind of infrastructure – similar to traditional infrastructure such as roads, railways etc. – that firms cannot alone derive profit from since it is difficult to obtain payment for the services generated by the research. Nonetheless, publicly financed academic research can contribute to increasing competition for scarce resources, which, via price and wage formation effects, crowd out private research. However, it is probable that the net effect is positive, given that publicly conducted research is of good quality.</p>
<p>Most firms are driven to concentrate their activities close to similar firms or firms that supply important input goods and services. The results of studies that try to estimate spillover effects between universities and firms  indicate that firms’ R&D benefits from being localised near a university that conducts advanced research. The effects are greater in high tech industries such as pharmaceuticals. Economic research on agglomeration and cluster formation assigns political measures a significant role in “accompanying” market forces and creating conditions for localising economic activity, including innovations. The same research also emphasises that what distinguishes the clusters that exist is that they constitute a complicated, economic ecosystem that is difficult to duplicate. Since the geographic proximity to the research laboratories of the universities is of importance for the emergence of spillover effects, the access to infrastructure, land and premises in direct proximity to research centres may be an important factor to take into consideration for decision-makers who wish to facilitate cooperation between universities and firms.</p>
<p>In general it is more common for large firms to participate in cooperation with public research institutions than for small and medium-sized firms to do so. Among the OECD countries it is by far the most common for firms in Finland to collaborate with public research institutions. Sweden is among the OECD countries with the highest percentage of firms participating in R&D cooperation with public institutions, in particular among the larger firms. The methodology problems involved in evaluating the effects of participation in research cooperation between public research institutions and firms are considerable. The (few) evaluations that exist support the idea that research cooperation may act as a lever to increase firms’ innovations and spread them through citations. The effects of cooperation seem to be greater for the firms that are already innovative, have previous experience of cooperation, are part of research networks with other firms etc. It becomes a challenge for the authorities responsible to balance the fact that the programmes probably give the greatest return – in terms of innovative activities – if they target those who are already successful, against the obvious risk that cooperation will be with firms that would have managed relatively well without the support.</p>
<p>There is a statistically significant, positive correlation between individuals’ education levels  and their innovation, but the causality of the correlation is not obvious. The educational level in Sweden has risen considerably in recent decades. The percentage with only compulsory education has fallen, and the percentage with some form of university education has more than doubled and is now over 40 per cent. In an international perspective there are relatively many people in Sweden with a theoretical education at a higher level, but it is rather unusual to have short vocational preparatory programmes. Several emerging economies, including China and India, have drawn attention to education in natural sciences and technology (NT) as effective methods of promoting (future) growth. At the same time the proportion  of students graduating in NT subjects has fallen in many countries over time, which also is the case in China.</p>
<p>To ensure innovative firms' access to skilled labour, but also to stimulate innovations more directly  it is of the greatest importance that higher education maintains high quality and meets the labour demand of firms.</p>
<h2>Effects of indirect measures to stimulate R&D and innovation (Chapter 6)</h2>
<p>A country’s innovative capacity is also determined by (indirect) framework conditions. To a great extent the framework conditions that affect firms’ R&D and innovation are the same as affect their investments, partnerships and internal organisation. The framework conditions primarily refer to the supply side  of the economy; that is the conditions that affect the extent to which real capital, intangible capital (including human capital), financial capital and other production factors are made available to firms. But framework conditions can also affect the demand  for innovations. The significance of different framework conditions changes depending on a country's economic development level. Indirect and direct measures interact. A country with wellfunctioning framework conditions for R&D and innovation perhaps does not need to use direct measures, such as direct R&D support and tax relief, to stimulate R&D investments. Favourable framework conditions can also facilitate commercialisation of research results obtained by public research institutions.</p>
<p>There is broad consensus on the importance of some form of minimum level for protection of intellectual property rights , but both theoretical and empirical research is divided on how extensive this protection should be. In addition there are other ways than patents to protect innovations, such as secrecy, short lead times to market introduction, a shorter time to the next innovation etc.</p>
<p>Protection of intellectual property rights can de facto facilitate the spread of ideas, since the alternative is to keep the innovations secret as long as possible. Nevertheless, with protection of intellectual property rights, other firms and individuals get access to new knowledge, even if there are restrictions on how they can use this knowledge for their own gain. It is important to make a distinction between the length  of the patent (how long it is valid) and its breadth  (how comprehensive the patent is, i.e. how many aspects of the innovation the patent protects). The conclusions concerning the optimal patent breadth and length vary according to assumptions on costs, establishment barriers and consumer preferences. Decision-makers must find the delicate balance between favouring both early innovators and subsequent innovators. How the balance between advantages and disadvantages is to be achieved will also depend on a number of other factors that may differ between countries, such as transparency and economic development.</p>
<p>Regulation in the labour and product markets has recently been highlighted as important in explaining innovation activities in firms, industries and countries. The growing empirical literature is, however, in many respects divided as to the effect regulation has on innovation. This is mainly because one regulation can have different effects on different parts of the innovation process, which becomes clear when a differentiation is made between resource inputs (for example expenditure on R&D) and outputs (for example patents). The effects also often depend on how regulation is implemented.</p>
<p>Previous studies find some empirical support for more flexibility in the labour market, for instance in the form of weaker employment protection, giving more innovations. The effect seems to be greater for high tech industries. However, the relation between labour market regulation and innovations could be expected to apply in the short term; regulations that get firms to retain their employees during crises may have a positive impact on innovation and radical breakthroughs in the longer term. Sweden shows a closer relationship between investments in knowledgebased capital and GDP than is motivated by a simple regression between employment protection and the share of knowledge capital. In other words, there are factors other than employment protection that are (more) important. More generally, mobility on the labour market is an important channel for knowledge diffusion and thus generating spillover effects. The empirical literature on effects of researcher mobility on innovations indicates that research results and innovations are spread by researchers changing workplaces. Firms increase their innovative capacity by receiving new researchers.</p>
<p>Product market regulations that make competition and new establishment more difficult are negatively related to productivity growth. The negative effect is greater the further away a country is from the technological frontier, since such regulations can hinder the adoption of new technologies. The relation between product market regulation and innovations is not clear-cut, however, and there is also empirical evidence that the effect of regulation may even be positive in proximity to the technology frontier. Sweden’s relative position as regards regulation of product markets and costs for starting companies varies depending on the index used but Sweden seems to be at about the average mark in the OECD as regards product market regulation.</p>
<p>Economists have long tried to understand the effect of competition rules  on investments in R&D. Some believe that competition is necessary to create incentives for firms to make R&D investments, while others believe that some degree of monopoly is required for innovation to take place. There is also a growing body of research literature that concludes that the relation between competition and R&D is rather reminiscent of an inverted ”U”. The U-formed relation between R&D and competition is assumed among other things to be due to the distance to the technology frontier, where competition has a positive effect on R&D among technologically advanced firms, but a negative effect on R&D among laggards. New research indicates also that the relation between R&D and competition may be due to company size and innovation costs in an industry.</p>
<p>International trade and direct investments stimulate firms’ R&D and innovation through several channels. Trade enables countries’ comparative advantages to be utilised and countries with a sound framework for a highly skilled labour force will probably be specialised in R&D and  high-tech  production. Access to foreign markets also enables firms to spread (fixed) costs associated with innovation over the larger volumes that can be achieved through exports. In that way the expected return on innovation projects increases. Increased import competition can stimulate domestic firms to be more innovative as a way of “getting ahead of” increased competition. Trade and other forms of cross-border economic exchange, not least foreign direct investment, are also important channels for spreading new knowledge and new technology. In the economic policy debate it is often stated that a good innovation climate for firms is important for increasing exports. A number of studies show, however, that increased import competition for input goods from low-wage countries has been important for promoting more innovative companies in countries with higher wage costs. Access to cheaper input goods makes it possible for firms in high cost countries to specialise in products with a higher value added. They are also generally more productive, which makes it even more interesting to set aside resources for innovative activities. Reforms that facilitate trade in input goods can thereby contribute to increasing return on innovations.</p>
<p>A well-functioning and dynamic system of innovation financing  is important for being able to develop future growth industries. Innovation projects are characterised by long waiting times, uncertainty and great risks. This makes it more difficult to finance innovation projects than other projects. The inherent uncertainty associated with the expected return on innovations makes potential financiers hesitant to provide financing at an early stage of the innovation process.</p>
<p>Comparisons between countries show, at an aggregate level, that financing opportunities, for example in terms of getting a bank loan, are relatively good in Sweden. Relative to other EU countries, there are few firms that state that access to (private) financing is a major problem in Sweden; Sweden reports the largest proportion of firms that do not  consider financing to be a problem. Unlike in many other OECD countries, Swedish firms do not seem to have been affected as seriously by the financial crisis as regards renewing bank loans.</p>
<p>Apart from (bank) loans and their own cash flow, risk capital is another existing form of financing. The supply of risk capital differs considerably between countries as regards the amounts of risk capital invested and at what stage (of the development of the product/process towards being ready for market introduction) the investment is made. In Sweden it is less common than in other OECD countries to have innovation financing via “business angels” and even more uncommon via risk capital. When such investments are made, however, the average levels are comparatively high. In Sweden the distribution between financing at an early and later stage is relatively even, but in the USA it is considerably more common to have financing at later stages.</p>
<p>Many OECD countries’ governments try in various ways to intervene in the risk capital market and even actively increase the supply of risk capital through direct or indirect ownership in target companies, for example through state risk capital funds/companies, co-investment funds or “funds of funds”. Central government financing, above all in the form of grants but also government loans, are common in Sweden (approximately one third of total capital investment in start-up companies consists of central government financing). The proportion of public funds is at a much higher level than for example in American start-up companies. The supply of (risk) capital at early stages is, according to available data, relatively good in Sweden, while central government investments are mainly made at later stages.</p>
<p>However, there are few studies of the effects of public sector risk capital investment in R&D and innovation. As far as Sweden is concerned, there seem to be positive effects of central government seed financing provided that patents have already been commercialised to some extent. However, patents with market oriented government loans given during the commercialisation phase have approximately the same profit outcome and tendency to be renewed as the average of other commercialised patents. Seen in the light partly of risk capital investments satisfying a very limited part of firms' financing needs, partly of the supply of risk capital in Sweden being relatively good, initiatives to increase the supply of public sector risk capital do not seem to be a decisive factor in stimulating firms' innovative capacity.</p>
<p>Public and private risk capital investments can complement  each other if made in the right way. The participation of private actors may function to impose discipline and profitability requirements while the public funds can help to both manage the uncertainty that is the rule for investments at early stages and in innovations that have not yet reached the market. The public co-financing should be sufficient to make a difference, but not too great in relation to the private actors' financing. If the public share of financing is too large, it may reduce the motivation of private financiers to ensure that the investment is made under the best market conditions.</p>
<p>The formulation of general tax policy  affects firms’ return after tax on investments in R&D, and thus affects the amount of knowledge capital and how it is used in production. In general, mobile tax bases, particularly those that are internationally mobile, should be taxed at a lower rate than less mobile tax bases. Intangible capital can be assumed to be internationally mobile, at least in the long term. All else being equal, this indicates that the return on intangible capital should meet a lower tax rate to retain its activities in the country and to maximise public finance revenue.</p>
<p>Multinational enterprises have great opportunities to utilise differences in taxation between countries. By means of tax planning, multinational enterprises located in countries with relatively high taxation can transfer ownership of patents to subsidiaries in countries with lower taxation. An obvious problem in tax planning of investments in intangible capital is that it leads to tax base erosion, i.e. reduction in the tax bases in the firms’ home countries, which means that higher taxes must be levied on other tax bases (for the same level of public income). However, the existence of favourable tax conditions for profits from patents, for example, may also have real economic  effects, i.e. affect the level of investment in intangible assets and where the fruits of this investment come into use. Several countries, including Sweden, take various forms of action to restrict multinational enterprises’ tax planning. It is difficult to estimate with any precision the significance of tax planning opportunities multinational enterprises have for investing in intangible assets and innovations. Since it is more difficult for new, small innovation companies to derive benefit from opportunities for international tax arrangements, in the long term this may inhibit innovation capacity in a country, or at least the opportunities of developing new, radical innovations. Moreover, there is a risk that countries could be thrown into a “race to the bottom” when it comes to trying to stimulate or retain multinational enterprises’ innovations in their own countries. This not only leads to the undermining of tax bases, but also means it is less likely for investments in R&D and other intangible capital, to end up in the locations that have the best fundamental conditions for research and innovation.</p>
<p>The public sector can promote innovations in firms by increasing demand for innovations . It may be a matter quite simply of establishing a market that has not existed before, for example because of high entry barriers or traditions (historical), or making an existing market larger (demand greater volumes). By means of the public sector in various ways guaranteeing demand (at a reasonable price) for the firms’ innovations, uncertainty about innovation projects can be reduced. Moreover, the role of the public sector as a customer can be seen as a stamp of quality by potential investors and financiers, which reduces the credit restrictions that innovation firms may encounter, in particular if they are new and/or small. Another, common reason for the public sector to create demand for innovations, in addition to what the market itself can generate, is to give an industry an advantage over corresponding industries in other countries. The aim is to help increase the domestic industry’s – or even the entire country’s – competitiveness and growth.</p>
<p>Increased demand can be achieved, in principle, through public procurement and through regulation and standards with a specified purpose – though not necessarily as the main purpose – to stimulate the emergence of new technology. Price-based instruments such as price guarantees, differentiated charges, discounts, vouchers or tax credits, targeting consumers or firms to demand a certain technology may also contribute to increased demand for – and thus the emergence of – new products and processes. The use of demand-oriented measures has been fairly marginal to date, in relation to other ways for the public sector to stimulate innovation. An explanation for this is that great requirements are often posed on government agencies in terms of knowledge of industry specific or technology specific circumstances, not least as regards innovation procurement. There are also considerable risks that demand-oriented measures, particularly regulation and technical standards, will be designed in a way that intervenes too much in the function of the economy, for example by obstructing new establishments. This can then lead to a decrease in total production or employment, even if the intervention leads to (further) innovations. Complicated regulation and standards may also lead to markets becoming fragmented and monopolised because it is too expensive, above all for small companies, to comply with the regulations and adapt to standards. To calculate in advance the economic costs and benefits of demand-oriented measures is therefore very difficult. Demandoriented measures may also be associated with deadweight losses, i.e. they create a demand in the market that otherwise would have arisen through households and firms’ preferences in combination with the market economy’s equilibrium creating mechanisms.</p>
<p>Supply of skilled labour  is a prerequisite for innovations to materialise. Higher levels of knowledge not only mean that a country can produce its own innovations, but raise its capacity to assimilate as well as implement and spread others’ ideas. Firms are increasingly seeking highly educated labour outside the country’s borders. The research literature on immigration of highly educated people, and also foreign students, and its effect on innovation activities have been based, with a few exceptions, on data from the USA. Even if the research literature is not entirely clear cut, immigration of foreign students and highly skilled labour has generally proved to be an important input factor in the creation of innovations, and therefore migration policy is also part of innovation policy. Labour from other countries that immigrated to the USA accounts for about a quarter of the labour force in innovative industries, and contributes an equal amount to measurements of innovations (outputs), such as patents granted. People who have immigrated to Sweden do not seem to be equally inclined to devote themselves to innovative activities measured in terms of the patent rate. The lower inclination to seek patents among immigrants to Sweden may be due to negative selection. Language and the even income spread are factors that make Sweden less attractive to foreign labour with leading edge skills, compared to for example the USA and the UK. In addition Sweden has a greater share of asylum seeking immigrants than other developed countries.</p>
<p>The importance of macro-economic  stability  is rarely specified as an important framework condition for firms’ investments in R&D and innovation. The financial crisis and the subsequent protracted recession have, however, raised fears that production capacity in the worst affected countries could have been damaged for a long time or even permanently (through a permanently lower GDP growth rate ). A protracted recession can mean that the R&D stock – and ultimately the stock of innovations – grows more slowly for a period, which has a negative impact on growth, not only in countries worst hit by a crisis but also in other countries via reduced spillover effects. The financial crisis has probably affected innovations negatively in several OECD countries, but the negative effect of the crisis was different in severity in different countries and industries. Emerging economies in Asia, including South Korea, managed the financial crisis relatively well. High tech, innovative firms also managed the crisis better than other company categories. Countries also differ with regard to how they acted in response to the potential effects of the crisis on innovative capacity. Some countries have invested in an infrastructure that promotes innovation (for example broadband) and introduced targeted, financial support for innovations. Countries whose innovation systems are characterised by ample access both to skilled labour and credit and risk capital seem to have been able to reduce the negative effects of the financial crisis considerably.</p>
<p>There is much to indicate that a stability focused macroeconomic policy should also take into account the long-term effects of recessions. However, there are researchers who believe that periods of weak growth, or even economic crises, are more or less a prerequisite  for enabling new technology development. Crises provide scope for the process of “creative destruction” that is the core of the Schumpeterian view of economic function. Firms with products that are not viable are forced to leave the market or be taken over by new firms that see their chance to become established or to take new market share. Periods of low growth become, in this perspective, good soil in which companies let their innovation seeds grow. An examination of studies of how firms’ R&D expenditure co-varies with the economic cycle shows, however, that expenditure is procyclical , that is, it increases in economic upswings and vice versa. In other words economic crises are more of a bad thing for innovations in firms than the other way around. This does not, however, mean that it is not desirable to have a high degree of creative destruction – not taking into account the distribution effects of this transformation – when the economy is in cyclical balance.</p>
<h2>Economic policy for strengthened innovative capacity (Chapter 7)</h2>
<p>Correctly formulated, firms’ incentives to invest in R&D and innovation – and thus innovation capacity – can be influenced by economic policy measures. It also seems probable that countries’ international patterns of specialisation, albeit in the long term, can be geared towards more human capital and R&D intensive production. The effects of both political decisions and decisions taken by the firms themselves last in many cases for long periods of time. Thus Sweden’s relatively good innovative capacity is a result of historic decisions. Correspondingly, the foundations for future innovative capacity are laid through today’s decisions.</p>
<p>Sweden’s prominent role in the area of innovation builds both on high R&D investment and other resources that promote innovation (i.e. high innovative capacity) and a relatively effective use of these resources (i.e. high innovation efficiency). The Swedish leading position as regards innovation is intimately connected to the development of a competitive business sector and, above all, a strong industrial base. The significance of large, Swedish multinational enterprises for this development cannot be enough emphasised. To be able to retain, or even strengthen, sound innovative capacity firms must continue to enjoy good conditions for investment in R&D and innovation.</p>
<p>An economic policy for strengthened innovative capacity should be adapted to the fact that already at the outset Sweden has good innovative capacity and can be assumed to lie close to the global technological frontier. This circumstance implies a focus on policy measures that are “innovation promoting” rather than “imitation promoting”. It means that it will be relatively more important to have institutions and measures that support a dynamic business sector where new technology and new products can rapidly and at low cost be allowed to replace existing technology and products. Institutions and measures that are innovation promoting include a high degree of external transparency and low entry barriers. Moreover it will be relatively more important to promote academic leading edge education rather than broad education. Since there are differences between industries, with regard to both innovative capacity and innovative efficiency, there may be industries that rather have a need to assimilate research results and innovations from other countries. This means that broad education will continue to be important even for countries that show a high innovative capacity at the outset. In the same way the effects of policies that promote increased competition and lowers entry barriers can affect different industries in different ways, depending on how close to the technology frontier they are.</p>
<p>It is not possible on the basis of economic research to issue a clear “prescription” for how an optimal economic policy for innovation should be formulated. Even if economic research has come to devote itself increasingly to better understanding firms’ R&D investments and innovation, not least thanks to better access to large and rich datasets of firm behaviour, it is still difficult to draw clear-cut policy conclusions from research. In addition, innovations are, in some contrast with the linear perspective that economic research and this report also adopts, often the result of experimentation, failures and “mutations” between different ideas, products and concepts. In particular this evolutionary perspective applies to new, radical innovations; that is, innovations that give rise to fundamental changes in activities and behaviours in an organisation or industry. Therefore, a characteristic of innovative activities is high risk. A too exaggerated belief that political measures can create innovations that give a direct – and rapid – return in the form of higher productivity and employment risks leading policy in the wrong direction. Neither historical success nor previous rapid growth are good indicators of future innovation. Policy must address what is sometimes called the “innovator’s dilemma”: the firms that fail do not so much do so due to bad decisions but due to management making the same  decision that once made the firm great. A policy that tries to support established, successful firms risks preserving the old while missing out on the new.</p>
<p>Despite difficulties in deriving clear policy conclusions from the economic research on what drives firms to invest in R&D and become innovative, there are a number of insights that should guide the formulation of economic policy measures:  R&D intensity in the business sector is higher in Sweden than in most other OECD countries , which is mainly due to higher R&D intensity overall, rather than industry composition. This also indicates that Sweden has managed to upgrade production to a more  knowledge-intensive  content to a greater extent than many other, economically developed countries.  R&D intensity in the private service sector is considerably higher than in comparable countries . This indicates a possibility that further measures to strengthen conditions for innovation in the service sector may be warranted.  Access to a skilled labour force in Sweden is still good, but worse learning outcomes and increasing international competition for labour constitute factors for concern . International competition for skilled labour may be expected to increase, which makes it even more urgent to take a coherent approach to education, migration and research and innovation policies.  Publicly performed R&D, in particular at universities, is important for firms’ R&D and innovations . The collaboration between firms and public research institutions should therefore be strengthened.  Fiscal R&D incentives have played, and should play, a limited role in the innovation policy toolbox in Sweden . Considerable effects on innovative capacity of such measures can probably only be achieved at very high costs.  General tax policy should not disadvantage small innovation firms . Large multinational enterprises today have tax advantages that can disadvantage the production of new, radical innovations in which new, small firms play a decisive role.  Good framework conditions have probably played a greater role in firms’ R&D investments in Sweden than in other OECD countries.  This supports the idea that policy areas outside research and innovation policy, such as competition policy, general tax policy and trade policy are of central importance for stimulating R&D and innovation in companies. Furthermore, it is important that complementarity between direct measures (i.e. measures associated with research and innovation policy) and indirect measures or framework conditions, is used in the formulation of policy.  International coordination and financing of R&D will probably be more important in future . A central challenge, when R&D to an increasing extent “runs off” and becomes an international collective product, is to allow scarce R&D resources to be used in the countries that offer the best environments, so that the return – not just the monetary return – is as high as possible, while there is a reasonable distribution of both costs and benefits.  Swedish innovative capacity probably benefits more through Swedish firms being offered help to meet and cooperate with technology leaders in their home countries  rather than attracting foreign firms’ R&D investments to Sweden. Measures that are too “aggressive” to persuade foreign firms to localise their R&D in Sweden, for example by offering generous tax credits, not only risk being expensive, but also helping to disperse the total innovation stock by localising R&D to places that do not necessarily have the best conditions.  Continued efforts are required to counter tendencies towards lower productivity growth in the future.  The significance of a reduced pace of innovation for the slowing productivity growth in many countries is difficult to quantify. Moreover, it is probable that other factors have, and will have, a dampening effect on the  long-term  productivity growth in the OECD as a whole: an ageing population, high debt levels, climate change and lower educational levels. To achieve high and sustainable productivity growth, despite these expected headwinds, continued efforts are thus required to ensure that the conditions for R&D and innovation are as good as possible. It will be a particular challenge to combine ambitions to maintain good productivity growth with the fact that the service sector is becoming increasingly important.</p>
<p>As is the case for almost all public involvement aimed at influencing the allocation of resources in the economy, decisionmakers at all levels – central government, municipalities and county councils as well as at the EU level – will be faced with a series of difficult considerations, also as regards the formulation of economic policy measures to stimulate R&D and innovation. The considerations concern both the degree of commitment and the design of different measures. The risk of policy failure is overhanging. Such risks are not least due to the processes through which innovations in firms are generated not only being difficult to identify and measure, but also due to them being characterised by a high degree of uncertainty. Some guiding principles for formulating government support for R&D and innovation in firms should be:</p>
<p>The support provided by the government, in one form or another, should be carefully formulated, taking into account that various market failures can take place simultaneously.</p>
<p>Government support should be formulated so that failed projects can be discontinued as fast as possible so that they do not become excessively expensive. At the same time, it is important that the period of support is long enough so that it is meaningful to conduct (effect) evaluations.</p>
<p>It is important to consider the possibilities of offering licensing or otherwise making available the results of the projects that have received government support.</p>
<p>Innovation policy support should be formulated as transparently as possible (even if commercial confidentiality etc. must be observed) and be continually evaluated.</p>
<p>Selective support should be formulated in a way that builds on already dynamic markets, but that avoids targeting them towards already established firms.</p>
<p>Decision-makers should strive to primarily support projects with a large “wedge” between micro-economic and macro-economic profitability, rather than projects that can be expected to have the highest return for the whole economy. In some industries and for some technologies the correlation between micro-economic and macro-economic returns is high.</p>
