<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>This interim report discusses that part of our remit which focuses on examining whether there is a need for measures aimed at ensuring strong protection in criminal law against the purchase of sexual services and the purchase of sexual acts from children. In this context, our task has been to:</p>
<p>• evaluate what impact the increase, introduced in 2011, of the maximum penalty for the crime ‘purchase of sexual services’ has had, with the aim of ensuring that the penalty in serious cases of purchases of sexual services fully corresponds to the seriousness of the crime;</p>
<p>• analyse and take a position on whether the purchase of sexual services should be exempted from the dual criminality requirement and, regardless of our position on the substance of the matter, present proposals as to how an exception to the double criminality requirement should be designed; and</p>
<p>• review the scale of penalties for the purchase of sexual acts from children and consider an increase of the minimum penalty with the aim of ensuring a scale of penalties that reflects the seriousness of the crime.</p>
<p>In addition, the inquiry has been tasked with reviewing and evaluating application of the negligence requirement for perpetrators regarding the crime victim’s age in sexual crimes against children (Chapter 6, Section 13, Swedish Penal Code), with the aim of considering the need for legislative amendments, based on the results of our work.</p>
<p>The inquiry’s other tasks – to investigate whether there is a need for measures aimed at ensuring strong protection in criminal law against trafficking in human beings, to review the scales of penalties for trafficking in human beings and procuring, and to review the protection provided in criminal law against exploitation of vulnerable people for activities such as forced labour, begging or for other financial gain – will be presented in a final report from the inquiry.</p>
<h2>Assessments and proposals Purchase of sexual services The crime ‘purchase of sexual services’ will be divided into degrees</h2>
<p>In 2011, stricter penalties for the purchase of sexual services were introduced when the maximum penalty was raised from imprisonment for six months to imprisonment for one year. The purpose of this was to create greater scope for a more nuanced assessment of penal value in serious cases of the purchase of sexual services. According to statistics from the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention (Brå) and the judgments we have obtained, it appears that the assessment of penal value and choice of penalty remains the same, despite the stricter penalties introduced in 2011. It is thus very unusual for the penalty to be set at anything other than a fine. Even if the present scale of penalties has only been in place for a relatively limited period of time, this data indicates that the stricter penalties have not had the intended impact. Consequently, our assessment is that despite the stricter scale of penalties for the purchase of sexual services introduced in 2011, there is a need of further amendments to the penalty provision to ensure a more nuanced assessment of the penal value for the more serious cases of the purchase of sexual services.</p>
<p>We therefore propose that the penalty provision be amended so that the crime ‘purchase of sexual services’ is divided into degrees and that a gross offence is introduced. By amending the provision and explicitly stipulating that account is to be taken of aggravating circumstances, as well as specifying the kind of circumstances referred to, it can be expected that the stricter penalties introduced in 2011 will have the intended impact. An expected consequence of amending the penalty provision is that it will be clearer to both law enforcement authorities and courts that account is to be taken of aggravating circumstances, as well as what kind of circumstances are relevant to consider. Also, there will be greater predictability for the individual perpetrator and, by extension, the normative effect of the prohibition on purchasing sexual services is expected to be strengthened.</p>
<p>Under our proposal, the punishment for the ordinary degree of the crime ‘purchase of sexual services’ will be a fine or imprisonment for at most 6 months. For ‘gross purchase of sexual services’, the punishment will be imprisonment for at most one year. We propose that when assessing whether a purchase of sexual services is to be considered a gross crime, special attention should be given to whether the person who performed the sexual service was in a vulnerable situation or whether the act was otherwise of a ruthless nature. The aim here is to cover situations where someone is the victim of trafficking in human beings or other similar organised crime. We consider that there is no reason to change the outer boundaries of the scale of penalties. The intention is not to influence the levels of penalties across the board.</p>
<h2>An exception to the dual criminality requirement for the purchase of sexual services should not be introduced</h2>
<p>The purchase of sexual services is a crime under Swedish law even when the act is committed outside Swedish territory. A general requirement for a Swedish court to be competent to sentence a person for a crime committed abroad is that the act in question must be a criminal offence in both Sweden and the other country, i.e. dual criminality is required. Exceptions to the dual criminality requirement have previously been made for a large number of sexual crimes against children, including the purchase of sexual acts from children, trafficking in human beings, coercion to marry and certain child pornography offences. Exceptions have also been made for genital mutilation pursuant to Section 3 of the Act Prohibiting the Circumcision of Women (1982:316). These crimes can therefore be prosecuted in Sweden even if the acts are exempt from criminal liability in the country where they were committed. Consequently, the crimes that are excluded from the dual criminality requirement are those considered to be particularly serious, or are of an international and cross-border nature, or where there is international consensus as to which acts are to be punishable.</p>
<p>We consider that an exception to the dual criminality requirement should not be introduced for the purchase of sexual services. The most important reason for this is that at present, there is no international consensus concerning criminalisation of sexual services. Introducing an exception in this regard for the purchase of sexual services would accordingly be contrary to the current principles of when such exceptions can be made.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a number of sexual crimes have already been excluded from the dual criminality requirement. However, one circumstance that these crimes have in common is that a condition for being excluded from the requirement is that they were committed against a person under the age of eighteen. Accordingly, at present there is no exception to the dual criminality requirement for sexual crimes committed against adults. Introducing an exception to the dual criminality requirement for the purchase of sexual services would thus deviate significantly from the existing system used in the Swedish Penal Code. In addition, any legal proceedings concerning the purchase of sexual services abroad would entail a number of difficulties since it can be assumed that the police and prosecutors cannot be expected to receive full assistance from foreign authorities for the investigation of a crime that, in many countries, is not a criminal offence. In this context, it is also important to point out that in practice, it is likely that the rules concerning the requirement of authorisation to prosecute mean that very few proceedings would be commenced for the purchase of sexual services abroad, even if an exception to the dual criminality requirement was introduced.</p>
<h2>Design of a possible exception</h2>
<p>Accordingly, it is the inquiry’s opinion that the purchase of sexual services should not be exempted from the dual criminality requirement. Nevertheless, in line with our terms of reference, we are presenting a legislative proposal on such an exception. With this in mind, we consider that the exception should include both the crime ‘purchase of sexual services’ and our proposed crime of ‘gross purchase of sexual services’. Furthermore, we believe that it should also include attempts to commit a crime in so far as the crime is punishable while still in the attempt stage. Finally, we consider that Swedish courts should be able to impose sanctions considered more severe than the most severe penalty prescribed for the crime under the law in the place where it was committed.</p>
<h2>Purchase of sexual acts from children The crime should be called ‘exploitation of a child through the purchase of a sexual act’ and the penalty should be made more severe</h2>
<p>Protecting children and young people from being drawn into prostitution is of key importance. The extent to which children and young people are exploited in Sweden through the purchase of sexual acts is difficult to assess. In terms of criminal law, this is addressed through criminalisation, where the purchase of sexual acts from those under the age of fifteen is often punishable as rape of a child, with a minimum sentence of imprisonment for at least two years, or as sexual abuse of a child if the sexual act did not involve intercourse or a comparable act. Regarding purchases of sexual acts that target children between the ages of 15 and 17, the crime ‘purchase of a sexual act from a child’ may instead apply.</p>
<p>The crime ‘purchase of a sexual act from a child’ was introduced in 2005 through modernisation of the previous provision on seduction of youth. The scope of application was expanded and the maximum penalty was increased from six months imprisonment to imprisonment for two years. The latter was implemented to emphasise that the purchase of sexual acts from children generally has a higher penal value than corresponding acts that target adults. However, fines were retained in the scale of penalties for the crime.</p>
<p>Our examination of the application of the provision has shown that since its introduction, legal proceedings have only been brought against a small number of people for the crime ‘purchase of a sexual act from a child’. Moreover, it has emerged that those who have been prosecuted for the crime are seldom sentenced to a custodial sentence and that penalties consisting of a fine have been imposed.</p>
<p>Our examination of case-law and information provided by representatives of law enforcement authorities also show that, to a certain extent, legal action is instead brought for the purchase of sexual services, even though the circumstances were such that a more careful investigation on the part of the law enforcement authorities would probably have provided a basis for legal action under the provision ‘purchase of a sexual act from a child’, which would result in a more severe penalty.</p>
<p>Our view is that more measures should be implemented to ensure that the penalty for the purchase of sexual acts from children reflects the seriousness of the crime. We therefore propose that:</p>
<p>• fines are no longer to be included in the scale of penalties;</p>
<p>• the crime is to be divided into degrees to provide greater opportunities to make a more nuanced assessment of the penal value regarding serious cases of the purchase of sexual acts from children;</p>
<p>• when assessing whether the purchase of sexual acts from children is to be considered gross, particular account is to be taken of whether the child was in a vulnerable situation or if the act was otherwise of a ruthless nature;</p>
<p>• the scale of penalties for the purchase of sexual acts of the ordinary degree is to be imprisonment for at most two years;</p>
<p>• the scale of penalties for the purchase of sexual acts from children is to be imprisonment for at least six months and at most four years; and</p>
<p>• the names of the crimes are to be changed to  exploitation of a child through the purchase of a sexual act  and gross exploitation of a child through the purchase of a sexual act  in order to further emphasise the difference between children and adults where the purchase of sexual acts is concerned. Accordingly, purchasing sexual services from a young person should always be considered exploitation of that person and never viewed as a business transaction between two equal partners.</p>
<h2>Negligence requirement for perpetrators regarding the crime victim’s age in sexual crimes against children</h2>
<p>The general rule is that intent is required for someone to be found guilty of a crime under the Swedish Penal Code unless otherwise specifically prescribed (Chapter 1, Section 2, first paragraph of the Swedish Penal Code). Chapter 6 of the Swedish Penal Code contains such an exception regarding sexual crimes. Under Chapter 6, Section 13, a person who did not realise but had reasonable cause to assume that the other person had not reached a certain age is also to be found guilty of a criminal offence.</p>
<p>The provision was introduced in connection with the establishment of the Penal Code. The legislative history of the provision makes clear that the provision is to be applied with great caution and that a fairly high degree of negligence is required for criminal liability to exist.</p>
<p>The provision fulfils an important function in maintaining the protection children have under criminal law from exposure to sexual abuse. This is because an element that is common to the provisions on sexual crimes against children is that the injured party is under a certain age, usually fifteen but in some cases eighteen. That which can be shown about the perpetrator’s awareness of the victim’s age then becomes important, as well as how the legal provisions concerning this are designed.</p>
<p>In our examination of the case-law, we have found that there is no common standard of prudence regarding what is required in relation to the child’s age for a defendant to be found of guilty of a sexual crime against a child. Furthermore, in our examination we noted major variations in courts’ assessments of negligence, which is illustrated by the fact that courts, in many cases, assess similar circumstances in different ways. Examples of such circumstances may include the perpetrator’s age, the perpetrator’s knowledge of which school the injured party attends, that the injured party used his or her year of birth in their email address or profile name, and that the perpetrator did not adequately check the injured party’s age. This risks seriously impairing the protection of children who have been subjected to sexual abuse as well as predictability for the defendants.</p>
<p>Moreover, our examination shows that there is great variation in the courts’ reasoning regarding the injured party’s physical development when determining the perpetrator’s guilt. It can also be noted that the use of assessments of young people’s physical development as the basis of the perpetrator’s awareness or suspicion of a child’s age has its shortcomings, not least from a child protection perspective.</p>
<p>In light of this, we consider that the provision must be changed. In this connection, the inquiry has considered introducing much more stringent requirements on the perpetrator by lowering the standard for criminality by means of negligence, for example by introducing a strict liability requirement or a control obligation laid down in law. However, for reasons pertaining to legal certainty, rquirements of this kind would be too far-reaching. Instead, we propose that a general assessment of negligence be made. Such an assessment should take account of all existing circumstances. Furthermore, it should be made clear that for criminal liability to be considered, it is sufficient for the perpetrator to have been unintentionally negligent. The term ‘unintentional negligence’ involves making an examination of what the perpetrator could have done to obtain the relevant awareness and, thereafter, whether it can be expected of the perpetrator that he or she should have done that which, in the first stage, it was determined that he or she had the ability and opportunity to do. Accordingly, we propose that the provision of Chapter 6, Section 13 of the Swedish Penal Code be formulated so that a judgment of guilty, which under Chapter 6 of the Penal Code is prescribed for an act committed against a person under a certain age, is also to be handed down against a person who has been negligent  with respect to the fact that the other person had not reached that age. The amendment is intended to help clarify the scope of application, but also entails a certain tightening of the requirements on the carefulness the perpetrator is required to exercise in order to avoid criminal liability.</p>
<h2>Entry into force, etc.</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the legislative amendments enter into force on 1 July 2017. No special transitional provisions are necessary.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>In all, implementation of the proposals we have presented will not lead to any substantial cost increases for public authorities. Our pro- posals regarding dividing the crimes ‘purchase of sexual services’ and ‘exploitation of a child through the purchase of a sexual act’ into degrees, and making the penalty for the latter crime stricter, can be expected to result in a larger share of perpetrators being sentenced to penalties other than a fine than is presently the case. Our pro- posal on amending the wording of the negligence requirement for perpetrators in relation to a young crime victim can also be expected to result in somewhat more perpetrators being found guilty than today. This would entail a cost increase for the Swedish Prison and Probation Service. However, the financial consequences are difficult to access and are based on estimates. Nevertheless, we believe that any increased costs that result from our proposals can be expected to fit within existing appropriations.</p>
<p>It can also be expected that several of our proposals will require training and information for staff working within the judicial system. We consider that these costs as well will fit within existing appro- priations.</p>
<p>Among the other consequences of our proposals is that certain positive effects for crime prevention work can be expected. In addition, our view is that our proposals, which in many respects are clarifications, can be expected to result in increased predictability and legal certainty, and create the conditions for a more nuanced application by law enforcement authorities and the judiciary.</p>
