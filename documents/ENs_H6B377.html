<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Specialist nurses are responsible for providing advanced nursing within health and medical care, and are necessary in order for equal, safe care to be provided on the basis of science and proven experience. The shortage of specialist nurses undermines the opportunities for health and medical care to ensure good health, alleviate suffering and support dignified death. This shortage has also led to growing waiting lists, cancelled operations and ward closures. Virtually all the political parties and other decision-makers within healthcare agree that a number of measures are needed in order to improve access to specialist nurses and make the profession more attractive. To provide a short-term solution to the situation that has arisen, a number of temporary initiatives have been carried out with varying results. Promoting the attractiveness of the profession and increaseing access to nurses with specialist training will require both shortand long-term measures. In order to retain specialists within healthcare, skills need to be used within healthcare operations to improve the quality of care. There is also a need for more training paths to create opportunities for the career development of nurses with specialist training.</p>
<p>In this report, the Inquiry presents a proposed solution that consists of various measures which, as a whole, will improve the skills supply of specialist nurses and thereby improve patient safety. Ultimately, the Inquiry focuses on creating an infrastructure to strengthen both specialist training and the professional role of nurses with specialist training within the health and medical care of the future. Key factors for achieving this include providing employers with tools for planning the skills supply in a sustainable manner, and introducing further training requirements in accordance with EU legislative requirements, thereby improving patient safety. Taken together, the proposals in this report lead to new roles and additional training for nurses with specialist training, improving both the conditions for life-long learning and the attractiveness of the profession. In order to further quality assure future specialist training, the Inquiry is of the opinion that work-based training and care science research need to be strengthened via an agreement (a workbased training and research agreement) corresponding to the national medical training and research agreement. Rapid changes and developments within healthcare, where the majority of initiatives are carried out within close care, place growing demands on specialist nurses working on the basis of evidence-based knowledge, which is why the Inquiry proposes that the regulations for combined employment be strengthened by promoting care science, thus strengthening the quality of care and ultimately patient safety.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s remit and starting points</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit is to carry out a review of specialist nurse training. The aim of this review is that the training of the future should meet the changed needs of health and medical care, and should give students the knowledge and abilities required to work independently as specialist nurses. The Inquiry shall also analyse healthcare’s access to and need for specialist nurses, and shall propose measures to increase the attractiveness of the specialist nursing profession. The Inquiry shall also assess the need for an updated qualification descriptor for the Postgraduate Diploma in Midwifery and shall assess the need for a Postgraduate Diploma in Specialist Radiography.</p>
<p>Since the Inquiry’s review affects both the higher education and research field and health and medical care operations, the regulations that govern these two sectors – both of which are based on demands for science and proven experience – have been taken as a starting point. Within higher education, this is expressed for example through higher education qualification requirements stipulating that students shall demonstrate knowledge of the scientific basis of the field and an insight into current research and development work, as well as knowledge of the link between science and proven experience and the significance of this link for professional practice. For health and medical care, this is expressed both through the care provider’s responsibility for care being run so that the requirements of good health in accordance with the Health Care Act being met, and through the personal responsibility of health and medical care staff for carrying out their work in agreement with science and proven experience, in accordance with the Patient Safety Act. Ultimately, this is about care being evidence-based and being carried out so that a high degree of patient safety can be achieved.</p>
<p>In accordance with the demands for science and proven experience, the Inquiry has also decided on an additional starting point: research. As far as possible, our proposals shall have the backing of research and shall thereby strengthen the link between higher education qualifications and evidence-based care.</p>
<p>An additional perspective that provides guidance for the Inquiry is the definition of higher education that is essential to society. Taking as a starting point the Government’s assessment in the bill that preceded the introduction of the 1993 higher education reform, the Inquiry is of the opinion that the proposals presented in this report should be seen as worthy of particular protection from a societal perspective, and that increased state control is thus warranted within the fields of both higher education and health and medical care.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s assessment of what needs to be done</h2>
<p>In order to increase both access to nurses with specialist training in care and the attractiveness of the profession, the Inquiry has decided in its considerations that there is a need for measures that solve these problems in both the short and long terms. The Inquiry therefore proposes changes to the provisions that govern health and medical care and higher education. Creating a coherent infrastructure for specialist nurses is one objective. The Inquiry’s perception is that clarifying and strengthening existing regulations would give care providers the tools needed for planning the skills supply, and that more higher education opportunities for nurses wishing to carry out specialist training would make the profession more attractive.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s assessment of what needs to be done is based on health and medical care providers not making sufficient use of specialist nurses’ skills, and the profession therefore not being seen to be as attractive as it potentially could be. All the Inquiry’s stakeholders agree that specialist nurses play a central role in ensuring high quality care that is safe for patients. Despite this, the Inquiry is of the opinion that in several key respects nurses with specialist training are treated unfairly by their employers. For example, there is a lack of knowledge regarding what specialist nurses’ skills consist of and which duties are included in the role, which ultimately can have a negative impact on salaries due to employers not knowing what should be remunerated. Health and medical care staff make up the biggest professional group in the Swedish labour market, and while they experience stress of conscience in their work, they also account for the highest proportion of sickness cases (2014) in Sweden. The Inquiry therefore proposes a number of measures in the form of good examples that can be taken by care providers.</p>
<p>According to the Inquiry, the possibility of further training through individual skills development plans drawn up in consultation with the employer and access to independent higher education courses in order to develop within the profession on a scientific basis would increase the attractiveness of and access to specialist nurses. In order to further strengthen the quality of evidence-based care, a focus on care science research and combined employment is also needed.</p>
<h2>Measures to increase access to and the need for specialist nurses</h2>
<p>There is a broad consensus among the Inquiry’s stakeholders that more specialist nurses are needed within healthcare in both the short and long terms, and this is supported by most government agencies’ forecasts of various shortages of workers. In order to ascertain healthcare’s access and needs within various specialist areas and to get a deeper understanding of the extent of the shortage, the Inquiry has inventoried the provisions and steering documents that care providers can refer to in connection with competence requirements and skills supply. Which tools do health and medical care authorities and care providers use to assess and forecast needs and access in the short and long terms? The Inquiry’s assessment is that, despite agreement among stakeholders on the shortages and their consequences in - terms of ward closures and cancelled operations, care providers lack management systems to help produce sustainable forecasts of skills requirements in their skills supply planning. Other factors that make it harder to assess access to and the need for specialists include the lack of requirements placed on care providers when it comes to monitoring and mapping skills, the lack of services for specialist nurses and the lack of work duty definitions in the work identifycation system, as well as the fact that only a few work duties within health care require specific training in order to be carried out. Overall, the Inquiry is of the opinion that these factors have led to the current shortage and to the specialist nursing profession not being seen as attractive. However, there are measures that can be taken to rectify the problem.</p>
<p>The recruitment of specialist nurses is one area that can be improved by stating which specialisation is sought for advertised positions in job adverts. Job adverts are often drawn up in such a flexible manner that it is not clear whether or not specialist knowledge is required. The majority of adverts state that a nurse with basic training is required, and that specialist knowledge would be an advantage. It is not clear to applicants whether specialist knowledge would make a difference. It is also hard to know anything about the difficulty of the work duties and whether there is any salary scope for specialist knowledge when the advert suggests that basic training would be enough.</p>
<p>Against this background, the Inquiry proposes that health and medical care’s requirements for quality within health and medical operations should be systematically and continuously developed and ensured, that they should refer specifically to operational skills supply and skills development in relation to advanced clinical specialist nurses, midwives, radiographers and specialist nurses, and that good quality care should be provided by health and medical staff who have the right skills for the job. The Inquiry’s assessment is that care providers should use the prescribed management system as a tool for inventorying, identifying and planning for healthcare’s skills supply and skills development in both the long and short terms.</p>
<h2>Measures required to improve the attractiveness of the specialist nursing profession Good examples that care providers can adopt</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has identified a number of good examples of measures that can be taken by care providers to improve the attractiveness of the specialist nursing profession. Care providers should define the duties of specialist nurses so that these duties are seen and valued correctly within the work identification system. This would also allow for a higher degree of salary differentiation than is currently the case, as the work duties carried out by specialist nurses would be recognised. Care providers should create specific positions for specialist nurses based on the relevant specialisation, to both clarify and highlight the need for these and thus increase the incentives for nurses to carry out specialist training. At the same time, the creation of positions will represent a tool for care providers in their skills supply planning. Care providers should also carry out the necessary measures to improve the working environments for nurses and specialist nurses in the form of plans and routines to ensure systematic further training, models for reducing working hours and mapping action plans for workloads and stress-related sick leave. Care providers should also work systematically to improve managers’ leadership, for example through training and other skills improvement initiatives.</p>
<h2>Measures that the state can carry out</h2>
<p>The Inquiry reports on three different measures that the state can carry out to increase the attractiveness of and access to trained specialist nurses. The first proposal, on management system requirements for systematic operational development for skills provision, has been described above. The second proposal involves placing demands for systematic and ongoing further training in order for Sweden to meet the requirements of the Directive on the recognition of professional qualifications (2013/55/EU) and to improve patient safety. Despite the legislation requiring health and medical care staff to carry out their work in compliance with science and proven experience, the Inquiry is of the opinion that the updating of existing training is currently almost non-existent. The requirement for member states to ensure that the conditions are in place for health and medical care staff to carry out further training is not covered in Swedish law.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s third proposal involves an increase in the number of independent higher education courses within subject areas of relevance to advanced clinical specialist nurses, midwives, radiographers and specialist nurses. In order for higher education’s research and scientific developments to benefit healthcare, further training at higher education institutions must be made possible to a greater extent than is currently the case. Higher education instituteions should therefore provide a broad, flexible and predictable offering of independent courses for the purposes of continuing and further education. The content of these courses should be adapted to follow developments within healthcare. The remit to educational institutions should be given over consecutive four-year periods, for which earmarked funding should be provided. The total funding for this remit is estimated at SEK 54 million per year.</p>
<h2>Introducing advanced clinical specialist nurses as a new regulated profession</h2>
<p>Over the course of the last 20 years, Swedish health and medical care – within which specialist nurses will work – has undergone many changes. In general, healthcare has become more complex in both medical and technological terms while the number of hospital beds has fallen, and a large proportion of healthcare is now provided outside hospitals. Healthcare also faces challenges involving the fragmentation of healthcare management with an unclear distribution of roles and a lack of coordination between  in-patient and out-patient care, with a large number of actors working within both forms of care. This requires access to highly trained nurses who can coordinate healthcare and provide accurate information about patients’ conditions so that patients can decide for themselves how to promote good health, manage their diseases and know when they need to ask for help with their conditions.</p>
<p>In order to meet the needs of the health and medical care of the future and its changing requirements, an additional specialist level should be introduced over and above the current Postgraduate Diploma in Specialist Nursing. The Inquiry proposes that a new higher education professional qualification be introduced at secondcycle level. The Advanced Clinical Postgraduate Diploma in Specialist Nursing should form the basis for qualification as an advanced clinical specialist nurse.</p>
<p>This two-year programme should reflect the needs in the Swedish healthcare context and represent a new professional role that leads to increased quality of care for patients through in-depth knowledge within both medical science and care science, giving nurses the tools needed to take overall responsibility for the patient within the chosen specialisation. The advanced clinical specialist nurse should act both autonomously and in cooperation with other professions, and should diagnose disease and ill-health, refer patients if necessary, provide self-care advice, teach and supervise colleagues and students, and coordinate care interventions. In practice, advanced clinical specialist nurses can – to a greater extent than specialist nurses – run their own clinics, as a result of their authorities and their in-depth knowledge, in e.g. rural areas for older patients with multiple diagnoses and a significant need for continuity within the care chain, thereby promoting equality. The professional role will also increase attractiveness for nurses by offering an additional career path for nurses who want to carry out specialist training.</p>
<h2>An amended Postgraduate Diploma in Specialist Nursing</h2>
<p>Ongoing developments within health and medical care create a continuous need for new education programmes and changes to existing programmes to ensure that they keep abreast of healthcare needs and developments. The Inquiry proposes that the Postgraduate Diploma in Specialist Nursing should continue to be a professional qualification at second-cycle level that is achieved on completing course requirements worth 60 higher education credits. The qualification should have four specialisations: three set specialisations and a fourth different specialisation. The three set specialisations should be anaesthesia care, intensive care and operating theatre care. These specialisations should be regarded as beginner professions that aim to maintain the necessary skills needed in society within the fields of emergency care, operating theatre care and intensive care. The design of specialist nurse training makes it sustainable in the long term in accordance with the principles that apply for the qualification descriptors. Different content structure can lead to the same objectives, and the educational institutions should have both freedom and responsibility for the choice of different paths that lead to these objectives. The Inquiry’s proposed Postgraduate Diploma in Specialist Nursing also reduces lock-in effects for specialist nurses, and can ensure that nurses – with their broad expertise and in-depth knowledge bases – can work within each specialisation area to a greater extent than is currently the case.</p>
<h2>Entry requirements for the Postgraduate Diploma in Specialist Nursing</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s assessment is that specific eligibility requirements for specialist nurse training may present an obstacle to the supply of specialist nurses. If higher education institutions set specific eligibility requirements in the form of professional experience, those individuals who do not have professional experience cannot be accepted for the programme. It is probably reasonable to assume that without specific eligibility requirements, more students would be accepted for specialist nurse training. It should still be up to each educational institution to decide on specific eligibility requirements for specialist nurse training. The Inquiry would particularly like to emphasise that, according to the legislation, the specific eligibility requirements imposed must be necessary for the student to be able to assimilate the education successfully.</p>
<h2>Continued state responsibility for specialist nurse training</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s assessment is that the state should continue to be responsible for specialist nurse training, and that this training should be provided in the form of higher education and by individual education providers. This is to ensure that work duties can continue to be carried out on the basis of science and proven experience.</p>
<h2>Proposals to strengthen cooperation between educational institutions and care providers Work-based training and research agreements should be entered into between the state care providers</h2>
<p>In order to strengthen quality and provide the necessary number of work-based training places, educational institutions and care providers should enter into a work-based training and research agreement, similar to the national medical training and research agreements for doctors. The Inquiry is of the opinion that an agreement will improve the conditions for planning the work-based training for the parties to the agreement, by ensuring access to the necessary number of workbased training places, improving the quality and monitoring of operations, creating equivalent payment levels and reducing the administrative burden on educational institutions and care providers. The agreement will also contribute towards an important strengthening of care science research through the provision of SEK 200 million per year. This funding should be allocated within the framework of the agreement’s regional cooperation, and aims to both encourage more combined employment for specialist nurses and increase the quality of care through care science research findings reaching out to patients and being put into practice to a greater extent than is currently the case.</p>
<h2>A council within the Government Offices for cooperation at national level</h2>
<p>There is a need to further formalise the cooperation on training and skills supply issues for advanced clinical specialist nurses, midwives, radiographers and specialist nurses. The Inquiry therefore proposes that a council should be established within the Government Offices to deal with strategic issues on cooperation between the state and authorities. The council will allow the Government to obtain information on an ongoing basis on issues relating to the skills supply for these professional groups, and on various training issues such as dimensioning and course offering based on access and need forecasts, as well as how more effective use can be made of existing skills. The council shall consist of the programmes’ stakeholders in the form of representatives from e.g. professional associations and trade unions, specialist associations, educational institutions, care providers (county councils, municipalities, private actors, etc.) and certain ministries and government agencies.</p>
<h2>A need to change the qualification descriptor for midwife training</h2>
<p>The Inquiry is of the opinion that changes need to be made to the qualification descriptor for the Postgraduate Diploma in Midwifery, but does not propose making changes to the programme itself. It is stated in the Inquiry’s directive that the scope of the qualification should remain the same, in other words 90 higher education credits, and that the requirement to issue authorisation as a midwife should also remain. The Swedish Association of Midwives and all the educational institutions that train midwives have requested direct training to become a midwife, or alternatively an extension to the current training. These stakeholders are of the opinion that the current training does not include all the knowledge deemed necessary for professional practice as a midwife. In January 2018, the Inquiry appointed a reference group consisting of experts within midwife training to discuss the design of an amended training programme. Unfortunately, the participants in the reference group stated that they did not intend to support the Inquiry in the work involved with an amended training programme. The Inquiry believes that there is a lack of support for a reform process in relation to an amended midwife training programme within the scope of the Inquiry’s remit, and the Inquiry has not therefore been able to carry out this aspect of the remit.</p>
<h2>A Postgraduate Diploma in Specialist Radiography should not be introduced within higher education</h2>
<p>The Inquiry is of the opinion that a Postgraduate Diploma in Specialist Radiography should not be introduced within higher education. The Inquiry’s perception is that the scope of each specialist area does not currently correspond to a professional qualification worth 60 higher education credits. The Inquiry’s analysis and assessment should be</p>
<p>seen in the light of the limited time made available to the Inquiry. The Inquiry therefore proposes that the Government should com- mission the Swedish Higher Education Authority with investigating further the existing conditions for those educational institutions with degree-awarding powers for a Bachelor of Science in Diagnostic Radiology Nursing to provide a Postgraduate Diploma in Specialist Radiography. The Inquiry is of the opinion that there are rapid developments within the field of radiology in both technological and medical terms, placing significant demands on access to continuing and further training for radiographers. The Inquiry wishes to em- phasise the educational institutions’ opportunities to offer general qualifications, meaning that several institutions already offer both education programmes and independent courses for radiographers at second-cycle level. Independent courses for radiographers at second-cycle level are currently largely lacking. The current course offering is too narrow to meet healthcare’s skills development needs. Against this background, the Inquiry proposes a greater number of independent higher education courses, as described previously.</p>
