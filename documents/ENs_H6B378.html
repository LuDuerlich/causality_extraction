<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Countries, regions, municipalities and higher education institutions all compete to attract knowledge, competences, and investments, in order to improve their position and stimulate their economic development. In this competition higher education, research and innovation are key factors. However, higher education institutions, countries and regions are both competitors and collaborative partners. Sweden is one of the countries that are making significant efforts to attract competences and investments but Sweden is lagging behind in the competition.</p>
<p>Many higher education institutions find their most important strategic partners abroad, and many countries have taken clear steps towards achieving a greater international presence by becoming established abroad or through education export. That universities would primarily be working in a national context is too narrow an image. The development of knowledge-based economies, requiring the expansion of higher education and research is under way in large parts of the world. The map of important research nations is growing, requiring of Swedish higher education institutions to look further afield when developing academic cooperation. However, the Swedish position in view of these developments is restrained.</p>
<p>This changing environment presents both challenges and opportunities. If Sweden is to take advantage of these challenges, efforts are needed to develop initiatives, education and cooperation, and to brand Sweden as a knowledge nation. In order to be able to establish partnerships and attract essential resources, it is crucial that Sweden and Swedish actors within research and higher education have international visibility, and that cooperation between Swedish and international actors is legally and administratively uncomplicated.</p>
<p>In its first report, the Inquiry proposed that all international activities at higher education institutions should aim to improve the quality of higher education and research and should contribute to sustainable development, both nationally and globally.</p>
<p>These objectives should also guide the work to strengthen Sweden’s attractiveness as a knowledge nation and a study destination. By attracting high quality students, doctoral students, researchers and other staff to Swedish higher education institutions, the quality of education and research can be strengthened. Establishing long-term links with foreign students and alumni is extremely valuable for Sweden. This is the case whether students are given the opportunity to work in Sweden, thereby contributing to the skills supply here, or whether they return to their home country or somewhere else where they can provide good links to Sweden later in life. Correspondingly, Sweden’s ability to attract foreign investment in research and innovation collaboration is dependent on having a high degree of expertise here in Sweden and the ability to cooperate internationally, and on knowledge of this being developed abroad. Swedish higher education institutions must also develop their global presence and responsibility in view of global common challenges.</p>
<h2>The remit</h2>
<p>The remit of the Inquiry is to propose new objectives and a new national strategy for the internationalisation of higher education institutions that includes both education and research interaction activities. The Inquiry shall also propose how more students can gain an international perspective in their education through, for example, more students, teachers and researchers studying or working abroad, and through increased internationalisation at home. Finally, the Inquiry shall propose measures to increase Sweden’s attractiveness as a study destination and a knowledge nation.</p>
<p>On 31 January 2018, the Inquiry reported on the remits of objectives, strategy and the international perspective in education in its interim report “Internationalisation of Swedish Higher Education and Research – A Strategic Agenda” (SOU 2018:3). The remit of Sweden’s attractiveness as a study destination and a knowledge nation is reported on in this report, which also concludes the work of the Inquiry.</p>
<h2>Branding of Sweden as a knowledge nation</h2>
<p>Creating favourable conditions for higher education, research and innovation policy neither begins nor ends at our national borders. On an overall level, the complex world situation makes it increasingly important to reinforce Sweden’s image and relations abroad. It is also important to strengthen the brand of Sweden as a knowledge nation, especially as more and more countries are also aspiring to be knowledge driven societies. Sweden leading the way within research and higher education is an essential element of the broader picture of Sweden.</p>
<p>The responsibility that Sweden takes on the global stage should also include higher education institutions and research actors. It is essential for the quality and relevance of higher education and research that there are favourable conditions for higher education institutions to form international long-term mutual cooperation within these fields. Therefore, it is also essential that actors on the national level coordinate their efforts to internationalise higher education and research. The international partnerships of higher education institutions strengthen the links between countries, and can therefore also have an important, positive diplomatic impact.</p>
<p>There is a strong mutually reinforcing connection between the quality, the internationalisation and the visibility or attractiveness of higher education institutions. Even though the quality of Swedish research and higher education is high, Swedish higher education institutions are not very visible in many other countries. As a result, the quality of higher education and research cannot fully contribute to internationalisation by attracting students and researchers. Highly internationalised research and education environments tend to feature a high level of quality, which also makes them visible internationally. Conversely, inadequate internationalisation risks leading to lower quality and thus poorer visibility. A lack of awareness of Sweden is therefore a significant problem if Swedish higher education institutions are to remain attractive and Sweden is to continue to be a leading knowledge nation. To enhance the conditions for Sweden to be an attractive and relevant collaborative partner abroad, ambitions need to be raised when it comes to the external analysis that Swedish higher education institutions and other government agencies and organisations can benefit from.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore makes a number of proposals in order to increase awareness in other countries of Sweden as a knowledge nation and a study destination.</p>
<p>• It is proposed that the international presence of Swedish higher education and research should be increased through a developed organisation abroad. The current Offices of Science and Innovation that are organised within the Government Offices and have a presence at six Swedish embassies should have their assignments adjusted to improve their relevance to the needs of Swedish higher education institutions. It is therefore proposed that the offices should be strengthened and expanded.</p>
<p>• Alongside these offices, a pilot project should be launched in which two new international offices are established specifically to meet higher education’s need for international cooperation, hosted by an agency outside the Government Offices. According to the Inquiry, these pilot offices will be better placed to provide the necessary link to operations in Sweden than the current organisation, which is partly limited by being organised within the Government Offices. The Inquiry also proposes that the international offices including the pilot offices should be jointly evaluated in order to provide data for decisions on future organisation and expansion to additional countries.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Institute’s remit to promote and market Sweden as a  study destination  should be expanded. It should also be given a new remit to provide information about Sweden as a knowledge nation  abroad, which would involve providing basic information and supporting Sweden’s missions abroad. This remit should be carried out in dialogue with the internationalisation platform proposed by the Inquiry.</p>
<p>• A programme for Swedish research and higher education ambassadors should be established within the Swedish Institute, in cooperation with the Association of Swedish Higher Education Institutions. Swedish researchers and teachers with doctoral degrees who work at higher education institutions abroad should be able to apply to become Swedish education and research ambassadors at their respective institutions and help to raise awareness of Sweden as a knowledge nation.</p>
<p>• A pilot project for a  five-year period should be initiated for postdoctoral appointments within the humanities, with the appointees simultaneously serving as Swedish senior lecturers abroad.</p>
<p>• A variable resource for a  five-year focus on contacts with a specific country should be created to facilitate a coordinated gathering of strength.</p>
<p>• The coordinated Team Sweden groups within the framework of Swedish trade promotion abroad should include higher education institutions and research funding bodies in their work. In addition, a special Team Sweden Knowledge group should be created to enhance international cooperation within higher education and research and the visibility of Swedish higher education and research.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Council for Higher Education, the Swedish Higher</p>
<p>Education Authority, the Swedish Institute, Sweden’s Innovation</p>
<p>Agency, and the Swedish Research Council should be tasked with supporting the internationalisation of Swedish research, higher education and research-linked innovation by way of providing continuous and in-depth information and analysis of international developments that are relevant to these areas.</p>
<h2>Agency coordination</h2>
<p>The Inquiry believes the internationalisation of higher education institutions should be integrated into all relevant policies at national level. This involves a significant need for cooperation between policy areas. Increased cooperation between government agencies can promote such integrated internationalisation at national level.</p>
<p>Agency coordination is needed in several different areas in order to support the internationalisation of higher education and research, and to ensure that the rest of society benefits from this:</p>
<p>• cooperation for strategic internationalisation,</p>
<p>• cooperation to provide information about Sweden as a knowledge nation and to promote building relations,</p>
<p>• cooperation on international external monitoring and analysis, and</p>
<p>• cooperation on improving the conditions for mobility.</p>
<p>Within all these areas, different government agencies have specific roles. The Inquiry therefore makes the following proposals for the agencies’ various roles and activities to be coordinated for a more effective, coordinated whole:</p>
<p>• The Government should task the Swedish Institute, the Swedish Higher Education Authority, the Swedish Council for Higher Education, the Swedish Research Council and Sweden’s Innovation Agency with setting up an internationalisation platform to coordinate issues affecting internationalisation within higher education, research and  research-linked innovation.</p>
<p>• The Government should appoint the directors of the above agencies, a representative for other research funding bodies and two representatives from higher education institutions as a steering group for the platform. The remit for the steering group should be to jointly devise and lead the work within the internationalisation platform.</p>
<p>• The work within the internationalisation platform can then be organised into several different working groups, in which government agencies, organisations and student representatives can participate.</p>
<h2>The process of coming to Sweden as a fee-paying student</h2>
<p>A well-functioning and easy process of applying and moving to a new country is a very important part of international competition for internationally mobile students. Coming to Sweden as a student is currently a complicated process in several respects. There are many stages from applying for a study place through to registering for a course, and the system is fragmented in some respects with information that must be obtained from and submitted to several different government agencies and organisations.</p>
<p>How an applicant perceives the process of applying to study in Sweden affects the student’s choice of study destination. It is therefore important that the process in Sweden works well and is perceived as straightforward, modern and accommodating. An effective process also gives an important positive impression to the majority of those applicants who ultimately do not come to Sweden to study. The possibilities to become established in the local labour market is also a key factor for many students when choosing a study destination. The Inquiry therefore makes a number of recommendations:</p>
<p>• The internationalisation platform proposed by the Inquiry should ensure that the process of coming to Sweden as a  fee-paying student is made more effective. One possibility that the Inquiry believes should be considered is to develop a joint web-based cross-agency interface for foreign students to apply to higher education institutions and to deal with their applications for higher education studies, scholarships and residence permits.</p>
<p>• The higher education institutions and the Swedish Council for Higher Education should analyse the reasons why a large proportion of applicants are deemed to be ineligible and to take actions to reduce this proportion.</p>
<p>• The higher education institutions and the Swedish Council for Higher Education should review the possibility of shortening both processing times and application times.</p>
<p>• The higher education institutions should investigate the possibility of using separate admission of  fee-paying students to a greater extent than is currently the case. This involves greater flexibility in the institutions’ admission of these students, and could for example allow admission notifications to be issued earlier. Few higher education institutions currently make use of this possibility.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Council for Higher Education and the Swedish Higher Education Authority should be tasked with investigating how  fee-paying students can be monitored from application to graduation via regular statistics or specific monitoring. A greater understanding is needed of what happens during the different stages of the process in order to make the process of coming to Sweden as a fee-paying student more effective.</p>
<p>• Higher education institutions should take more responsibility for increasing foreign students’ contact with Swedish society and employers. The Inquiry recommends that higher education institutions and employers should work more closely in partnership on individual education programmes to create opportunities for internships and professional mentoring. The Inquiry recommends that higher education institutions should arrange their Englishlanguage programmes so that they include elements of work experience.</p>
<h2>Migration law aspects</h2>
<p>Swedish migration policy emphasises regulated immigration, while education and research policy highlights operational quality regardless of the origin of those who work within higher education. The Inquiry has tried to identify a way to bring these different aspects together. It is very important that higher education institutions understand how migration policy works, in the same way that the Swedish Migration Agency and other government agencies need an understanding of higher education institutions’ objectives and operations. The Inquiry believes that the parties involved have a joint responsibility to create constructive cooperation. This work has already begun to some extent.</p>
<p>In its proposals, the Inquiry has been inspired by the model applied in the Netherlands for dealing with residence permits. This model involves Dutch higher education institutions with the status of recognised sponsor being entitled to apply for residence permits on behalf of applicants, and it is the higher education institutions that are in contact with the Dutch migration authorities.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that:</p>
<p>• Higher education institutions should assess the intention to study in preparation for the Swedish Migration Agency’s decision on granting a residence permit for studies. With this model, the higher education institutions’ assessment of the intention to study – just like the admission notification today – would form the basis for the agency’s decision on a residence permit for studies. The Swedish Migration Agency would continue to review other residence permit conditions.</p>
<p>• In the long term, the Government should appoint an inquiry on certifying higher education institutions for dealing with applications for residence permits for studies and research, and for work permits.</p>
<p>• The Government should review the conditions for the award of residence permits to foreign doctoral students conducting part of their studies in Sweden (visiting doctoral students) and consider how the conditions can be improved.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also recommends that:</p>
<p>• Higher education institutions should draw up guidelines for ensuring effective admissions in harmony with the migration process.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Migration Agency should strengthen and further develop the work to shorten processing times, both for students and doctoral students, and for employees.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Migration Agency should review and change the current  three-month limit for bank deposits for first-time applications.</p>
<p>• The higher education institutions should ensure that routines are in place to notify the Swedish Migration Agency immediately if students end their studies.</p>
<h2>Application and tuition fees The application fee should not be changed</h2>
<p>The Inquiry is of the opinion that the application fee for thirdcountry students should remain at the current level of SEK 900, and should continue to be set by the Government. Even if an applicant applies for multiple courses, only one fee should be charged as is currently the case.</p>
<h2>Tuition fees Size of the fees</h2>
<p>The Inquiry notes that full cost coverage, which is the model currently used to determine the size of tuition fees, is a well-established model for higher education. Full cost coverage should be achieved for operations financed by tuition fees in their entirety, which allows for a degree of flexibility in pricing. The Inquiry has considered whether there is a need to propose a clarified regulation of how the size of tuition fees should be determined and what can be included. The conclusion is that national regulation should not be introduced in this area. The Inquiry is of the opinion that the distinction should be made at the individual higher education institution based on the institution’s operations and its desired profile. Higher education institutions should therefor establish principles for full cost coverage of tuition fees.</p>
<h2>Information to students</h2>
<p>Students who pay tuition fees have an entirely legitimate right to know what is included in tuition fees and why these may differ from the state contribution levels. Students therefore need clear information that is tailored to suit the target group, about both the structure and content of the education and the support or services available.</p>
<p>• Higher education institutions should therefore report clearly to applicants and students on what is included in tuition fees.</p>
<h2>Greater flexibility in setting fees and clearer rules about repaying fees where applicable</h2>
<p>Since the Ordinance on application fees and tuition fees at higher education institutions came into force in 2010, it has been amended a few times. However, no general review of the provisions has been carried out. Higher education institutions have pointed out the need for changes on a number of occasions. The Inquiry therefore makes the following proposals:</p>
<p>• The point at which liability for fees begins to apply should be clarified to make it clear that this point is when the course starts.</p>
<p>• The requirement that tuition fees should be the same for all feepaying students studying the same programme at the same time should be withdrawn. The Inquiry emphasises that the basic principle should be that tuition fees are set based on factual decisions for each programme, and should initially apply to all admitted students. However, it should then be possible to reduce tuition fees or grant scholarships, based on objective, transparent grounds.</p>
<p>• It should be compulsory for a higher education institution to repay tuition fees in full or in part if the student is prevented from taking part in studies due to a residence permit not having been granted or  pro-longed or for personal reasons, such as the student or a family member being ill. Higher education institutions may also repay tuition fees in full or in part for other specific reasons. What constitutes personal or other specific reasons should be determined by the higher education institutions.</p>
<p>• The provisions on exclusion due to  non-payment should be abolished. Instead, it should be established that a student who has not paid tuition fees for a course may not register for the course until these fees have been paid.</p>
<h2>Scholarships to fund third-country students</h2>
<p>Many countries worldwide are investing heavily in international scholarships to address social problems and to develop diplomatic international relations. Scholarships are an important tool for recruiting students, and many Swedish higher education institutions have pointed out the need for more scholarship opportunities as well as a scholarship programme for highly qualified students. The lack of Swedish scholarships has also been highlighted as one of the main barriers to the recruitment of foreign students.</p>
<p>A system financed by tuition fees needs to be supplemented with various types of scholarships. Flexibility also needs to be created for higher education institutions in dealing with tuition fees when it comes to more long-term strategic cooperation. According to the Inquiry, the current scholarship system is insufficient. Today, the system includes scholarships aimed at students from certain lowand medium-income countries, as well as funding allocated to higher education institutions so that they can reduce fees for certain students whom they want to recruit. The Inquiry therefore proposes how it should be possible to devise a more comprehensive scholarship system so that all fee-paying students can have the opportunity to apply for Swedish scholarships for tuition fees and living costs.</p>
<p>• The scholarship funding available to higher education institutions after allocation to higher education institutions by the Swedish Council for Higher Education should be doubled from today’s SEK 60 million to SEK 120 million. It should be possible to use these scholarships, which are intended for particularly highly qualified students regardless of their country of origin, to reduce tuition fees and to award grants for living costs.</p>
<p>• A new SEK 50 million scholarship programme for flagship scholarships, should be created. It is proposed that these scholarships should be awarded to highly qualified students studying for a master’s degree in connection with prominent research environments, and should cover both tuition fees and living costs.</p>
<p>• A new SEK 50 million scholarship programme for national bilateral cooperation should be created. It is proposed that this funding should be allocated to scholarship programmes created as part of bilateral agreements between Sweden and another country. The funding should be set aside in connection to the signing of an agreement.</p>
<p>• Higher education institutions should be given the opportunity to use up to 0.3 percent of the funding for education at firstand  second-cycle levels to reduce tuition fees for third-country students in special cases. Within the framework of the higher education institution’s strategic focus, each higher education institution should decide whether funding shall be used to reduce tuition fees for certain students, if so to what extent (up to the set limit), and on what grounds.</p>
<p>The Inquiry is also of the opinion that:</p>
<p>• A tax deduction entitlement for donations to scholarships for  fee-paying students in order to encourage industry to contribute towards meeting the skills supply requirement should be investigated.</p>
<p>• It should be possible to expand the scholarship programme targeted at students from countries that receive development aid from Sweden. SEK 150 million is currently allocated from the development cooperation budget to two scholarship programmes for studies at  second-cycle level, called Swedish Institute Study Scholarships. The Swedish Institute has proposed an increase of SEK 50 million. The Inquiry backs such an increase, but believes that the increased funding should primarily be directed towards student and teacher exchanges.</p>
<h2>Student influence</h2>
<p>The right of students to participate in decision making in higher education institutions is important for both Swedish and foreign students and vital for the governance of the institutions. It is important for the development of higher education institutions that foreign students’ perspectives are taken into account generally. Furthermore, integrated internationalisation requires the perspectives of foreign students to be taken into account. By making it easier for these students to participate in decision making processes, higher education institutions can also contribute towards the dissemination of practical knowledge and experience of participation in democratic governance.</p>
<p>The Inquiry notes that the student unions have a real desire to work for the greater inclusion of foreign students in student influence. However, language is a main barrier to involvement. Other barriers can include international students wanting to complete their studies quickly while active involvement in student union activities is often based on students spending longer time at the higher education institution.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore makes a number of recommendations to strengthen student influence for foreign students. Higher education institutions should:</p>
<p>• work together with the student unions to develop ways for foreign students to have an influence;</p>
<p>• actively inform incoming students about student influence opportunities and the work of the student unions, both before arriving in Sweden and during introduction periods, as well as during their actual studies;</p>
<p>• work to improve opportunities for  English-speaking students to take on student representative roles and clarify the conditions for participation in various forums, as well as the opportunities for linguistic support; and</p>
<p>• offer the student unions support with translating their steering documents, such as statutes, operational plans and policy documents, and</p>
<p>• clarify their expectations as well as the financial terms placed on the unions’ undertakings for supporting foreign students.</p>
<h2>Clarified student status</h2>
<p>The rights and obligations that students in Sweden have in accordance with the Higher Education Act and the Higher Education Ordinance are based on students being formally admitted for studies. These include the right to student influence, healthcare, course evaluation and appeals, as well as the opportunity for the higher education institution to take disciplinary action. The student status also affects the right to join student unions, as well as the right to student accommodation and student discounts.</p>
<p>The regulations mean that those who have not been formally admitted for studies are also not formally regarded as students. This affects exchange students and students within contracted courses, who are students at their home institutions. In a strict legal sense, these individuals do not therefore have the same formal rights or obligations as other students. In practice, this has not been a significant problem, as most exchange students are treated as having been admitted for studies. As a matter of principle, however, equivalent rights and obligations should be conferred upon exchange students and students within contracted courses.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore proposes that the Higher Education Act (1992:1434) should be clarified so that the term ‘student’ also refers to those studying at a higher education institution within the framework of an exchange agreement with a foreign higher education institution, or within an agreement on contracted courses with another Swedish or foreign higher education institution.</p>
<h2>Contracted courses and contract education</h2>
<p>The Inquiry also makes certain other proposals regarding contracted courses and contract education.</p>
<p>Contracted courses, i.e. education that higher education insti- tutions commission from other higher education institutions, is governed not by legislation or ordinance but only in brief in the appropriation documents for state higher education institutions. This creates a lack of clarity in terms of what applies for contracted courses, e.g. when it comes to participants’ status and which higher education institution is responsible for examining and registering study credits, particularly within international cooperation. The In- quiry therefore proposes that rules for contracted courses should be established in the Higher Education Ordinance.</p>
<p>A higher education institution can also provide contract edu- cation on payment of a fee for those who have been appointed by the client (for example, a company or an organisation purchasing education for employees). It is not currently possible for non-state organisations to purchase contract education needed for foreign aid policy reasons. The Inquiry therefore proposes that higher educa- tion institutions should be allowed to provide contract education needed within international development cooperation or humani- tarian aid to non-public clients.</p>
