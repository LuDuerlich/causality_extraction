<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In this final report, the  Commission on the Review of Economic Statistics proposes a substantial improvement of economic statistics.</p>
<p>In recent years, economic statistics have been used increasingly for following up economic policy on the national level as well as the EU level, thus placing greater demands on reliability and timeliness. Simultaneously, accelerating changes in society cause growing difficulties producing economic statistics of good quality.</p>
<p>In international comparison, resources allocated for official statistics in Sweden are relatively small, both in absolute terms and in relation to the size of the country. Since the beginning of the 1990s, resources for economic statistics have also declined, despite specific efforts for these statistics.</p>
<p>The Commission's proposals include improved statistics, as well as improved ways of working and a review of the organisation. The proposals emphasise a need for improvement of the National Ac- counts.</p>
<p>Concerning improved statistics, the Commission proposes that price statistics, input-output statistics, IT-statistics and measures of capital stocks should be improved. Economic statistics should also be produced more quickly. These demands were most evident in the user survey that was carried out by the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission also proposes improvements in statistics on the service sector, productivity growth, regional developments, the public sector, household income, real estate prices and wages, as well as better coverage of the hidden economy and improved exchange rate calculation. In addition, it is proposed that longer time series be developed, and that the perspective of gender in statistics production be strengthened.</p>
<p>Regarding improved ways of working and ways to change the organisation, the Commission proposes that analysis and competence in economics at Statistics Sweden be strengthened. The ma-</p>
<p>jority of national statistical institutes in other countries use much more resources for analysis than does Statistics Sweden.</p>
<p>Moreover, cooperation should be developed between National Accounts and primary statistics as well as the users. A Board for National Accounts should be set up, and service level agreements with important users should be drawn up. Documentation and information on revisions also need to be improved. Statistics Sweden should also consider unifying data collection in one department, and reviewing the organisation of National Accounts.</p>
<p>A strategic plan for improvements of economic statistics based on the proposals of the Commission should be drawn up and followed up yearly.</p>
<p>The total cost for proposals of the Commission amounts to about SEK 64 million. The proposals would correspond to 80â€“90 persons annually, of which about 20 persons annually would be directly linked to the National Accounts and the others would be engaged with the input to the National Accounts or other parts of economic statistics. Improvements should firstly be financed within the limits of new reforms in the Government budget and secondly by a reconsideration of priorities of appropriations within those government ministries most concerned. The proposals have been assigned to government ministries as shown in the table below.</p>

<p>At the same time as this report is published, Statistics Sweden will submit a budget request. Proposals for improvements of economic statistics are also taken up. The supporting documents for the budget request include an appendix containing the proposals from the Commission as well as the proposals in the budget request.</p>
