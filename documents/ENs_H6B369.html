<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The purpose of our remit has been to examine whether there is a need to take measures to ensure stronger protection from child marriage, forced marriage and offences with honour motives. In this context, our remit has included:</p>
<p>• evaluating the application of the penal provisions on coercion to marry and luring a person into travelling abroad for the purpose of a forced marriage;</p>
<p>• examining to what extent honour motives are taken into account by the police, prosecutors and courts;</p>
<p>• considering whether a special ground for more severe penalties for offences with honour motives should be added to Chapter 29, Section 2 of the Swedish Penal Code and, irrespective of what conclusion we draw on the matter, presenting a proposal of how to frame such a provision;</p>
<p>• following ongoing development work in the Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Prosecution Authority and assessing whether additional measures need to be taken to increase the possibilities of taking legal proceedings for the offences of coercion to marry and luring a person into travelling abroad for the purpose of a forced marriage;</p>
<p>• examining how the collaboration between the various authorities affected is functioning; and</p>
<p>• analysing the possibilities of keeping statistics of  honour-related offences and, if judged possible, proposing how to produce such statistics.</p>
<p>In supplementary terms of reference the Inquiry was given a broader remit to the effect that the Inquiry was also to analyse and consider the international dimension of forced marriage and genital mutilation. In particular, this part of the Inquiry has included:</p>
<p>• analysing and considering the possibilities of introducing more effective tools for preventing and stopping people with ties to Sweden being forced to marry or to be subjected to genital mutilation abroad, such as seizing, withdrawing and blocking passports and issuing travel bans for the purpose of protection, as well as measures to force or facilitate a return of the person concerned to Sweden;</p>
<p>• analysing and considering how collaboration between judicial authorities, the social services, schools and the Swedish Foreign Service in matters concerning forced marriages with international aspects can be developed and how working methods can be improved; and</p>
<p>• analysing and considering how working methods can be improved and collaboration developed between the relevant actors in matters concerning genital mutilation.</p>
<p>Our remit has also included proposing legislative amendments when required. For more information about our terms of reference, see annexes 1 and 2.</p>
<p>In December 2017 we presented proposals for further restrictions of the possibilities of recognising child marriages entered into abroad in our interim report Utvidgat hinder mot erkännande av utländska barnäktenskap [Extended impediments to the recognition of child marriages entered into abroad]  (SOU 2017:96).</p>
<h2>The Inquiry's assessments and proposals</h2>
<p>The term honour-related violence and oppression is now clearly established and can generally be described as being linked to honour norms, which build on strong patriarchal and heteronormative perceptions. Characteristic features are that the interest of the individual is held to be subordinate to that of the family; that the acts of the individual are held to affect the good name of the whole of the family; and that the sexuality of the individual is a matter for the whole of the family. These norms include the view that the reputation and good name of the family and of relatives are dependent on the chastity and virginity of female family members and their actual and alleged behaviour in relation to these norms. Forced marriage, child marriage and genital mutilation are different expressions of honour-related violence and oppression.</p>
<h2>A penal provision regarding child marriage should be introduced</h2>
<p>The risks of child marriages and relationships similar to marriage (or informal marriages) are many and well-known (see for example, section 4.4 of the Inquiry’s interim report, SOU 2017:96). Despite this view of marriage entered into with children, there is no separate penal provision that is aimed at the case where someone marries a child or is complicit in the marriage of a child.</p>
<p>The question of whether to introduce a special child marriage offence has been considered on several occasions (see, for instance, SOU 2008:41 and SOU 2012:35).</p>
<p>Child marriages are almost exclusively instances of parents or relatives forcing teenagers to get married or pressuring them to do so. Therefore child marriage is forced marriage to a great extent, and this means that the penal provisions on coercion to marry (Chapter 4, Section 4 c of the Penal Code) and luring a person into travelling abroad for the purpose of a forced marriage (Chapter 4, Section 4 d of the Penal Code) are also applicable to the vast majority of cases of child marriage. Against this background it is justifiable to ask whether criminalisation is reasonable.</p>
<p>There are, however, several circumstances that can justify the introduction of a separate child marriage offence. The prime concern is the probative difficulties encountered more or less as rule in matters concerning coercion to marry and luring a person into travelling abroad for the purpose of a forced marriage with a child as the injured party (see, for example, the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Southern Norrland of 18 April 2018 in case B 1382-17). The prosecutor has to show that the child has been induced into entering a valid marriage or a relationship similar to marriage by some improper means; unlawful coercion or exploitation of the vulnerable situation of the child.</p>
<p>It is not unusual for there to be pressure that is not punishable. Examples that can be mentioned are parents explaining that the family will be shamed if the child does not marry the person designated by the family or the child being excluded from the family group. It can also be the case that the young person does not dare to express their unwillingness to get married at all.</p>
<p>The protection that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (the CRC) seeks to give children also includes protection from early marriages. The CRC requires States Parties to work to combat traditional practices prejudicial to the health of children (Article 24.3). Child marriage has been identified as one such practice. A criminalisation of child marriage is a clear signal from legislators that child marriage is not tolerated.</p>
<p>A penal provision can have a deterrent effect on a person who is considering being an accomplice in a child marriage. This can strengthen families that need help to resist pressure from others to marry off a minor family member. The same can apply to a person who is being pressured by other people to marry a child. A penal provision can also strengthen children who do not want to get married and give them a tool to oppose the marriage.</p>
<p>The overall assessment of the Inquiry is that child marriage should be criminalised and that there is a sufficiently large scope to be able to justify a penal provision.</p>
<p>As regards the framing of a special penal provision, it is natural so start from the present regulation of coercion to marry but to remove the requirement of coercion or exploitation of a vulnerable situation in the case of offences directed at children. A design of that kind, where responsibility for the offence thus does not require that the perpetrator has used some improper means, is in line with the regulation of human trafficking, where there is no requirement of such means in the case of offences aimed at children. Another natural starting point is that primarily the person who bears the main responsibility for bringing about a child marriage should be punished. Whether the child itself consents to entering into the marriage is of no importance. It is therefore reasonable to punish the person who induces a child to enter into a marriage without requiring coercion or exploitation of a certain situation.</p>
<p>In many cases the child’s custodian is also the person who has induced the child to enter into the marriage. But it is also possible to conceive of cases in which it is not possible to prove that the custodian induced the child to enter into the marriage or where their measures are not to be considered to be inducement. The Inquiry therefore proposes providing that a person who “permits” a child to enter into a marriage can be punished for a child marriage offence. The term “permits” is aimed at active actions. Examples of actions that can include permitting are when a custodian gives their consent to the marriage or is present at a marriage ceremony.</p>
<p>Therefore responsibility for a child marriage offence should be borne by the person who “induces” or “permits” the child to enter into a marriage.</p>
<p>Child marriages that have been entered into after coercion or exploitation and that do, in fact, meet the requirements for coercion to marry should also be covered by the provision on child marriage offences. This solution is preferable since it leads to unified treatment of all coercion to marry offences aimed at children.</p>
<p>Informal marriages shall also be covered by the provision (cf. Chapter 4, Section 4 c, second paragraph of the Penal Code). It actually appears to be the case that this is where the penal provision will have the greatest effect since it is no longer possible to enter into legally valid child marriages in Sweden and the proposed tightening of the rules concerning child marriages entered into abroad will have the consequence that child marriages entered into abroad will, in principle, never be recognised.</p>
<p>The penalty proposed for the offence is imprisonment for at most four years.</p>
<h2>Special ground for more severe penalties for offences with honour motives should be introduced</h2>
<p>The provisions on sentencing are set out in Chapter 29 of the Penal Code. Present legislation already allows the existence of certain motives to have an impact on the assessment of an offence. This is because the intentions or motives of the accused should be taken into account in the assessment of penal value under Chapter 29, Section 1, second paragraph, first sentence of the Penal Code. So it is already possible, at present, to take account of honour motives in assessing penal value since the motive for an offence is itself a factor that expressly has to be taken into account. The study carried out as part of our investigation (see annex 3) also shows that the courts do make some use of honour motives as a basis for more severe penalties.</p>
<p>Honour-related violence and oppression is a social problem and combating offences that have honour motives should be a priority. Against this background it is desirable for the seriousness of the criminal activity taking place in the name of honour to be reflected clearly and regularly in its penal value. Moreover, the individual victims of honour-related criminal activity suffer greatly. On account of the collective nature of this criminal activity, the crime victims, who are mainly young women and girls, may often suffer more than is otherwise the case. It is also important, in view of this, that there is scope to assign offences with honour motives a higher penal value than corresponding criminal activity that is not honourrelated; having a special ground for more severe penalties for offences with honour motives can help to ensure this. Such a new ground for more severe penalties can also be seen as a step towards clarifying the particularly great vulnerability of these crime victims and towards strengthening the protection of rights of those affected.</p>
<p>The fact that honour motives can already be taken into account at present within the wording of Chapter 29, Section 1 of the Penal Code should not be seen as an obstacle to the introduction of a new special ground for more severe penalties. The provision in Chapter 29, Section 1 of the Penal Code is expressed in general terms and covers a great variety of circumstances, leading to both more severe and more lenient treatment, so there can be uncertainty about the full significance of the fact that an offence has been committed with honour motives. If a new special ground for more severe penalties is introduced, there will be no doubt that the existence of honour motives is of significance in the assessment of penal value. A clarification of that kind can first and foremost contribute to the police, prosecutors and courts giving more attention to honour motives – for example, through the securing of evidence about the motive in preliminary investigations and the imposition of more severe sanctions by the courts. The introduction of a special ground for more severe penalties for offences with honour motives also draws attention to the public institutions standpoint that criminal activity of that kind can never be accepted and ought to be able to influence the view that both society as a whole and certain groups have of criminal activity with honour motives.</p>
<p>Against this background we propose adding a new point, point 9, to Chapter 29, Section 2 of the Penal Code to the effect that, in the assessment of penal value, particular consideration shall be given as an aggravating circumstance to whether a motive for the offence was to preserve or restore the honour of a person or of a family, relatives or some other similar group. The proposed text of the legislation is mainly linked to the definition of honour-related criminal activity that the police and prosecutors use and is based on the character and purpose that such criminal activity possesses.</p>
<p>However, the fact that the proposed wording refers to the term of honour (and connects, in doing so, to a view of honour that is not shared by most people) does not mean that the legislators are to be viewed as accepting the notion that honour can be an acceptable reason for violence and oppression. On the contrary, the message of the special ground for more severe penalties is that honour motives are not defensible and it expresses a clear rejection of those ideas about honour. The Inquiry has therefore chosen to use the term honour. If there is, nevertheless, a wish to stress that the public authorities do not give their backing to that meaning of the term honour, we have provided alternative wording that starts from a perception of honour.</p>
<p>As regards the question of the introduction of a special honour offence, i.e. special regulation in the Penal Code aimed at honourrelated criminal activity, this falls outside our remit. Despite this we have considered the question briefly in our report and found that there are objections worthy of attention to the introduction of such a penal provision; to cover the whole range of the violence and oppression exercised in the name of honour the penal provision would, to begin with, need to be designed so broadly that it is questionable whether a special classification of an offence is the most suitable solution. Moreover, problems concerning scope and competition would arise since such a penal rule would risk overlapping with the gross violation of integrity offences.</p>
<h2>For the purpose of protection a ban on leaving the country should be introduced for children at risk of being taken abroad to enter into marriage or be subjected to genital mutilation</h2>
<p>Even though both forced marriage and genital mutilation have been criminalised and there is no requirement of dual criminality, there are instances of children with ties to Sweden being force to marry or being subjected to genital mutilation abroad. Numerous difficulties can be linked to this fact; for instance, public authorities often have small possibilities of helping a person who is outside Sweden.</p>
<p>At present the possibilities of intervening with preventive measures appear to be limited. The rules in the Care of Young Persons Act (1990:52), the coercive measures in penal procedure (such as travel bans under Chapter 25 of the Code of Judicial Procedure) and the possibility of issuing non-contact orders do mean that coercive measures can be applied in some cases. Despite these rules there are instances of children being taken abroad to be subjected to forced marriage or genital mutilation. One reason for this may be that none of the above-mentioned sets of regulations is specially designed to avert someone being taken out of Sweden for these purposes. With the exception of the Care of Young Persons Act they are not aimed at persons in need of protection either, but are aimed at suspects or possible perpetrators. Nor do the regulations for passports and other travel documents contain provisions to protect individuals in these situations.</p>
<p>In this light, it is important to take measures so as to be able to prevent children being taken abroad to be forced to enter into marriage or undergo genital mutilation. Such measures should also cover children who are taken abroad to enter into a marriage that they appear to consent to; one reason is that it is generally harmful for children to marry and they should not be awarded the capacity to consent to the far-reaching consequences resulting from marriage.</p>
<p>So there is a need to be able to restrict the possibility of travelling abroad for children at risk of being taken out of the country to enter into marriage or a relationship similar to marriage or to undergo genital mutilation. The Inquiry therefore proposes including a travel ban relating to these cases in the Care of Young Persons Act. The proposal is mainly based on the current structure of that Act, which means that a travel ban will generally be issued by an administrative court but that in urgent cases a temporary ban can be issued by the municipal social welfare committee. For such a ban to be effective, there should be a penalty for breaching it and the ban should result in restrictions in the possibility of obtaining and holding a passport. We therefore propose, first, that a person who takes a child out of Sweden contrary to a travel ban or aides such a trip, should be sentenced to a fine or imprisonment for at most one year and, second, that there should be an impediment to issuing a passport and grounds for withdrawing a passport in the case of a child issued with a travel ban. The amendments we propose to the Passport Act (1978:302) also make it possible to detain and block a passport in these cases. In our assessment the same procedure as we propose for ordinary passports should also apply to official and diplomatic passports issued by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and alien’s passports and travel documents issued by the Swedish Migration Agency. We should also mention that in connection with reviewing the rules for passports and other travel documents we have found that measures in this area alone are not sufficient to counter children being taken abroad for the purposes concerned.</p>
<p>When it comes to adults an equivalent system (i.e. corresponding to the one we have proposed introducing for children) is not as urgent. The Inquiry is therefore not proposing a travel ban or amendments to passport regulations etc. for this group.</p>
<h2>Our assessment regarding the collaboration, working methods and areas of responsibility of authorities</h2>
<p>Legislation is an important part of work to prevent and combat honour-related violence and oppression and its various forms of expression. But these problems also require other measures. Identifying and preventing honour-related violence and oppression is a responsibility of many actors in society and not solely of the law enforcement authorities.</p>
<h2>Some improvements possible in the working methods of the Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Prosecution Authority</h2>
<p>Development work is under way in the Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Prosecution Authority to increase the possibilities of taking legal proceedings for coercion to marry, luring a person into travelling abroad for the purpose of a forced marriage and genital mutilation. In the view of this Inquiry this work should continue in areas including the production of joint methodological support.</p>
<p>There is also reason for the Swedish Prosecution Authority to consider concentrating cases concerning coercion to marry, luring a person into travelling abroad for the purpose of a forced marriage and genital mutilation (as well as the proposed child marriage offence) to a smaller number of public prosecution offices so that they are handled by specially designated prosecutors. Moreover, a competence network should be set up for prosecutors handling these offences.</p>
<h2>Collaboration with other authorities can be improved in schools, health care, social services and the foreign service</h2>
<p>Important steps have been taken to improve collaboration between the relevant authorities regarding honour-related violence and oppression. However, there are areas in which better collaboration is needed with other authorities. This concerns schools and health care, which are important actors in terms of identifying that someone is at risk of being subjected to honour-related violence and oppression. If these actors are to communicate information and also to cooperate generally with other authorities, established procedures are required, as is knowledge of the issues raised by honour-related violence and oppression. In their ongoing work, the National Agency for Education and the National Board of Health and Welfare should therefore take account of the need for clear procedures for collaboration regarding matters including the risk that pupils, people seeking care, etc. are taken abroad to enter into marriage or undergo genital mutilation.</p>
<p>Collaboration and methods can also be improved regarding work to help people taken abroad to enter into a child or forced marriage or to undergo genital mutilation. There is a need for better collaboration at a general level primarily between the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the National Board of Health and Welfare concerning questions about persons in distress who have been taken abroad to, for instance, be married off or subjected to genital mutilation. International cases like these raise a number of general questions, such as the division of responsibility and work between municipal social services and the Swedish Foreign Service on the basis of the applicable regulations. We therefore make the assessment that general collaboration in these matters should take place in a set and structured form.</p>
<p>There is also scope for better collaboration in the handling of individual cases, especially between municipal social services and the Swedish Foreign Service, to help persons who have been taken abroad to come home to Sweden. Even if this cooperation often appears to work well, there are instances where problems arise. This is mainly bound up with the fact that knowledge of these matters varies between municipal social services across the country. We therefore make the assessment that the National Board of Health and Welfare should be given the commission of developing the possibilities for municipal social services to collaborate effectively with the Swedish Foreign Service and other actors by producing methodological support for the handling of these cases.</p>
<p>As regards the working methods of the Swedish Foreign Service, there is already a system in place that means that the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and selected embassies have officials specialising in consular matters, including child and forced marriages. This system should be made permanent. An arrangement of that kind fosters greater expertise and better working methods in matters concerning the return of people who are in distress abroad on account of honourrelated ‘family conflict reasons’. We therefore make the assessment that the Government’s initiative in the area of family conflict for 2018–2020 should be evaluated to examine whether a permanent system of officials specialising in issues including child and forced marriage and genital mutilation should be introduced in the Swedish Foreign Service.</p>
<h2>Division of responsibilities between authorities</h2>
<p>Another aspect of the need for collaboration is that the division of responsibilities between different authorities must be clear and that issues must not fall through the net. We have therefore examined the division of responsibilities between the National Board of Health and Welfare, the Swedish Gender Equality Agency, Östergötland County Administrative Board and the National Centre for Knowledge on Men's Violence Against Women.</p>
<p>Even though there are minor overlaps between the missions of the relevant authorities, there do not appear to be any substantial problems regarding the division of roles or responsibilities between the authorities. However, there is a need for an overarching permanent resource or expertise function tasked with promoting action to address honour-related violence and oppression in various ways by providing concrete support to the relevant agencies, municipalities and county councils. Our remit does not include specifying the forms for organising a function like that. However, that question should be reviewed as soon as possible. Our assessment is therefore that there is a need to make an earlier start to the coming evaluation of the commission of Östergötland County Administrative Board to be responsible for the national competence team (which is planned to take place after 2020).</p>
