<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The violation of integrity inquiry has been instructed to a) evaluate the application of the offences gross violation of integrity and gross violation of a woman’s integrity in Chapter 4, Section 4a of the</p>
<p>Swedish Penal Code and to b) examine and assess whether criminal liability for arbitrary conduct concerning a child is appropriately formulated for cases involving joint custody.</p>
<p>The purpose of the remit concerning the evaluation of violation of integrity offences has been to identify problems of interpretation that may have arisen in application and to examine whether the objective of introducing these offences has been met. After an additional directive the Inquiry remit also includes a review of the scale of penalties for gross violation of integrity and gross violation of a woman’s integrity and in that context to give special consideration to raising the minimum penalty.</p>
<p>The remit also included determining whether there is a need for legislative amendments and, if so, to make proposals to that end.</p>
<h2>Violation of integrity offences</h2>
<p>The objective of introducing violation of integrity offences has on the whole been met</p>
<p>Chapter 4, Section 4a of the Swedish Penal Code prescribes liability for violation of integrity offences. According to the first paragraph, a person who commits criminal acts as defined in Chapters 3, 4 or 6 of the Swedish Penal Code against a person with whom they have, or have previously had, a close relationship will be sentenced for gross violation of integrity to imprisonment for at least six months and at most six years if each of the acts were part of a repeated violation of the person’s integrity and the acts were liable to severely damage the person’s self-esteem. The second paragraph states that if the acts were committed by a man against a woman to whom he is, or has been, married or with whom he is, or has been, cohabiting under circumstances comparable to marriage, he will instead be sentenced for gross violation of a woman’s integrity to the same punishment. The objective of introducing violation of integrity offences was to enable criminal proceedings to take account of the abused person’s entire situation when he or she has been subjected to a series of albeit punishable but often individually relatively minor acts. The violation of integrity offences were also intended to bring about an upgrading of the penal value of such acts.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the evaluation, we have conducted a special case-law review of violation of integrity prosecutions that were appealed to the appeal courts in 2009. This review shows that repeated violations (offences under Chapters 3, 4 or 6 of the Swedish Penal Code) committed against a person who has, or has previously had, a close relationship with the perpetrator were deemed by the courts in a clear majority of cases to be violation of integrity offences and not isolated acts. This means that there has been a general increase in the penal value of repeated offences in close relationships. The particular punishability of subjecting a close relative or previous close relative to repeated offences that include violation of integrity is thus recognised in the assessment of criminal liability. In this respect the objective of introducing violation of integrity offences has been met.</p>
<p>In reviewing the rulings of the courts of appeal, the inquiry has noted that the majority of cases concern relatively serious offences. The case-law review shows that prosecutions for violation of integrity offences rarely involve relatively minor acts alone, i.e. acts that taken in isolation would be punishable by a fine. However, we are of the opinion that firm conclusions on the reasons for this cannot be drawn from the practice of the courts. The case-law review shows that in many cases relatively minor acts form part of the prosecution for violation of integrity offences but usually along with more serious offences; moderately serious assault was found in almost all of the reviewed cases.</p>
<p>Our general conclusion is that the objective of introducing violation of integrity offences has on the whole been met. The inquiry’s review and analysis of judicial decisions regarding violation of integrity offences does not support the conclusion that there is some uncertainty regarding the interpretation and application of the specific stipulations repeated violation  and liable to severely damage the person’s  self-esteem. Against this background, we have found no reason to propose amendments to the way the provisions on violation of integrity offences are formulated.</p>
<p>To further meet the objective of the legislation, we have however found grounds to consider whether there are other types of offences that should also be included in violation of integrity offences.</p>
<p>Additional types of offences should be included in violation of integrity offences</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that infringement of a non-contact order and vandalism be added to the offences listed in Chapter 4, Section 4a of the Swedish Penal Code. We have also considered whether defamation offences and interference in a judicial matter should be included in violation of integrity offences but found that this should not be the case.</p>
<p>In considering whether additional types of offences should be included in violation of integrity offences, our starting point was that the penalty provision should continue to cover violations that typically constitute a direct assault on personal integrity. The inquiry has also taken account of the new penal provision on unlawful harassment  (Chapter 4, Section 4b of the Swedish Penal Code), which focuses on offences involving repeated or systematic harassment of the same person and entered into force on 1 October 2011. The crime of unlawful harassment  has been modelled on violation of integrity offences and we have found that there is an interest in the offence lists of both offences being in agreement as far as possible. When considering whether the offence list for violation of integrity offences should be extended, the inquiry has therefore paid particular attention to whether a particular type of crime will be included in the new offence of unlawful harassment.</p>
<p>The scale of penalties for violation of integrity offences should not be changed</p>
<p>The scale of penalties for a crime must be designed in such a way as to allow an adequate assessment of the penal value. A violation of integrity offence may include acts of highly varied penal value. For example, several of the types of crime that may be included in violation of integrity offences carry fines in the scale of penalties and are of such a nature that the normal penalty is a fine or a short period of imprisonment if the crime is an individual occurrence and sometimes even in the case of repeated offences of the type in question. In our opinion the scale of penalties for violation of integrity offences is well-considered and we do not propose any amendment to it.</p>
<p>Statutory limitation of violation of integrity offences</p>
<p>The case-law review did not support the view that the provisions on statutory limitation have affected the types of offences that have been included in the violation of integrity offence, except in a few cases. Nor did it support the view that the statutory limitation provisions give rise to problems of application for the courts.</p>
<p>With violation of integrity offences, the starting point for calculating the statutory limitation period is the scale of penalties for the individual acts included in the violation of integrity offence. The inquiry has found that special statutory limitation provisions should not be introduced for violation of integrity offences.</p>
<h2>Arbitrary conduct concerning a child</h2>
<p>Under the current wording of the penal provision on arbitrary conduct concerning a child in Chapter 7, Section 4 of the Swedish Penal Code, the punishable act is differently formulated depending on whether the act is committed by a person who has joint custody of the child or by a person who does not have a share in custody. A person who does not have a share in custody who without authorisation separates a child from the person who has custody can be sentenced for arbitrary conduct concerning a child provided that the act does not constitute a crime against personal liberty (Chapter 7, Section 4, first paragraph, first sentence, Swedish Penal Code). While</p>
<p>the term without authorisation separates  comprises both removal and retention of the child, the liability of a person who has a share in the custody of the child is limited to removal. Thus, liability for arbitrary conduct concerning a child can, according to the penal provision, arise if a person who jointly with another person has custody of a child under fifteen years of age without good reason arbitrarily removes  the child (Chapter 7, Section 4, first paragraph, second sentence, Swedish Penal Code). If the removal was not unlawful, it is consequently not punishable as arbitrary conduct concerning a child if one of the persons who have custody of the child unlawfully retains the child with them.</p>
<p>The inquiry has found that criminal liability for arbitrary conduct concerning a child in cases of joint custody is not appropriately formulated. We propose that the penal provision is amended to also include situations where the child is arbitrarily retained without good reason by one of the persons who have custody.</p>
