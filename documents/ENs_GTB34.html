<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Terms of reference</h2>
<p>Under the terms of reference the Commission has two main tasks. In the first place an overall analysis is to be made of the long-term effects on consumers, the business community, the labour market and the economy in different parts of Sweden of the regulatory reforms made in the telecoms, electricity, postal, domestic aviation, taxi and railway markets. The evaluation is to describe trends in competition, prices and quality as well as service to the public.</p>
<p>In the second place, measures are to be proposed that can increase the positive effects of implemented regulatory reforms. According to the terms of reference, increased competition has changed the conditions governing co-operation between the public and private sectors. An analysis is to be made of the possibility of promoting technical progress, research and development through new cooperation models. The various expected effects of the proposals are also to be reported.</p>
<h2>Methodological problems</h2>
<p>The Regulatory Reform Commission uses key indicators to assess the effects of liberalisation. The key indicators that the Regulatory Reform Commission uses are partly from statistics compiled on behalf of the Commission and partly from earlier studies. The Regulatory Reform Commission has found relatively few studies that evaluate the liberalisations that have taken place. In addition, the quality of parts of the data compiled on behalf of the Commission is sometimes deficient. The Regulatory Reform Commission would therefore like to indicate lack of material as the greatest methodological problem. A formal and quantitative general equilibrium analysis of the effects of liberalisation has not been possible.</p>
<p>Instead the Commission has mainly made qualitative assessments. It is therefore very important to point out that the Commission is aware of this weakness in our method.</p>
<h2>What effects may liberalisation be expected to have?</h2>
<p>In assessing the effects of liberalisation it is important to have a clearly specified premise.</p>
<p>A possible and often used premise is a market without competition. The companies are monopolists and can set any price they want. Since the companies are assumed to maximise profit they will set the price that maximises profit. This means that prices will be higher and production less than in a market where there is competition. Since production is not at the level of social efficiency a socalled dead weight loss will arise. The profits that a profit-maximising monopoly can achieve as a consequence of the lack of competition are called monopoly profits. These monopoly profits can be divided between the owners and the employees. It is also possible that the lack of competition will instead mean that the company becomes inefficient, so-called X inefficiency.</p>
<p>Exposure to competition should lead to:</p>
<p>• a fall in prices, since companies that compete try to attract customers by offering lower prices for equivalent products</p>
<p>• increased production when demand increases as a result of lower prices</p>
<p>• increased productivity if the protection from competition entailed ineffective production</p>
<p>• falling wages if the employees shared in any monopoly profits</p>
<p>• an increased number of people employed if output rises as a result of lower prices, but a reduced number of people employed if the exposure to competition entailed streamlining of previously inefficient operations</p>
<p>• reduced profits if the owners shared in any monopoly profits</p>
<p>• increased investments if output increases but reduced investments if too much was previously invested</p>
<p>• more companies.</p>
<p>In practice it should not be assumed that the effects of liberalisation will be as clear as the simplified analysis above implies. The Commission wishes to particularly stress that the existence of economies of scale and different types of transaction costs is of great importance both to the effects of liberalisation and how it should best be carried out.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that different effects of the readjustments in different markets are to be expected, depending on the nature of the transaction cost. Additionally, effects of liberalisation will be different for buyers with a lot of information and low transaction costs than for buyers with little information and high transaction costs.</p>
<p>The liberalisations as a rule have changed the transaction costs for both consumers and companies and in many cases new transaction costs have arisen. Increased separation of the electricity market for example, has meant that consumers must meet more companies in order to consume a given product. In order to assess the effects of the liberalisations these increased transaction costs must be set against any positive effects for consumers and producers the liberalisations have brought.</p>
<h2>Why do markets not function?</h2>
<p>In practice, however, all markets do not function well; and what are usually described as market failures arise. These may lead to such things as lower output and higher prices.</p>
<p>In many cases market failures can be handled by means of various types of regulation. Regulation may, however, fail and entail costs or other less desirable effects.</p>
<p>In this context the effects of market power are of special interest. There are several different ways of handling market power. The best way is that entry into the market – or the mere threat of entering the market - will lead to the elimination of market power. Competition per se may in such a case be the force that disciplines the market.</p>
<p>In many markets such a mechanism may be expected to function well. However, several of the markets studied by the Commission – telecoms, electricity, postal and railway services – are mainly characterised by the fact that they are network industries with high entry costs. It appears to be less likely that the problems of market power would disappear entirely in such industries. It is true that liberalisation means that many decisions are left to the market players, but even after liberalisation various measures are required to counteract the utilisation of market power.</p>
<h2>Post liberalisation developments</h2>
<p>In the table below a summary is given of the trends for a number of key indicators in the respective markets</p>
<p>Table Summary of developments after liberalisation according to the Regulatory Reform Commission</p>
<p>The figure below presents the price trend in relation to the CPI for the years 1980-2004. In order to give comparability over time and between industries the effect of taxes has been excluded. If the prices in an industry excluding taxes had increased at the same rate as the average prices excluding taxes the index would have been 100. Of the industries examined, taking into account the entire period surveyed, only telecoms had a lower trend of price increases than the total net price index (NPI, which is CPI excluding taxes and subsidies). Consumer prices in the electricity sector decreased in relation to the NPI in the 1980s and 1990s, but in the period from 2000 to 2003 increased at a considerably faster rate. The railway, aviation, postal and taxi sectors have seen faster price increases than the NPI for the entire period. For the three latter sectors consumer prices increased in relation to the CPI only from the beginning of the 1990s. It is important to point out that the CPI measures a varying percentage of total consumption in the different markets.</p>
<p>Graph Price trend relative to the CPI, excluding tax</p>
<p>Index 1980=100</p>
<p>Sources: Statistics Sweden and own calculations.</p>
<p>Since the CPI only measures the price trend for a part of the market it must be supplemented by other price measurements to enable an assessment to be made of the total price trend. According to the Federation of County Councils the average price for healthcare related travel by taxi rose by about 30 percent between 1993 and 2003. The National Post and Telecom Agency, PTS, reckons that the price level for pre-sorted bulk mail fell by about 30 percent between the beginning of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s. According to Statistics Sweden’s analysis of list prices for business tickets by domestic aviation, these increased by 18 percent between 1996 and 2003. Electricity prices for industry increased by 37 percent between 1996 and 2004 according to the Swedish Energy Agency.</p>
<p>The productivity trend shows how much more is produced without changing the intermediate consumption. The most relevant measurement is total productivity, i.e. when consideration is given to the input of both labour and capital. There are, however, relatively few studies for the markets in question where any attempt has been made to measure total productivity.</p>
<p>According to Falkenhall and Kolmodin (2004) Posten AB’s labour productivity in letter production increased by about 30 percent between 1993 and 2000. According to SIKA, the Swedish Institute for Transport and Communications Analysis, the number of train kilometres produced per employee increased substantially in the railway sector in the 1990s. The increase in productivity, measured as the number of paid ton-kilometres per employee, has also been considerable for aviation.</p>
<p>Veiderpass (2004a and b) in two studies has examined productivity in the electricity supply industry before and after liberalisation. The studies show that there are distinct differences in productivity before and after liberalisation. In the period 1970-1995 total productivity fell on average by 16.9 percent, while in the period after the electricity market reform there was a productivity increase equivalent to 19 percent.</p>
<p>The Regulatory Reform Commission has compiled data from Statistics Sweden’s business database on trends in the number of companies on each respective market. It is important to point out that we do not look at the growth in numbers of companies in neighbouring industries that may also have been affected. As shown in the table below, the number of companies, according to this source, has increased in all sectors apart from the aviation sector.</p>
<p>Table Number of companies in the respective sectors in 1987 and 2002 and percentage change</p>
<p>Source: Analysis of Statistics Sweden’s statistics by the Swedish Institute for Growth Policy Studies, ITPS.</p>
<p>An indicator of the degree of competition in a market is the distribution of market share. In all the markets studied the three largest companies have a very high total market share. The predominant company in the industries examined has, with the exception of mobile telecom, a considerably higher market share than the next largest company. Apart from in the aviation market, however, the market share of the largest company decreased between the middle of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s, but it is important to point out that many airlines entered the market after 2001.</p>
<h2>The effects of liberalisation.</h2>
<p>The Regulatory Reform Commission has decided to mainly base its evaluation on social efficiency. It is, however, difficult to assess social efficiency. The Regulatory Reform Commission started from previous evaluations and supplemented them with indicators of social efficiency. The assessments are thus made more in the form of discussions around a number of important variables. The six industries we have been instructed to investigate are described below.</p>
<p>The electricity market</p>
<p>The electricity market reform meant that the vertically integrated elements of electricity generation, electricity trading and distribution were to a certain extent separated. Electricity generation and electricity trading were exposed to competition, while distribution remained a monopoly.</p>
<p>The company concentration decreased after liberalisation in that the local/regional monopolies in generation and sale of electricity were removed and the Nordic market was opened. After liberalisation the ownership structure, however, has become increasingly concentrated. The number of producers, network companies and companies trading in electricity have become fewer, mainly because the larger groups have bought up small and medium-sized companies. This trend was already taking shape before the reform and is not a direct consequence of liberalisation.</p>
<p>The price of electricity excluding tax for the final customers has risen in relation to the net price index. Since it has not been possible to separate the effect of liberalisation on electricity prices, above all from the hydrological effects, the Regulatory Reform Commission cannot assess whether electricity prices are higher or lower than would have been the case if the electricity market reform had not been implemented.</p>
<p>There are advantages and disadvantages of the present structure of the electricity market. The advantages are that the market has been opened to competition and that supervision of the monopoly has been strengthened, which are essential conditions for the market to be able to generate prices that distribute generation resources and electricity use as effectively as possible. The disadvantages are that the separation of the various components of the business has increased transaction costs for both customers and producers.</p>
<p>The Regulatory Reform Commission believes that the electricity market has not yet achieved its ultimate form but that the reforms carried out have contributed to a positive development. The Commission believes that it is neither possible nor desirable to return to the former market structure.</p>
<p>The Commission does not have sufficient reference data to be able to assess whether the present market structure is sufficiently satisfactory or whether the advantages of a further vertical separation outweigh the disadvantages. A first step towards strengthened competition is to tighten up the regulation of the network companies and above all the supervision of regional network companies. If this measure is not sufficient, the network companies should be fully separated from the operations that are exposed to competition.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the future electricity market is constructed, the Regulatory Reform Commission believes that it is probable that electricity prices will rise in the long term. The Nordic countries have the lowest electricity prices and integration with more countries will thus imply increased electricity prices.</p>
<p>The Regulatory Reform Commission believes that the government has a central role in strengthening the position of consumers in the markets in which they have an unequal relation with the producers. This is true of the electricity market and the Commission therefore makes proposals that strengthen the position of household customers when entering into agreements, when there is a time lag in settling electricity bills and when there is an electricity supply failure. These proposals are presented in the section on consumer protection later in the summary.</p>
<p>The Energy Agency is to supervise all networks but in practice has mainly supervised the local networks and to a very small extent (if at all) supervised the transmission and grid tariffs. The Regulatory Reform Commission considers it very important that all networks are supervised. Later in the summary we submit a proposal that the independence of the part of the Energy Agency that regulates distribution should be strengthened and that it should be transformed into an independent authority.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the Commission more transmission capacity is needed between Sweden and other countries in order to create a more efficient electricity market. This is needed both to increase competition and to reduce the need for reserve capacity. But there are objections to this solution. We would like to point out that the Regulatory Reform Commission has not had access to estimates that show how socially efficient an expansion would be.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether more transmission capacity is built or not, the need to monitor concentration at the power generation level remains. Increased monitoring of developments by the competition authorities is therefore needed, as well as clearer requirements as regards mergers and acquisitions of companies.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the intention was to integrate the Nordic electricity generation markets, no Nordic supervisory institutions have yet been created. Co-operation between the Nordic supervisory authorities is limited. Increased co-operation between the Nordic supervisory authorities and harmonisation of the regulatory framework would strengthen the monitoring of competition in the electricity market.</p>
<p>Domestic aviation</p>
<p>The international aviation market is at present undergoing rapid transformation. This of course is also having an effect on the Swedish domestic aviation market. The old flag-carriers are experiencing major economic problems while so-called low price companies are taking an increasing share of the market. Since the market is undergoing rapid transformation it is difficult to draw conclusions as to the effects of liberalisation, even though it has probably played a decisive role in many of the processes now taking place.</p>
<p>Liberalisation of the aviation market meant that obstacles to entry into the Swedish domestic aviation market decreased. Even though at first companies entered the market, SAS was able after a couple of years to strengthen its position in the domestic market instead. In recent years, however, competition has again increased.</p>
<p>It is difficult to describe the price trend in the aviation market after liberalisation. It is not given that competition entails lower prices, since companies can choose to compete on quality rather than price. In Sweden, however, most companies that have tried to enter the domestic aviation market have competed on price rather than quality, with one important exception, Malmö Aviation. Few companies have been able to survive, however, and their price level may thus only be regarded as sustainable in the short term.</p>
<p>When the aviation market was liberalised SAS held a dominant position and this made it necessary to enable entry on equal terms in order to create competition. Since SAS was partly state-owned this made heavy demands on the regulatory framework and supervision of the market. Government monitoring of the market is needed by the Swedish Civil Aviation Authority and the Swedish Competition Authority and the available rules must be used to prevent abuse of a dominant position.</p>
<p>Railways</p>
<p>The Regulatory Reform Commission considers that the separation of the formerly undifferentiated Swedish State Railways, SJ, into the National Rail Administration, which maintains the railway network, and carriers, who operate the traffic, has had a positive effect on developments in the railway sector. The Commission considers that the productivity improvement that has taken place to a certain extent can be attributed to the division and the increased clarity of roles that ensued from it.</p>
<p>The reform of the railway market was carried out in stages and the market is today only partly liberalised. Market entry for goods traffic is in principle free, but for passenger traffic, SJ has the sole right to business that the company considers can be run at a profit. Other passenger traffic is procured by the National Public Transport Agency (interregional traffic) and the regional transport authorities (regional and local traffic).</p>
<p>The existence of competition in the tendering procedure for traffic business has also had a positive effect on the railway market. The available information indicates lower costs for the contracting entities and that the additional players in the market have contributed to developing traffic and making it more effective.</p>
<p>The prices of railway journeys have increased considerably faster than the general price trend. It should be noted that the price measurement includes both business procured through a competitive tendering procedure and business carried on by SJ under exclusive rights. Large parts of the price measurement therefore refer to business that is not exposed to competition.</p>
<p>The price increases may to a certain extent be explained by the fact that high-speed train traffic using the X2000 was introduced during the period. The X2000 is a new product with shorter travelling time, which is partly aimed at new customer categories. On certain routes there is competition with the airlines and the pricing has been affected by this. Price differentiation on the total range of railway services has also increased.</p>
<p>For regional traffic the price increase may to some extent be attributed to the fact that the regional transport authorities’ subsidies have decreased. As a consequence of strained finances some regional transport authorities in recent years have decided to raise ticket prices and reduce the degree of subsidy in the business procured.</p>
<p>A general problem in the sector is the very weak profitability for the operators. This applies both to the dominant companies and the new players in the market. Weak profitability, which is also found in the rest of Europe, according to the Commission, is a very important experience of the period after liberalisation. It is true that weak profitability already existed before liberalisation, but the new allocation of roles in the sector and the way of steering the state operators is based on an assumption that the earnings capacity of the operators is on a level with other players in the transport market.</p>
<p>The reform process in the railway sector has been carried out in stages and over a relatively long period of time.</p>
<p>The gradual implementation of liberalisation has been a disadvantage as regards the availability of so-called common functions in the sector. SJ for example, retained ownership and control over stations and terminals for a long time, despite the fact that the market had been opened to new players. Similarly, the decisions on allocation of capacity and the operative traffic routing remained for a time under SJ. This was probably unfair to or deterred new players in the market. Certain maintenance and service functions also remained with the dominant players, which led to deficient competition in the market for services in the sector.</p>
<p>The Regulatory Reform Commission has made a number of observations in the railway sector in the course of its work which we believe should be given attention in framing future railway policy.</p>
<p>• SJ’s exclusive right to profitable passenger traffic should be defined more precisely and linked to certain conditions regarding scope and content of the traffic.</p>
<p>• Decisions on infrastructure investments should be more clearly linked to macroeconomic benefit.</p>
<p>• Economic incentives should to a greater extent be included in the agreements between the National Rail Administration and the operators.</p>
<p>Postal services</p>
<p>In the postal market the substitute competition from other forms of communication has increased in the period after liberalisation. This makes it difficult to differentiate between the effects of liberalisation and the effects of technological development.</p>
<p>The Regulatory Reform Commission believes that the existence of competition has had a positive effect on the letter market. Since CityMail is the only significant competitor to Posten AB on the letter market CityMail’s market entry has thus been of major importance to the development of competition. Since the regulatory framework was not clear before liberalisation, liberalisation has probably played a decisive role in allowing CityMail to establish itself in the letter market.</p>
<p>The Regulatory Reform Commission believes that the rebalancing of the price structure that has taken place has meant increased efficiency, since prices have become fairer, but that the price differences between the parts of the letter market exposed to competition and those not exposed to competition are remarkably large.</p>
<p>The Regulatory Reform Commission is of the opinion that increased competition has put pressure on Posten AB to improve the efficiency of its operations. The number of letters forwarded per employee in Posten AB increased substantially between 1993 and 2000 and this increase can be mainly attributed to the liberalisation of the postal market and the conversion of the Post Office into an independent company. Posten AB now processes about the same number of items of mail with considerably fewer employees, which indicates that the previous number of employees was high in relation to the workload.</p>
<p>After the liberalisation of the letter market many new companies entered the market, at the peak there were over 100 companies licensed to carry on postal business activities. However, only one company has succeeded in establishing a relatively large-scale operation. Since there are no legal obstacles to entry into the part of the market where Posten is at present the only company, using another definition the letter market can be said to be entirely exposed to competition. The same applies if substitute competition is taken into consideration.</p>
<p>The Regulatory Reform Commission considers that the need for sector-specific legislation was underestimated at the time of liberalisation. The fact that the old regulatory code was abolished before a new one was ready may be criticised, but under the circumstances prevailing it seems to have been necessary. The fact that the 1994 Postal Services Act contained no provisions governing access to postal infrastructure proved subsequently to be a misjudgement of the possibilities of achieving functioning competition without sector-specific rules for the postal market.</p>
<p>The government could have more actively ensured that Posten AB set a good example as regards not abusing the company's dominant position in the market.</p>
<p>The Commission submits the following proposal as regards the postal market.</p>
<p>• Separate Svensk Kassaservice from Posten.</p>
<p>• Give PTS (the National Post and Telecom Agency) the right to terminate unutilised licenses for carrying on postal business activities.</p>
<p>• Posten’s price ceiling should be retained but reformed.</p>
<p>• An investigation should be made as to whether it would imply a financial burden for Posten to supply universal services, how great this burden would in that case be and how it should be financed.</p>
<p>• Adjust the quality requirements imposed on Posten to a level closer to the actual level.</p>
<p>• PTS should be given a competition promoting role in the postal market.</p>
<p>• Introduce provisions in the Postal Services Act concerning forwarding.</p>
<p>• PTS should publish an annual report as to whether Posten’s prices for universal services are  cost-based.</p>
<p>• PTS should draw up a method in collaboration with Statistics Sweden to follow the price trend for the entire letter market.</p>
<p>Taxi services</p>
<p>The Regulatory Reform Commission considers that the more substantial increase in prices for taxi journeys compared with the NPI can mainly be explained by the fact that the costs of production of taxi services has increased more than the general price trend. Since 1993, however, prices have increased in total more than production costs (measured as a taxi index).</p>
<p>The Regulatory Reform Commission believes that the reason for the increased prices over and above the cost increases is mainly that the product has changed. Many taxi customers attach a high value to the waiting time and reduced waiting times therefore provided scope for higher prices. Reduced waiting time requires more cars and thus fewer journeys per car, which must be compensated by higher prices.</p>
<p>The prices of private individuals’ taxi journeys have increased at a faster rate compared with the county councils’ taxi journeys. This can probably be explained by the fact that private individuals’ taxi journeys were previously subsidised. Before liberalisation even those who procured large volumes had to pay the same price per journey as private individuals who made few journeys. If the costs of producing state-financed and private journeys respectively are different, differentiated prices will imply increased efficiency.</p>
<p>The previous regulation seems to have kept wages at a level that did not reflect labour supply and demand in the taxi market. Liberalisation therefore meant reduced incomes for those employed in the taxi sector. Wages have also been forced down by increased problems of illegal activities in the taxi business. This pressure does not, however, entail an adjustment to the correct wage level.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the regulators underestimated and misjudged the transition problems and inconvenience that liberalisation would involve, in particular as regards the customer’s position in relation to the producers and the lack of competition on equal terms. The Regulatory Reform Commission considers that the decision-makers’ actions to rectify the problems arising after liberalisation were far too passive and long drawn-out.</p>
<p>There is no authority that has the overall responsibility for following developments in the taxi market. This has meant that knowledge of market conditions and development of competition in the taxi market is deficient. The Regulatory Reform Commission believes that in a recently liberalised market there must be an authority that has the main responsibility for following market developments. The taxi market is a clear example of this need.</p>
<p>The Commission submits the following proposal as regards the taxi market.</p>
<p>• In order to enhance competition there is a need for better order in the taxi market as regards reporting of incomes.</p>
<p>The telecommunications market</p>
<p>The telecoms market has successively developed from an unregulated monopoly to the present legally regulated market which is increasingly exposed to competition. The increased competition is explained to a large extent by the transition from a business controlled by the government through Swedish Telecom to a market where state companies are subject to the same regulatory code as all other market players.</p>
<p>Developments in the past twenty years are, however, to a great extent also a result of technical progress and increasing internationalisation of the market. Successive rule changes have therefore often been a reaction to the fact that such changes in the business environment brought about a change in conditions and new opportunities in the market.</p>
<p>It is not really possible to separate the effects of technical progress from the effects of liberalisation. The Regulatory Reform Commission believes, however, that the regulatory system contributed to the emergence of competition and that it thus had positive effects on the telecoms market.</p>
<p>By means of the Telecommunications Act, which imposed stricter requirements on dominant players, the market has gradually been opened to new players through such things as toughening up the right of access to others' telecommunications networks. The steering of the telecoms market towards liberalisation and increased competition has taken place mainly through successive government regulation of the players’ behaviour. In that the regulatory code imposed more stringent requirements on dominant players than on others, small and newly established players have been able to assert themselves and survive to greater strength. Between 1990 and 2002 the number of companies on the market increased from 49 to 293.</p>
<p>As regards prices, there is for example a lot to indicate that changes in the rules had an effect. Firstly through a tightening up of the Telecommunications Act in 1997 PTS (the National Post and Telecom Agency) was able to actively intervene and determine interconnection conditions for fixed telephony, above all as regards interconnection rates, which meant that more interconnection contracts could be made and that the interconnection rates fell considerably.</p>
<p>The measure that in addition probably had the greatest significance for opening up competition in the market for fixed telephony is the so-called pre-selection reform, completed in 2002.</p>
<p>The increased competition meant that Telia could not continue to cross-subsidise in fixed telephony, for example between local calls and long-distance calls. The rebalancing of the price structure that took place brought increased effectiveness because prices became fairer. This should also have led to better adaptation and development of the service offering.</p>
<p>On the mobile market the changed rules were not as successful. The consumer prices in Sweden are relatively high in comparison with the other Nordic countries and are at about the OECD average.</p>
<p>In the telecoms area there are now more networks in addition to Telia’s nationwide fixed network. In particular the mobile networks that have come into existence have taken a growing and now considerable share of the telecoms market. Even if a large proportion of telecommunications requires the use of Telia's fixed network, there is competition not only between service-providing operators, but also between infrastructure alternatives.</p>
<p>But access to the access network also gives Telia advantages in other and new parts of the market. Telia still has a unique position in the market because the company is alone in having a fixed access network that reaches all permanent dwellings and business establishments in the country.</p>
<p>There is all reason to assume that liberalisation has contributed to the substantial increase in productivity in the telecoms sector. Above all the increased competition should have put pressure on Telia to improve the efficiency of its operations. It is, however, difficult to determine what are the effects of technical development and what are the effects of liberalisation.</p>
<p>A clear lesson from the development of the Swedish telecoms market is that in a network industry more advanced institutional support may be required than in other industries in order for competition to really function. It seems, however, as though the legislator imagined when the Telecommunications Act came into existence that on this market it would be sufficient to rely on the regulatory codes in the form of contractual, company and competition law that make up the general basis of trade and competition. Subsequently this proved to be wrong, especially in two respects – protection against monopoly pricing  and rules for interconnection .</p>
<p>Consideration was also given to separating responsibility for the copper access network from other telephony in a separate company or authority in a similar way as applied at the same time to the railway and electricity industries.</p>
<p>One assessment is that such a separation would have made the emergence of competition easier, particularly for fixed telephony in 1993–1997, and perhaps would also have had some impact on developments as regards broadband/ADSL. In both cases the competing companies encountered a ”price squeeze” in which Telia squeezed the margins between the price of semi-finished products (access to the access network and/or ADSL) and the price to consumers.</p>
<p>The arguments for vertical separation of Telia Sonera AB still remain. At the same time the conditions for such a separation have been made more difficult by the company having been listed on the stock exchange. It is not possible to assess the costs and consequences of such a separation.</p>
<p>The relatively slow rate at which certain reforms have been implemented could be criticised.</p>
<p>Ambitions for a high degree of accessibility in connection with the allocation of frequency licences also risk limiting the market.</p>
<p>The Commission submits the following proposal as regards the telecommunications market.</p>
<p>• The government should set up an inquiry to investigate and make proposals for measures that can improve efficiency of procedure and reduce the time taken for a PTS decision to gain legal force after appeal.</p>
<p>• PTS should be instructed to develop price monitoring of the telecoms market.</p>
<p>• The government should appoint a special committee of inquiry to submit proposals on how Sweden is to achieve an economically more effective spectrum use through a system with more  market-controlled spectrum allocation.</p>
<h2>Regulation and regulatory authorities</h2>
<p>The so-called Chicago school was critical at an early stage to the assumption that it was possible to achieve effective regulation. Stigler (1971) pointed out the following: “The central tasks of the theory of economic regulation are to explain who will receive the benefits or burdens of regulation, what form regulation will take and the effect of regulation upon the allocation of resources”.</p>
<p>The starting point was empirical studies that showed that a regulated industry was not more efficient than an unregulated industry and that the prices were not lower.</p>
<p>There is a choice between the so-called Chicago school, which leaves markets to fend for themselves without the supervision of regulatory institutions, and a more regulation-friendly school.</p>
<p>The extremities in this context can be described as on the one hand the state only guaranteeing basic ownership rights and legal security, and on the other the state taking on the entire responsibility for building and running infrastructures.</p>
<p>The Regulatory Reform Commission considers that strong institutions will always be required in relation to markets for infrastructure services. We believe, however, that there are good reasons for the government to consider the Chicago school’s objections to the possibility of effectively regulating network markets. This applies above all to the conditions governing regulatory authorities.</p>
<p>The regulatory institutions have not developed at the same rate as markets have been liberalised and the role of the state has decreased. Experience from the financial markets shows that the significance of powerful regulatory bodies for creating sound markets has been underestimated. Liberalisation is still in its infancy, and its success will depend on the degree of autonomy and power of the institutions that develop. If the regulators are strengthened there is less chance for special interests to influence them. Special interests, however, vary in strength and effectiveness and a market can be vulnerable if the special interests do not balance out each other. Rules are also needed to achieve equality between buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>Regulation in Sweden is, in the opinion of the Commission, relatively weak. One reason for this may be our weak tradition for this type of regulation, for example in comparison with the USA. Another reason is the organisation of the authorities and the tasks they have been allocated by the Riksdag (Swedish parliament) and the government. Several of the regulation authorities are small. The duties of the authorities vary considerably. There are relatively large variations between how the various markets are regulated. None of the authorities seem to be a pure government agency, their tasks vary considerably.</p>
<p>Authorities must be independent</p>
<p>In the opinion of the Commission strong, separate and independent regulatory authorities are often a condition for successful liberalisation. By independent is not meant independent of political decisions. We mean that independence involves applying statutes and regulations objectively and impartially. The authority should be fully responsible for decisions and measures within the framework of its given mandate. The Riksdag and the government should also continue to regulate operations through statutes and regulations in the sense of clarifying which decisions the authorities may make (of course not how the authorities should decide on individual issues).</p>
<p>Strengthen the independence of the heads of the authorities</p>
<p>Those who head the government authorities are at present subject to the same conditions as other directors general. In the opinion of the Commission there is reason to discuss strengthened job security for certain heads of regulatory authorities. The reason for this is that the authorities that the Commission is analysing in many cases have a significant responsibility for standard-setting. Their decisions affect millions of consumers, major asset values and in certain cases considerable future investments. They may also have credibility problems, since in most of the industries there are very large and strong state interests. In the areas being examined by the Commission it is also true that the latter interests and authorities are responsible to the same ministry.</p>
<p>A regulator in theory must be all-knowing, benevolent and able to be bound in advance to a code of practice. In practice such a form of regulator is less probable. A strong head of an authority may, however, as shown above, affect many different interests. In order to facilitate effective decision-making and future career paths it is therefore necessary to improve security of employment. Such strengthened security of employment must also be linked to clear accountability procedures. The premise is, however, that it is the government that appoints the heads of the authorities.</p>
<p>Strengthen the clarity of roles</p>
<p>There is a risk that the organisation of government regulatory authorities will lead to credibility problems. The authorities that the Commission is analysing are all under the Ministry of Industry, Employment and Communication. At the same time the ministry has owner responsibility for a number of dominant players in the markets being examined by this Commission. Thus the government is both regulator and owner of companies with a decisive influence over the infrastructure that is of significance for competition in the markets. In addition, the administration of the regulatory authorities takes place in an environment that handles sectoral policy and competition issues. One way of isolating the regulatory function may be to gather the regulatory authorities under one ministry without specialised responsibility for the areas in which the companies/utilities operate.</p>
<p>Increase transparency</p>
<p>In the opinion of the Commission transparency needs to be increased. Increased transparency is also a further way to strengthen the regulatory authorities and increase independence. Above all in the sense that discussions concerning regulatory risks and taking over regulatory controls can be analysed in a more independent way. There may also be a tendency towards irreversible regulatory control. The authorities are constantly seeking new tasks to justify their activities. One way of influencing the above-mentioned problems is to expose the regulatory authorities to systematic and recurring evaluation.</p>
<p>Other comments</p>
<p>There are also other deficiencies in regulation and supervision. Certain of the markets being examined by the Commission are not subject to supervision or regulation despite the existence of monopolistic enterprises.</p>
<p>In comparison with sector-specific regulators, competition authorities, by virtue of their collective knowledge, experience and institutional culture, seem to be better suited to handle questions concerning protection of fair competition. For the same reason sector-specific regulators seem better suited than competition authorities to handle economic regulation. Such regulation is by its nature continuous rather than periodical and is based to a large extent on sector-specific knowledge. This is not, however, as obvious when it comes to regulation of entry.</p>
<p>The Regulatory Reform Commission believes that it is not just interest groups outside the political system who may have an interest in a certain type of regulation; consideration must also be given to the structure and function of the political system. There is a political economy that determines how liberalised markets will be regulated. There are interests that influence both the liberalisation process and the relation between the regulators and the regulated companies.</p>
<p>The Commission submits the following proposal as regards regulation and regulatory authorities.</p>
<p>• The independence of the part of the energy agency that regulates distribution should be strengthened and it should be transformed into an independent authority.</p>
<p>• The new authority should be financed by direct charges. The government should consider whether such a form of financing should also include the newly formed Swedish Rail Agency.</p>
<p>• Heads of government authorities that mainly handle regulatory and supervisory issues should have stronger independence and augmented security of employment. The Commission’s proposal applies to the heads of the Swedish Rail Agency, the Swedish Competition Authority, the Swedish Civil Aviation Authority, the National Post and Telecom Agency and a possible independent part of the energy agency.</p>
<p>• The National Post and Telecom Agency, the Swedish Rail Agency, the Swedish Civil Aviation Authority and a possible independent part of the energy agency should be placed under the Ministry of Justice.</p>
<p>• The regulatory authorities should be subject to systematic and recurring evaluation.</p>
<p>• A committee should be instructed to review the regulatory and supervisory authorities in the six industries being examined in this report.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Competition Authority should be annually commissioned to analyse SJ AB, the National Rail Administration and Svenska Kraftnät (national grid) since the extent of supervision of these is relatively small.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Competition Authority should be annually commissioned to report on the function of regulatory control within the taxi industry and to analyse the competition situation in the industry.</p>
<h2>The state’s corporate governance</h2>
<p>The state is Sweden’s largest company owner. Most of these companies operate in markets where the state-owned company holds a dominant market position. In most of the industries examined in this report state-owned companies also have a decisive influence over the infrastructure that is of significance for competition in the markets. This applies particularly to the infrastructure that acts as a bottleneck for the entire market.</p>
<p>The state – in its capacity of both regulator and owner of the dominant player – has an integrated and unique possibility to work towards a market development with increased competition and effective utilisation of resources.</p>
<p>A number of operations are natural monopolies and for that reason are state-owned. They may also be state-owned because the government wishes to achieve objectives that are not purely commercial, for example to promote a particular public interest. The Commission considers that more effective corporate governance in state-owned utilities and enterprises will contribute actively to increased economic efficiency.</p>
<p>Strengthen the ownership function in the Government Offices and increase clarity of roles</p>
<p>Increased competition is not the only means to achieve more effective operations in the areas covered by this report. If liberalisation is to lead to both higher economic efficiency and better achievement of social goals, corporate governance should be strengthened. Key factors are more effective evaluation of targets set and clearer accountability procedures. This assumes in turn clarity of roles and transparency for a more effective evaluation of the companies.</p>
<p>In our opinion, there is an evident risk of uncertainty and ill-defined roles in the government’s ownership organisation. In effect there are three strong objections to the present organisation.</p>
<p>• A very strong objection is that both the regulatory authorities and the companies subject to regulation and/or supervision are within one and the same ministry. This is very pronounced for the industries analysed in the report.</p>
<p>• Another strong objection is that the ministry handles policy areas in which many of the government owned companies operate. This applies mainly to companies that are subject to commercial profitability requirements and that operate in an environment exposed to competition.</p>
<p>• A third objection is that the Ministry of Industry, Employment and Communication is also responsible for competition issues that are to be handled in parallel with ownership issues in stateowned companies.</p>
<p>In our opinion these objections indicate considerable conflicts of role and interest that may weaken the owner role and also reduce credibility in other areas. In the assessment of the Commission a more integrated ownership function should be created, which is associated with the Swedish Government Offices. The function should be kept separate from the regular organisation in the Government Offices to reduce obvious conflicts of role and interest.</p>
<p>There are several conceivable alternatives as regards strengthening the ownership function. For example the ownership function could be integrated for all state companies and public utilities in a ministry without specialised responsibility for the areas in which the companies/utilities operate, or else a special ministry could be set up for state corporate governance.</p>
<p>However, we have instead considered the establishment of one or more state holding companies in order to make corporate governance more effective. A disadvantage of such a solution is, however, the control function: Who will watch the watchman?</p>
<p>All models have their advantages and disadvantages, and the Commission cannot make any decision as to the alternatives presented above. We submit a proposal, however, that the ownership function in the Government Offices should be strengthened and isolated.</p>
<p>Develop the goals of state-owned companies</p>
<p>In the assessment of the Commission the present ownership organisation leads to several problems. The dual targets – achieving economic efficiency and social goals – often cause problems. Control models for state-owned operations cannot be simply transferred from private commercial business operations.</p>
<p>There are often goals that are not effectively evaluated. This may apply to public enterprise, such as SJ whose profitability targets have not been achieved for long periods. This seldom entails any consequences for the board of directors and management. The present economic evaluation is not fully credible, since in practice no requirements are imposed to achieve the profitability targets set. At the same time a company’s management may understand implicit goals on the part of the owner, since state-owned companies handle operations that work in segments where both economic and political goals are to be achieved.</p>
<p>State enterprises often have an objective function that is different from private commercial operations. For that reason it is not always appropriate to have goals concerning shareholder value, which owners of companies listed on the stock exchange, for example, may have in their objective function. Shareholder value is not an appropriate premise when the purpose of owning the companies is other than financial. In addition, most of the state-owned companies are not listed on the stock exchange, and therefore it may be difficult to assess their real value. It is, however, possible to get an idea of the value via company valuation models.</p>
<p>Many of the state-owned companies/utilities operate within both legal and natural monopoly areas, as well as in competition with other companies. However, no explicit goals for the various operations are set, but the goals seem to apply to the company’s/utility’s entire operation. This may lead to distortion of competition and faulty allocation of resources. The governance policy, for example the required return, in the opinion of the Commission, should be adapted to the fact that the operations are carried on under fundamentally different market and competition conditions.</p>
<p>State-owned companies often have ambiguous clauses as regards the purpose of the company. We propose clear and realistic profitability targets that are supplemented by operational objectives such as customer satisfaction, availability or timeliness. These goals are not financial and reflect what the owner wishes to achieve with the operations. In many cases there are no such goals or else they are unclear. If the social goals of the companies are established and/or clarified a higher degree of transparency will be achieved.</p>
<p>Further, it is not appropriate to use portfolio theory when managing state-owned companies. Companies that are managed as though they are part of a portfolio assume that the principals are considering selling or buying companies from or to the portfolio in the foreseeable future. When the principal instead intends to retain the companies for a very long time, almost in perpetuity, it is not fruitful to have an ordinary portfolio theory approach. It is reasonable for the government to speak of a company group instead of thinking in terms of portfolios, and the Commission has noticed impulses towards changes in this direction.</p>
<p>Increase transparency</p>
<p>It is important that citizens/owners can obtain information as to goals and results in the state-owned companies. The goals may often be multiple, unclear and incomplete. Several of the Commission’s proposals, such as the ownership function and goal formulation, concern increased transparency.</p>
<p>Competition issues</p>
<p>The government is responsible for competition policy, but in the opinion of the Commission it also has a further important and more direct role as owner of the companies/utilities that own the infrastructure that functions as a bottleneck for the entire market. The Commission has not had the opportunity to analyse the need for further rules for the state-owned companies. We would like to see, however, that competition issues are given greater weight in the government’s ownership policy and that the requirements concerning the companies’ information on this issue are increased.</p>
<p>According to the Commission, the government should also analyse the liberalisation process more stringently. The background is of course the dominance of the state-owned companies in most of the markets that have been liberalised.</p>
<p>The Commission submits the following proposals as regards state corporate governance.</p>
<p>• Strengthen the ownership function in the Government Offices.</p>
<p>• The goals of  state-owned companies should be made more visible, clear and measurable. There should be a clear breakdown and specification of goals for monopoly operations and operations carried on in competition with others.</p>
<p>• The goals for companies with special public interests should be developed. This also applies to following up the operations.</p>
<p>• Combine the government’s ownership policy in a special document.</p>
<p>• A general competition neutrality policy should be introduced in the government’s overall ownership policy for  state-owned companies and public utilities.</p>
<p>• The government should report on the liberalisation process every year in a communication to the Riksdag.</p>
<h2>Consumer protection</h2>
<p>The customer in network industries has a special relation to the supplier. It is often difficult for the customer to change networks. They are strongly dependent on electrical cables, railway tracks or telephony networks. One of the Commission's observations is the pronounced inequality that prevails in the relationship between customer and producer in the network industries. This is an argument for strong regulatory codes in the interest of the customer but also so that public monopolies can incorporate customer goals such as availability into their goal functions.</p>
<p>In various contexts it has been reported that one consequence of how liberalisation has been carried out in the electricity and telecoms markets is that it has given rise to certain deficiencies in consumer protection. By consumers is meant in this context private individuals who acquire or otherwise secure a product, service or other utility mainly for private purposes.</p>
<p>It is true that there are rules for consumer protection in both the Electricity Act and the Act on Electronic Communications. The legal regulation is in this respect more developed in the Act on Electronic Communications than it is in the Electricity Act and concerns the formulation of agreements and the information the business operator must have supplied to the consumer before entering into the agreement. The Electricity Act on the other hand only gives augmented protection to consumers in certain specific and limited situations.</p>
<p>In relation to the provisions of more general consumer legislation such as the Consumer Sales Act and the Consumer Services Act, however, consumers, particularly in the electricity market, have a weaker position than is normally the case when a consumer enters into an agreement with a business operator for a product, service or other utility. Considering that the services and utilities supplied in the markets concerned here constitute so-called public utility services, it should be possible to impose even higher requirements as regards the legal protection of consumers in these contexts. Moreover, there is no reason for not allowing the level of legal protection to be equally high on both these markets.</p>
<p>The deficiencies as regards consumer protection legislation that the Swedish Consumer Agency among others has called attention to concern three main areas where there is a danger that the inferior position of consumers may be exploited in these markets. This applies partly to the circumstances at the time the agreement is entered into, where the companies could exploit the consumer's inferior knowledge, partly to the companies' deficient customer handling and partly the consumers’ difficulties in establishing a procedure for settling disputes.</p>
<p>In order to rectify these problems the Regulatory Reform Commission proposes the following:</p>
<p>The electricity market</p>
<p>• The Electricity Act should impose requirements on how an agreement between an electricity company and a consumer should be formulated and the information on the terms of the agreement that the consumer should have access to.</p>
<p>• The supervision in the electricity market should be strengthened, which entails making electricity suppliers subject to the control of the part of the Energy Agency that regulates distribution.</p>
<p>• The power distribution companies should be obliged in their choice of referral supplier to be open,  non-discriminatory and market-oriented.</p>
<p>• The consumers should be given the possibility of depositing a disputed amount with the county administrative board.</p>
<p>• A special shorter period of limitation should be introduced for standardised calculation of electricity consumption.</p>
<p>The telecoms market</p>
<p>• The consumers should be given the possibility of depositing a disputed amount with the county administrative board.</p>
<p>Proposals common to the electricity and telecoms markets</p>
<p>• A joint government advice bureau for the electricity and telecommunications markets should be set up. Consumers should be able to consult this bureau with questions and for advice on how a dispute with a telecoms company or electricity company should be settled.</p>
<h2>Experiences of the liberalisation process</h2>
<p>According to the Regulatory Reform Commission the most important experiences that can be drawn from liberalisation of the markets dealt with by the Commission are as follows:</p>
<p>• Do not have unreasonable expectations as to results. Many factors affect the development of a market over time and some markets have characteristics that make it difficult to get them to function well.</p>
<p>• Liberalisation entails both costs and revenue. Regulatory changes create transaction costs, which must be set against the revenues of a liberalisation.</p>
<p>• A liberalisation affects more parts of the economy than just those that are directly affected by the regulatory change.</p>
<p>• There is a need for clear goals for liberalised markets. Citizens must be able to evaluate whether the policy goals and instruments used are leading to the desired results.</p>
<p>• Liberalisation does not necessarily reduce the need for regulation. As a rule it is not possible for competition to arise without some form of market regulation. This applies particularly if some part of the market is a natural monopoly.</p>
<p>• State ownership cannot be ignored. Since the state owns the largest companies in the sectors covered by this report, in its regulation of the markets examined the state is primarily influencing its own activities.</p>
<p>• Do not underestimate the need for consumer support. Since all regulatory changes have distribution effects various players will have an interest in influencing the regulatory process. As a rule it is more difficult for consumer interests than for producer interests to mobilise.</p>
<p>• An earlier market opening will have consequences. In most of the liberalised markets Sweden has been one of the first countries to open the markets examined to competition.</p>
<p>• The difficulty of evaluating. The greatest problem for the Regulatory Reform Commission has been the lack of information on developments in the liberalised markets.</p>
