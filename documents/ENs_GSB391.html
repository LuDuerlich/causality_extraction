<p>Background</p>
<p>For a long time now, the rents for residential dwellings have been determined in accordance with the principle of utility value in cases where the matter is brought before the rent tribunal as the result of</p>
<p>a dispute. This principle means that a rent should be determined following a comparison with apartments that are equivalent to the apartment in question. When this comparison is made, the rent tribunal primarily takes into consideration the rent for such apartments as are owned by municipal housing companies (the public housing sector).</p>
<p>Another important element of the system for determining rents is the system of collective negotiation, whereby most residential rents in Sweden are decided by means of an agreement between, on the one hand, an organisation representing tenants (“Hyresgästföreningen,” for example) and, on the other hand, the individual landlord.</p>
<p>The task of the committee has been to consider certain changes to the regulations for determining residential rents. The startingpoint has been that if any changes are implemented, they should be done so within the framework of the utility value system. It has therefore not been the brief of the committee to implement any fundamental changes to the system of establishing rents.</p>
<p>The task was to address the following four questions:</p>
<p>• Should special regulations be implemented to determine the rents for apartments in  newly-constructed buildings?</p>
<p>• Should the regulations be changed so that it will be easier to adjust rents in accordance with the utility value in the current stock of apartments? Should it be possible to have different rents in the same building for exiting tenants and those who have just moved in?</p>
<p>• Should it be made easier for tenants, by choosing or rejecting options, to make individual variations to their apartments?</p>
<p>• Should any changes be made to the regulations for making comparisons in the utility value system? Are there grounds for drawing up more detailed regulations concerning the way decisions are justified by rent tribunals when settling rent issues?</p>
<p>The rents for newly-built apartments</p>
<p>A person who is contemplating the building of an apartment block cannot always be sure that the rental income will cover the production costs if the matter is to be decided in accordance with the utility value principle. This problem is particularly noticeable,</p>
<p>not only in places where the public housing sector is not building new dwellings, but also in a situation where costs for the construction of new dwellings are increasing. It is possible that this lack of predictability might be a contributory factor to the fact that an insufficient number of new properties for rent are being built.</p>
<p>The committee proposes that the rent for a newly-built residential apartment, if it has been determined by means of a collective agreement, should be exempt from being determined in accordance with the utility principle for a period of ten years from the time that the first tenant gains access to the apartment, unless there are particular reasons to decide otherwise. The principal rule should therefore be that the rent agreed upon should be valid for ten years, if it has been decided as part of a negotiated settlement between a landlord and a tenants’ association and the settlement has been reached prior to the rental agreement.</p>
<p>This does not apply to the rebuilding of existing rental apartments. Neither does it apply to that part of the rent that constitutes compensation to the tenants’ association for the work of negotiation it has carried out. Moreover, it should be possible to change the rent during this ten-year period, if this is reasonable with respect to the general changes in rent levels in the area in question, or with respect to the choices made by the tenant with regard to choosing or rejecting options.</p>
<p>As has been stated above, the principal rule is that rent decided by a collective agreement should be exempt from being examined in accordance with the utility principle, unless there are particular reasons to decide otherwise. By “particular reasons” is meant clear irregularities during the course of the rent negotiations. If this has been the case, it shall be possible for the rent to be examined in the light of the utility principle.</p>
<p>When the ten-year period has elapsed, it shall be possible for the rent to be determined in the usual way.</p>
<p>The proposal means that a landlord can either try to reach an agreement with a tenants’ organisation that is established in the area and in that way get the rent exempted from being tested in accordance with the utility principle, or, following a breakdown in negotiations, decide that a rent can be reviewed in accordance with the utility principle, should a dispute arise.</p>
<p>Rents in the current housing stock</p>
<p>The question has arisen more and more frequently in recent years as to whether the differences in rents that exist between different apartments are always reasonable in the light of the utility principle. The opinion that the rent for an apartment can be too high or too low in relation to the apartment’s utility value, depending, for example, on how attractively situated the apartment is, has been confirmed by various surveys. In certain parts of Sweden this has led to changes in the structure of rents within the framework of the collective negotiations concerning the rents for apartments in the public housing sector. In such cases, the utility value for certain apartments has been raised, sometimes drastically, while the utility value for others remains the same or is reduced. In certain places, Malmö among them, in those cases where the utility value has been raised, the new and higher utility value is levied directly on new tenants, while existing tenants are given a rent rebate during a transitional period and thus a slower adaptation to the new level of rent.</p>
<p>The committee proposes regulations that make it possible for such negotiated agreements to be valid when they are reached.</p>
<p>However, not all landlords in a particular area reach negotiated agreements on different rents for new and existing tenants. The purport of current legislation is that a landlord who has not reached such a negotiated agreement could cite the newer (and higher) utility value of rents in the public housing sector when the matter is brought before a rent tribunal, so that this higher level would be the basis on which the rents of all tenants would be judged, including that of existing tenants. It is the opinion of the committee that this would not be acceptable. In order to prevent this happening, protective legislation is needed for existing tenants.</p>
<p>The effect of the protective regulation that the committee proposes would be that a private landlord who wishes to cite the rent for new tenants (the utility value rent) that has been decided within the framework of a system with varying levels of rent for new and existing tenants, must accept the implementation of the entire system, including different levels of rent. This would mean that in such a situation, existing tenants would enjoy the rent rebate for existing tenants that had been negotiated within a system of different rent levels, even if their apartments are not directly covered by the system.</p>
<p>The committee’s proposal is that this protective regulation should not be applicable when swapping apartments, or in cases</p>
<p>where an apartment has been renovated to a higher standard, or during the time that an apartment is sub-let.</p>
<p>Options chosen and rejected</p>
<p>It is desirable that it should be possible for tenants to choose and reject options: i.e. that individual variations with respect to maintenance intervals, equipment etc should be possible. Opting in and opting out should be done on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>In most cases, such choices and rejections are treated as part of the rent at the present time. This should also be the case in the future. However the committee proposes a regulation for recovering costs, to the effect that the costs of choosing and rejecting options are taken into account when the utility value is considered. It is the opinion of the committee that the shortest depreciation period for choices made or rejected should be approximately five years. However, if options chosen do not amount to more than approximately 20 per cent of the rent, a shorter period of depreciation should be accepted.</p>
<p>If a tenant who has chosen or rejected an option moves out, the committee proposes that the rent for the new tenant should be decided in accordance with the principle of utility value, without applying the regulation that the cost of choosing or rejecting an option should be taken into account.</p>
<p>If the price for an option chosen or rejected has been decided in accordance with a price list that has been collectively negotiated, or been collectively negotiated in any other way, it is the opinion of the committee that the following consequences should prevail:</p>
<p>• The rule that costs should be recovered should also be applied to a new tenant.</p>
<p>• The price for choosing or rejecting an option is deemed to correspond to the cost of it, as long as no obvious irregularities occurred during the collective negotiations.</p>
<p>• The obligation of a landlord to negotiate with tenants’ organisations before rents are raised, is deemed to have been fulfilled by means of the negotiation about the price list. A collective negotiation need not therefore take place every time a tenant chooses an option.</p>
<p>Rent tribunals and the determination of rents</p>
<p>The committee does not consider that the regulation concerning comparative evaluation in the utility value system should be changed. However, the obligation of the rent tribunals to justify their decisions should be more extensive than is the case at the present time. A rent tribunal should always be obliged to justify its decision if it rules against a particular party. The justifications should be formulated so that they are easy to understand, both for the parties involved and for others.</p>
<p>The consequences of the committee’s proposals</p>
<p>The financial consequences of the committee’s proposals, both concerning options chosen and rejected and the rent tribunals’ justifications of their decisions, are minor or negligible. How much significance the other proposals will have will depend on the extent to which the parties in the housing market for rental properties exploit the opportunities given to them by the proposals. As far as the state’s finances  are concerned, the proposals may affect the costs of interest subsidies and, to a lesser extent, housing subsidies. With the production of new dwellings to rent, the costs of unemployment may diminish and tax revenue increase. The proposal with respect to justifying the decisions of the rent tribunals does not mean that the rent tribunals are in need of more resources. As far as municipal finances  are concerned, the costs of social allowances may be affected to a minor extent, and to the degree that the proposals contribute towards increased production, there will be increased infrastructure costs. As far as domestic finances  are concerned, the proposals might result in some people paying higher rents, and other people paying lower rents, than would otherwise have been the case. As far as business finances  are concerned, the proposals will result in greater predictability for land-lords and in some cases might also result in greater profitability. As far as public finances  are concerned, the proposals might contribute towards a housing market that works better as a result of facilitating the production of new dwellings.</p>
<p>As far as integration policy is concerned, the consequences of the committee’s proposals are marginal. To the extent that the proposals have any consequences in this respect, these can be both positive and negative.</p>
