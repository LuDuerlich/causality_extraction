<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Cycling has received increasing attention in recent years and will become more popular as a mode of transport. A contributing factor to the greater focus on cycling are societal changes resulting in the increase in importance of environmental and public health issues. The special requirements of cyclists on the traffic environment and infrastructure, and their design, have also clearly come to the fore. The fact that traffic regulations can sometimes affect cyclists differently than other road users has also received more attention. Furthermore, there is an increasing realisation that traffic regulations, planning and design are intimately linked with the operation and maintenance of traffic infrastructure. This particularly applies in relation to cycles. The strong link between cycling and the availability of cycle parking facilities, especially at public transport nodes, has also received greater attention, as has the interdependence of cycling and public transport.</p>
<p>Against this background, I have been instructed to review the regulations and conditions in the areas of infrastructure, cycle parking, cycling and public transport, as well as traffic regulations affecting cycling, and to propose legislative amendments and other measures that may be needed to increase cycling and make it safer. The remit primarily covers regulations for cyclists, but to some extent also includes regulations for other road users.</p>
<p>The number of regulations and provisions that arise in a review of the regulations from a cycling point of view in the four above mentioned areas is very large. It is not possible within the framework of this inquiry to review all provisions that could be relevant. Based on an interpretation of the terms of reference, the review has therefore been limited to addressing regulations and conditions that are strongly linked to matters of traffic legislation and infrastructure. Furthermore, the review and selection of regulations has been given a transport policy focus. The selection of regulations for review has been based on the relatively uniform problem scenario that emerged during the inquiry’s work. Furthermore, the selection of regulations took account of where a review appeared most necessary and where the possibilities of effecting change appeared greatest. The review of other conditions for cycling has been limited to factors that are in some way linked to regulations. Thus, the review does not claim to be exhaustive, but it has been extensive and has included a review of a large number of regulations and individual provisions. In the review, factors such as cooperation, knowledge-building, communication, regulatory knowledge and compliance have been taken into consideration. The same applies to the ability of children to handle the traffic environment and understand and follow traffic regulations, and to the question of how transport policy can impact on the design of the traffic environment. Finally, local government autonomy and Sweden’s international commitments have been taken into consideration in the review.</p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>In the course of the inquiry, I have been supported by a team of experts consisting of representatives of a number of government agencies and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR). In addition, I have been in continuous contact with a large number of stakeholders, including government agencies, organisations and individuals. In this context, the contacts I have had with a number of cycling organisations should be specifically mentioned. Furthermore, within the framework of the inquiry, I have employed the services of a consultant, WSP Analys och Strategi, to identify the affect of the regulations on the conditions for cycle planning and cycling. The consultant’s report (Annex 3–4) has served as one of several supporting documents for my assessments and proposals. WSP is responsible for the content of its report, while my assessments, proposals and conclusions, as well as starting points, may be seen in Chapters 6–10.</p>
<p>Information about other countries’ legislation has also been obtained.</p>
<h2>Deliberations and proposals General considerations</h2>
<p>Cycling, cyclists and cycles have a number of special conditions and requirements that distinguish them from other modes of transport, road users and vehicles. Cyclists are a heterogeneous group, which means that their conditions and requirements are shared to a degree, but not entirely. However, common to all types of cycling and all cyclists is that they have requirements on the infrastructure and design of the traffic environment, need cycle parking facilities, are affected in different ways by traffic regulations and, from time to time, want to be able to combine cycling with, for example, using the public transport system.</p>
<p>Achieving increased accessibility and improved traffic flow for cyclists is key to increasing cycling. At the same time, it is important to pay attention to conditions where this accessibility and/or traffic flow may conflict with road safety for cyclists and/or other road users. It is important that cycling is perceived as a safe mode of transport if it is to increase. The interaction between cyclists and other road users is very important and needs to be considered and also developed if cycling is to increase and become safer. Cycling must not only be a safe mode of transport, it must also be perceived as a safe mode of transport. This is especially important for children and their opportunities to cycle freely in the traffic environment, for example, to and from school. It is also important that cycling is perceived as pleasant and enjoyable.</p>
<p>For these factors to be taken into account in reality, cycling must be seen as an autonomous mode of transport, like other forms of road traffic, but also as part of the entire journey and the transport system. Furthermore, cycling must be treated within the framework of an approach that takes in all modes of transport. Cycling should therefore be part of the big picture and be treated in the same way as other modes of transport, but, like these, based on its own conditions and requirements. This applies to infrastructure planning, spatial planning and financial planning during the design of the traffic environment and in legislation.</p>
<p>Traffic planning is largely a municipal concern. This is also the case in many other countries. How clearly defined the roles of municipalities, regions and states are can vary from country to country, as can the extent to which the state provides financing. In all the countries where the cycling rate is high, there has been investment over a lengthy period in creating a good cycling infrastructure with more cycle paths that are safe and attractively designed. A good cycling infrastructure in conjunction with an approach that takes in all modes of transport and a ‘whole-journey’ perspective are important success factors. It should also be possible to achieve the same good results in Sweden since the basic conditions for the successful handling of cycling are contained in the legislation and the planning systems. To succeed, however, collaboration is required at, and between, national, regional and local planning levels. Cycling infrastructure must also, when the criteria are met, be seen as an object for national investment.</p>
<p>With increased cycling, much is to be gained economically from, for example, public health and environmental perspectives. Cycling and public transport interact with and affect each other positively. Cycling has an important role in strengthening the competitiveness of public transport.</p>
<h2>Current legislation</h2>
<p>In general, the legislation governing the planning and design of the traffic environment is vehicle-neutral and formulated to meet social changes and new needs as well as political priorities. The main features of the legislation involve the balancing of different interests. One of the interests to be handled within the framework of the legislation is the traffic infrastructure, and the needs of cycling must be taken into account – cycling is a public interest. My opinion is that these interests can very well be handled within the framework of current legislation. Many of the problems that exist today are linked to the actual application of the legislation and to the political and financial priorities set, rather than the regulations themselves. Thus, regulatory changes are not primarily needed, but rather incentives to apply the legislation so that cycling interests are catered for and the possibilities available under the current framework are actually utilised. This is what my proposals and assessments in this area aim towards.</p>
<p>With regard to the possibility of bringing cycles on to trains, the area is relatively unregulated. However, an EU regulation on rail passengers’ rights gives passengers the right, under certain conditions, to bring their cycles on trains. The regulation is applicable law in Sweden. The public transport market has been decentralised and is now characterised by a measure of commercialisation. This is something that must be taken into account when considering any additional legislative measures with requirements that passengers are to have the right to bring cycles on public transport. The conclusion is that change must be accomplished in other ways that are more in line with the nature of public transport today.</p>
<p>Current traffic legislation is obligation-based, rather than rightsbased. It consists of a number of basic regulations that are common to all road users and a number of regulations that are common to all vehicles. To a limited extent, there are also special regulations for different types of vehicles and road users. Vulnerable road users, such as cyclists, have special needs that must be considered, and this has led to certain special regulations for them. In balancing the various interests, which is necessary in the formulation of traffic regulations, account must be taken of the fact that a traffic regulation can have different consequences for different groups of road users. However, the basic idea is to facilitate cooperation between road users. Available research and knowledge seems to indicate that the ability to control cyclists by regulations alone is limited, due to, among other things, the flexibility of the mode of transport. The behaviour of cyclists is affected more by the design of the traffic environment than by the design of the regulations. Correct design of the traffic environment can also minimise and in some cases completely solve traffic flow and accessibility problems for cyclists while satisfying road safety requirements, without changing the underlying traffic regulations. Traffic flow and accessibility should not be achieved at the expense of safety, whether for cyclists or other road users. Furthermore, the vulnerable situation of pedestrians must be taken into account and points of conflict may not be shifted more than warranted as a result of a regulation change. As far as possible, traffic regulations should be clear and unambiguous, educational and consistent. In my opinion, it is often more efficient to invest in infrastructure design than to change the traffic regulations. Only if it is not possible to achieve improvement in this way should a change in regulations be considered. In all likelihood, the design of the traffic environment, and its connection with the built environment, affects the cycling rate more than individual traffic regulations do. It is worth noting that traffic regulations are relatively similar in international comparisons, while infrastructure design can differ significantly.</p>
<p>In summary, cycling and the conditions for cycling have most to gain from being seen as an integrated part of a whole in all processes and systems, and in the legislation affecting cycling.</p>
<h2>Cycling and infrastructure: planning, design, operation and maintenance, etc.</h2>
<p>There is a need to further develop and improve the network of cycle paths along national roads and within and between communities and municipalities.</p>
<p>In general, legislation and planning processes, as well as financing principles, provide good opportunities to achieve a connected, direct and attractive cycle path network, but cycling must also be prioritised financially and politically as a mode of transport in its own right.</p>
<p>My proposals and assessments in the area point to the opportunities that exist, clear up any misunderstandings of the legal situation and are intended to create incentives so that the full potential of the legislation and systems is realised. Finally, my proposals and assessments are aimed at ensuring that measures, in certain respects, are followed up.</p>
<p>I do not propose any legislative amendments within the area of planning, design, operation and maintenance. The primary reason for this is that it is already possible to create a good cycling infrastructure.</p>
<p>Another reason for not proposing any legislative amendments is that in some cases this would involve measures that would have much wider repercussions and therefore cannot be handled within the framework of a cycling inquiry. However, I have indicated where these cases arise, and where there is need of an alternative inquiry. In other cases, relevant work is already in progress and should continue.</p>
<p>With this approach, a review of road maintenance responsibility, with regard to cycling infrastructure as well as operation and maintenance of cycle paths, should be handled within the framework of a general review of road maintenance responsibility.</p>
<p>The report of the Swedish mapping, cadastral and land registration authority, entitled Review of the Joint Facilities Act (2002:9), contains a proposal on granting the right under Section 49 of the Joint Facilities Act (1973:1149) to a municipality to construct and maintain, among other things, cycle paths across another property. This proposal should be implemented. This proposal is still being processed. During the continued work on the proposal, it should be considered whether such a right should also be granted to the state. Furthermore, the possibility of linking the proposed amendment to the physical planning process should be examined.</p>
<p>The work of the Swedish Transport Administration on developing a functional standard for the operation and maintenance of cycle paths for which the state has road maintenance responsibility, and the Administration’s work on the dissemination of knowledge about the inquiries in the area are important and should be prioritised. The work of the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR) on comfort measurements and the work of the Group for National Collaboration in the road safety area concerning the link between operation and maintenance and the accident rate among cyclists should be prioritised. The knowledge that emerges during the course of all this work should be spread.</p>
<p>I present the following proposals.</p>
<p>• The Government should instruct the Swedish Transport Agency, in consultation with the Swedish Transport Administration, SALAR and REV (National Association of Private Roads), as well as other relevant actors, to analyse from a traffic safety perspective the need of extending the scope of application of the Road Safety Act (2010:1362) to include cycling infrastructure, primarily cycle paths and secondarily all roads and streets that are included in a cycling infrastructure identified in the instructions. The assignment should also include an analysis of what such an extension of the scope of application would mean in terms of costs for those responsible for road maintenance. The background to this part of my proposal is that recent research has shown that a large proportion of cycle accidents are  single-vehicle accidents and these can primarily be linked to the operation and maintenance of cycle paths. It is conceivable that an extension of the Road Safety Act would help to reduce the number of accidents.</p>
<p>• Moreover, the Government should instruct the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning to revise the handbook ‘Make Towns – instead of traffic planning and housing development’ and make it  web-based and interactive. Additionally, the Swedish Transport Administration and the Swedish National</p>
<p>Board of Housing, Building and Planning, in consultation with SALAR, should in a similar way be concurrently tasked with revising the handbook ‘Traffic for an attractive town’ and making it web-based and interactive. The Swedish Transport Administration should also, in consultation with SALAR, be concurrently tasked with revising the handbook ‘Design, operation and maintenance with pedestrian, cycle and moped traffic in focus’ (the GCM handbook) and making it web-based and interactive. The idea behind these concurrent assignments is to create greater opportunities to keep these handbooks up-to-date and, by making them interactive with the possibility of linking to other manuals, increase knowledge about what must be taken into account in the planning of cycling infrastructure and clarify the importance of collaboration. In this way, the handbooks will also become more accessible to all instances working on cycling issues.</p>
<p>• Finally, the Swedish Transport Administration should be tasked by the Government to, in consultation with SALAR, revise the handbook ‘Design of roads and streets’ (the VGU handbook) from a cycling perspective. The VGU handbook has been recently revised, but not with regard to aspects important to cycling. Given society’s development, cycling’s development and the increased knowledge about cycling needs and requirements, such a revision should be carried out. There is a connection between this assignment and the assignment to conduct an inventory of the road verges that form part of the cycling infrastructure, and it is important that the conclusions of this inventory are reflected in the revision of the VGU handbook.</p>
<h2>Cycling, cycle parking and public transport</h2>
<p>Within the framework of current legislation, and based on the municipal monopoly on planning, municipalities are well-placed to take responsibility for the planning of cycle parking facilities and ensure that property owners arrange cycle parking facilities, including at public transport nodes, since the municipalities can take the initiatives for coordination. It is appropriate, as is done in the current legislation, to identify property owners as being responsible for constructing cycle parking facilities at public transport nodes. There is no reason to amend the provisions of the Planning and Building Act (2010:900) which regulates the obligation to construct parking facilities. The problems and practical consequences that the fragmented land ownership situation (mainly at public transport nodes) involves must be resolved in ways other than legislative amendments.</p>
<p>The need to be able to move illegally parked cycles, or wrecked cycles, is in my opinion covered by current regulations. The same applies to the regulations governing where cycles may be parked. The amendment I am proposing in this legislation is based on an amendment to the regulations for cycle crossings and is discussed below.</p>
<p>There should be real opportunities to bring cycles on public transport, without additional regulations in the area being introduced in legislation. Rather, the focus should be on getting relevant actors to see the benefits of collaboration between public transport and cycling. Nor do I propose any legislative amendments in this area, however I do propose measures aimed at, within the framework of current legislation, improving the possibilities of creating good cycle parking facilities and improving collaboration between cycling and public transport.</p>
<p>To these ends, I propose the following.</p>
<p>• The Government should instruct the Swedish Transport Administration, in cooperation with the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning, and in consultation with the Swedish Transport Agency and SALAR, to conduct a national inventory and needs analysis of cycle parking facilities with regard to availability and standard at all larger Swedish public transport nodes in order to create a common platform of knowledge. The results of the assignment are to form the basis of continued planning, with the possibility of assessing future national needs, including financial aspects, and building consensus and collaboration between relevant actors and disseminating knowledge. The assignment should ensure that municipalities and those with regional responsibility for public transport, as well as private actors who are affected, are involved through the establishment of a cooperation forum. Furthermore, within the framework of the assignment, an agreement model for cooperation and financing of cycle parking facilities at public transport nodes should be developed. The proposal aims to solve the problems that currently arise because several actors are involved when a cycle parking facility is to be constructed or expanded or otherwise improved.</p>
<p>• The Government, as a continuation of the cycling strategy, should instruct the Swedish Transport Administration, in consultation with the Swedish Transport Agency and in cooperation with cycling organisations, regional public transport agencies, public transport operators, SALAR, and a number of municipalities, to develop a catalogue of ideas to promote the combination of cycling and public transport. This catalogue of ideas should, in various ways, highlight the advantages of promoting travel on a combination of different modes of transport and should be seen as a continuation of the agencies’ assignment to develop a cycling strategy to increase cycling and make it safer.</p>
<h2>Cycling and traffic regulations, etc.</h2>
<p>I propose a number of legislative amendments in the area of cycling and traffic regulations. The reason I am proposing relatively few legislative amendments is that during the course of the inquiry I have found that most problems related to traffic regulations and cycling are not due to the regulations themselves and are therefore better solved by measures in the traffic environment.</p>
<p>I propose the following amendments, present the following proposals and make the following assessments.</p>
<p>• Cycles are to be permitted on a roadway, even if there is a cycle path, if special caution is taken and it is appropriate with regard to the width of the vehicle and the cycle has more than two wheels or is equipped with a cycle cart or sidecar. The reason for the proposed amendment is to facilitate traffic flow for cyclists since cycle paths are often not dimensioned for this type of vehicle. Otherwise, I have not found reason to expand the possibilities of cycling on the roadway. Nor have I found reason to expand the possibilities for cyclists to ride two abreast.</p>
<p>• The Road Traffic Ordinance (1998:1276) should explicitly state that the obligation, for cyclists and others, to use the road verge only applies if the road verge is of sufficient width and is otherwise appropriate to use. The reason for this proposal is that there appears to be uncertainty about when a cyclist is required to use the road verge.</p>
<p>• If there is no cycle path, it shall be permitted for children to cycle on the footway up to and including the year in which they turn 8. The primary reason for allowing children to cycle on the footway is that such a regulation is likely to promote increased cycling among children since the child, and the adults close to him or her, will experience a greater peace of mind when the child cycles in the traffic environment.</p>
<p>• The regulations for  non-signal-controlled cycle crossings are to be amended so that vehicles must give way to cyclists and riders of class II mopeds crossing or about to cross at the cycle crossing. Before crossing at a cycle crossing, cyclists or riders of a class II moped must slow down and take account of the distance and speed of the vehicles approaching the crossing. A certain place may only be considered to be a cycle crossing if it is intended to be used by cyclists and riders of class II mopeds to cross a roadway or cycle path and if the traffic environment is designed in such a way that ensures that vehicles do not travel at speeds exceeding 30 kilometres per hour or that the crossing is signalcontrolled. A ‘cycle crossing’ shall refer to a place that according to local traffic provisions is intended to be a cycle crossing and is indicated as such with road markings or signs. A road sign is to be developed by the Swedish Transport Agency. As before, a ‘signal-controlled cycle crossing’ is a crossing where traffic is regulated by traffic signals or a police officer. Otherwise, as before, the crossing is ‘non-signal-controlled’. The purpose of the amendment is to make the regulations for cycle crossings more clear and consistent, and to improve traffic flow for cyclists by requiring other vehicular traffic to give way to them. At the same time, placing certain demands on the design of cycle crossings will ensure that the improved traffic flow does not occur at the expense of road safety. For the same reason, a consideration provision is to be introduced for cyclists and relevant moped riders.</p>
<p>• It will be permissible to move vehicles that are parked in violation of provisions on stopping or parking within five metres before a cycle crossing. This amendment follows from the amended regulations for cycle crossings, which make it important to ensure that vehicles that have stopped or parked too close to these can be moved.</p>
<p>• The possibility of creating cycle streets is introduced. It should be possible to designate a certain road, section of road or all roads within an area as a cycle street. A cycle street refers to a road or a section of road that, according to a local traffic provision, is to be a cycle street and is marked as such with road signs. The Swedish Transport Agency is to develop road signs for ‘cycle street’ and ‘cycle street ends’. Motor vehicles are to adjust their speed to the cycle traffic in a cycle street, vehicles may only park in designated parking spaces and vehicles entering a cycle street are to give way to vehicles already in the cycle street. Drivers of motor vehicles and drivers of  non-motorised vehicles and the road users referred to in Chapter 1, Section 4, first paragraph of the Road Traffic Ordinance, who intentionally or through negligence violate the duty to give way will be liable to a fine. It will be possible to grant exemptions to the parking regulations for cycle streets. The reason for the proposed amendment is that this is a good way to increase cyclist accessibility and show that they are prioritised in the traffic environment.</p>
<p>• No new or amended terms or definitions of terms are proposed in the traffic legislation, apart from the terms ‘cycle crossing’ and ‘cycle street’.</p>
<p>• The Government should instruct the Swedish Transport Administration, in consultation with SALAR, to conduct an inventory of road verges that are part of the cycling infrastructure in order to identify the need for action to achieve a good cycling infrastructure resulting in increased accessibility and safety for cyclists. The results of the inventory, along with proposals for action, an action plan and a timetable for implementation should be reported to the Government. The assignment should also include reviewing current recommendations on the design and maintenance of road verges and proposing amendments where necessary. The result must impact on the assignment to revise the VGU handbook. Municipalities, regions and cycling organisations should also be invited to participate in the work. The shortcomings that have been pointed out with regard to road verges included in cycling infrastructure form the background to the assignment. In this context, road verges included in cycling infrastructure refer to road verges where cycle paths or alternative routes for cycling are unavailable within a reasonable distance, but where cycling occurs and is expected to increase due to fringe development or work and school commuting.</p>
<p>• It is already possible to allow cycling in both directions on oneway streets. The Government should jointly instruct the Swedish Transport Agency and the Swedish Transport Administration, in consultation with SALAR, to spread knowledge about current regulations on  one-way traffic and the scope, within the framework of this regulation, to allow cycling in both directions in some cases. The reason I propose such an assignment is that during the course of the inquiry it has emerged that knowledge concerning the options available under the current regulations is inadequate. The Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals does not permit the road sign ‘no entry’ to be combined with an additional sign exempting cycles from the prohibition.</p>
<p>• Traffic flow problems for cyclists at  signal-controlled crossings and at crossings where there is an obligation to stop should be solved in a manner other than a legislative amendment. It is not consistent with the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic and the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals to introduce the possibility of providing traffic signals or stop signs with an additional sign exempting, in certain cases, cyclists. There are other ways of prioritising cycle traffic in these situations – by exempting it from the obligation to stop or obey red lights – or by making the regulations more cycle-friendly.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>I have presented a relatively limited number of proposals and just a few of them involve legislative amendments. Otherwise, the report contains assessments. The reason that only a limited number of proposals have been presented is that during the course of the inquiry I have found that much to promote cycling and increase its safety can be achieved within the framework of current regulations and existing systems and processes.</p>
<p>My assessment is that continued investment in cycling infrastructure is needed. As far as possible, the design possibilities of the traffic environment should be utilised in preference to regulatory amendments in order to improve the conditions for cycling and make it safer. In the current system, it is already possible to make</p>
<p>these kinds of investments and priorities and the financial outcome is of course dependent on the choices made in the overall infrastructure planning, physical planning and financial planning. It is mainly within the ‘regional transport plans’ that funding, from a national system, should be channelled for increased and safer cycling, in the form of measures that fit within the scope of these plans, such as cycle communications, cycle parking facilities and cooperation with public transport. An estimated investment of SEK 800 million to SEK 1 000 million is required for cycling measures in the immediate future. It is worth pointing out that investment in cycling infrastructure in the long term will provide economic benefits in the form of a better environment and improved public health.</p>
<p>All of the assignments I have proposed that the Government give various agencies fall within their directions and are therefore to be financed within the framework of the agencies’ general government appropriations for their operations.</p>
<p>The proposals on legislative amendments that refer to cycle crossings and cycle streets involve financial consequences. The proposal on amended regulations for cycle crossings will mainly involve costs for municipalities and also, to some extent, the Swedish Transport Administration. The financial consequences consist of costs for decisions on local traffic provisions, administration, road markings and, following a review, removal or reconstruction of some crossings. The proposal entailing the possibility of creating cycle streets will also, to the extent that a municipality chooses to create this type of street, involve administrative costs and road marking costs. However, in my opinion, the local government financing principle does not arise since no redistribution of resources between central and local government is required.</p>
<p>My proposals do not affect local government autonomy negatively. In general, my proposals should lead to reduced offences and have preventive effects. The reason for this is that the proposals contribute to increased clarity concerning the regulations. In this respect, it is primarily my proposal on amended regulations for cycle crossings, which involves creating two clear general regulations, that I have in mind. Correct and appropriate design is the most important instrument for increasing compliance with current traffic</p>
<p>regulations.</p>
<p>My proposals do not affect public service in different parts of the country, but should in the long term have positive effects on the working conditions, competitiveness and other conditions of</p>
<p>small enterprises in relation to larger enterprises. Equality between women and men and the chances of achieving the objectives of integration policy are affected positively. The proposals will also, in the long term, affect children’s cycling positively. The same applies to the chances of achieving the objectives of environment policy and public health policy. This is key since in this way we can increase children’s freedom of movement, improve the environment, create a sustainable society and improve public health.</p>
