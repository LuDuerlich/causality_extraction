<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Sweden’s proposed climate strategy comprises objectives and an action programme for achieving them. The action programme includes measures, policy instruments and planning as well as organisational proposals for implementation. The strategy relates to the period up to 2050. The action programme covers the period up to 2010. The strategy and the action programme should be evaluated, revised and extended at specified times.</p>
<h2>The following long-termobjective is proposed:</h2>
<p>A decrease in emissions of greenhouse gases in Sweden of approximately 50 per cent on 1990 levels by 2050, with further reductions thereafter. Emissions in 2050 may not exceed 4.0–4.5 tonnes per year per capita, measured in carbon dioxide equivalent.</p>
<p>This means that current targets for Limited climatic impact  remain in place. These have been established on the basis of joint statements by the EU’s environmental ministers. However, the picture has been somewhat altered by the inclusion of all gases. The goal for 2050 should be to achieve stabilisation of the six greenhouse gases specified in the Kyoto Protocol at about 550 ppm of carbon dioxide equivalent. Sweden should seek to promote this target at international level.</p>
<p>The 2050 target is based on the need to achieve a radical decrease in atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases in developed countries by 2100.</p>
<h2>The following short-term objectiv is proposed for 2008–2012:</h2>
<p>Emissions of greenhouse gases for Sweden shall, as a mean value for the period 2008 to 2012, be 2% lower than emissions in 1990, counted as tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.</p>
<p>The goal includes the six greenhouse gases according to the definitions of the Kyoto Protocol and the IPCC. Measures adopted beyond the country’s boundaries shall be supplemental. Considerable emission reductions shall take place within the country’s boundaries.</p>
<h2>The following interim objective is proposed for 2005:</h2>
<p>Emissions of greenhouse gases in Sweden, in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, shall remain at 1990 levels, with further reductions thereafter. This target covers the six greenhouse gases as defined in the Kyoto Protocol and the IPCC.</p>
<h2>The strategy</h2>
<p>The strategy is based on two primary considerations: the need for international collaboration and the need for a long-term approach combined with integration with other policy areas.</p>
<p>Global climate change can only by addressed by a coordinated global strategy in which developed countries, which have been and continue to be responsible for a large proportion of all emissions, reduce their emissions substantially. International collaboration is therefore essential, and Sweden must take an active part in international efforts.</p>
<p>A strategy with a long-term perspective must allow flexibility, take account of the need to distribute burdens equitably among countries and generations, and prioritise measures aimed at infrastructural change. Changes must be predicated on the capacity of the democratic system to deal with them and on the prospects of effecting the necessary transformations in practice.</p>
<p>That said, we must ensure that no time is lost in commencing this transformation. This will require immediate steps. The consequences of climate change will affect future generations most of all. The Committee believes that the pace of transition to a climatically sustainable society must be stepped up. It is essential that developed countries set a good example so that developing countries will in turn be disposed to accept future requirements on emission reductions. It is thus of the utmost importance to avoid delay in implementing emission abatement measures.</p>
<p>As implementation of Sweden’s strategy proposals will affect the whole of society, it will also be necessary to consider the implications for other policy areas. The Committee believes that climate-related considerations should be an inherent component of all proposals drawn up in other policy areas affected by implementation of climate policy.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that educational, administrative and economic instruments should be used to achieve the proposed goals. The action programme includes both shortand long-term measures for achieving them. The proposals also include procedures for follow-up and evaluation as well as dates for upcoming climate policy decisions. The dates proposed are 2004 and 2008.</p>
<p>The Committee’s proposals are aimed at involving all of society in the implementation of climate policy. The proposals are predicated on the implementation of information initiatives aimed at communicating policy objectives to the public, and on the adoption of measures in all sectors of society to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Increased knowledge and awareness are vital in enlisting the support and participation of the public in facilitating the necessary changes.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that coordination within the Swedish Government Offices be strengthened and that a special Climate Council be established at government agency level. Further efforts at regional and local level should be supported by state subsidies and climate policy programmes to ensure that implementation is based on local conditions.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of the Committee that ratification of the Kyoto Protocol would be facilitated by further clarification of certain parts of the Protocol. This applies particularly to flexible mechanisms, sinks, the gases (sulphur hexafluoride, perfluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons) and the provisions relating to follow-up and sanctions. If the ratification process is to commence without delay Sweden should work actively to bring about the necessary clarification when the parties to the climate convention meet for negotiations.</p>
<p>In summary, the proposed strategy represents the first steps towards broad implementation in Sweden. Its aim is to ensure that Sweden assumes its share of the responsibility – internationally, by participating and contributing experience gained from our endeavours, and nationally, by adopting measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>
