<p>On 16 April 2014, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 2014/50/EU on minimum requirements for enhancing worker mobility between Member States by improving the acquisition and preservation of supplementary pension rights. The Directive establishes rules to make it easier for employees to exercise the right to free movement between Member States by reducing obstacles that follow from certain provisions on supplementary pension schemes linked to an employment relationship. The task of the Inquiry has been to analyse the Directive and submit proposals for measures, if any, that need to be taken to transpose the Directive into Swedish law.</p>
<p>The Directive covers occupational pensions under supplementary pension schemes. The Inquiry’s assessment is that, in a Swedish context, a ‘supplementary pension scheme’ is to mean regulations that give employees the right to an occupational pension, i.e. mainly collective agreements and individual occupational pension agreements.</p>
<p>The Directive covers occupational pensions in the form of retirement pensions. It does not cover other benefits that may be found in collective agreements on occupational pensions, such as disability pensions. It also contains provisions of significance for ‘dormant survivor’s pensions’. ‘Dormant survivor’s pension’ refers to a pension for a survivor, preserved as a dormant benefit until the survivor reaches a certain age.</p>
<p>The Directive contains provisions on conditions for the acquisition and preservation of occupational pensions and provisions on information. Some of the Directive’s provisions seem unfamiliar to some extent with regard to Swedish circumstances. This includes the Directive’s provisions limiting the possibility of imposing conditions concerning a certain period or age that must be fulfilled by the employee to acquire accumulated pension rights.</p>
<p>In the Directive, such conditions for the acquisition of pension rights are described as vesting period requirements and vesting age requirements, which are not found in Swedish collective agreements. Another unfamiliar phenomenon for Swedish circumstances is that the employees to some extent pays for their own occupational pension, which the Directive’s refunding provision focuses on. In addition, the Directive’s provisions on processing of and information on survivors’ dormant pension rights target a pension design that is not currently found in the Swedish labour market. Furthermore, the Inquiry notes that Swedish collective agreements already seem to meet the Directive’s requirements in the relevant sections. This also applies to individual agreements. It can thus be noted that the Directive’s practical significance for Swedish conditions is limited. Despite these conditions, the Inquiry’s assessment is that a legal regulation is needed for the Directive to be transposed into Swedish legislation. This is due to the fact that there are currently no legal obstacles to drawing up conditions in occupational pension agreements that conflict with the Directive’s provisions.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has considered whether the Directive’s provisions concerning acquisition and preservation should be implemented in existing legislation. However, the Inquiry has not found such a solution to be suitable. To guarantee employees and survivors their rights under the Directive, the Inquiry instead proposes the introduction of a new act. This proposed act targets the employer and contains provisions on conditions for acquisition and preservation in occupational pension agreements. The Inquiry proposes that the act also contain provisions on information. However, we propose that information provisions only apply if corresponding information is not provided in some other way, such as by the insurer or a selection centre. The Inquiry proposes that it should be possible, in some cases, to deviate from the act’s provisions in collective agreements, provided the agreement respects the protection provided by the Directive.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has considered whether the act should only include outgoing employees, i.e. employees who move to another Member State, in the same way as the Directive. However, the Inquiry has found that motives in favour of a regulation that applies to all employees are more important.</p>
<p>The proposed act regulates that requirements concerning the length of employment for acquisition of pension rights may not exceed three years. This means that no time frame requirements exceeding three years may be prescribed for the employee to start being covered by the agreement’s provisions, nor may corresponding time frame requirements be prescribed for the employee to acquire accumulated pension rights. Such requirements in combination may not exceed three years. Where a minimum age is stipulated as a requirement for the employee to acquire accumulated pension rights, that age may not exceed 21 years. However, the proposed act does not regulate the minimum age for being covered by the agreement’s provisions on retirement pensions, which exists in many Swedish collective agreements. The Directive does not prescribe any obstacle to such requirements. Since the Directive stipulates that the employee is to have the right to refunded pension contributions in certain cases, the act contains a corresponding provision. The provision can only be applicable if acquisition conditions are prescribed in the occupational pension agreement in combination with the condition that the employee in some part finances the occupational pension.</p>
<p>If the employee terminates the employment relationship for a reason other than that they receive an occupational pension in the form of a retirement pension, the occupational pension conditions are to stipulate that acquired pension rights are to be preserved. In accordance with the Directive, which states that a one-off payment below a certain threshold may be permitted, the Inquiry proposes that occupational pension agreements may allow one-off payments. Such payment requires that the value of the acquired pension rights does not exceed one price base amount and that the employee consents. The regulation therefore means that it is the contracting parties’ responsibility to arrange a one-off payment option.</p>
<p>Under the act, preserved pension rights are to be processed in a way that is equivalent to the terms for value growth of pension rights for employees remaining in employment. However, the terms may instead follow value growth of benefits under payment or be carried out in other ways that can be considered fair. If the occupational pension agreement provides the right to dormant pension rights for survivors, these pension rights are also to be processed fairly.</p>
<p>The act introduces provisions that the employer must provide, at the request of the employee, information on how a termination of employment would affect their occupational pension. Above all, information must be provided on acquisition conditions and the effects of applying them if employment is terminated, on the value of the acquired pension rights and the conditions governing value growth of acquired pension rights for the period after the employment relationship is terminated. Information is also to be provided to deferred beneficiaries and survivors on their dormant pension rights.</p>
<p>Occupational pensions regulated by an ordinance are not covered by the provisions of the proposed act, as it regulates occupational pension agreements. The Inquiry is not submitting any particular proposal with regard to occupational pension conditions regulated by an ordinance. However, for such government service pension provisions, the Inquiry proposes the introduction of a provision, in the Ordinance on processing of matters concerning government service pension benefits, on the National Government Employee Pensions Board having in principle equivalent responsibility to provide information as in the proposed act.</p>
<p>A contractual condition that violates the proposed act’s provisions can be adapted or declared void at the request of a employee. There must be a right to economic and general damages in the case of breaches of the act’s provisions. Under this act, a dispute is to be dealt with under the Labour Disputes (Judicial Procedure) Act (1974:371).</p>
<p>Under Article 8 of the Directive, the Directive is to be transposed into Swedish law by 21 May 2018. However, the Inquiry proposes that the act enter into force at the start of a new year, therefore as early as 1 January 2018. The act applies for periods of employment after entry into force. In accordance with the Directive, the act does not apply to agreements to which employees could no longer accede after 19 May 2014.</p>
<p>The proposed act is not deemed to increase pension costs for employers. Employers must learn about the new regulations, which may involve some time and costs. Since, under the act, the employer is only obliged to provide information if employees do not obtain information in some other way, the act is considered to involve no more than negligibly increased costs for employers.</p>
