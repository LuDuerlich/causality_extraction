<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Public procurement in Sweden</h2>
<p>Public procurement in Sweden is decentralised. Some 290 local government entities (responsible for primary and secondary school education, social services, water and sanitation, etc.) and 20 regions/counties (responsible for health care and public transport) conduct public procurement. More than 300 government agencies enjoy a high degree of operational autonomy from the ministries and have conduct their own public procurement.</p>
<p>Local and regional government can choose to use framework agreements provided by SKL Kommentus  (a central purchasing body owned the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions ) and central government agencies can use framework agreements provided by the National Procurement Services  (a central purchasing body that is a department of the Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency) .</p>
<p>Legislation on public procurement in Sweden is based on EU directives. All public procurement is regulated. Regulation of public procurement below the threshold amount (but above 15 per cent of the threshold) and the awarding of B-Services contracts are regulated in a way that resembles the regulation derived from the directives. Hence, procurement supervision and procurement assistance is aimed at all procurement above 15 per cent of the threshold amount.</p>
<p>In 2010, 19 000 notices for tender were published. About 75 per cent were for contracts below the EU threshold amount.</p>
<p>A supplier may request a review procedure at an administrative court, and consequently also appeal to an administrative court of appeal and finally to the Supreme Administrative Court. In 2011, no less than 2 750 court cases were initiated.</p>
<p>A supplier may under some circumstances make a damages claim against a contracting authority that has illegally awarded a contract. Such claims are not handled by the Administrative Court System, but are the responsibility of the district courts.</p>
<p>A public procurement damages fine (at most 10 per cent of the value of the contract and no more than approximately EUR 1.1 million) may be imposed if a contract has been illegally directly awarded.</p>
<h2>The objective of the Inquiry</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s mission is to propose how procurement assistance should be coordinated in order to increase competence, availability, consistency and visibility for procurement market participants. The Government emphasizes that it is important that the contracting authorities or entities, as well as suppliers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, are provided with assistance to help strengthen the skills of these groups. Procurement assistance is also essential for increasing the level of knowledge regarding environmental and social considerations in public procurement. As a starting point, the Inquiry should consider placing responsibility for procurement assistance activities on an existing government authority. If no existing authority should prove suitable, the Inquiry may also consider the establishment of a new authority.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Inquiry should propose measures to improve the possibilities of providing the Government Offices with support, such as studies as well as staff to participate in various EU meetings on public procurement.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In 1996, when Sweden joined the EU and the directives on public procurement were implemented in national legislation, a small special body, The National Board for Public Procurement,  was established to oversee public procurement and provide information and guidance. In 2007, the Board was terminated and its responsibilities were transferred to the Swedish Competition Authority.</p>
<p>In 2009, a  National Procurement Assistance and Development Department (Upphandlingsstödet) was established at  the Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency (Kammarkollegiet ).</p>
<p>This body now has a staff of 14 people. Over the past 1.5 years, it has produced 19 guidance documents on various topics related to public procurement. The department has also established a website and operates a helpdesk for contracting authorities and suppliers.</p>
<p>However,  the Swedish Competition Authority has to some extent continued to produce information material on public procurement.</p>
<p>The Swedish Environmental Management Council (SEMCo) is a company that is partially owned (85 per cent) by  the Ministry of the Environment . SEMCo provides  ready-to-use  criteria for making environmental requirements available to a broad range of professionals. These procurement criteria contain suggestions for different environmental requirements that can be included in calls for tender. SEMCo also provides advice and information on the use of its criteria.</p>
<p>In 2010, the Government ordered the Swedish Agency for Public Management  (Statskontoret), which analyses central government activities and agencies in terms of efficiency and provides documentation for review and rationalisation, to review the organisational structure of public procurement assistance and services. The agency proposed an amalgamation of almost all framework agreement procurement for central government agencies into one authority and that the procurement assistance function should also be included in this new authority.</p>
<p>The Government partially acted on this proposal and concentrated almost all framework procurement at a new organisation, the National Procurement Services , established in January 2011 as a department of the Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency  (Kammarkollegiet).</p>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>As expressed in the directives from the Government to this Inquiry, there is concern that procurement assistance is too fragmented. The Inquiry has concluded that despite very good progress with writing guidance documents from the National Procurement Assistance and Development Department , the role of this function is still not well-known by procurement officers and suppliers. At the same time, there is a growing concern over problems in public procurement. This has been especially highlighted in the media with revelations of problems in the procurement of health care and nursing home services.</p>
<h2>Proposals regarding the objective and work of the procurement assistance function A broad approach</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has concluded that is essential that the future procurement assistance function should work from a broad approach.</p>
<p>Various stakeholders have made it clear that for them the primary objective by far is ‘value for money’  or ‘good business practice’ . This concept is not only a matter of commercial conditions, but also of taking environmental and social consideration and of including a citizen’s perspective.</p>
<p>The primary goal of public procurement is to achieve ‘good business practice’ . There has been a strong desire to ‘to do right’ , that is to follow legislation. Various stakeholders, however, are seeking to ‘buy right’ , that is to be able to conduct precisely the type of good business practice within the framework of the legislative requirements as mentioned above.. The Inquiry concludes that the conditions for doing “ good business ” involve procurement assistance throughout the entire procurement process.</p>
<p>The procurement process must begin with needs, which should be subject to proper analysis. Thereafter, the contracting authority should obtain relevant knowledge about market conditions. This is followed by considerations that may be described as tactical; it is about how the contracting authority may buy a particular good or service by reference to its objectives, in the most beneficial way. In this context, the contracting authority should be able to take into account a number of different aspects including sustainability. The tactical considerations determine the requirements and conditions that are appropriate and relevant to set for the procurement.</p>
<p>Then the legal procurement process follows. Later on, some aspects of the procurement process lie outside procurement law, such as those relating to controlling deliveries and the final evaluation of the procurement. All these stages are interconnected and partially parallel. Based on this “ broad approach ” it is natural that procurement assistance should cover all these aspects.</p>
<p>The procurement assistance function shall offer guidance, not advice. There is a general principle in Sweden that public authorities do not give advice in individual cases. However, they can offer guidance of a general nature, which can be applicable in a specific setting.</p>
<h2>Target groups</h2>
<p>The Inquiry recommends the following target groups for procurement assistance:  Contracting authorities  Purchasers  Strategic  decision-makers  Line management  Companies – mainly SMEs  Suppliers  Potential suppliers  Other  Advisors</p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<h2>Guidance documents</h2>
<p>The Inquiry concludes that the procurement assistance function should continue to publish guidance documents, the content and format of which must be adapted to different target groups. The publication of guidance documents should cover issues in the entire procurement process in accordance with the broad view. The Inquiry also believes that there is a need for guidance documents that are more in-depth and do not shy away from complicated issues. Such guidance documents would be welcomed by both less and more experienced purchasers, suppliers and their advisers.</p>
<h2>Good practices</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s contacts with purchasers have shown that there is strong interest in learning from good examples. The procurement assistance function should provide good practices. However the concept of “ good practice ” does not refer to entire tender documents. Instead, the procurement assistance function should show how specific issues can be handled by providing examples and comments.</p>
<h2>Newsletter</h2>
<p>The procurement assistance function should provide information on recent developments in the area of public procurement. This information should include interpretations of amendments to the law, case law from the ECJ and guiding national court cases. Furthermore, the newsletter should present the opinion of the procurement assistance function in fundamental issues and recurring questions of general interest.</p>
<h2>Helpdesk</h2>
<p>The Inquiry concludes that it is essential that the procurement assistance function maintains a ‘helpdesk’ for guidance. The helpdesk function is not intended to convey legal or other advice in individual contracts, but should be able to give general guidance based on issues raised by contracting authorities and suppliers. The helpdesk function must have a high degree of accessibility.</p>
<h2>Industry standards and agreements</h2>
<p>The Inquiry considers it would be useful if the procurement assistance function promoted the development of party negotiated contract terms and common classifications in industries where this is lacking.</p>
<h2>Information packages</h2>
<p>The procurement assistance function should continue to work with information packages that can be used use by procurement officers to spread knowledge of public procurement to a wider circle of people. Information packages can consist of PowerPoint presentations, movies, questionnaires, etc. and are to be used in conjunction with existing guidance documents.</p>
<h2>Advisory Board on Public Procurement</h2>
<p>There should be an Advisory Board on Public Procurement as a part of the procurement assistance function. Its members should consist of people who have experience in procurement or expertise in procurement matters. The Board shall provide opinions on matters of principle, and on recurring questions of general interest. The Board shall not issue comments or provide opinions in its own name, but act as an advisory expert body for the procurement assistance function.</p>
<h2>Division of responsibilities The Swedish Competition Authority</h2>
<p>The Inquiry concludes that the procurement assistance function should be responsible for the main bulk of information about public procurement. The Swedish Competition Authority’s  information should be based on its supervisory role. The Swedish Competition Authority  should provide information on:  the Swedish Competition Authority’s role to supervise public procurement  the regulatory framework and case law on procurement damages fines  the Swedish Competition Authority’s supervisory activities in general and the conclusions regarding the application of procurement law that the authority has made from its supervisory role</p>
<p>Hence,  the Swedish Competition Authority should not in the future issue guidance documents or provide general information about the public procurement process.</p>
<h2>Swedish Environmental Management Council (SEMCo)</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the procurement assistance function should be responsible for general information and guidance on environmental considerations in public procurement.</p>
<p>The Swedish Environmental Management Council should provide information and guidance on the environmental criteria for various products and services that the company has developed. This information is partly technical. The Inquiry has hence concluded that it would be advantageous if the  SEMCo officer responsible for the management criteria also had the opportunity of assisting in communicating them.</p>
<p>The procurement assistance function should be responsible for the information and guidance on lifecycle cost analysis and other methods of calculation.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also concludes that SEMCo’s  work on social considerations, including the CSR Compass , should be transferred to the procurement assistance function.</p>
<p>The Swedish Environmental Management Council’s guidance activities should be conducted in close cooperation with the procurement assistance function. This should take on a practical expression, such as a single number to the Helpdesk function and regular staff meetings.</p>
<h2>Considerations on the organisation of the procurement assistance function</h2>
<p>The Inquiry started considering three different possible options: 0. The procurement assistance function remains at  the Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency  (Kammarkollegiet). 1. The procurement assistance function is placed at  the Swedish Competition Authority . 2. The procurement assistance function is placed at a new separate agency.</p>
<p>During its work, the Inquiry found that there were reasons to also examine four additional options. 3. The procurement assistance function is placed at  the National Service Centre . 4. The procurement assistance function is placed at  the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth  (Tillväxtverket). 6. The procurement assistance function is placed at  the Swedish Agency for Public Management  (Statskontoret).</p>
<p>Finally, the Inquiry also found reason to describe yet another option, notwithstanding that this alternative does not fit within the scope of the Inquiry directive:</p>
<p>Option X: The procurement assistance function and the National Procurement Services  are placed together in a new authority.</p>
<p>The Inquiry concluded that the present situation – option 0 – is not suitable for the future development of the procurement assistance function. The main reason is the low visibility attained as a department of the Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency . This agency has a very wide scope of responsibilities, covering about 30 different roles. The Procurement Assistance Department  has made good efforts to establish their own external profile, such a website www.upphandlingsstodet.se  separate from the main website of the agency. However, the Inquiry believes that the procurement assistance function will be hampered by being a part of the Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency .</p>
<p>Also, the Inquiry has reviewed options 1 and 3–6, and concluded that the procurement assistance function would not be better placed in any of those agencies.</p>
<p>The Inquiry is of the opinion that the prerequisites for developing the operations of the procurement assistance function, and thereby show contracting authorities and suppliers how important it is to achieve better public procurement, can be attained within a new single-purpose procurement assistance agency. The instruction from Government specifies that the Inquiry should compare different options.</p>
<p>To organise the procurement assistance function as an independent authority will be somewhat more costly than option 0.</p>
<p>The Inquiry calculates that these additional costs will be approximately EUR 270 000 per year. In an overall assessment of the organisational options, however, a number of aspects other than the cost differences between the alternatives were considered. Both organisational options have pros and cons.  A head of an agency has higher visibility and a better chance of influencing.  Improved possibilities of recruiting highly qualified staff to an agency that is dedicated to public procurement.  Easier to provide support to the Government Offices and to take charge of statistics on public procurement.  Simpler and more transparent steering and management from the ministry responsible for public procurement policy and legislation.  The vulnerability that follows from being a small authority.  Relocation and reorganisation costs.  Difficult for the head of the agency to take an active role in promoting better public procurement due to so many other roles for the Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency.  Difficult to recruit highly qualified staff due to vague role of the Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency.  A possible conflict of interests between the Procurement Assistance and the National Procurement Services.</p>
<p>The Inquiry concludes that there are strong reasons for establishing a new agency for procurement assistance.</p>
<h2>A new Procurement Assistance Agency</h2>
<p>The new agency is expected to have a staff of about 25 people, around 10 more than are presently working at the Procurement Assistance Department  at the Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency . The annual cost of the new agency is expected to be about EUR 4.6 million.</p>
<p>However, neither the expected staff increase nor the projected costs are certain. Additional requirements may follow as a result of the on-going negotiations on the new directives. Increased administrative cooperation and requirements may require more staff. Additionally, the future structure for collecting and analysing statistics on public procurement is presently under review. This may give the Procurement Assistance Agency  new tasks. The responsibility for research on public procurement is also an open issue awaiting the Government’s proposals for research policy.</p>
