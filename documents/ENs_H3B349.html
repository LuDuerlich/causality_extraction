<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In July 2006, the European Parliament and the Council adopted a directive on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts (the ‘Audit Directive’). The Audit Directive, which replaced the previous, less comprehensive, Eighth Company Law Directive, was implemented in Swedish law through provisions in the Auditors Act, the Swedish Companies Act and other statutes.</p>
<p>On 16 April 2014, new rules were adopted on auditors and auditing (the EU auditing package). The new rules comprise a regulation containing specific requirements regarding statutory audits of public-interest entities (the ‘Audit Regulation’) and a directive amending the Audit Directive (the ‘Amending Directive’).</p>
<p>The Audit Regulation regulates certain matters pertaining to the audits of public-interest entities. The term ‘public-interest entities’ refers to listed companies and certain financial undertakings. Several of the rules regarding audits of public-interest entities have been transferred from the Audit Directive to the Audit Regulation. In addition, the Regulation has introduced comprehensive new rules for such audits. Since an EU regulation is directly applicable in the Member States and precludes equivalent national legislation, the basic assumption is full harmonisation of statutory audits of the types of entities covered by the Regulation.</p>
<p>The Audit Directive still contains rules that apply to all audits that fall under EU law. Moreover, there are still certain rules in the Directive that apply only to public-interest entities. The number of rules in the Directive has also increased considerably.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s main task has been to analyse the amendments required in Swedish law in order to implement the new legal instruments. Most of the new provisions in the Audit Regulation do not require any implementing measures. In some cases, however, the provisions of the Audit Regulation require certain Swedish provisions to be annulled, as the matter will be regulated directly by the Regulation. Further, the Audit Regulation contains some provisions that have to be transposed into national law, as is the case with the rules in the Audit Directive. Some of the major amendments are presented below, together with the Inquiry’s proposals.</p>
<h2>General principles</h2>
<p>The general purpose of the new provisions on auditors and statutory audits is, firstly, to improve the quality of audits and, secondly, to ensure that the auditing rules make a greater contribution to financial stability. The regulatory framework is also intended to promote a less vulnerable market for auditing services.</p>
<p>One general principle of the Inquiry’s work has been to avoid increasing the administrative burden on companies beyond what is required by EU law. Regarding financial enterprises, however, account has been taken of the fact that stricter rules may be warranted in some cases, even if this leads to an increased administrative burden. When formulating proposals for public-interest entities, including provisions on audit committees and appointment of auditors, the Inquiry has as far as possible proceeded from and attempted to preserve the Swedish model of corporate governance.</p>
<h2>Definition of ‘public-interest entity’</h2>
<p>Stricter provisions apply to audits of public-interest entities than to audits of other entities. Furthermore, auditors and registered audit firms conducting audits of such entities are subject to more farreaching supervision. These entities are also subject to special requirements regarding audit committees, the appointment of auditors and other matters. The Inquiry does not consider that there is any reason for the stricter regulations to apply to entities other than those that under EU law must be regarded as public-interest entities. The Inquiry therefore proposes that the term ‘publicinterest entity’ shall cover undertakings whose transferable securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market and financial undertakings. The latter category includes companies that are authorised to conduct banking and financing business, certain securities companies and certain insurance companies.</p>
<h2>Audit firms from other Member States</h2>
<p>The new EU legislation makes it possible for audit firms that have been approved in one Member State to be registered and conduct statutory audits in other Member States as well. One condition is that the key audit partner responsible for conducting the audit on behalf of the firm must be approved in the Member State where the audit is being conducted.</p>
<p>A foreign firm that has been approved to conduct statutory audits in another EEA State is already treated as an audit firm under the Swedish Auditors Act, provided that the auditor conducting the audit is authorised or approved in Sweden. However, current national provisions do not allow such an audit firm to be registered as an audit firm in Sweden. Consequently, under current law, a foreign audit firm cannot be appointed auditor in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act and other provisions.</p>
<p>To implement the new EU legislation, the Inquiry proposes that an audit firm that has been approved elsewhere in the EEA shall have the right to be registered in Sweden. Since the registration is based on special grounds, i.e. on conditions other than those that apply to Swedish registered audit firms, the Inquiry proposes that such firms shall be called ‘registered EEA audit firms’. To conduct statutory audits in Sweden, an EEA audit firm will be required to entrust the principal responsibility for the audits it takes on to an auditor who is authorised or approved in Sweden. Registered EEA audit firms conducting statutory audits will be subject to the supervision of the Supervisory Board of Public Accountants ( Revisorsnämnden ) to the extent relevant to audits carried out in Sweden.</p>
<h2>The independence of auditors</h2>
<p>Several of the provisions concerning the independence of auditors in relation to their audit clients have been changed by the new legal instruments. The Audit Regulation introduces detailed rules on audit fees and the provision of non-audit services. The Regulation includes a catalogue of prohibited non-audit services. The Member States have some latitude to deviate from the catalogue by enacting stricter or more lenient national provisions. The Inquiry has found no reason to introduce prohibitions regarding additional non-audit services. However, the Inquiry proposes that it should be permissible to provide certain tax and valuation services to an audit client as long as the performance of these services does not affect the auditor’s independence according to specially designated criteria.</p>
<p>As a result of the changes in the Audit Directive, the prohibition against auditors taking up certain positions in the audited entity will apply to all auditors and not just to auditors conducting audits of public-interest entities, as was previously the case. The Inquiry proposes that the national provisions are amended accordingly. The Inquiry also proposes that auditors who violate this prohibition may be subject to an administrative pecuniary sanction. Auditors who have taken up a position with a client normally relinquish their authorisation or approval and are no longer subject to supervision by the Supervisory Board of Public Accountants. Consequently, in these cases disciplinary measures such as the withdrawal of authorisation or approval, a disciplinary reprimand or a disciplinary reminder have no effect. A pecuniary sanction, on the other hand, may serve as a more effective means of maintaining the prohibition.</p>
<h2>Design of the audit report</h2>
<p>The Amending Directive makes certain changes in the design of the audit report. These changes concern both formal and substantive requirements. To bring national provisions in line with the Directive, the Inquiry proposes that these provisions should prescribe that the report is to provide a statement on any material uncertainty relating to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.</p>
<p>However, beyond what is necessary to assess whether any such doubt exists, the scope of the statutory audit shall not include assurance on the future viability of the audited entity or the efficiency or effectiveness with which the management or administrative body has conducted or will conduct the affairs of the entity.</p>
<p>The Audit Regulation contains additional requirements on the design of the audit report in the case of statutory audits of publicinterest entities. These provisions introduce several new requirements regarding the content of the audit report. The Regulation is directly applicable and does not require any implementing measures. There is scope for the Member States to issue additional requirements regarding the design of the audit report. The Inquiry notes that in certain respects national requirements already goes further than the Directive and the Regulation. The Inquiry finds no reason to propose any new requirements regarding the audit report beyond what is prescribed in EU law.</p>
<h2>Supervision of auditors and registered audit firms</h2>
<p>The Audit Regulation contains provisions requiring the Member States to give the supervisory authority certain powers specified in the Regulation. The Inquiry proposes that the Supervisory Board of Public Accountants be given increased powers for the supervision of auditors and registered audit firms conducting audits of public-interest entities, where the supervision concerns such audits. For example, an audited public-interest entity will be obliged to provide information regarding the audit to the Supervisory Board of Public Accountants upon request and on pain of a financial penalty. It is also proposed that the Supervisory Board of Public Accountants be allowed to conduct an on-site investigation of an auditor or a registered audit firm when necessary.</p>
<p>To encourage employees to report infringements of the Audit Directive and the Audit Regulation, the Amending Directive introduces provisions on systems for reporting infringements (systems for ‘whistleblowers’). The Inquiry proposes that registered audit firms be obliged to provide effective systems for reporting suspected infringements of the provisions that apply to the firm’s activities.</p>
<h2>Disciplinary measures</h2>
<p>The Amending Directive introduces provisions on administrative measures and sanctions in the Audit Directive. These provisions are new and have no equivalent in the previous legal acts. The Inquiry proposes that the new disciplinary measures be placed among the existing measures prescribed in the Auditors Act. For example, a possibility will be introduced for the Supervisory Board of Public Accountants to order a temporary prohibition, for a maximum of three years, against engaging in auditing activities, signing audit reports or exercising the office of board member, substitute, managing director, deputy managing director, authorised signatory or senior clerk in an audit firm. A temporary prohibition can be used if the criteria for withdrawing authorisation, approval or registration are met but special grounds justify limiting the disciplinary measure to a temporary prohibition instead. A temporary prohibition can also be used if there is reason to issue a disciplinary reprimand and there are aggravating circumstances, but these circumstances are not so serious as to warrant a withdrawal of authorisation, approval or registration.</p>
<p>Another new sanction is the administrative pecuniary sanction. In the Inquiry’s opinion, this sanction is probably a criminal law sanction under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. This means that a procedure including imposition of a pecuniary sanction must be considered to constitute an accusation of a crime. Auditors have a statutory obligation to provide information. This obligation is subject to sanction in that auditors who do not cooperate in investigations by the Supervisory Board of Public Accountants may be subject to disciplinary measures. In view of the obligation of auditors to provide information, the imposition of a criminal law sanction may come into conflict with the protection provided in the European Convention against providing self-incriminating information (the right to remain silent). To meet the protection provided by the Convention in this regard, the Inquiry proposes that the pecuniary sanction shall only be used in the event of infringement of the rules prohibiting auditors from taking up positions in the audited entity within a certain time period. In these cases, exceptions are also proposed to the obligation to provide information that otherwise applies to auditors.</p>
<h2>Audit committees</h2>
<p>The amendments to the Audit Directive involve changes in the rules on audit committees. The possibility of a general exemption for public-interest entities other than listed companies from the obligation to have an audit committee has been removed. The Inquiry proposes that the national provisions on which companies are required to have an audit committee be amended accordingly. As previously, it is possible for companies to allow the governing board in its entirety to perform the duties of the audit committee. The Inquiry therefore proposes that this option be retained.</p>
<p>The Audit Directive also allows the exemption of certain types of public-interest entities from the obligation to have an audit committee. Given that an audit committee may be considered of value primarily in large entities and that the costs of establishing such committees are not negligible, the Inquiry proposes that the possibility of exempting certain entities from the obligation to have an audit committee should be used. The entities concerned are subsidiaries, undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities (UCITS), alternative investment funds, companies whose only business is to issue certain types of securities, and non-listed credit institutions.</p>
<p>There are also some new provisions regarding the duties of the audit committee. Mainly, the committee’s duties have been defined more precisely, but some new duties are also introduced. The audit committee still has the role of preparing matters of business and informing the governing board in matters covered by the committee’s responsibilities. The governing board remains fully responsible for the organisation of the company and the management of its affairs. The Inquiry proposes that the provisions of company law relating to the duties of the audit committee be amended in accordance with the Amending Directive.</p>
<p>According to the proposed legislation, the audit committee is required to inform the governing board of the outcome of the statutory audit. It shall also explain how the audit contributed to the integrity of the financial reporting and the role of the audit committee in that process. In addition, the audit committee is obliged to keep itself informed of the outcome of the quality control of the entity’s auditor carried out by the Supervisory Board of Public Accountants. The audit committee is also responsible for the procedure of selecting the auditor and recommending the auditor to be appointed.</p>
<h2>Appointment of auditors</h2>
<p>The Audit Regulation contains special provisions on the appointment of auditors in public-interest entities. The general rule is that the appointment of auditors in such entities must be preceded by a special selection procedure. The provisions on the special selection procedure are contained in the Audit Regulation and do not require implementation measures in national law. As mentioned, the organisation of the selection procedure is one of the duties of the audit committee. However, the Inquiry proposes that publicinterest entities that have a nomination committee in which the shareholders or members have considerable influence shall have the right to let this committee perform the duties of the audit committee regarding the appointment of auditors.</p>
<p>The Amending Directive introduces a prohibition against contractual clauses limiting the general meeting’s choice of auditor to certain categories or lists of auditors. Any such existing clauses shall be null and void. As the Inquiry understands it, these provisions target for example conditions to this effect in the articles of association and conditions in contracts with third parties, such as loan agreements. The Inquiry proposes that provisions on prohibited conditions be introduced in the company law legislation. Publicinterest entities will have a statutory obligation to inform the Swedish Competition Authority ( Konkurrensverket ) without delay if a third party attempts to introduce a contractual condition to this effect.</p>
<h2>Duration of the audit engagement</h2>
<p>In order to strengthen the independence of auditors, the Audit Regulation contains new rules on the duration of the audit engagement in public-interest entities. The provisions apply to all publicinterest entities and allow no possibility of limiting their scope to listed companies. One dimension of the rules is the introduction of mandatory rotation not just of individual auditors but also of audit firms. An audit engagement in a public-interest entity must last for at least one year and neither the first engagement nor this engagement combined with renewed engagements may have a duration exceeding ten years. After this, the auditor or audit firm may only conduct an audit of the audited entity after a cooling-off period of four years.</p>
<p>As the rules on the duration of the audit engagement are given in the Audit Regulation, equivalent national provisions must be annulled. However, the Regulation does allow the Member States to prescribe certain exemptions from the rules of the Regulation in this respect. The Inquiry proposes that some of these possibilities should be used.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes the introduction in national law of rules permitting public-interest entities to extend the engagement to a total of twenty years, provided that a new selection procedure is organised when the engagement has lasted for ten years. Moreover, provided that an additional auditor is engaged when the engagement has lasted for ten years, the audit engagement may be extended to a total of twenty-four years. The proposed provisions on extension of the duration of the audit engagement are derogations from the Regulation’s rules regarding the rotation of audit firms and do not apply when a natural person has been appointed as a company’s auditor. Under the Inquiry’s proposal, the possibility of extending the duration of the audit engagement beyond ten years by virtue of the provisions on derogations referred to will not apply to financial public-interest entities.</p>
<p>The rules of the Audit Regulation on rotation of auditors require the key audit partners to cease their participation in the audit engagement no later than seven years after the date of their appointment. After that, they may not participate in the auditing of the audited entity until a cooling-off period of three years has elapsed. As the reasons for rotation are even more compelling when a natural person has been appointed auditor, the Inquiry proposes the introduction in national law of provisions regarding personal audit engagements stating that engagements in publicinterest entities may not last for more than seven years. It follows directly from the Audit Regulation that a cooling-off period of four years is then required before the auditor can again take on an audit engagement in the entity. There is no possibility of prescribing any other waiting period by derogation from the Regulation.</p>
<h2>Dismissal of auditor after a court action</h2>
<p>Under current Swedish law, auditors may only be dismissed pre- maturely on objective grounds. These provisions were introduced as a result of the rules in the Audit Directive. The Amending Directive has brought in additional rules on the dismissal of audi- tors in the Audit Directive. The rules apply only to auditors with engagements in public-interest entities. They state that it must be possible for a minority of shareholders representing five per cent or more of the votes or capital in a public-interest entity, a body in the audited entity or a specific public authority to bring a claim before a national court for the dismissal of the entity’s auditor if objective grounds exist for doing so.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes the introduction in company law of rules on the possibility of bringing a claim before a court for the pre- mature dismissal of an auditor. In addition to a minority of share- holders, the governing board and the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority ( Finansinspektionen ) shall have the right to bring a claim for the dismissal of an auditor.</p>
