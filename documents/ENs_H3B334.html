<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The inquiry, which has adopted the name Inquiry into Prohibition on Promotion, has been commissioned to propose legislative changes which are necessary if the wording of the provisions of section 38, subs. 1 of the Lotteries Act (1994:1000) is to make no difference between Swedish and foreign lotteries, and to formulate penal provisions of section 54, subs. 2 of the Lotteries Act concerning violation of prohibition on promotion in such a way that it shall refer to all violations of this prohibition, irrespective of whether the promotion concerns a Swedish lottery without a permit or a foreign lottery. The inquiry shall furthermore consider a system of orders or prohibitions subject to fines which shall apply immediately (refer to Fi Directive, 2014:06).</p>
<p>The Swedish lottery legislation goes back to the middle of 19-th century, since which time it has been regarded as prohibition legislation. In principle, it has been forbidden to arrange lotteries without a permit. The current Lotteries Act came into force on 1 January 1995 and is to a large extent based on the Lotteries Ordinance of 1939 (1939:207) and the Lotteries Act (1982:1011). The supervisory authority in this area is the Swedish Gambling Authority.</p>
<p>Over the years several inquiries in the area of lotteries have been conducted. The Inquiry into Prohibition on Promotion has been preceded by the Lotteries Inquiry (Swedish Government Official Reports SOU 2006:11) and Gaming Inquiry (SOU 2006:124), which have both investigated partly the same issues as the Inquiry into Prohibition on Promotion, albeit with a wider mandate. These inquiries have not, however, led to new legislation.</p>
<p>The Swedish gaming market had a turnover of approximately 50 billion SEK in 2013, of which 47 billion SEK came from actors who had a permit to conduct business in Sweden, so called regulated actors, and 3 billion SEK came from actors who did not have such a permit in Sweden, so called unregulated actors. As regards marketing activities the relationship is reverse. The regulated actors spent 1.1 billion SEK in 2014, as compared with the unregulated actor’s expenditure of just over 2.6 billion SEK.</p>
<p>About two percent of the adult population in Sweden can be referred to as problem gamblers. Another 400 000 persons are at risk of developing gambling problems. There is a large turnover among problem gamblers and this, taken together with the fact that gambling problems lead to various social difficulties, health problems and financial worries for whole families, makes that considerably more people have negative experiences with gambling.</p>
<h2>Prohibition on promotion</h2>
<p>The prohibition on promotion regulated by section 38, subs. 1 of the Lotteries Act provides that it is not permitted, in commercial operations or otherwise for the purpose of profit, to promote participation in unlawful lotteries arranged within the country or in lotteries arranged outside the country. The Supreme Administrative Court stated in its ruling (Yearbook of the Supreme Administrative Court, RÅ 2004, ref. 95) that the provisions have been formulated in an unfortunate way, but stressed at the same time that they do not imply discrimination. The prohibition applies to both Swedish and foreign lotteries which have not obtained a permit.</p>
<p>The Inquiry into Prohibition on Promotion proposes that the provisions shall be formulated in such a way that it shall not be permitted in commercial operations or otherwise for the purpose of profit to promote participation in a lottery which has not been arranged in accordance with the provisions of the Lotteries Act. The amendment is more of an editorial kind, and does not imply any extension of the scope of the prohibition on promotion.</p>
<p>The penal provisions linked to the prohibition on promotion can be found in section 54 of the Lotteries Act. Section 54 states that a fine or a maximum of six months’ imprisonment shall be imposed on persons who, in the course of business or otherwise for the purpose of profit, intentionally and unlawfully promote participation in a lottery arranged outside the country if the promotion particularly relates to participation from Sweden. The formulation of this section has been the object of criticism delivered, among other institutions, by the Council on Legislation already at the time of the introduction of the provisions. The provisions were criticised for stipulating that criminal sanctions should be applied only for the promotion of participation in lotteries arranged in countries outside Sweden, and not for the promotion of lotteries without permits in Sweden. The latter can be subject to criminal sanctions only in the form of complicity to commit crime against the provisions of the Lotteries Act in accordance with section 54, subs. 1, pursuant to chapter 23, section 4 of the Penal Code. The area of criminal liability regarding promotion of participation in Swedish lotteries without a permit is thus narrower than it is for foreign lotteries which in some cases risk receiving more severe punishment. The Supreme Court stated in its judgment (Supreme Court Reports, NJA, 2012, p. 1 073), where two editors-in-chief were facing charges, that this was contrary to EU law, and acquitted the editors. The decision was based on the preliminary ruling that had been obtained in the case.</p>
<p>As a result the unregulated actors conduct widespread marketing practices in Sweden. The Inquiry into Prohibition on Promotion has proposed that section 54 of the Lotteries Act shall be formulated so that it includes all promotion of and participation in lotteries which have not been arranged pursuant to the provisions of the Lotteries Act. The change implies a certain extension of the criminal liability area in that even promotion of participation in a lottery arranged in Sweden without a permit, which at the present time cannot be punished in certain cases under the charge of complicity pursuant to the provisions of chapter 23, section 4 of the Penal Code, will now be included.</p>
<h2>Fines with immediate effect</h2>
<p>Orders and prohibitions subject to a fine are regulated by section 52 of the Lotteries Act. In accordance with the latter the supervisory authorities may issue, under the penalty of a fine, orders and prohibitions required for compliance with the Act and with any directions and conditions issued in accordance with the provisions of the Act. In has often been difficult to recover fines in practice, since both a decision concerning a fine and a decision on the imposition of a fine can be appealed against to three instances, and, as a result, by the time the decision becomes unappealable the event in question may well have ceased. The Inquiry into Prohibition on Promotion proposes that the Swedish Gambling Authority may decide that an order or prohibition subject to a fine, pertaining to the prohibition on promotion as provided in section 38 of the Lotteries Act, shall apply with immediate effect. The Swedish Gambling Authority has to decide in each individual case whether it is necessary to impose a fine with immediate effect in the case in question.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>The proposals of the Inquiry into Prohibition on Promotion are assumed to lead to a certain increase in the working load, primarily with regard to the Gambling Authority and the judiciary, at least in the beginning. It is considered that such increased work load can be handled with the current resources. With regard to compulsive gamblers the proposal is assumed to bring positive effects due to the fact that marketing of the unregulated actors should decrease.</p>
