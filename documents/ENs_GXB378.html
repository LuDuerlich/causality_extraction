<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>The remit of the Commission was decided at the Cabinet meeting on 16 October 2008. It is stated in the terms of reference (ToR 2008:127), that due to an increasingly hardened social climate it can be questioned whether the present security arrangements in the courts are adequate. The question was, therefore, whether there is a need to widen the scope to apply security checks in courts in accordance with the Act on Security Checks at Court Hearings (1981:1064). Part of the remit was to identify security risks and threats in society targeting the courts. In the event that a need to widen the scope to apply security checks at courts was identified, the terms of reference instruct the Commission to propose relevant amendments to the law. The remit also tasked the Commission to consider certain other issues in relation to the Act on Security Checks at Court Hearings.</p>
<p>In light of recent changes in society, in particular crime development since the Act on Security Checks at Court Hearings was last amended almost ten years ago, the Commission has found that there exists an undisputed need to widen the scope to apply security checks in the courts. Specific events that have affected the courts in particular can also be mentioned in this context, such as the knifing at Östersund District Court in 2001 and the explosions outside Umeå District Court in 2003, as well as the murders that took place during court hearings in Landshut and Dresden in Germany in 2009. There is also a need for increased security at hearings other than in criminal cases, and this also includes the administrative courts.</p>
<p>In order to apply a security check – either general or specific – under current law, a specific risk of a crime being committed must exist, which represents a serious danger to another person’s life, health or freedom, or of extensive destruction of property. However, it is the Commission’s view, that for a security check to be conducted, all that should be required in the future, is that the check is intended</p>
<p>to prevent  the commission of such a crime. If the Commission’s proposal is adopted, it should be more widely possible to apply security checks even in the event of a more or less abstract  threat, which does not necessarily need to be linked to a specific hearing. It should, of course, as is currently the case, also be possible to conduct security checks when a specific risk indication actually exists , primarily in connection with a specific main hearing or other session being held.</p>
<p>In practice, therefore, the proposal means that the scope to ensure safety in courts would be widened, as the threshold for when security checks can be conducted would be lowered. But it will also be possible to make more far-reaching decisions than is the case today, when a decision is naturally linked to a specific hearing being held. In the report, the term permanent  security check is used for this type of check. This would typically take the form of entrance checks, using archway metal detectors that are placed in the entrance to the court – similar to what is already used in places such as the Riksdag (Swedish Parliament).</p>
<p>According to the proposal, a decision to apply a permanent security check – i.e. over a longer period of time – as a result of an abstract threat picture may be based on experiences from previous security checks, e.g. when large numbers of dangerous objects have been confiscated or other incidences have occurred. Another cause could be a large number of criminal hearings being held simultaneously concerning serious violence or gang crime, as well as the occurrence of gang or family rivalry that affects the court’s jurisdiction. In addition, indicators of a threat against the staff of the court, against the prosecutor and others who customarily represent a government authority in court, or against barristers should be sufficient reason to conduct a more continuous security arrangement of this kind. The same applies when there is a threat scenario emanating from local socially disruptive groups. The Commission would like to generally highlight the connection between disturbance of public order and security risks, and underlines the general importance of Swedish courts – regardless of their use of security checks – more frequently hiring or employing uniformed security officers in order to, as necessary, maintain order in the courthouse and thus minimise security risks.</p>
<p>When considering applying a security check – whether or not there is a specific threat – due consideration must be given in every case to the important principle of proportionality, so that an adequate</p>
<p>level of protection is achieved with as little encroachment as possible on the individual’s constitutionally protected rights. To apply security checks over a longer period of time should not become a routine process and must be subject to regular review.</p>
<p>In light of the new model for risk assessment, the Commission proposes that there should only be one  type of security check in the future. It is therefore proposed, that the current distinction between ‘general’ and ‘specific’ security checks be abandoned.</p>
<p>In cases where the security check does not cover the entire court, the buildings or the hearing concerned must be specified in the decision. As is presently the case, it should be possible to conduct security checks in several locations within the courthouse itself at the same time.</p>
<p>Current provisions state that security checks must be carried out, if possible, by a police officer. However, following a decision by the police authority, security officers are allowed to conduct general security checks under the supervision of a police officer. They are also allowed to assist a police officer in conducting a specific security check. But as the Commission is now proposing that the scope for applying security checks be widened, it will not be practical in the future for police officers to participate in security checks to the extent that they do today. Under the proposal, it will therefore be possible for security checks to be carried out by a security officer – preferably as a first resort – but closely following instructions from the police authority or under the supervision of a police officer.</p>
<p>At the same time, police officers will still be able to carry out security checks. If there is a specific indication of a threat the court will be able to decide that the security check must be carried out by a police officer, who will then have the right to conduct a body search and check bags in ways other than with the use of a metal detector or similar device.</p>
<p>Unlike current regulations, there will be no need for consultation with the police authority prior to implementing a security check, if this is deemed unnecessary, for example in connection with the type of permanent security checks at which the police are perhaps not expected to be physically present. However, a decision to have a police officer carry out the security check (in other words, not just a security officer) must always be preceded by consultation with the police authority. Moreover, the prosecutor must always be</p>
<p>consulted before a decision is taken on security checks prior to a specific criminal hearing.</p>
<p>It must be for the Chief Judge of the court, or another person who has been authorized to make the decision, to make decisions on security checks, which are not limited to a specific court hearing. Changes in the organisation for preparing the docket and cases, which are now central to the work of the courts, have led the Commission to propose that the Chief Judge or the person who otherwise has the authority, should, in the future, without restrictions be able to decide to conduct security checks; this also applies to security checks in connection with a specific hearing, which is a widening of current regulations. It should be possible for this last category of decisions to be taken by the court or, if the hearing has not yet begun, by the designated Chairman.</p>
<p>Under current law, persons who do not allow their bags or other items to be searched in connection with a security check shall, if it is deemed appropriate, be given the option to leave the item in storage. It has emerged during the course of the Commission’s work that the option of refusing to store items is hardly used. However, items that have been left for storage do, of course, constitute a potential security risk. For this reason, the Commission proposes that it should no longer be possible to leave for storage items that have not been checked at the security check point. Persons who do not allow a search to be conducted should be refused entry.</p>
<p>Part of the remit was to consider whether the exemption for certain categories of people from having to undergo security check should apply without exception to barristers and interpreters. The Commission’s view is that this exemption should still apply to barristers and those who fulfil a public function or have public assignments. The option to limit the group of people who are universally exempt from general security checks arose in light of the practical problems that general exceptions can lead to, especially at larger courts. For ‘permanent’ security officers and police officers serving at the courts, it is easier if there are few general exceptions for various categories of people. It is therefore proposed that the scope of application for the option to limit the group of people, otherwise exempt from checks, be extended to all security checks, regardless of whether they are checks on visitors entering into the courthouse, or e.g. entering an individual hearing room.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposal concerns all courts in Sweden. However, the Commission assumes that there will only be a limited</p>
<p>number of courts – an estimated 10–15 courts – that at any given time would have reason to apply permanent security checks, i.e. over a longer period of time. The proposal will bring about a rise in costs. However, it is difficult to estimate an accurate figure. The only costs that can be calculated accurately are those for the recruitment of new security officers and the purchase of technical equipment. In addition, there are costs of making alterations to courthouses, etc. It is in the interest of society to be able to hold safe and open court hearings – a core activity in any state governed by the rule of law – and the increased costs should therefore, in the Commission’s view, primarily be covered by increased appropriations. If it is not an option to provide additional resources, these costs should be covered by raising fees or a redistribution of the existing funds available in the budget appropriation for the Swedish courts (which comprise the courts and the administrative agency, the National Courts Administration).</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Commission’s proposals of amendments to the law enter into force on 1 January 2011.</p>
