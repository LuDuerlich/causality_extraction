<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Treatments that are performed to alter a person’s appearance are a consumer service that may involve a significant health risk. At present the market for these treatments is partly unregulated, resulting in serious gaps in the conditions for consumers to undergo safe treatment. The Inquiry’s remit has been to consider what changes are necessary to ensure that individuals are given good and safe treatment and that adequate consumer protection is in place. In order to strengthen the protection of individuals undergoing appearance-altering treatments that may involve a significant health risk, the Inquiry proposes: – a new act on  appearance-altering treatments that may involve a significant health risk; and – a national online information service that provides impartial information about  appearance-altering treatments that may involve a significant health risk.</p>
<p>Appearance-altering treatments that may involve a significant health risk encompass a broad and diverse spectrum of different actors, treatments and regulatory frameworks.</p>
<p>At present there is no overall regulation of the conditions under which these treatments may be performed. A number of government agencies have different supervisory responsibilities, and there is a certain lack of clarity about where these responsibilities begin and end. The lack of statistics makes it difficult to ascertain the number of service providers, the incidence of various treatments and potential complications, and the development of the market. Furthermore, there are no particular requirements for service providers concerning their duty to provide information or have insurance, or concerning the skills required to perform different treatments.</p>
<p>There are also shortcomings in the conditions enabling consumers to make an active and conscious choice, as there is a lack of easily accessible, comprehensive and impartial information on which regulations apply, what undergoing such treatments may entail, and any potential risks involved. In the competitive market for appearance-altering treatments, it can also be difficult for consumers to discern what information is important for a given treatment.</p>
<h2>Basic premises</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals encompass treatments that are performed to alter a person’s appearance and that may involve a significant health risk . That a treatment may involve a significant health risk means that it may transmit infection, result in serious injury or illness, or cause lasting harm. Moreover, the Inquiry considers that appearance-altering treatments are a consumer service , which means that consumer protection regulations apply.</p>
<p>The Inquiry wants to make it clear that the treatments in question do not  fall within the regulations governing the health and medical care sector, as the purpose of these treatments generally speaking does not involve the medical prevention, investigation or treatment of illness or injury. Consequently, they do not fall under the definition of medical treatment. Although certain appearancealtering treatments are indeed performed within the framework of health and medical care, these treatments are for medical or reconstructive reasons. This type of treatment is not included in the Inquiry’s remit.</p>
<h2>Proposal for a new act on treatments that are performed to alter a person’s appearance and that may involve a significant health risk</h2>
<p>The conditions for ensuring that individuals are given good and safe treatment will improve through a new consumer protection act. The purpose of the act is to strengthen consumer protection by placing more stringent requirements on service providers. The Inquiry would like to emphasise that appearance-altering treatments that may involve a significant health risk are a consumer service and not part of health and medical care. A clear regulatory framework will also provide improved control over service providers. Statutory regulations will also make it easier for consumers to assert their rights in the event of a dispute with a service provider.</p>
<p>The scope and contents of the act</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the act apply to appearance-altering treatments that do not constitute medical or healthcare treatments and that a service provider performs on a consumer. Furthermore, the act will only apply to treatments that are associated with significant health risk. Examples of treatments covered by the act include surgical procedures, injections, tattoos, piercings, laser treatments, IPL treatment and dermabrasio.</p>
<p>The proposed act contains provisions on service providers (e.g. licences, patient safety measures and staff), treatment (e.g. information, consent and health declaration), documentation (e.g. information management, documentation obligations and consumer rights), complaints (procedures for consumers), supervision (e.g. competent supervisory authorities and their powers, and recordkeeping), cooperation between government agencies, and penalties.</p>
<p>Distinctive features of this new act are proposals to: – limit certain treatments to specific professional groups; – introduce a licence requirement for service providers offering  appearance-altering treatments that may involve a significant health risk; – appoint municipalities and the Health and Social Care Inspectorate as competent supervisory authorities; and – establish a national register of licensed service providers.</p>
<p>Surgical procedures and injections may only be performed by specific professional groups</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that treatments involving surgical procedures may be only performed by authorised physicians or authorised dentists in their respective areas of expertise. Treatments involving injections directly under the skin (subcutaneous) or deeper may only be performed by authorised physicians, authorised dentists, registered nurses or registered dental hygienists in their respective areas of expertise. The term ‘respective areas of expertise’ means the area in which the authorised or registered professional can be expected to have developed formal and actual skills.</p>
<p>Licence requirement to be introduced</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that service providers covered by the new act must be licensed. This means that the current notification requirement for providers offering ‘hygienic services’ involving the use of needles or scalpels, contained in the Swedish Environmental Code, will no longer apply and will be replaced by a licence requirement. This licence requirement will also apply to providers of hygienic services that are currently not covered by any form of notification requirement, but which are considered to be associated with a significant health risk, e.g. laser and IPL treatments.</p>
<p>Licence applications are to be submitted to the municipal board in the municipality where the services are to be provided. The licence will be regarded as certification that the service provider was approved at the most recent supervisory review and, accordingly, the review should not be perceived as applying forward in time.</p>
<p>This proposal also means that service providers offering treatments within the regulatory framework of health and medical care and under the new act on appearance-altering treatments must both notify the Health and Social Care Inspectorate of their activities in accordance with Chapter 2, Section 1 of the Patient Safety Act and apply for a licence from the municipality.</p>
<p>Supervision</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that municipalities be appointed as competent supervisory authorities for all providers covered by the act. The proposed act means that municipalities’ supervisory remit is accordingly expanded to also include the supervision of service providers in which licensed staff offer appearance-altering treatments that may involve a significant health risk. It should be a form of ‘system supervision’ in the sense that municipalities ensure that the object of the inspection is capable of controlling and directing its activities in accordance with the applicable regulatory framework. However, inspection will not include assessment of professional or qualification requirements, or inspection of the techniques and technologies used.</p>
<p>If there are grounds to do so, municipalities must notify the Health and Social Care Inspectorate about service providers with licensed staff, e.g. in the event of deficiencies in hygiene routines or a lack of stipulated documentation. The Inspectorate is also entitled to independently conduct checks, following notification or on its own initiative, of individual licensed practitioners.</p>
<p>New national register of licensed service providers</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Health and Social Care Inspectorate is to be responsible for a national register of service providers licensed to carry out activities under this act. As the register is to be accessible nationally, consumers will easily be able to find information about service providers, e.g. whether they have a licence, which treatments they are licensed to perform, where the services are provided and who is responsible for the activities.</p>
<h2>Proposal for a national online consumer information service</h2>
<p>It is of the utmost importance that consumers are better able to access factual and impartial information, as the services in question may involve significant health risk. As these treatments are being offered in a growing commercial market, the motive of financial profit should not be underestimated in this context. The more aware consumers are about the risks associated with a contemplated treatment, the better equipped they will be to make well-considered choices about what they are willing to expose their bodies and health to.</p>
<p>Being well-informed also empowers individuals and strengthens their ability to protect themselves. It is also in the interest of society that consumers of appearance-altering treatments are well informed, as the cost of potential complications could burden the public health and medical care sector. The information service is to: – be primarily tailored to consumers; – involve cooperation between relevant government agencies to ensure that the information is factual and impartial; and – contribute to providing information about the attendant rights and responsibilities of all concerned parties before, during and after  appearance-altering treatments.</p>
<p>An online information service can effectively meet the need for comprehensive, impartial information. Although the information service aims to inform consumers before a treatment is performed, post-treatment problems will also need to be dealt with. The information service must not  be a body for lodging complaints, or an intermediary service for contacts with or recommendations of service providers offering appearance-altering treatments.</p>
<p>Cooperation between government agencies</p>
<p>To ensure that consumers can be confident of the information provided, the information service should be based on cooperation between relevant government agencies.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Swedish Consumer Agency have primary responsibility for the information service. It is also proposed that the following agencies cooperate and have responsibility for their respective areas of expertise: the National Board of Health and Welfare, the Health and Social Care Inspectorate, the Public Health Agency of Sweden, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority, the Medical Products Agency, the Swedish Chemicals Agency and the National Board for Consumer Disputes. The</p>
<p>Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions should also be included because of the supervisory responsibility municipalities will have for hygienic service providers offering appearance-altering treatments.</p>
<h2>Other proposals</h2>
<p>The remit of the Inquiry also includes assessing whether a specific minimum age requirement is necessary for treatments involving a significant health risk and whether a mandatory insurance requirement should be introduced for service providers.</p>
<p>No general minimum age requirement to undergo appearance-altering treatments that may involve a significant health risk</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes no general minimum age requirement, as it considers that the protection already in place under the Children and Parents Code (1949:381), the Social Services Act (2001:453) and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is sufficient societal protection for children under the age of 18 who wish to undergo appearance-altering treatments that may involve a significant health risk. The Inquiry recommends, however, that developments are monitored and that an appropriate agency is assigned to more closely assess, on the one hand, which treatments</p>
<p>– as a result of medical risks to health or cultural reasons – may be considered to need a particular minimum age requirement or recommendation and, on the other hand, whether any exemptions should be made.</p>
<p>Appearance-altering treatments are a consumer service and a personal matter, and from a consumer perspective the question of whether children under 18 years of age should be allowed to undergo such treatments is primarily a matter between the custodial parent and the child.</p>
<p>If a general minimum age requirement of 18 years were to be introduced for appearance-altering treatments, this would mean that children with embarrassing hair growth, prominent ears or disfiguring scars, or children with severe acne, would not be able to have these treatments before the age of 18.</p>
<p>No mandatory insurance requirement for service providers</p>
<p>The Inquiry does not propose any form of insurance solution for personal injury in connection with appearance-altering treatments that may involve a significant health risk. These treatments are a consumer service offered under various terms and conditions in a commercial market. It is the responsibility of consumers to keep themselves informed about insurance protection for a given treatment and supplement their insurance coverage accordingly.</p>
<p>Treatment insurance taken by the service provider should provide the consumer relevant insurance protection against injury incurred during treatment. However, it has proven difficult to require taking out such insurance. In light of the fact that there is currently no overall regulation of these appearance-altering treatments and that several different types of service have been assessed as being high risk, it is not possible at present for service providers operating in ‘high risk activities’ to carry insurance that covers different forms of injury resulting from treatment.</p>
