<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In an interim report (Government Official Report 2010:40) the Committee mapped out and discussed circular migration and development in detail and at an overarching level. That survey and discussion provides the basis for the positions and proposals presented in this final report.</p>
<p>A central issue for the Committee is how the concept of circular migration should be viewed. The Committee deems that a strict definition of the concept is not suitable, and that all migration movements that include a movement to a country and then back to the country of origin constitute a form of circular migration. In some cases the movement is repeated several times and becomes recurring circular migration.</p>
<p>As a result of its discussion of circular migration, the Committee has established that a life-cycle perspective on migration must be adopted in order to fully understand what takes place and what impact it will have on development. People who have immigrated to our country may later become circular migrants. Some migrants move several times between different countries and most migrants move frequently between different countries, often without actually “moving” in the formal sense. Furthermore, we are of the view that the target group for these policy proposals is all migrants, irrespective of why they came to Sweden or on what grounds they obtained a residence permit, and independent of why a migrant leaves Sweden and perhaps chooses to return.</p>
<p>In order to describe circular migration patterns that are measurable in official statistics, the Committee requested Statistics Sweden (SCB) to carry out a revision of existing statistics. In statistical terms, circular migrants are defined as all individuals who cross a national border at least twice. Statistics show that over 2 000 000 circular moves involving Sweden have been made since 1969. Over 850 000 people made circular moves to or from Sweden, and about 280 000 of them currently live here. A large proportion of the circular migrants are people born in Sweden, and among those born abroad most come from another Nordic country. Evidently, geographic proximity is of major importance for migration but, at the same time, globalisation is clearly having an effect on migration patterns. Inter-Nordic circular migration was largely predominant up to the 1990s but has subsequently decreased slightly while migration exchanges with the EU member states and countries such as India and China have increased.</p>
<p>In the international debate on circular migration, the phenomenon is often described as having three winners. The circular migrant benefits from the move by improving his/her living conditions and broadening his/her competence and experience. The country the migrant moves to acquires additional experience and competence and the migrant fills an opening in the labour market that otherwise would have been difficult to fill. The country of origin benefits both from money that the migrants send to their families, which the families use as they see fit, and from the competence and experience acquired by the migrant when he/she returns for longer or shorter periods of time. The Committee has also found that knowledge, experience and values are conveyed back to countries of origin from diasporas even when not connected with a physical move (so-called “virtual circulation”). In all that is essential, the Committee supports this positive view of circular migration and development.</p>
<p>In many countries, including within the EU, the concept of circular migration is often equated with programmes for labour migration exchanges between countries, often for certain limited parts of the labour market. Usually such programmes are based on bilateral agreements between countries. The Committee calls this managed  circular migration and, instead, recommends the promotion of spontaneous  circular migration, that is to say a system where the individual him/herself decides when he or she should migrate and where the individual employer decides whether to employ labour from a third country. With this approach as a point of departure, all migrants in Sweden can be regarded as potential circular migrants. Analogously, all people born in Sweden are potential circular migrants since it cannot be ruled out that some of them will move from Sweden and at a later stage come back here again. Research and experience show that in order to create the preconditions for integration and perhaps, down the road, circular migration, a form of residence permit where the migrant to the greatest extent possible can decide over his or her life, is most advantageous.</p>
<p>Development is a very complex concept and there are many factors that affect a country’s development. However, the Committee is of the view that through his or her activities and behaviour, an individual migrant can affect development in the country of origin. For example, a migrant may send home money to his/her family, which perhaps makes schooling and hospital care possible. Some of the money sent home is also invested in various ways. Furthermore, the migrant brings competence and knowledge as well as new values with him or her in connection with longer or shorter stays in the country of origin.</p>
<p>The Committee deems that diasporas play an important role in the development of countries of origin. Many in the diaspora are strongly committed to the development of their countries of origin, either on an individual basis or as part of expat associations or diaspora organisations. 14 percent of Sweden’s population is foreign-born. Correspondingly, Sweden also has a diaspora abroad. It is estimated that 250 000 Swedes live abroad. Furthermore, 170 000 migrants born abroad that lived for a period in Sweden moved abroad during the 2000s. This Swedish diaspora abroad is of importance for the development in Sweden.</p>
<h2>Points of departure</h2>
<p>An essential point of departure for the Committee is that migration is something positive and beneficial to our society. Demographic developments in Sweden and labour market needs contribute to the need for migration. In order to be able to compete for international labour Sweden must be an attractive country for migrants.</p>
<p>The Committee has considered the labour immigration reform from December 2008 a basis for its proposals. During the two years the new rules have been in force, some 14 000 labour immigrants have come to Sweden annually, for a long or short period of work. Over a third of these are people with higher education, while about half have little or no formal education.</p>
<p>In its work, the Committee has examined in particular three groups of migrants and the ways in which they can contribute to development. At the same time, it is emphasized that all migrant independent of their reasons for coming to Sweden have a potential of influencing the development in their countries of origin. The special groups concerns labour migrants who enter the labour market in Sweden directly and fill a need here. Many of them intend to return to their countries of origin with their new experience. Through their stay in Sweden, international students can add to their competence and experience which may later be beneficial to the country of origin. Entrepreneurs with a foreign background who start businesses in their country of origin contribute to development and create employment. In the same way, entrepreneurs who start businesses in Sweden contribute to development and employment here.</p>
<h2>Facilitating circular migration</h2>
<p>In order to make it easier for circular migrants to move between different countries the Committee examined the concept of permanent residency permits and residency requirements. The Committee proposes an exemption to the rule that a permanent residence permit is to be revoked when residence ceases. The proposal means that a permanent residence permit may be revoked at the earliest five years after residence in Sweden has ceased. A precondition for this is that the person who wishes to retain his/her permanent residence permit must notify the authorities before departure. This exemption provides additional security for the migrant insofar as the tie to Sweden can continue despite that residency ceases for a certain period.</p>
<p>Increasing globalisation places new demands on policies and legislation regarding aliens. The Committee is of the view that in the long term it should be possible to consider changes to basic concepts such as the residency requirement in the legislation.</p>
<p>The Committee has observed that a naturalised Swedish citizen may in some cases have to relinquish his or her Swedish citizenship in connection with a move back to the country of origin. This is mainly in cases where the country of origin does not generally accept dual citizenship or does not accept dual citizenship for certain political or government posts. To increase opportunities for circular migration the Committee proposes that the requirements for reacquiring Swedish citizenship be somewhat simplified. The Committee proposes that the current provision requiring prior residence in Sweden for a total of ten years should no longer need to be fulfilled before  the age of eighteen. A strong tie to Sweden based on ten years’ prior residence can be attained even though residence was during adulthood.</p>
<h2>Labour immigrants</h2>
<p>The Committee is of the view that more labour immigrants should be able to come to Sweden. There is a shortage of skilled labour in parts of the labour market, which may be reinforced by the demographic structure. Many labour immigrants intend from the beginning to become circular migrants and with their new experience of the labour market have good chances of contributing to development in their countries of origin. This makes them particularly interesting from a migration and development perspective.</p>
<p>In order to make the rules for labour immigration more flexible, it is proposed that it should be possible to grant time-limited work permits even after the four year period at which a person is able to apply for permanent residency, if there are special reasons for doing so. The proposal will make it easier for people who do not intend to settle in Sweden but who want to work in Sweden periodically for short periods. The proposal will also make it easier for people who have been outside the labour market for periods, for example due to parental or sick leave.</p>
<p>Another proposal which aims to make the rules more flexible and thereby make it easier for labour migrants is extension of the qualification period for a permanent residence permit in Sweden. The proposal means that the total qualification period of four years with a time-limited residence permit to work can be fulfilled within an eight year period, instead of a five year period as is the case today.</p>
<p>As a result of current eligibility requirements with regard to failed asylum seekers who wish to “change queues” and apply for a temporary residence permit for work, only a limited group qualify, although the number of applications that have been approved increased slightly last year. Furthermore, many applications are rejected. In light of this, the Committee has found reason to propose a certain relaxation of the requirements for a “queue change” for failed asylum seekers who have found employment. The simplifications include changing the requirement of at least six months’ employment to qualify as a labour immigrant to three months’ employment. In addition, a possibility is introduced of meeting the requirement for a “queue change” through two employments. In the Committee’s view, the deadline for submitting an application for a “queue change”, following a negative decision on asylum that is final and non-appealable, should be extended from two to four weeks. The Committee also proposes that family members who have not themselves sought asylum should be able to obtain a temporary residence permit on grounds of ties to a person who has changed queue from failed asylum seeker to labour immigrant.</p>
<p>The Committee considers that in order to preserve the labour immigration reform, potential abuses must be addressed. The reform largely fulfils its purpose, however in some sectors employers have not lived up to the requirements under the system of rules. The Committee deems that problems with certain employers who do not fulfil promised working conditions call for a broad review in the near future.</p>
<h2>Self-employed persons</h2>
<p>Self-employed persons are an important group of migrants both for development in Sweden and in countries of origin. The Committee establishes that the framework of rules for immigration of entrepreneurs from third countries enables migrants to move here with an existing business or to start a business here. The Committee considers it desirable that more self-employed persons come to Sweden and has therefore looked into the difficulties that may exist for this group. A fundamental question is what requirements should be placed on the business plan that is the basis for the application and which authority is best able to judge the business plan.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the Government task an independent actor to investigate how the economic assessment of business plans should be performed and what basic material should be required of the applicant. The aim is to facilitate movement and make it possible for more entrepreneurs to come to Sweden and start businesses here.</p>
<p>To promote the development potential of migration for countries of origin, support, mainly in the form of counselling, will be offered to entrepreneurs with their origin in developing countries who want to start businesses in their home countries. A project focusing on support for businessmen in post-conflict countries existed previously and the Committee is of the view that it is of major importance that this is continued. In addition, there is a need to extend the target group to include persons from other developing countries.</p>
<h2>International students</h2>
<p>International students are a large and important group of migrants. This is a migrant group that has steadily increased in number in recent years. However, compared with previous years the number of applications for the upcoming autumn term has strongly decreased as a result of the introduction of fees for international students from third countries. International students may be regarded as circular migrants right from the start, since it is usually their intention to stay in Sweden for a limited time. At the same time they get their education in Sweden and return to their counties of origin with newly acquired knowledge and experience that can contribute to the development of the country of origin. The Committee presents several proposals that may contribute to an increase in the number of international students that come to Sweden to study and in this way contribute to development in Sweden as well as in the country of origin.</p>
<p>For those accepted for education at research level, the Committee proposes that a new type of permit be introduced, a residence permit for doctoral students. This form of permit should, for example, mean a possibility of qualifying for a permanent residence permit.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that members of the family of persons granted a residence permit for studies at university or college, and who have been granted a time-limited residence permit, should also be granted a work permit. This can on the one hand increase Sweden’s attractiveness for international students and, on the other, imply an addition of in many cases qualified labour in Sweden. If the accompanying family member extends his or her qualifications and experiences, this can contribute positively to developments in the country of origin on return.</p>
<p>The Committee further proposes that international students be able to stay in Sweden for six months after completing their studies to find gainful employment here. If they find work in Sweden they can both contribute to the Swedish labour market and supplement their education with work experience which may be of importance in the case of a possible future return to their country of origin.</p>
<p>The Committee has established that the introduction of fees for international students from third countries in connection with studies at Swedish universities and colleges has resulted in a decline in the number of students coming here. This may be negative for people from poor countries, that is to say those countries that have most to gain from education of their young people. The Government has introduced a grants system for students from third countries. However, the Committee considers the grants system should be extended so that more international students from third countries may be awarded grants to study in Sweden. The Committee therefore proposes that the grants programme addressed to all students from third countries be increased by a further SEK 30 million. It is further proposed that the grants programme administered by the Swedish Institute, which is addressed to students from countries with which Sweden carries on long-term development cooperation, be increased by an additional SEK 20 million. The Committee judges this grants programme to be of particular importance for promoting circular migration and development.</p>
<h2>Portability of social security benefits</h2>
<p>Within the EU there is coordination of social security, which is a precondition for free movement and which also acts as an incentive to inhabitants to move between the Member States. Social security is also of major importance for movement in relation to third countries. The possibility to take earned rights from one country to another can be of decisive importance for a decision to move between countries. Swedish social security benefits are either residence-based or employment-based. The employment-based benefits are largely portable. For example, income-based retirement pension may be taken to any country in the world.</p>
<p>The Committee has carried out a survey of which social security benefits can be taken to third countries and, at the same time, considered the possibility of increasing the portability of residencebased benefits in relation to third countries. The Committee stresses that it is crucial that work on developing the portability of social security between Sweden and third countries and between the EU and third countries, continues and developes further. In addition, in cooperation with third countries, Sweden should support them in their efforts to develop their social insurance. In the light of the fact that residence-based benefits are tax funded, that there is a danger of double insurance, a lack of reciprocity and also that such a proposal would mean a major modification of the basic design of social insurance, the Committee establishes that a change towards increased portability regarding the residence-based benefits should not be considered at this stage.</p>
<p>The Committee considered changes regarding the sickness benefit based income (SGI) for a person working abroad. The Committee proposes that a person who has worked abroad and returns within five years, within three months’ prolonged protection as from the day after his/her arrival in Sweden should recover at least the SGI that applied immediately before departure. Further deliberations with reference to a proposal of this nature or the formulation of alternative solutions we leave to the Cross-party  Committee on Social Insurance .</p>
<p>In order to simplify and promote circular migration, the Committee considers it should be possible, given certain conditions, and to the same extent as in the EU, for job seekers with unemployment benefit to seek employment in third countries for three months while retaining their Swedish unemployment benefit. However, the final formulation of such a proposal needs to be further elaborated.</p>
<h2>Increasing the positive development effects of circular migration</h2>
<p>A central task of the Committee is to look into how the positive development effects of migration can be promoted. The development to which migrants contribute takes place both through the circular migration that is already going on and through the ties to and relations with the home country that migrants have even when they are in Sweden. The Committee is of the view that the role of the state is to support and facilitate these ongoing processes in different ways and thereby strengthen the existing development potential.</p>
<h2>Development effects resulting from efforts of the diaspora</h2>
<p>Increasing attention at the international level, and nowadays also in Sweden, is given to the large flows of money, remittances, that migrants send home to their families in countries of origin. The sum of this private money is estimated to be several times larger than the total development assistance that developed countries send to developing countries.</p>
<p>The Committee establishes that in many cases the fees charged today by banks and different financial institutions to transfer money home to families are disproportionately high. The Committee therefore proposes that the Government instruct, for example, the Swedish Consumer Agency in its consumer guidance in accordance with international models and World Bank models, to construct an Internet service where the consumer can find the cheapest service for transferring a given amount of money to a given country. A service of this nature will mean that a larger share of the money will reach recipients and contribute to the development.</p>
<p>Collective remittances, money collected by the diaspora used to give support to the country of origin, have greatly increased in scale. This refers partly to money collected in campaigns and partly to larger philanthropic contributions. Some of the collective remittances are used for more long-term development projects, a large share is used for more short-term relief work in connection with various kinds of disasters. Analysts are of the view that these collective remittances are as large as, or larger than, total international development assistance. The Committee proposes that in a three-year pilot scheme the Government contribute to development projects initiated by a diaspora organisation or other association of members of a diaspora, an amount equivalent to the amount they themselves can mobilise. A committee specially appointed for the purpose at the proposed Resource Centre for Diasporas should evaluate and assess applications to avoid funds being paid to activities that do not have the desired development potential.</p>
<p>The Resource Centre should also give support in different ways to diaspora organisations and other associations of members of diaporas to take part in development in their countries of origin. This can be effected by giving diasporas professional support on the one hand to plan their development activities and, on the other, in the implementation of the projects. This support can be given through counselling and customised courses. Another function may be to build and maintain networks for diaspora organisations and other association in diasporas. The Resource Centre should have a long-term mandate since this is a process that can be expected to take several years before it reaches full impact.</p>
<h2>Development effects resulting from circular movement</h2>
<p>The Committee has established that there is a desire and preparedness among members of the diaspora in Sweden to return to their country of origin for a limited time in order to engange in development-relevant activities. Experience has shown that the expertise needed for the further development of a country has often moved out and can be found in the diaspora. These people in the diaspora are in many cases highly motivated to contribute to the development of their country of origin by working there. We consider that in their development work Swedish authorities and organisations should note and utilise the qualified resource available in parts of the diaspora in Sweden to a greater extent than is the case today. The Committee proposes that a newly established Resource Centre for Diasporas be instructed as part of its remit to create, by means of informational efforts and in other ways, meeting places for people in the diaspora who want to contribute to the development of their country of origin. The Resource Centre should also undertake efforts to ensure an increase in the supply of voluntary activities and the like, that link the diaspora in Sweden with activities in the country of origin relevant in a development context. A special grants programme will also be set up to enable to some extent participation in activities important for development.</p>
<p>The newly established Resource Centre will be tasked to collect applications showing interest from members with expert competence in the diaspora who can constitute a resource base for projects. It should be possible to give financial support to experts who carry out individual expert efforts in their countries of origin. The activities of the Centre should be evaluated after three years.</p>
<h2>Development effects through the Swedish diaspora abroad</h2>
<p>The committee deems that the resource which the Swedish diaspora abroad constitutes, irrespective of whether it consists of persons born in Sweden or of migrants that have lived here a time, should be used to a greater extent to promote Swedish interests. Many embassies and consulates already carry on active cooperation with this diaspora today, however the Committee proposes that missions abroad be instructed to, in their activities, systematically create interfaces with the whole of the extended Swedish diaspora.</p>
<h2>Swedish authorities’ circular migration efforts</h2>
<p>Sweden’s policy for circular migration and development must as far as possible be based on knowledge of circular migration streams and the effects of migration on development. Continued development of the policy area is furthered by increasing knowledge. The Committee assesses that it should be possible for the authorities that keep statistics to get more out of the basic material that has already been collected. However, there is also reason to consider whether other basic data need to be collected and if they need to be organised differently for it to be possible to describe modern migration. The Committee therefore proposes that the Government commission Statistics Sweden, Sida and the Swedish Migration Board, jointly and in cooperation with researchers, to specify what new demands should be made on statistics relating to migration in order to describe and offer basic data for future research and civic information on migration. The Committee also underscores the importance of further research that sheds light on circular migration and development from a life-cycle perspective.</p>
<p>Based on the conclusions the Committee has drawn during its work, we deem that questions regarding circular migration and its development potential should be given greater attention than is the case today in the Swedish public administration. A policy for circular migration and development comprises policies in several policy areas. The Committee wants all authorities together in their respective policy area to influence the whole issue of circular migration and development in a positive direction.</p>
<p>Sida and the Swedish Migration Board have interests in common regarding circular migration and development. Increased cooperation in which different perspectives are further interwoven and cooperation between Sida and the Migration Board is intensified should produce synergy effects for both authorities. The Committee proposes that the Government task Sida and the Swedish Migration Board jointly to submit a survey of the areas of the migration and development concept where they can cooperate to achieve synergy effects.</p>
<p>Part of the mandate of several authorities and state companies is to give support and advice to entrepreneurs with a foreign background and/or with companies established abroad. The Committee considers there is reason to bring together representatives of the relevant authorities and state companies to discuss the matter of advice and support to self-employed persons with a foreign background who want to start a business in their country of origin. The purpose of this is to build on the experience of support for the creation of new businesses and establishment abroad in the respective area.</p>
<p>The Committee underscores the importance of good integration. A positive connection between circular migration and development presupposes that through his or her own competence and development the migrant can also contribute to developments in his or her country of origin. It is therefore essential that migrants are well integrated and hence obtain employment that is relevant to their own education and previous experience. In this context it should also be stressed that discrimination is a major problem. It is essential for development in Sweden and in the countries of origin that we can utilise the competence and knowledge of people of different backgrounds and experience. A functioning and efficient process for validation of foreign education and experience is of vital importance in this regard. The Committee emphasises that a functioning and efficient process for validation of foreign education and experience is of utmost importance for promoting circular migration and development. The Committee further proposes that the Government task the Swedish National Agency for Higher Vocational Education, the Swedish National Agency for Higher Education, the Swedish Agency for Higher Education Services (VHS) and other Swedish authorities with a validation mandate to submit proposals for how cooperation with relevant actors in some important countries of origin should be formulated. This is in order to develop competence and knowledge of validation in the latter, to facilitate circular migration between Sweden and these countries.</p>
<p>The Committee also establishes that in order to continue to attract potential circular migrants to Sweden, Sweden must be attractive to migrants both during their stay here and when engaging in circular migration. In addition to the general image of Sweden, this concerns on the one hand the reception of migrants in Sweden and their opportunities to develop during their time here and, on the other, the conditions offered during their stay in Sweden. An important part of efforts to promote Sweden as an alternative for labour migrants consists of informational efforts about Sweden and the Swedish labour market. Extensive work is already ongoing to market and spread information about Sweden, not least at Swedish embassies abroad. The Committee proposes that the Swedish Institute be requested to further develop the website Working in Sweden . The Swedish Institute’s mandate should also be broadened to also include information about Sweden directed to previous migrants in Sweden. Development work should be initiated to see how this category can be reached.</p>
<p>The practical preconditions for moving between different countries can also be of major importance for the individual’s decision to migrate. The Committee stresses that everyday life for migrants must function in a satisfactory way. Practical difficulties for people who come to Sweden can have an inhibitory effect on circular migration.</p>
<h2>Future policy for circular migration and development</h2>
<p>The Committee points out a few areas where we believe there will be reason in future to continue to further strengthen policies for circular migration and development.</p>
<p>In recent years, a new awareness has emerged that migrants may in many respects be bearers of innovation and development between countries. This new awareness means there is an increasing demand for bridges between migration policy and global development policy. This insight should influence the formulation of Swedish</p>
<p>development cooperation policies in future. The Committee considers it is increasingly important that diasporas from the countries with which Sweden carries on development cooperation become involved in this process of change. If we can optimally utilise diasporas’ and migrants’ experience and knowledge, they may be both a valuable addition to Swedish development and signify a channel out from Sweden of ideas and energy for positive change.</p>
<p>An area of central importance if circular migration is to contribute to development both here in Sweden and in the country of origin is that the preconditions for circular migration are made easier. The Committee’s proposals in many ways facilitate preconditions but the Committee is of the view that further changes will be needed in this area in the future. The Committee considers that there are many things that speak in favour of a permanent residence permit actually being permanent and that further steps in that direction are necessary in order to continue to make Sweden attractive both to migrants and circular migrants. A continued discussion is needed of how the right for third country citizens to reside in Sweden should be formulated.</p>
<p>Another area of key importance to make it easier for circular migrants is that it should be possible for earned rights to move with the migrant. It is the Committee’s conviction that, with the new migration patterns, policy development must continue to move in the direction of an increase in the portability of social rights. The survey the Committee has carried out leads to the conclusion that a continued comprehensive discussion of how we should view the residency concept in the future is necessary. In a not too distant future there may be a need to seriously consider and re-examine whether residency, as it is currently defined, should continue to be what designates the tie to Sweden. The Committee considers that one of the major challenges ahead is to enable global families to maintain daily life that may sometimes reach over several different countries and discussions of how this is best done must continue.</p>
<p>When people constantly change their manner of moving and migrating between different countries it is essential that policies are adapted accordingly. The Committee is therefore of the opinion that there is a need to continue to follow developments and make further changes in a direction that promotes increased movement, removes obstacles and “lock-in effects” and increases the development potential of migration.</p>
<p>The Committee presents a number of different proposals but has also carried out a number of assessments that have given rise to different recommendations. In summary the Committee’s more concrete proposals are as follows.</p>
<p>• A provision should be introduced to the effect that, following notification of the Swedish Migration Board, a permanent residence permit may at the earliest be revoked when five years have passed after residence in this country has ceased.</p>
<p>• It will be easier to reacquire Swedish citizenship in that the requirement of residence in this country for a total of ten years need no longer be fulfilled before the age of eighteen.</p>
<p>• It shall be possible to grant  time-limited work permits for a total period longer than four years if there are special reasons for doing so.</p>
<p>• The qualifying period for a permanent residence permit for persons who have held a temporary residence permit for work for a total of four years, shall be extended from five to eight years.</p>
<p>• Eligibility requirements for failed asylum seekers who wish to apply for temporary residence permits for work be modified so that instead of six months’ employment during the processing time, three months’ employment shall be sufficient. In addition, a possibility to fulfil the requirements through two employments shall be introduced. Lastly, the deadline for submission of the application shall be extended from two to four weeks.</p>
<p>• A provision should be introduced enabling family reunification between labour immigrants who were previously asylum seekers and members of their families who were not themselves asylum seekers.</p>
<p>• An independent actor be tasked to examine how the economic assessment of business plans should be performed when applications for residence permits for carrying out business activities are submitted. Furthermore, it should be examined what basic data should be required of the applicant, and also how the efficiency of the process can be improved in order to shorten processing times.</p>
<p>• Counselling and support through Swedish authorities shall be offered to entrepreneurs with their origin in developing countries who want to start activities in their home countries.</p>
<p>• A new type of permit should be introduced for persons from third countries who have been accepted for education at research level, a residence permit for doctoral students.</p>
<p>• It shall be possible to grant a work permit also to members of the family of persons granted a residence permit for studies at a university or college, and who have been granted a  time-limited permit.</p>
<p>• A possibility should be introduced of granting international students, whose studies are ongoing for at least two terms, a residence permit for a period of six months after completing their studies.</p>
<p>• Grants to international students from third countries shall be increased. It is proposed that the study programme addressed to all students from third countries be increased by SEK 30 million. An increase of SEK 20 million is proposed for the study programme administered by the Swedish Institute which is addressed to students from countries with which Sweden carries on  long-term development cooperation.</p>
<p>• A possibility should be introduced for those who work abroad to regain sickness benefit based on income (SGI) if they return to Sweden within five years. Further deliberations with reference to such a proposal or the elaboration of alternative solutions is left to the  Cross-party  Committee on Social Insurance .</p>
<p>• Unemployed persons entitled to Swedish unemployment benefit shall on certain conditions be able during a period of three months to apply for work in a third country while retaining their Swedish unemployment benefit. The final formulation of this proposal needs to be further reviewed.</p>
<p>• A resource centre should be set up for diaspora organisations. Its task shall consist of giving support in different ways to diaspora organisations and other associations in their development efforts in the country of origin. Furthermore, a grants programme shall be introduced in order to facilitate shorter development contributions in the country of origin. Moreover,</p>
<p>it should be possible to give financial support to individuals for expert efforts in the country of origin.</p>
<p>• An authority, for example the Swedish Consumer Agency, should be requested to set up a website where consumers can compare the costs of transferring a given sum of money to a given country through different operators.</p>
<p>• In a  three-year pilot scheme, the state shall contribute development assistance funds to development projects initiated by a diaspora organisation or other association of members of the diaspora. The amount shall be the equivalent of what the diaspora organisation or association itself contributes.</p>
<p>• Missions abroad shall be instructed to systematically create in their activities interfaces with the whole of the extended Swedish diaspora. The result of these contacts shall be reported and evaluated after three years.</p>
<p>• Statistics Sweden, Sida and the Swedish Migration Board should be tasked jointly and in collaboration with researchers, to specify what new requirements should be imposed on statistics relating to migration.</p>
<p>• The Government shall inform relevant authorities of the connections between circular migration and development.</p>
<p>• Sida and the Swedish Migration Board should be instructed to jointly look into the parts of the concept migration and development in which authorities can cooperate to achieve synergy effects. The assignment shall be reported within six months.</p>
<p>• An appropriate authority should be requested to see to it that public authorities and companies compile experience of counselling efforts for persons with a foreign background who want to start a company or already have a company in Sweden. The authority shall also describe how this experience can be used to support people who want to start a company in their countries of origin.</p>
<p>• The Swedish National Agency for Higher Vocational Education, the Swedish National Agency for Higher Education, the Swedish Agency for Higher Education Services and other Swedish authorities with a validation mandate should be requested to submit proposals for how cooperation with relevant actors in</p>
<p>some important countries of origin may be formulated in order to develop competence and knowledge of validation in these countries.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Institute should be requested to further develop the website  Working in Sweden,  partly to give information about the labour market to former migrants.</p>
