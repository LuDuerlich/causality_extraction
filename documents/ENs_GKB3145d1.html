<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>According to our terms of reference we have had three principal tasks: · to analyse the  long-term consequences of alternative forms of shorter working time, · to investigate ways in which flexible provisions for working time can be introduced in Swedish legislation, · to investigate the consequences of the EC Working Time Directive on the Swedish regulatory system in the working time sphere.</p>
<p>The third issue was to be given priority, and we presented an interim report concerning the consequences of the EC Directive in September 1995.</p>
<p>This final report contains our considerations and proposals with regard to the issues in our terms of reference. We have requested a number of research reports which are presented in an appendix to this report.</p>
<p>In this summary, we briefly present our deliberations and considerations regarding the various chapters of the report. We begin, however, by highlighting the principal considerations in the report.</p>
<h2>Principal considerations</h2>
<p>According to our terms of reference, a central point of departure is that issues concerning working time are to be regulated, as far as possible, in agreements between the social partners. We suggest that this should involve both the length and location of working time. We propose that a new Working Hours Act should contain a direct invitation to the social partners to conclude agreements on these matters. It is of great importance that the social partners regulate collective reductions in working hours as</p>
<p>well as greater flexibility in collective agreements. The role of the legislator should be to encourage the social partners to assume responsibility for such a development.</p>
<p>We propose a new Working Hours Act which should apply under civil law. This implies a strengthening of the responsibilities of the social partners for working time issues, and also that dispensations granted by the National Board of Occupational Health, and the supervision carried out by the Board, will disappear.</p>
<p>A new Working Hours Act under civil law underlines the need to make it clear that working time is part of the work environment. We propose therefore, that this be made explicit in the legislation by a general reference in the Working Hours Act to the Work Environment Act.</p>
<p>The new Working Hours Act implements the provisions set out in the EC Directive, which means that the provisional implementation decided on by the Parliament, may be replaced.</p>
<p>According to our terms of reference, the employee’s possibilities of influencing the location of his or her working time should be considered. We propose that a central aspect of a new Working Hours Act should be a principle of good work organisation, suggesting that, within the limits of the line of activity in the company or administration, working time should be organised and located with respect to the differing needs and wishes of employees.</p>
<p>Furthermore, every employee must be entitled to have his or her requests concerning the length and location of working time objectively assessed by the employer. The employee’s requests must be complied with if they are compatible with the requirements of the company or administration.</p>
<p>Moreover, we propose that the employee be entitled to make use of annual leave exceeding four weeks, as well as accumulated annual leave, in other ways than as full days, if this can be agreed by the employee and the employer.</p>
<p>We consider that our proposals to strengthen the influence of the individual employee concerning various aspects of working time, should improve the possibilities of parents to combine work with family responsibilities. We also suggest an amendment to the Parental Leave Act, which strengthens the influence of the employee concerning partial parental leave.</p>
<p>There is a development towards more flexible working time arrangements. We have been assigned to suggest more flexible working time legislation.</p>
<p>We stress, however, that more flexible legislation must not lead to weaker provisions on workers’ health and safety. The legislation should therefore combine provisions on health and safety with possibilities of flexible working time arrangements. We consider that further flexibility needs to be allowed for in collective agreements. We suggest certain provisions which should be binding in the sense that deviations can only be made if the worker is afforded a period of compensatory rest or, if that is not possible, appropriate protection.</p>
<p>Every worker shall be afforded a work break, at the latest after six hours’ work. In certain cases work breaks may be replaced by meal breaks. In addition to work breaks, every worker shall be allowed to take the necessary work pauses.</p>
<p>Every worker shall be afforded a minimum daily rest period of eleven consecutive hours per 24-hour period (daily rest). The so-called night work prohibition is deleted.</p>
<p>Every worker is afforded a minimum rest period of thirty-five consecutive hours in every seven-day period (weekly rest period).</p>
<p>Maximum weekly working time, overtime included, may not exceed an average of 48 hours per week over a reference period of four months. The reference period may be extended in collective agreements to a maximum of twelve months.</p>
<p>Hours of work for night workers shall be limited to an average of eight hours per 24-hour period, over a reference period of a maximum of four months. For night workers whose work involves special hazards or heavy physical or mental strain, the hours of work shall be limited to eight hours in any period of 24 hours during which they perform night work.</p>
<p>However, with the aim of strengthening the elements of flexibility in the legislation, we propose certain amendments. Greater flexibility can be achieved if working time issues can be dealt with to a greater extent at the company or administration level. Furthermore, the social partners should be able to decide at this level on derogations to adapt the legal provisions to various local needs and prerequisites. We therefore suggest that the</p>
<p>legislation be neutral as to at which level within the trade unions, derogations from the legal provisions are decided.</p>
<p>We propose that regular working time is the time which has been agreed in the individual employment contract. According to present legislation, regular weekly working time may not exceed 40 hours. We propose that regular weekly working time may not exceed 40 hours, but that it may be calculated as an average over a period of no more than ten weeks. A longer period on which the average is based may be agreed in collective agreements.</p>
<p>If variations in the demand for labour can be met to a larger extent within the limits of regular working time, the need for overtime should decrease. We propose a limitation of the right to use overtime from 200 hours per year to 100 hours per year. In addition, it will be possible to set off overtime against periods of compensatory rest, which means that overtime can be used in a more flexible way.</p>
<p>Reduced working time, as compared to the provisions set out by the present Working Hours Act, has already been realized for a vast majority of employees. This reduction is a consequence of the way that collective agreements are designed. In addition, agreements on reduced working time have been made at a company level, often in combination with a flexible location of working time.</p>
<p>Our assignment has not been to propose a general reduction of workinghours. As regards the consequences of alternative forms of reduced working time, we have particularly stressed the possible effects on employment. We have come to the conclusion that, on the basis of theoretical research, it is not possible to advocate a general reduction of working-hours with the aim of reducing unemployment. However, the empirical findings differ to a considerable extent and we therefore suggest that the possibility of a decreased unemployment as a result of a reduction of working-hours, cannot be eliminated. Furthermore, we point out that there are a number of reasons in the welfare sphere which tend to favour shorter working-hours.</p>
<p>A number of alternative working time arrangements are under way in the labour-market, in some cases involving shorter working time. We consider this to be a positive development which should be supported. We therefore suggest that government funds be directed towards interdisciplinary studies of these issues within the framework of existing research funds. We also propose that the government provides incentives for further</p>
<p>working time arrangements at a company level, involving shorter working time. The government should, at the same time, offer research support during the period in which the project is undertaken.</p>
<p>A study of national differences in working time reveals that the Swedes work neither the longest nor the shortest working-hours. We point out that such comparisons are very difficult to make due to differences in methods of measurement.</p>
<p>On the basis of the statistical material, we nonetheless wish to point out the following:</p>
<p>· the number of average hours usually worked per week by those who work full time in Sweden, exceeds the average figure in most of the countries included in the study,</p>
<p>· the number of average hours actually worked per week/per employee is less in Sweden than in most of the countries included in the study,</p>
<p>· the number of average hours actually worked per year/per employee is less in Sweden than in most of the countries included in the study,</p>
<p>· the number of average hours actually worked per year/per person in the population in Sweden, exceeds the average figure in most of the countries included in the study,</p>
<p>· the proportion of  part-time employees in Sweden is higher than in most of the countries included in the study.</p>
<p>The labour-market is segmented by gender. 56 per cent of the women in the labour force work in the public sector, while 44 per cent work in the private sector. The corresponding figures for men in the labour market are 22 per cent in the public sector, and 78 per cent in the private sector. Changing working times could therefore affect women and men in different ways.</p>
