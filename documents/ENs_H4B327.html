<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As users’ communication patterns change, letter volumes are declining. The current rules on overnight delivery and a price cap were introduced almost two decades ago when the conditions for rapid digital communication were not the same as they are today. The Inquiry’s objective is therefore to devise rules to secure the provision of a universal postal service throughout the country at affordable prices, without state support. The obligations on the universal service provider must be proportionate while meeting the future needs of users.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore proposes that the overnight delivery requirement of the universal postal service shall be replaced with a two-day basic service for letter delivery, whereby 95 per cent of all letters must be delivered no later than on the second working day, counting from the day of deposit. This proposal is to secure the provision of a universal postal service that effectively meets society’s need to send letters, also in the future.</p>
<p>Tariff increases for letters weighing up to 250 grams deposited under the new service will be limited by a price cap that can be adapted to the anticipated decline in volumes. Through this proposal, regulation of tariffs will continue to guarantee a basic service at an affordable price for users who send letters.</p>
<p>With its proposals, the Inquiry wishes to maintain the value of the letter as a symbol of a means of communication that is secure and reliable – delivery without fail.</p>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit for this first part mainly comprised the following elements.  Assess which groups in society need overnight delivery of letters as part of the universal postal service, and in particular analyse and assess the need for postal services in various types of remote and rural areas.  Describe the consequences of a discontinuation of the overnight delivery of letters as part of the universal postal service and propose how an alternative postal service could be designed, provided on market terms for overnight delivered mail items. In addition, assess how the basic level for the  cross-border postal service can be maintained, and consider in the analysis that the conditions are different in different parts of the country.  Investigate the current price cap regulation under the Postal Services Ordinance (2010:1049) and, in doing so, analyse in particular the effects of the price regulation in Chapter 3, Section 2 of the Postal Services Act (2010:1045).  Look into whether there are still groups in society without any alternative to Postnord Group AB (Postnord) who thus need to be protected by a price cap, and if this is the case, propose an appropriate  price-cap regulation.  Describe the consequences of a discontinuation of the price cap, and analyse the market situation and the possibilities for competing businesses to enter the market and sustain operations.  Draw up any necessary legislative proposals.</p>
<h2>Applicable law</h2>
<p>Chapter 3, Section 1 of the Postal Services Act contains a description of the scope of the universal postal service and an authorisation for the Government or the authority designated by the Government to issue requirements concerning time limit for routing. In Section 6 of the Postal Services Ordinance, the Government lays down that the universal postal service is to meet the requirement of delivering on the next working day throughout the country at least 85 per cent of the letters deposited for overnight delivery before the last collection time notified, wherever in the country they are posted. At least 97 per cent of these letters must be delivered within three consecutive working days. The requirement concerning how many letters must be delivered has been adapted on the basis of costs, the willingness of customers to pay, Sweden’s geography and climate, and the basic level that is required for cross-border mail under the Postal Services Directive.</p>
<p>The Government has also used its authority under Chapter 3, Section 3 of the Postal Services Act to issue regulations specifying that prices for services included in postal activities and covered by the universal postal service must not exceed certain levels. Under Section 9 of the Postal Services Ordinance, the universal service provider may not, per calendar year, increase prices for domestic conveyance of single postal items referred to in Section 6, first paragraph, and which weigh at most 500 grams, by more than the alteration in the consumer price index between July in the immediately preceding year and July in the year before that. The purpose of this price cap is, together with the provision on affordable prices for the universal postal service, to protect users without any alternative to Postnord from excessively high tariffs when posting single mail items.</p>
<p>The provisions of the Postal Services Act on pricing for the universal postal service are contained in Chapter 3, Section 2 of the Postal Services Act. Under this regulation, the pricing of the universal postal service shall be transparent, non-discriminatory and cost-oriented, and give incentives for an efficient universal service provision.</p>
<h2>Two-day delivery time and high reliability</h2>
<p>The vast majority of letters that are currently regarded as urgent will in the future be sent digitally. The Inquiry has read the report that the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority commissioned concerning the need for overnight delivery among private individuals and small business owners. The Inquiry has also commissioned interviews with representatives of several organisations and public actors about their needs. The reports show that in many cases it is not essential to the users that their letters arrive the next day instead of in two or sometimes three days’ time. Regulated overnight delivery is therefore no longer justified. However, there is still a general need for letters to be delivered, which is why it is necessary to maintain regulations concerning the domestic conveyance of letters. The Inquiry proposes the introduction of a requirement that letters be delivered within two days as a basic service of the universal postal service and the discontinuation of overnight delivery.</p>
<p>During the course of the Inquiry it emerged that the users of postal services place great value on knowing when  at the latest their letters will arrive. The current requirement that 85 per cent of the letters conveyed overnight must be delivered on the subsequent working day should therefore be raised. To safeguard the quality of postal services in the long term, the Inquiry proposes that 95 per cent of the letters posted for delivery in two days’ time must be delivered within two working days. The quality requirement must apply throughout the country, regardless of where a letter is deposited.</p>
<p>It will therefore be possible to ensure users’ needs are met in the future too, while the designated postal operator will be able to avoid the additional costs that the overnight delivery requirement entails and that is in ever declining demand.</p>
<h2>Quality requirement for cross-border mail</h2>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes special regulation of the quality requirement for cross-border mail within the European Union to meet the requirements placed on Sweden in the Postal Services Directive. Sweden currently lacks such a requirement. To ensure through regulation that Sweden is meeting the requirements of the Postal Services Directive concerning cross-border postal services, the Inquiry considers it appropriate to establish a special regulation concerning cross-border mail when the quality requirement for overnight delivery is abolished. The requirement is limited to postal items weighing up to 2 kg and applies to postal items sent for delivery within the fastest standard category. The quality requirements are in line with the requirements contained in Annex II of the Postal Services Directive, which means that at least 85 per cent of postal items must be delivered no later than the third working day counting from the day of deposit, and at least 97 per cent no later than the fifth working day from the day of deposit. We do not propose any particular national follow-up requirement for crossborder mail; instead, follow-up should be carried out, as previously, by the International Post Corporation.</p>
<p>The aim of and need for a price cap can change over time. The current price cap, which applies to domestic conveyance of single postal items weighing up to 500 grams deposited for overnight delivery, was introduced in 1998. The main aim of this was to protect consumers against excessively high prices. Above all, the Government wanted to ensure affordable prices for those consumers who lacked alternatives to Posten AB (now Postnord Group AB). Another important aim of the price cap was to counter cross-subsidisation between Postnord’s postal services that are subject to competition and those who are not.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has had an investigation carried out into the priorities of private individuals when posting letters and selected groups’ access to and interest in digital alternatives. The aim was to assess whether there are groups worthy of protection due to the fact that they would not have any alternative to Postnord when sending letters, if tariffs were raised. These investigations indicate that there will be groups in the future that would benefit from tariffs being kept at a regulated level, primarily small businesses in remote and rural areas and older private individuals. However, it has been difficult to establish how great the need is for regulated tariffs as no statistics are available on how many letters these groups send.</p>
<p>Neither the postal regulations nor the legislative history clarify what is meant by the pricing of the universal postal service having to be cost-oriented. In light of the fact that the current regulation on cost orientation is difficult to apply and the threat that unclear legislation would pose to long-term sustainable competition, the Inquiry considers that at present, it is primarily the risk of crossubsidisation that justifies a price cap. Without a price cap in the section of the letters market not subject to competition, tariffs would probably be raised.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that no such competition will emerge in the foreseeable future as to entail price pressure on the market covered by a price cap regulation. This assessment has been made in light of the declining letters market, future digitalisation and the high barriers to market entry.</p>
<p>Price regulation in the Postal Services Ordinance should be amended to apply to single letters weighing up to 250 grams to be delivered within two working days. The new weight limit is justified as it covers as much as 97 per cent of the single items of correspondence sent domestically that are currently distributed overnight. In the Inquiry’s view, the current link to the consumer price index should be kept as the basis for the price cap. The price cap should be made more flexible by introducing a parameter that takes into account how the designated provider’s cost structure changes for changes in volumes of items of correspondence weighing up to 250 grams. The Swedish Post and Telecom Authority shall at three-year intervals decide the size of this parameter. On the introduction of a new price cap, the Government should establish a new cost base as a starting point for the price cap.</p>
<h2>Impact assessment of the proposals</h2>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the two-day delivery time combined with an increased delivery guarantee requirement of 95 per cent will have mainly positive consequences for the postal market stakeholders. Users may initially feel that the new quality requirement means deterioration in the postal service as they will no longer be able to send a letter at a standard tariff for overnight delivery to all parts of the country. However, one positive consequence for users will be that the regulated quality of services is increased and ensured in the longer term with the new quality requirement. The proposal will have positive consequences for Postnord, as it will lead to savings and enable greater efficiency. On the other hand, the proposal will not have any major consequences for competing postal operators or the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority.</p>
<p>Further, the proposed price cap framework will not have any major consequences for users and competitors compared with the current price cap. However, Postnord will be able to set tariffs to take greater account of changing costs in the event of changes in volumes of the services covered by the price cap. The proposal thus creates the conditions for long-term sustainable regulation. The disadvantage of the proposed price cap is that its design is more complex than the current price cap, which may increase the administrative costs for both Postnord and the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has calculated, on the basis of information from Postnord, that the discontinuation of overnight delivery will reduce the company’s net costs by SEK 250–300 million per year (savings in terms of air transport and increased costs for information campaigns). These savings must be placed against the users’ increasingly limited need to send letters for overnight delivery, both now and in the future. The Inquiry has not been able to show that removing the overnight delivery requirement would have such serious consequences for users that the costs of maintaining the service can be considered proportionate.</p>
<p>At present, 22 per cent of the mail items addressed to domestic recipients for overnight delivery are sent by airmail. Air transport is necessary to guarantee overnight delivery for domestic letters throughout the country. According to Postnord, the carbon dioxide emissions from airmail services that could be replaced with twoday delivery would amount to approximately 7 500 tonnes gross. Such a high level of flight emissions is the equivalent of a climate impact that is approximately twice as large because of emissions other than carbon dioxide that have a greater climate impact at high altitude. If the airmail services in question were replaced by rail transportation – which is already used to deliver mail items across the country – the climate impact of the transportation of letters previously sent via airmail would essentially be reduced to zero. This is assuming that no great number of customers transfer to</p>
<p>Postnord’s overnight express delivery service. The Inquiry considers that this is unlikely considering the relatively high price of the service and the reduced need for overnight delivery of mail items that has been identified.</p>
