<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>Our remit has been to chart the protection currently provided for sensitive information handled within the framework of international cooperation for peace and security in which Sweden is participating. Our remit has also included analysing what consequences disclosure of such information may have for Sweden, Swedish interests and the cooperation Sweden is participating in and to consider whether, and if so how, the protection for this type of information needs to be reinforced through, for example, regulation in criminal law. Our remit has also included analysing the relationship between any reinforced protection and the freedom of expression and information under Sweden’s fundamental laws and the European Convention on Human Rights. We have also had the remit of analysing and considering whether amendments to the Freedom of the Press Act and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression are necessary.</p>
<p>To assist the understanding of our proposals we have considered it of value to give a fairly extensive account of the current law in this summary.</p>
<h2>International cooperation for peace and security in which Sweden is participating</h2>
<p>Cooperation within the framework of various international and regional organisations has become more important in recent years in order to respond to the range of challenges the international community is facing. Cooperation in various international and regional organisations is, for example, judged to ensure access to capabilities sought in peace operations around the world and to strengthen the legitimacy of these operations, while increasing local understanding of conflicts and the actors involved. This cooperation also strengthens regional security while reducing the risk of crises.</p>
<p>Globalisation means that land borders are of less importance and that conflicts in other countries also assume importance for Sweden and our security. In this context, the Government has stressed that the country’s security cannot be safeguarded solely at our borders, and that greater collaboration with other countries provides better opportunities to deal with challenges and threats before they reach our own territory. The Government has also stated that it is in Sweden’s interest to promote international security and defence cooperation, since this builds confidence between states and lays the foundation for common security. In addition, the Government’s stance in defence and security policy means that Sweden’s bilateral and multilateral cooperation in defence and security policy should be strengthened and that Sweden should continue its active involvement and participation in both civilian and military international operations within the framework of the UN, the EU, NATO and the OSCE (Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe). The Government has also stressed that security is built on solidarity along with others and that threats to peace and security are deterred collectively and in collaboration with other countries and organisations.</p>
<p>As a result of developments in the area of security and defence policy Sweden is now collaborating to a greater extent with other countries than before. For instance, Sweden participates in cooperation for peace and security in a number of areas. This can involve international peace-support and security-building operations within the framework of the UN and EU, NATO and the OSCE, but it can also involve multinational exercises or other securitybuilding work, for example Swedish contribution of individuals possessing expert military and civilian capabilities. Examples of Swedish government agencies that participate in international cooperation for peace and security include the Government Offices, the Swedish Armed Forces, the Swedish Police Authority, the Swedish Security Service, the Swedish Prosecution Authority, the Swedish National Courts Administration, the Swedish Coast Guard, the Swedish Prison and Probation Service, the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) and the Folke Bernadotte Academy (FBA).</p>
<h2>Consequences of a disclosure</h2>
<p>Sensitive information handled within the framework of international cooperation for peace and security in which Sweden is participating can, for example, concern information about individuals, organisations, states, occurrences and phenomena, the intelligence capabilities of Sweden and other actors, protected values and assessments of actors threatening security, threats and vulnerabilities. Disclosure of such information can result in serious consequences for Sweden – and ultimately for Sweden’s security. This is because Sweden’s security depends indirectly on security in other countries and international cooperation that is successful and effective.</p>
<p>According to the Swedish Armed Forces , a disclosure of sensitive information handled within the framework of international cooperation for peace and security can disturb Sweden's relations with other states or international organisations. Such a disclosure could also reduce the capacity of the Swedish Armed Forces to avert threats to peace and security in common with other countries, increase the risk of Swedish personnel or personnel of a collaborating party being killed or wounded within the framework of international operations and harm Sweden’s military industrial cooperation and the Swedish Armed Forces’ export-related activities with other countries.</p>
<p>The Swedish Police Authority  has stated that a disclosure of sensitive information handled within the context of international cooperation for peace and security could impair confidence in the Swedish Police Authority and its personnel, which could, in turn, impair the possibilities for international police cooperation. Another consequence of a disclosure of sensitive information would probably be that, in connection with participation in international police cooperation, Swedish police would not be given access to operationally important information or hold positions in which such information is dealt with. This would then result in greater risks for posted personnel.</p>
<p>According to the Swedish Security Service , Sweden would suffer economic, military or intelligenceand security-service related damage in the event of a disclosure. At worst, a disclosure could result in the Swedish Security Service (Sweden) being excluded from bilateral and multilateral forums that are essential to protect the country.</p>
<p>Essentially, the  Swedish Courts Administration , the  Swedish Prison and Probation Service , the S wedish Civil Contingencies Agency and the  Folke Bernadotte Academy have pointed out that a disclosure could lead to a loss of confidence in Sweden and Swedish personnel and impair the participation of these agencies in ongoing and future cooperation. These agencies have also pointed out that a disclosure could damage the relations of Sweden and Swedish government agencies with partners, international organisations and other states. The Swedish Prison and Probation Service and the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency have also pointed to the risk that individuals may be harmed in the event of a disclosure and the increased security risks that such conduct might also entail for Swedish personnel in international operations.</p>
<p>Foreign intelligence activities also include international cooperation concerning the exchange of information of a sensitive nature that may deal with the security of both states and organisations. Important actors in this area include the Military Intelligence and Security Service (MUST)  and the National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA) . These bodies have stressed that international cooperation in intelligence matters is very much based on trust and on the ability to protect secret information. If Swedish actors do not live up to this, then, according to MUST and the FRA, Sweden might, as a result, not be given access to information of material importance for national security.</p>
<p>A disclosure of sensitive information handled in the context of international cooperation for peace and security in which Sweden is participating could therefore be of great importance to Sweden, Swedish interests and the international cooperation for peace and security in which Sweden is participating as well as for the possibilities of further cooperation. This might also impair Swedish possibilities of maintaining national security.</p>
<h2>Protection for sensitive information handled within the framework of international cooperation for peace and security</h2>
<p>As international cooperation becomes more tightly knit, an increase in the exchange of information between states is natural and fundamentally positive. This enables information to be re-used and experience to be spread, contributing to a more efficient administration. Sensitive information is handled on many occasions within the framework of international cooperation for peace and security. It can be a matter of information concerning Sweden, other countries involved in the cooperation, the relations between the countries or a current operation. In international cooperation for peace and security, the cooperation itself can reveal something about the defence and security capability of the participating countries. There can also be information of a more general and political nature that relates to the relations between the counties or some future cooperation. However, there is, above all, likely to be information concerning ongoing or planned international operations, for example the criteria for the use of violence and force, signals protection, situation assessments and the safety and security of the operation. Such information is of key importance for the conduct of the operation and for the safety of the individuals taking part in the operation, as well as for the collaborating countries and organisations.</p>
<p>The fact that Swedish agencies are increasingly handling information originating from foreign agencies or linked in some other way to international cooperation means that constant consideration must be given to how far Sweden can ensure that sensitive information of importance for the international cooperation that Sweden is participating in is given sufficient protection. In Sweden sensitive information handled in the context of such cooperation is primarily protected by provisions about secrecy, protective security, protection under criminal law and protection for trade secrets.</p>
<h2>Secrecy to protect information handled within the framework of international cooperation for peace and security</h2>
<p>Information handled in the context of international cooperation for peace and security in which Sweden is participating can, in some cases, be subject to secrecy under an act or law other statute or under an authorisation or restriction issued pursuant to an act or other statute.</p>
<p>Secrecy means not only a restriction of the right to access official documents but also a prohibition on disclosing information, either orally or by releasing an official document or in some other way (Ch. 3, Sec. 1 of the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400)). Secrecy thus means both document secrecy and a duty of secrecy. To the extent that secrecy provisions entail a duty of secrecy, they result in a restriction of freedom of expression under the Freedom of the Press Act (FPA) and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression (FLFE) or under the European Convention on Human Rights. The duty of secrecy applies under Ch. 2, Sec. 1 of the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (PAISA) to public authorities and to persons who, by participating on behalf of the public institutions in the activities of a public authority, have become aware of the information on account of employment or an assignment with the authority or on some other similar basis.</p>
<h2>Secrecy relating to foreign affairs under Ch. 15, Sec. 1 of PAISA</h2>
<p>Ch. 15, Sec. 1 of PAISA contains the provision of secrecy relating to foreign affairs. Under this provision, secrecy applies to information regarding Sweden's relations with another state, or otherwise regarding another state, an international organisation, or an authority, a citizen of or a legal person in another state or a stateless person, if it can be assumed that disclosure of the information will disturb Sweden's international relations or harm this country in some other way.</p>
<h2>Secrecy in international cooperation under Ch. 15, Sec. 1 a of PAISA</h2>
<p>Under Ch. 15, Sec. 1 a of PAISA secrecy applies to information that a public authority has received from a foreign body on the basis of a legally binding EU act or an agreement with another State or with an international organisation entered into by the EU or approved by the Riksdag, if it can be assumed that Sweden’s ability to participate in the international cooperation referred to in the act or the agreement would be impaired if the information was disclosed. Corresponding secrecy also applies to information obtained by a public authority for transmission to a foreign body in accordance with such an act or agreement.</p>
<h2>Secrecy under Ch. 15, Sec. 1 b of PAISA</h2>
<p>Ch. 15, Sec. 1 b of PAISA contains a provision on absolute secrecy to protect public interests for information in a foreign database that is accessible electronically to a Swedish authority through direct access but that the authority must not process on account of a legally binding EU act or an international agreement. The reason for this provision is that items of information in foreign databases to which a Swedish public authority has direct access are official documents at the authority if the information is contained in what is called a “finished electronic document” or can be complied by means of routine measures without the use of prohibited search arguments.</p>
<h2>Secrecy relating to defence under Ch. 15, Sec. 2 of PAISA</h2>
<p>Under Ch. 15, Sec. 2 of PAISA secrecy applies to information concerning activities to defend the country or the planning or other preparation of such activities or otherwise concerning total defence if it can be assumed that disclosure of the information would harm the defence of the country or otherwise endanger national security.</p>
<h2>Preliminary investigation secrecy under Ch. 18, Sec. 1 of PAISA</h2>
<p>Under Ch. 18, Sec. 1 of PAISA secrecy is applicable to protect the crime prevention and crime prosecution activities of the public institutions. Preliminary investigation secrecy applies to information included in a preliminary investigation in a criminal matter, a matter that relates to the use of coercive measures or in another activities intended to prevent, discover, investigate or prosecute crime and that are conducted by a prosecution authority, the Swedish Police Authority, the Swedish Security Service, the Swedish Tax Agency, the Swedish Customs or the Swedish Coast Guard if it can be assumed that the purpose of the measures ordered or foreseen would be countered or the future activity would be harmed if the information is disclosed.</p>
<h2>Secrecy to protect intelligence activities etc. under Ch. 18, Sec. 2 of PAISA</h2>
<p>The provision in Ch. 18, Sec. 2 of PAISA provides that secrecy to protect the work of the public institutions to prevent, pursue or discover criminal activity applies to information that is referable to intelligence activities. In this context intelligence activities means activities that consist of gathering, processing and analysing information in order to establish whether a criminal activity has been or may be carried out and that is not part of a preliminary investigation.</p>
<h2>Protective security</h2>
<p>Information covered by secrecy under PAISA and that concerns national security is also protected by the Protective Security Act (1996:627). Protective security means, first, protection against espionage, sabotage and other offences that can threaten national security; second, protection in other cases of information covered by secrecy under PAISA that concerns national security and; third, protection against terrorist offences even if the offences do not threaten national security. The Protective Security Act also contains provisions on the obligation to sign protective security agreements in certain cases and on training, control and supervision.</p>
<p>Protective security shall be in place, to the extent necessary, in activities of central government, municipalities and county councils, in legal persons in which these bodies have a legally decisive influence and with respect to individuals if their activities are of importance for national security or in particular need of protection from terrorism. There are supplementary provisions on protective security for the Riksdag (the Swedish Parliament) and its agencies in the Act on protective security in the Riksdag and its agencies (2006:128).</p>
<p>Protective security is intended to prevent information covered by secrecy that concerns national security being disclosed, altered or destroyed without authorisation (information security) , to prevent unauthorised persons gaining entry to places where they can access such information or where activities of importance for national security are conducted (entry restriction)  and to prevent persons who are not reliable from a security perspective from participating in activities of importance for national security (security examination) . In addition, protective security is intended to prevent terrorism.</p>
<h2>Criminal law protection</h2>
<p>In certain circumstances a person who discloses information of importance for international cooperation for peace and security in which Sweden is participating may be guilty of an offence. The provisions of Ch. 19 of the Swedish Penal Code (PC) that regulate criminal responsibility for offences against Sweden’s national security are of central importance here.</p>
<p>Information of importance for international cooperation for peace and security in which Sweden is participating can, as stated above, be subject to secrecy, in certain cases, under an act of law other statute or under an authorisation or restriction issued pursuant to an act or other statute. The disclosure of such information can therefore raise the question of criminal responsibility for a breach of the duty of secrecy under Ch. 20, Sec. 3 of PC. If an act includes the exercise of public authority, it may, in certain circumstances, also involve criminal responsibility for misuse of office under Ch. 20, Sec. 1 of PC.</p>
<p>In addition, Ch. 4 of PC contains provisions criminalising acts that mean that someone unlawfully gains access to various forms of communications. These provisions may also be applicable if the act is committed in order to get at sensitive information occurring within the framework of international cooperation for peace and security in which Sweden is participating.</p>
<h2>Espionage and gross espionage</h2>
<p>Ch. 19, Sec. 5 of the PC states that a person who, in order to aid a foreign power, without authorisation procures, transmits, gives or otherwise discloses information concerning a defence facility, arms, supplies, imports, exports, means of production, negotiations, decisions or other matters, the revelation of which to a foreign power can cause harm to Sweden’s security, is guilty – whether the information is correct or not – of espionage and shall be sentenced to imprisonment for at most six years. This provision also states that it is punishable to produce or have any dealing with a written document, drawing or other object containing such information without authorisation.</p>
<p>If the offence is gross the perpetrator is, under Ch. 19, Sec. 6 of PC, guilty of gross espionage and shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term, at least four and at most eighteen years, or for life. In assessing whether the crime is gross, special consideration shall be given to whether the act was of an exceptionally dangerous nature in view of an ongoing war or concerned a matter of great importance or whether the perpetrator disclosed something entrusted to them by reason of their position in public or private service.</p>
<p>One precondition for criminal responsibility for espionage is that the ‘harm requirement’ is met. This means that revelation of the matter concerned could result in harm to “Sweden’s security”. The harm requirement means that the scope of the criminal provision is restricted to really important matters. The section gives examples of matters of great protective value that can typically be an object of interest for a foreign intelligence service, namely information about defence facilities, arms, supplies, imports, exports, means of production, negotiations and decisions. The examples are not of decisive importance for the scope of the provision and are only intended to clarify the meaning of the section. The examples given mean, among other things, that the espionage provision is not restricted to ‘military espionage’ but also covers other forms of espionage. For example advanced forms of industrial espionage and political espionage.</p>
<p>Espionage is a an offence against the freedom of the press under Ch. 7, Sec. 4, first paragraph, point 3 of FPA and an offence against freedom of expression under Ch. 5, Sec. 1 of FLFE. Espionage is also entered in Ch. 7, Sec. 3, first paragraph, point 1 of FPA and Ch. 5, Sec. 3, first paragraph, point 1 of FLFE, which means that the ‘freedom to communicate information’ does not apply. Under Ch. 7, Sec. 3, second paragraph of FPA and Ch. 5, Sec. 3, second paragraph of FLFE a procurer of information is not protected from criminal liability either. The same applies to attempt, preparation and conspiracy to commit espionage.</p>
<h2>Unauthorised dealing with secret information and gross unauthorised dealing with secret information</h2>
<p>Ch. 19, Sec. 7 of PC criminalises unauthorised dealing with secret information. The offences of espionage and unauthorised dealing with secret information differ regarding the subjective requirement and the nature of the information. Criminal liability for unauthorised dealing with secret information does not require the perpetrator’s purpose to have been to aid a foreign power. But there is a requirement that the information – in addition to meeting the harm requirement – concerns a matter of a secret nature. The scale of penalties for the offence is a fine or imprisonment for at most two years. If the offence is gross, the perpetrator is guilty of gross unauthorised dealing with secret information and the scale of penalties is then imprisonment for at most four years (Ch. 19, Sec. 7 of the PC). In assessing whether the offence is gross, special consideration shall be given to whether the act involved assistance of a foreign power or was of an exceptionally dangerous nature in view of an ongoing war or related to a matter of great significance or whether the perpetrator disclosed what had been confided to them by reason of public or private service.</p>
<p>Unauthorised dealing with secret information is an offence against the freedom of the press under Ch. 7, Sec. 4, first paragraph, point 4 of FPA and an offence against freedom of expression under Ch. 5, Sec. 1, first paragraph of FLFE. The same applies to attempt and preparation to commit unauthorised dealing with secret information and to conspiracy to commit the offence, if it is considered gross. Under Ch. 7, Sec. 3, first paragraph, point 1 and second paragraph of FPA and Ch. 5, Sec. 3, first paragraph, point 1 and second paragraph of FLFE, the ‘freedom to communicate and procure information’ does not apply to gross unauthorised dealing with secret information or to attempt, preparation or conspiracy to commit such an offence.</p>
<h2>Negligence with secret information</h2>
<p>Under Ch. 19, Sec. 9 of PC a person who through gross negligence transmits, gives or reveals information referred to in the provision on unauthorised dealing with secret information is guilty of negligence with secret information and shall be sentenced to a fine or imprisonment for at most one year or, if the country was at war, to a fine or imprisonment for at most two years. So for there to be criminal responsibility the objective requirements for the offence of unauthorised dealing with secret information have to be fulfilled. In subjective terms, however, it is sufficient that the perpetrator has been grossly negligent. The gross negligence requirement applies with regard to all the objective requirements for the offence, i.e. even with regard to the characteristics of the information that mean that it falls within the scope of the penal provision.</p>
<p>Another difference in relation to what applies to unauthorised dealing with secret information is that criminal responsibility for carelessness with secret information is limited to transmitting, giving or revealing such information.</p>
<p>Negligence with secret information is an offence against the freedom of the press under Ch. 7, Sec. 4, point 5 of FPA and an offence against freedom of expression under Ch. 5, Sec. 1, first paragraph of FLFE.</p>
<h2>Unlawful intelligence activities against Sweden</h2>
<p>Ch. 19, Sec. 10 of PC criminalises activities for the purpose of acquiring information of the kind referred to in the provision on espionage, i.e. information concerning matters that it can damage Sweden’s security for a foreign power to be aware of. Under the first paragraph, a person is convicted if they, in order to aid a foreign power, secretly or by fraudulent means either conduct activities designed to procure information concerning matters whose revelation to a foreign power can result in harm to Sweden’s security, or are complicit in such activities on a more than temporary basis.</p>
<p>The penalty for the offence is imprisonment for at most two years. If the offence is gross, a particularly severe scale of penalties applies under the second paragraph: imprisonment for not less than six months and not more than four years. The assessment of whether the offence is gross has to be based on an overall appraisal of the circumstances in the particular case. Examples of circumstances that can lead to an offence being assessed as gross are if the act was of a particularly dangerous nature in view of the foreign policy situation or of the character and scope of the activities or if the perpetrator held a special post that included trust to be responsible for information of a sensitive or secret nature and the act entailed misuse of that trust.</p>
<h2>Unlawful intelligence activities against a foreign power</h2>
<p>Ch. 19, Sec. 10 a, first paragraph of PC states that a person who, in order to aid a foreign power, here in Sweden either conducts activities whose purpose is to procure information about matters, the revelation of which to that foreign power may cause harm to the security of another foreign power, or is complicit in such an activity on a more than temporary basis is guilty of unlawful intelligence activities against a foreign power and shall be sentenced to a fine or imprisonment for at most one year. If the offence is gross, the perpetrator shall, under Ch. 19, Sec. 10 a, second paragraph, be sentenced to imprisonment for at least six months and at most four years.</p>
<h2>Criminal liability for attempt, preparation and conspiracy to commit certain offences under Ch. 19 of PC and for failure to reveal or prevent such offences</h2>
<p>Ch. 19, Sec. 14 of PC regulates criminal liability for attempt and preparation to commit offences included in Ch. 19 of PC. Under the provisions of the first paragraph attempt and preparation to commit offences including espionage, gross espionage, gross unauthorised dealing with secret information, unlawful intelligence activities against a foreign power or unauthorised dealing with secret information are criminalised in the way specified in Ch. 23 of PC. Ch. 19, Sec. 14, first paragraph of PC also criminalises conspiracy to commit offences including espionage, gross espionage, unauthorised dealing with secret information, gross unauthorised dealing with secret information and unlawful intelligence activities against a foreign power.</p>
<p>Ch. 19, Sec. 14, second paragraph of PC regulates the extent to which a person can be punished for failure to reveal an offence when the offence is criminalised under a provision of Ch. 19 of PC. It also follows from this provision that it is punishable to not reveal offences including espionage, gross espionage and gross unauthorised dealing with secret information.</p>
<h2>Criminal liability for negligent complicity in certain offences under Ch. 19 of PC</h2>
<p>It follows from Ch. 23, Sec. 4 of PC that responsibility for a criminal act is assigned not only to the person who committed the act, but also to anyone who furthered it by advice or deed. Responsibility for complicity is of more general application than responsibility for attempt and responsibility for preparation and conspiracy to commit an offence or failure to reveal or prevent in the sense that it does not require there to be specific regulation of responsibility for complicity for the offence concerned. Responsibility for complicity in an offence is generally applicable in relation to all offences in PC. Each accomplice is assessed according to the intent or the negligence attributable to them.</p>
<p>Moreover, under Ch. 19, Sec. 15 of PC, if a person who ought, in view of what they knew on account of a warning given or for some other reason, to have realised that offences including espionage, gross espionage and gross unauthorised dealing with secret information were taking place, is complicit in the act, they are guilty of being an accessory to it. However, under this provision the penalty may not exceed imprisonment for two years. For there to be criminal liability under Ch. 19, Sec. 15 of PC, the accomplice must have had intent regarding the act through which they were complicit. The accomplice must also have acted even though they had knowledge that ought to have made them refrain. So the component of negligence is that the accomplice ought to have realised on account of this knowledge that an offence of a particular kind was at hand. Before a person can be convicted of careless complicity, the principal offence must have progressed so far that it can lead to a penalty. However, the offence does not have to be completed; it is quite sufficient for the act to reach the level of punishable attempt or preparation to commit an offence.</p>
<h2>Misuse of office</h2>
<p>Ch. 20, Sec. 1 of PC states that a person who through an act or omission in the exercise of public authority disregards what applies to their task intentionally or through negligence is guilty of misuse of office except in minor cases. The scale of penalties for misuse of office is a fine or imprisonment for a most two years. if the offence is gross, a sentence of imprisonment for at least six months and at most six years can be imposed.</p>
<h2>Breach of a duty of secrecy</h2>
<p>A person who discloses information that they are obliged to keep secret under an act of law or other statute or by an order or restriction issued under a law or other statute is guilty of a breach of a duty of secrecy under Ch. 20, Sec. 3 of PC unless a penalty for the act is prescribed elsewhere. The same applies if a person unlawfully makes use of such a secret. For there to be criminal liability for a breach of a duty of secrecy, a person must disclose or unlawfully make use of information they have a duty to keep secret under Swedish law. Provisions of this kind are mainly found in PAISA. Secrecy regulations that are based on foreign law or that fall outside the exercise of Swedish public authority are not covered by this criminal provision. The scale of penalties for breach of a duty of secrecy is a fine or imprisonment for at most one year. If someone commits such an act out of negligence, they are sentenced to a fine instead. No responsibility is assigned in minor cases.</p>
<h2>Certain offences in Ch. 4 of PC</h2>
<p>Ch. 4 of PC criminalises acts including someone unlawfully gaining access to various forms of communications. These provisions can also be applicable to acts committed in order to get hold of information of importance for international work for peace and security in which Sweden is participating.</p>
<p>Under Ch. 4, Sec. 8 of PC, a person who unlawfully accesses a communication being conveyed by a postal or telecommunications company as an item of post or in a network for electronic communications is guilty of breach of postal or telecommunications secrecy. The scale of penalties is a fine or imprisonment for at most two years.</p>
<p>A person who, in other cases, unlawfully opens a letter or a telegram or accesses something kept sealed can, under Ch. 4, Sec. 9 of PC, be sentenced for intrusion into a safe depository  to a fine or imprisonment for at most two years. In cases of unlawful interception or recording of speech or conversation, there may instead be criminal responsibility for unlawful interception  under Ch. 4, Sec. 9 a of PC in certain circumstances. The scale of penalties for this offence is also a fine or imprisonment for a most two years.</p>
<p>If a person who installs a technical device with the intent of carrying out an offence under Ch. 4, Sec. 8 or 9 a can be convicted under Ch. 4, Sec. 9 b of preparation to commit such an offence.</p>
<p>This rule is a complement to the provisions of Sections 8 and 9 a and one intention is to ease the victim’s and prosecutor’s burden of proof.</p>
<p>Finally, it can be mentioned that Ch. 4, Sec. 9 c states that, in cases other than those referred to in Ch. 4, Sections 8 and 9, a person who unlawfully obtains access to information intended for automatic processing can be sentenced to a fine or imprisonment for at most two years for breach of data security .</p>
<h2>Measures not of a criminal nature</h2>
<p>An act that involves unauthorised handling of information can also result in consequences outside of criminal law for the individual. The act can, for example, form a basis for liability for damages but sanctions under labour law also become relevant if the conduct is linked to employment. Ultimately it can be lead to notice of termination under Sec. 7 of the Employment Protection Act (1982:80). For public employees there are also provisions about disciplinary liability under the Public Employment Act (PEA) (1994:260). Under Sec. 14 of the PEA, disciplinary sanction for misconduct may be imposed on any employee who intentionally or by negligence disregards the duties associated with their position. The disciplinary sanctions are a warning and a salary deduction (Sec. 15 of the PEA).</p>
<h2>Protection of trade secrets</h2>
<p>A disclosure of information of importance for international cooperation for peace and security in which Sweden is participating can – if the information relates to matters whose disclosure to a foreign power can result in harm to Sweden’s security – be unauthorised handling under the Act on the Protection of Trade Secrets [1990:409]. This can, for example, be the case if the information relates to matters concerning research, development and production in a Swedish company that is producing military equipment or other equipment for Sweden’s armed forces. So there could be situations in which a trade secret is of such importance for the country that disclosure of the information could endanger the independence or existence of the country, i.e. its security.</p>
<p>Unauthorised conduct with trade secrets is sanctioned through criminal responsibility and liability for damages. Under Sec. 3 a person who, with intent, unlawfully obtains access to a trade secret is guilty of industrial espionage . Attempt and preparation to commit industrial espionage are also punishable. A person who procures a trade secret in the knowledge that the person providing the secret or someone before them has gained access to it through industrial espionage is guilty of unlawful dealing with a trade secret  (Sec. 4). In case law employees’ use and disclosure of trade secrets they have access to in their work has not been held to be punishable dealing with a trade secret. This applies to complicity both in perpetration and as an accomplice. The penalty for industrial espionage is a fine or imprisonment for at most two years or, if the offence is gross, imprisonment for at most six years. The scale of penalties for unlawful dealing with a trade secret extends from a fine to imprisonment for at most two years or, if the offence is gross, imprisonment for at most four years. Under Sec. 5 a person who is guilty of industrial espionage or unlawful dealing with a trade secret shall also compensate the damage incurred as a result of the offence or because the trade secret has been used or disclosed without authorisation.</p>
<p>Unlawful conduct with trade secrets other than procuring such information is subject to sanctions in the Act on the Protection of Trade Secrets in the form of damages, conditional financial penalties and surrender orders. Sections 6–8 contain provisions about the liability for damages of certain persons who use or disclose a business operator’s trade secret intentionally or by negligence. Under these provisions the liability for damages applies to a person who was entrusted with a trade secret in confidence in connection with business relations, an employee who has been given access in their employment to a trade secret held by their employer and a person who uses or discloses a trade secret that, according to what they ought to have realised, has been attacked under the Act.</p>
<h2>An international comparison Finland</h2>
<p>In Finland there are provisions on the unlawful dissemination or revelation of secret information in the Criminal Code (39/1889). The Finnish provision on espionage is applicable if a person for the purpose of favouring a foreign state or damaging Finland procures, relays, delivers or discloses or publishes information about matters including Finland’s foreign relations. Unlike the Swedish equivalent this provision is thus not restricted to acts that may result in harm to Finland’s security but also covers acts that concern Finland’s foreign relations. This also applies to other crimes of treason in the Finnish Criminal Code.</p>
<h2>Norway</h2>
<p>In Norway the criminal regulation of the dissemination or revelation of secret information is mainly set out in the Norwegian Criminal Code (LOV-1902-05-22-10). The requirements for criminal liability under the espionage provision include someone gathering or gaining possession, to the advantage of a foreign state or a terrorist organisation or without “noteworthy grounds ” , of information linked to any of the fundamental national interests stated in the provision so that the interest concerned may be harmed if the information is disclosed. One example of such fundamental national interests mentioned is Norway’s relations to other states. The Criminal Code also contains a special provision criminalising the revelation of state secrets. This provision refers to the same object of the act as the espionage provision. Criminal liability for the dissemination or revelation of secret information is not limited in Norway, either, to matters that can result in harm to the country’s security but can also refer to Norway’s relations to another state.</p>
<h2>Denmark</h2>
<p>In Denmark there are provisions on the unlawful dissemination and revelation of secret information in the Criminal Code (Act no 1052 of 4 July 2016). The object of the act under the espionage provision is matters that shall be kept secret in view of Danish state or public interests. This term covers, first and foremost, military secrets and state secrets but also covers secrets with a lower level of classification that concern the State’s relations with foreign powers and matters that relate to the economy, trade policy and supply. This provision also covers information concerning the circumstances of partners that shall be kept secret out of consideration not only of the foreign power concerned but also of Danish state interests. So criminal liability in Denmark is not restricted to acts that result in harm to Denmark’s security and criminal liability can also hit the disclosure of matters concerning Danish partners.</p>
<h2>Netherlands</h2>
<p>The Dutch Criminal Code (Wetboek van Strafrecht) contains provisions about espionage and other unlawful intelligence activities in a special division about Serious Offences against the Security of the State. These provisions protect both information of importance for the interests of the Dutch State and those of its allies, as the interest protected is “any information classified in the interest of the State or of its allies”. This means that information received as part of international cooperation or from allied states is given the same protection under Dutch law as the information has in its country of origin.</p>
<h2>Germany</h2>
<p>The German Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch, StGB) contains provisions about espionage and other unlawful intelligence activities in a chapter entitled Treason and endangering national security (Landesverrat und Gefährdung der äusseren Sicherheit). This code also contains provisions on breaches of the duty of secrecy. Criminal responsibility under the above-mentioned provisions for unlawful dealing with information is limited to information that is a “state secret”. State secrets are facts, objects or knowledge which are only accessible to a limited category of persons and must be kept secret from foreign powers in order to avert a danger of serious prejudice to the national security of the Federal Republic of</p>
<p>Germany. As a main rule, secret information originating from other states – including secret information of allied states – is not a state secret. However, a state secret originating from another state can be a German state secret if it has been confided in a German body. This is especially the case when German bodies receive certain information from foreign bodies within the framework of military and other cooperation. In the same way the term state secrets covers secret information within the framework of NATO cooperation.</p>
<h2>Canada</h2>
<p>In Canada there is criminal legislation regarding espionage and other unlawful intelligence activities in the Security of Information Act, the Criminal Code and the National Defence Act. There is some overlap in this legislation. As Canada uses both civil law och common law, these written acts are supplemented to a great extent by case law made by the courts. The Security of Information Act (SOIA) is of most importance. SOIA regulates the dealing with information that may harm Canada and its interests. The focus of the Act is on Canada’s security. However, the revelation of information that in the first place harms a partner country or an organisation is punishable under the Act if the revelation would also affect Canada’s international relations. This could be the case if the Canadian Government’s possibilities of conducting diplomatic or consular relations or international negotiations were threatened or impaired as a result of the revelation.</p>
<h2>Introduction of a new criminal provision on foreign espionage The protection under criminal law is neither comprehensive nor strong</h2>
<p>Espionage-like acts aimed at international cooperation can result in considerable damage to international cooperation for peace and security, our partners and any operations. As a result, this conduct can also harm Sweden – and ultimately Sweden’s security – since</p>
<p>Sweden’s security is dependent indirectly on security in other countries and on international cooperation that is successful and effective. Sweden is also dependent on good and trusting relations with other countries to access information that may be of importance for Sweden’s security and to be able to take full part in various forms of activities for cooperation for peace and security. If it is not possible to bring legal proceedings against persons who have committed espionage-like acts aimed at sensitive information handled within the framework of international cooperation for peace and security in which Sweden is participating, this could affect Sweden’s relations with other countries and partners, which could, in turn, result in defence and security policy consequences for Sweden by having an adverse effect on the willingness of other countries to engage in cooperation and exchanges of information in questions of importance for Sweden’s security.</p>
<p>The protection under criminal law for sensitive information of importance for international cooperation for peace and security in which Sweden is participating and that does not meet the harm requirement in the espionage provision is neither comprehensive nor particularly strong. This is also so when account is taken of the fact that greater dependence on international collaboration in the area of security and defence policy may have the result that more information concerning Sweden’s cooperation with other countries and organisations for peace and security is judged to be of such importance for Sweden’s security that it may be covered by the espionage provision. But the espionage provision is still reserved for conduct that may have a negative impact in some substantial way on Sweden’s security in the sense of the country’s independence or existence. This means that information that is only of indirect importance for Sweden’s security mainly falls outside the scope of the espionage provision – and therefore also the scope of the other provisions in Ch. 19 of PC. In view of the importance of Sweden's international cooperation for peace and security, the protection under criminal law for information handled within the framework of such cooperation cannot be said to be fit for purpose.</p>
<p>On the contrary, it is unsatisfactory that espionage-like acts aimed at such cooperation may, at worst, fall completely outside the punishable area and may, at best, only be punished as misuse of office or a breach of a duty of secrecy.</p>
<p>Moreover, the protection of such information under criminal law is much weaker in Sweden than in the other Nordic countries.</p>
<h2>Criminalisation of espionage-like acts aimed at sensitive information handled within the framework of international cooperation is justified</h2>
<p>One important question in deliberations about whether some particular conduct should be criminalised is whether the reasons for criminalisation are strong enough to justify broader criminal responsibility. Or, to put it another way, whether the problem is one that should be solved through criminal law or whether there are other possibilities of solving it. Alternative sanctions and other possibilities of remedying the problem must also be taken into account. In addition, the effect of extending criminalisation should also be considered.</p>
<p>Ultimately, criminalisation of espionage-like acts aimed at sensitive information handled within the framework of international cooperation for peace and security in which Sweden is participating is based on an interest on safeguarding Sweden’s security. However, in our view, the immediate and specific protective interest for criminal regulation should be Sweden’s relation to another state or an international organisation. The protective interests that criminalisation is intended to safeguard are strong and argue for criminalisation as the method to choose.</p>
<p>The alternatives to criminalisation available, including protective security work, amendments to secrecy legislation, liability for damages and labour law sanctions, are, in our view, not sufficient to solve the problems of espionage-like acts aimed at sensitive information handled within the framework of international cooperation for peace and security in which Sweden is participating. In addition, there is reason to assume that a criminal sanction would be an effective means of countering espionage-like acts of this kind. In view of the interest that new criminal law regulation is intended to protect, Sweden’s relation to another state or an international organisation and – ultimately – Sweden’s security, there is also good reason to deploy society’s resources to take legal proceedings against these acts.</p>
<p>Regulation of this kind would also signal to other countries and partners that Sweden takes a serious view of these acts. In our view, criminalisation of espionage-like acts aimed at sensitive information handled within the framework of international cooperation for peace and security in which Sweden is participating is justified.</p>
<h2>Drafting and classification of the provision</h2>
<p>We propose adding a new criminal provision to Ch. 19 of PC. The provision has been modelled on the espionage provision and covers espionage-like acts that relate to secret information concerning a matter whose revelation to a foreign power or association can result in serious harm to Sweden’s relation to another state or an international organisation. The offence is named foreign espionage. The criminal provision will only be applied to conduct that does not meet the requirements of Ch. 19, Sec. 5 of PC.</p>
<h2>Protective interest</h2>
<p>The criminal provision is justified by the Swedish need to cooperate with other countries and international organisations. Ultimately the criminal provision is based on an interest of safeguarding Swedish security. However the most appropriate protective interest for this criminal regulation is Sweden’s relation to another state or international organisation. It follows from this that only acts that can endanger or impair Sweden’s foreign relations in a substantial way are covered by the criminal regulation. The requirement that the act may lead to serious harm to Sweden’s relation to another state or an international organisation highlights Sweden’s relations as the interest worthy of protection. Such regulation conforms to the present systematic approach regarding offences against Sweden’s security and is well in line with how countries including Norway, Finland and Denmark have chosen to protect information of the present kind.</p>
<h2>The criminal act</h2>
<p>The punishable act consists, following the pattern of the offence of espionage, of someone without authorisation procuring, transmitting, giving or disclosing information whose revelation to a foreign power or association can cause serious harm to Sweden’s relation to another state or an international organisation. The regulation also covers a person, without authorisation, producing or having any dealing with a written document, drawing or other object that contains any information referred to in the criminal provision.</p>
<h2>Requirement of direct intent to aid a foreign power or association</h2>
<p>In common with what applies to espionage, and for the same reason as justified the restriction in that case, criminal responsibility is only considered when the conduct has taken place with direct intent. Here direct intent means the same as direct intent. Unlike what applies to espionage today, the punishable area is not limited to solely cover cases where the perpetrator's intent was to aid a foreign power. It is not likely that the groupings that usually occur in areas for international peace-support operations in which Sweden participates and that are affected in one way or another by the conflict that justifies the operations will always come under the definition of a foreign power even though they are, in practice, a power factor and a clear and real threat to an operation. To meet the need for criminalisation and the requirement of effective criminal legislation, the criminal provision also includes conduct that entails someone deliberately giving information to such a group or association. The term foreign association  therefore refers to a grouping that represents an opposing interest but that does not necessarily need to be a foreign power. However, for the criminal provision to be applicable the actor concerned is required to hold a position of power. But there is no requirement that the grouping has to be organised in a particular way to be covered by the term. The following can be mentioned as examples of what can be covered by the term: the UCK guerrilla in Kosovo, warlords in Afghanistan and Al Shabaab in Somalia.</p>
<p>The reasons for letting the criminal provision also cover conduct that entails someone deliberately giving information to a foreign association  are also applicable to the other provisions in Ch. 19 of PC that are of relevance here (espionage, unauthorised dealing with secret information and negligence with secret information). For this reason and in order to arrive at logical and consistent legislation we propose also amending these provisions to also cover cases where the perpetrator's intent was to aid a foreign association.</p>
<h2>Requirement of serious harm to Sweden’s relation to another state or international organisation</h2>
<p>A precondition for criminal liability is that a revelation of the information concerned to a foreign power or association may result in serious harm to Sweden’s relation to another state or international organisation. International organisation  means the same as in Ch. 2, Sec. 7 a of PC, i.e. an independent legal entity according to international law. These organisations are generally associations of states, examples being the UN, the EU, NATO and the OSCE. The requirement of serious harm  means that only serious acts can result in criminal liability. The expression serious harm means that the threshold for a punishable act is higher than that the act, as in Ch. 15, Sec. 1 of PAISA for example, disturbs Sweden’s international relations. So a precondition for criminal liability is that the act involves information of great importance where there can hardly be any doubt that disclosure can have serious consequences for Sweden’s relation to the country with which it is collaborating or the international organisation. Conceivable examples of such consequences are that what has happened can result in Sweden being excluded from further cooperation or no longer being able to take part in the exchange of secret information. The Swedish body taking part in the cooperation is probably best placed to assess the consequences of information being disclosed through action that can be attributed to Swedish personnel. If the information results in the exposure of criminal or improper conduct as, for example, in the case when the Swedish UN official Anders Kompass disclosed that serious offences had been committed by UN personnel, that type of exposure should not be held to be capable of seriously harming Sweden’s relation to the country or international organisation concerned even though internal secrecy rules have been breached and the exposure have caused irritation in the body concerned. The requirement that, to result in criminal liability, a disclosure of secret information has to be unauthorised, also excludes reports of criminal offences to a competent body, for example, the Swedish Police Authority or the Swedish Prosecution Authority from the scope of the criminal provision.</p>
<p>The term serious harm also conforms well to the division into four protective security classes and the corresponding degrees of damage currently used by the Swedish Armed Forces that are proposed to be incorporated in a new protective security act. They are in rising order: limited , corresponding to minor damage, confidentiall , corresponding to not insignificant damage, secret , corresponding to serious damage,  and top secret , corresponding to exceptionally serious damage . The criminal provision is linked to serious damage, meaning that the two highest levels are covered by criminal liability. Authorities such as the Swedish Armed Forces, the Swedish Security Service and the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency are likely to already have experience of making assessments of harm linked to these two protective security classes.</p>
<h2>A limitation to secret information</h2>
<p>The punishable area – unlike what applies to espionage – is limited to acts that entail dealing with secret information, i.e. information covered by secrecy under PAISA, or some other statute. In the first place this ought to cover secrecy relating to foreign affairs under Ch. 15, Sec. 1 of PAISA and secrecy relating to defence under Ch. 15, Sec. 2 of PAISA, but other secrecy regulations such as those for the protection of intelligence activities under Ch. 18, Sec. 2 of PAISA could also be covered.</p>
<p>Criminal responsibility does not require that the information has actually been handled in an activity covered by PAISA or that the person who has relayed the information is subject to a duty of secrecy as long as the information would have been covered by a secrecy provision if it had occurred in the activities of the public institutions. This means that information of a secret nature in private activities or in an international military operation etc., that is not referable to Swedish exercise of public authority may come within the punishable area. So the application of the criminal provision is not dependent on a formal examination of secrecy under PAISA. Nor is the handling of the information as secret in the activity a formal requirement for criminal responsibility. However, the perpetrator’s intent also has to cover the fact that the information concerned a secret matter. This means that, in practice, the question of criminal liability would probably mainly be raised concerning information that has been kept secret in the activity and where this has been expressed in some way. In cases where the information has been handled as open information in the activity – even though it is subject to secrecy – the perpetrator is generally likely not to have had intent.</p>
<p>The limitation to information of a secret nature means that there are already considerable restrictions on the possibilities of spreading the information for publication in media protected by the fundamental laws. This is seen from provisions including Ch. 7, Sec. 3, points 2 and 3 and Ch. 7, Sec. 5, points 1 and 2 of FPA as well as Ch. 5, Sec. 3, points 2 and 3 of FLFE. For this reason alone the criminal provision is unlikely to result in any great change in terms of freedom of the press and freedom of expression.</p>
<h2>Scale of penalties</h2>
<p>The acts that the criminal provision is intended to hit are of a serious nature. However, the criminal provision may cover acts of various kinds and gravity. At worst, this criminality may lead to very severe consequences for Sweden’s foreign relations. A revelation of secret information may put human life at risk and cause great destruction. It can also lead to it not being possible to implement all or parts of an international peace operation at all or as planned. As stated above, criminal liability requires that the act concerned can result in serious harm to Sweden’s relations with another state or to an international organisation. This means that the scale of penalties should be relatively severe in order to reflect the fact that there is reason to take a serious view of the type of offence concerned. The scale of penalties must also have sufficient range to permit nuanced and differentiated sentencing and mean that a sentence corresponding to the severity of the offence can be imposed. The scale of penalties for the offence should therefore permit the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment for at most four years. In addition, given the nature of the offence there is a presumption of imprisonment.</p>
<h2>Gross offence</h2>
<p>A separate offence of gross foreign espionage should be introduced. In the offence is gross, it should be possible to impose a sentence of imprisonment for at least two and at most eight years. In assessing whether the offence is gross, special consideration should – as is the case for espionage – be given to whether the act was of an exceptionally dangerous nature in view of an ongoing war or concerned a matter of great importance or whether the perpetrator disclosed something entrusted to them by reason of their position in public or private service.</p>
<h2>Criminalisation of conduct without direct intent or through gross negligence</h2>
<p>We propose expanding the criminal provisions in Ch. 19, Sections 7–9 of PC so that an act that meets the objective requirements for foreign espionage, but that is carried out without the purpose of aiding a foreign power or association, or that is carried out through gross negligence, can lead to criminal responsibility for unlawful handing of secret information or negligence with secret information.</p>
<h2>Criminal responsibility for attempt, preparation, conspiracy to commit an offence, negligent complicity in an offence and failure to expose or prevent an offence</h2>
<p>The provisions of Ch. 19, Sections 14 and 15 of PC on criminal responsibility for attempt, preparation, conspiracy to commit an offence, negligent complicity in an offence and failure to expose or prevent an offence should be made applicable to foreign espionage to the same extent as they apply to espionage.</p>
<h2>An expansion of the punishable area for offences against a duty of secrecy</h2>
<p>We propose expanding the provision in Ch. 20, Sec. 3 of PC on criminal liability for breach of a duty of secrecy to also cover disclosure of information of a secret nature in international cooperation for peace and security in which Sweden is participating. This is quite irrespective of whether the information is secret under Swedish law or some other statute. The crucial point is that the information would have been covered by secrecy if it had occurred in public activities. This expansion means that disclosures that are not serious enough to be punished under our proposals of new offences in Ch. 19 of PC can still be hit by criminal liability.</p>
<h2>This criminalisation is consistent with the Instrument of Government</h2>
<h2>and the European Convention on Human Rights</h2>
<p>The Instrument of Government (IG) contains fundamental provisions about freedom of expression and freedom of information. As regards freedom of the press and corresponding freedom of expression in certain other media, for example radio and television and similar transmissions as well as film, the provisions of FPA and FLFE are applicable. Freedom of expression and information are also protected in the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p>Freedom of expression and freedom of information may be limited in law or – in respect of information that has come to a person’s knowledge in public service or in the performance of official duties – with authority in law (Ch. 2, Article 20 IG). A limitation may only be imposed to satisfy a purpose acceptable in a democratic society. However, a limitation must never go beyond what is necessary with regard to the purpose that occasioned it; nor may it be carried so far as to constitute a threat to the free shaping of opinion. Nor may a limitation be imposed solely on grounds of a political, religious, cultural or other such opinion (Ch. 2, Article 21</p>
<p>IG). It follows from Ch. 2, Article 23 of IG that of freedom of expression and information may be limited in view of certain specified interests including national security, public order and public safety and the prevention and prosecution of crime. Otherwise freedom of expression and freedom of information may only be limited where particularly important grounds warrant doing so.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, freedom of expression is also protected by the European Convention on Human Rights. Under Article 10 (1) of the Convention everyone has the right to freedom of expression, which includes freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. However this right is not absolute. The exercise of freedom of expression may, under Article 10 (2), be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime and for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence among other interests.</p>
<p>A criminalised prohibition of espionage-like acts that may harm Sweden’s relations to another state or to an international organisation can include a limitation of both freedom of information and freedom of expression to the extent that information may not be procured and therefore cannot be conveyed to others either. A prohibition of this kind also hits the procuring and conveying of information for publication in the media. The ultimate purpose of the prohibition is to protect Sweden’s security. This is a purpose that according to both IG and the European Convention is accepted as grounds for limiting freedom of expression and information. The criminalisation of espionage-like acts that may harm Sweden’s relation to another state or an international organisation is thus consistent with both IG and the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<h2>The new offence should be covered by the regulations in Ch. 7, Sec. 3 FPA and Ch. 5 Sec. 3 FLFE</h2>
<h2>and be an offence against freedom of the press and freedom of expression</h2>
<p>One of the fundamental principles of FPA and FLFE is the principle of sole responsibility. This means that only one of the generally many people who participated in the production of material protected by the fundamental laws bears the criminal responsibility for the content of the material and that other participants are therefore free from responsibility. In addition, IG and FLFE also contain rules that expressly protect a person who participated in the production of material protected by the fundamental laws, including the person who provided information for publication (freedom to communicate information) and the person who procured information intended for publication (freedom to procure information). In principle, freedom to communicate information means a freedom to communicate information for publication in media protected by the fundamental laws without the risk of punishment irrespective of whether the information is published. The freedom to procure information means that everyone has the right, with impunity, to procure information intended for publication in a medium covered by the fundamental laws.</p>
<p>The freedoms to communicate and to procure information are not absolute. Ch. 7, Article 3 of FPA set out the exceptions when a person communicating information for material protected by the fundamental laws or other participants in it can be held criminally responsible for their participation. The provisions refer both to the person communicating information under Ch. 1, Article 1, third paragraph of FPA, i.e. the person normally called the communicator, and a person who, without being responsible under the provisions of Ch. 8 of FPA on sole responsibility, contributes to material intended for insertion in printed matter as author or other originator or as editor. This provision means that the three cases given there are excluded from the scope of FPA and that provisions of ordinary law shall be applied instead. Point 1  takes up the case where the participant commits high treason, espionage, gross espionage, gross unauthorised handling of secret information, insurrection, treason or betrayal of country, or any attempt, preparation or conspiracy to commit such an offence. Point 2  takes up the case where the participant commits intentional wrongful release of an official document to which the public does not have access, or release of such a document in contravention of a restriction imposed by a public authority at the time of its release. Point 3  take up the case where the participant commits deliberate disregard of a duty of secrecy, in cases specified in a special act of law.</p>
<p>With respect the responsibility of a procurer, Ch. 7, Sec. 3, second paragraph of FPA states that if a person procures information or intelligence in order to publish it in a medium protected by the fundamental laws and thereby commits an offence referred to it the first paragraph, point 1 of the provision, then provisions of ordinary law, i.e. PC, concerning liability for such an offence apply.</p>
<p>FPA also contains an enumeration of the acts that are offences against the freedom of the press if they are committed by means of printed matter “and are punishable under law” (Ch. 7, Art 4 FPA). They include a number of offences against national security: for example, high treason, espionage, unlawful dealing with secret information and negligence with secret information. Offences against the freedom of the press also include certain acts that entail that the actual publication constitutes an unlawful publication of secret documents, an intentional disregard of certain enhanced secrecy and, in the event of war or immediate danger of war, other offences against national security than those specified in Ch. 7, Article 4 FPA (Ch. 7, Art 5 FPA). By means of a reference in FLFE, offences against freedom of the press shall be regarded as offences against freedom of expression if they are committed in material that is covered by FLFE and are punishable under law (Ch. 5, Article 1 FLFE).</p>
<p>Espionage, unauthorised dealing with secret information and negligence with secret information are thus offences against the freedom of the press under Ch. 7, Sec. 4 of FPA. This means that a person who has the sole responsibility can be convicted of such an act if it is committed in printed matter (following the procedure prescribed in FPA). Espionage, gross espionage and unauthorised dealing with secret information are also covered by Ch. 7, Sec. 3 FPA, which means that freedom to communicate and procure information do not apply in these cases. So the legislator has considered that the reasons for criminalisation in these cases are so strong and that publication of information covered by the criminal provisions can result in such damage that freedom of the press and of expression have to give way to satisfy the purpose of the criminal regulation. Even though the immediate protective interest for foreign espionage and associated types of offences is not Sweden’s security and even though the harm requirement is framed in a slightly different way from in the espionage provision, there are reasons to equate this criminal activity in this respect with the above-mentioned offences in Ch. 19 of PC. As stated, they involve serious criminal activity and a very important protective interest.</p>
<p>As with respect to the limitation of freedom of the press regarding espionage, gross espionage and unauthorised dealing with secret information, it is thus proportionate to limit freedom of the press regarding foreign espionage and associated types of offences by exempting them from freedom of the press. As regards the most serious types of offences, i.e. foreign espionage, gross foreign espionage and gross unauthorised dealing with secret information grounded in foreign espionage, it is also proportionate to exclude them from freedom to communicate and procure information, as is the case regarding their equivalents among espionage offences. This means, according to our proposal, that a person who is prosecuted for these gross offences – and who would normally be protected by freedom to communicate and procure information – will be subject to legal proceedings in a normal trial or freedom of the press trial even if their freedom to communicate/procure information related to publication in media protected by the fundamental laws. This proposal hereby links this regulation to the present handling of espionage offences. These offences involve direct intent or, in the case of gross unauthorised dealing with secret information, such flagrant conduct that the offences surely belong in the regular procedure for criminal matters. Such regulation also appears logical and consistent. We therefore propose amending the provisions of Ch. 7, Art 3–4 of FPA and corresponding provisions in FLFE so that foreign espionage, gross foreign espionage and gross unauthorised dealing with secret information grounded in foreign espionage be excluded from the freedom to communicate and procure information in Ch. 7, Art 3 of FPA and Ch. 5, Art 3 of FLFE and that these offences, along with an act that takes place by gross negligence, be included in the offences against the freedom of the press in Ch. 7, Art 4 of FPA and therefore also in Ch. 5, Art. 3 of FLFE. We also propose including their inchoate offences (preparation, attempt and conspiracy) to commit foreign espionage and gross foreign espionage in the catalogue of offences. Not including the above-mentioned offences in the catalogue of offences would mean that there would be no penalty for committing the offences through publication in printed matter, which would appear remarkable in comparison with the present system. This obviously means an expansion of the offences against freedom of the press. Not doing so opens the way to the use of media protected by the fundamental laws in order to disclose secret information of the kind concerned to unauthorised persons. It is fully possible, as shown in detail in Ch. 5, that, in such a situation, a foreign power or association would be able to exploit the freedom of the press and of expression protected by the fundamental laws to get at information covered by the criminalisation proposed.</p>
<p>At the same time as the insertion of foreign espionage and associated offences into the catalogue of offences limits freedom of the press, it must be borne in mind that the special procedure that applies to the treatment of offences against freedom of the press is a way of safeguarding freedom of the press that is not found in most countries comparable with Sweden. The instruction  in Ch. 1, Art. 4 of FPA and Ch. 1, Art. 5 of FLFE contributes to ensuring that no one will be convicted of offences against freedom of the press and freedom of expression except in cases involving expressions that are clearly beyond acceptable limits. This is because, under these provisions, any person entrusted with passing judgment on abuses of the freedom of the press and of expression or otherwise overseeing compliance with the fundamental laws should bear in mind that the freedom of the press and of expression are fundamental to a free society and always direct their attention more to the aim than the manner of presentation and, in case of doubt, acquit rather than convict. The right of the Chancellor of Justice to make a discretionary assessment and the possibility of examination by a jury of whether or not an expression is criminal function as protection for freedom of the press and of expression. In addition, foreign espionage and associated offences are limited to information of a secret nature, which, as stated, means that there are already considerable restrictions on the possibilities of spreading the information for publication in media protected by the fundamental laws. For this reason alone the criminal provision is unlikely to result in any great change in terms of freedom of the press and freedom of expression.</p>
<h2>The possibility of using coercive measures</h2>
<p>In view of the nature and seriousness of this criminal activity and the interest of effective and appropriate regulation in criminal law, there should be the same possibilities of using covert coercive measures – i.e. covert interception of electronic communication, covert surveillance of electronic communication, covert camera surveillance and covert localised interception – on suspicion of an intentional offence of the present kind as is the case of other comparable offences in Ch. 19 of PC. We therefore propose amending the provisions of Ch. 27, Sec. 2 of the Code of Judicial Procedure (CJP) so that a written communication between the suspect and a related person or between such related persons is seized from the suspect or a related person in a preliminary investigation into foreign espionage, gross foreign espionage, unauthorised dealing with secret information and gross unauthorised dealing with secret information originating in foreign espionage. We also propose amending the provision in Ch. 27, Sec. 2 of CJP so that the second paragraph states that covert localised interception may be used in a preliminary investigation into foreign espionage and gross foreign espionage.</p>
<p>The exemption from the notification obligation under Ch. 27, Sec. 33, third paragraph of CJP shall – as is the case with espionage and associated offences – also apply to a preliminary investigation into foreign espionage and gross foreign espionage and into unauthorised dealing with secret information and gross unauthorised dealing with secret information grounded in foreign espionage.</p>
<p>We also propose making the Act on measures to prevent certain particularly serious offences (2007:979) applicable to foreign espionage and gross foreign espionage and to gross unauthorised dealing with secret information grounded in foreign espionage. We also propose making the Act (2012:278) on the collection of information about electronic communication in the intelligence activities of the law enforcement agencies applicable to foreign espionage and gross foreign espionage.</p>
<h2>An expansion of Swedish criminal jurisdiction</h2>
<p>With the expansion of the concept of international security, the activities in international cooperation for peace and security in which Sweden is participating have grown in number and size at the same time as more and more categories of personnel are participating in international missions. There is a corresponding increase in the practical need for consistent rules about jurisdiction that regulate the jurisdiction of the posting state over its personnel. The local immunity usually enjoyed by posted international personnel under special agreements entails commitments for the posting state to maintain full jurisdiction over its personnel.</p>
<p>While persons belonging to the international staff of the Swedish Police Authority and other police officers, customs officers or officers of the Swedish Coast Guard who perform duties according to an international agreement are exempted under Ch. 2, Sec. 3 of PC from the requirement of dual criminality, there is no corresponding regulation for other civilian staff participating in international cooperation for peace and security. To the extent that posted individuals commit acts that are offences under Swedish legislation but that are not offences at the place where they are committed, it may therefore not be possible to bring legal proceedings against the individual in a Swedish court. The UN has pointed out in various contexts that it is up to Sweden and other posting states to maintain jurisdiction over posted personnel. The present situation means that, with respect to jurisdiction, Sweden is not fully living up to its international undertakings to punish offences committed by Swedish personnel participating in international missions within the UN framework.</p>
<p>We propose supplementing the provision in Ch. 2, Sec. 3 of PC to also make a clear exception from the requirement of dual criminality concerning offences committed by other civilians than persons belonging to the international staff of the Swedish Police Authority and other police officers, customs officers or officers of the Swedish Coast Guard who perform duties according to an international</p>
<p>agreement. Such an expansion thus not only means that the Swedish regulations on jurisdiction fulfil the international commitments made by Sweden. It also has the function of providing instruction and clarification, not least for the posted personnel concerned.</p>
<p>The proposed exception from the requirement of dual criminality is generally worded and covers all Swedish citizens or aliens habitually resident in Sweden who, in cases other than those referred to in Chap 2, Sec. 3, points 2–3 a of PC, are participating in an international mission within the framework of international cooperation for peace and security in which Sweden is participating. The new exception from the requirement of dual criminality is not limited to offences committed in the course of their duty but covers all offences committed when serving abroad.</p>
<p>In addition, we also propose a supplement to the exceptions made in Ch. 2, Sec. 5, second paragraph of PC so that prosecutions for these offences may be brought without authorisation to prosecute except regarding personnel from the foreign intelligence agencies.</p>
