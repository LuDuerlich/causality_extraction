<h2>To Reclaim My Language</h2>
<h2>– Measures to Strengthen the Sami Language</h2>
<p>The Sami Language Is Threatened</p>
<p>The assimilation and educational policies that were practised in Northern Sweden over a long period of time have caused many Sami, who spoke the Sami language as children, to lose their Sami language and cause younger generations of Sami not to learn the Sami language. Some Sami feel that they were deprived of their language. The will to preserve and to reclaim the language is strong.</p>
<p>The Sami language is threatened and the smaller varieties, such as South Sami and Lule Sami, are at risk of disappearing completely. This would mean that a part of Sweden’s living cultural heritage and an important part of the collective identity of the Sami people would be lost. For an indigenous people, the preservation of the language is of vital importance to the continuity and the transmission of the culture.</p>
<p>Approximately half of the 20 000 Sami in Sweden speak Sami and a fourth are literate in Sami. The number of speakers is lower in the Southern parts of Sápmi. In general older Sami possess a better mastery of the Sami language. Many in the parental generation do not have sufficient language skills themselves to transmit the Sami language to the next generation, even if they wanted to.</p>
<p>International Obligation to Protect and Support Minority Languages</p>
<p>The recognition of the Sami as a national minority in accordance with the Council of Europe Minority Conventions means that Sweden is under an international obligation to actively promote the Sami language in order to safeguard it. The recognition means inter alia  that the Sami are to be given influence in matters regarding</p>
<p>them. As an indigenous people the Sami also have a right to selfdetermination.</p>
<p>The work to implement the linguistic and cultural rights of national minorities is part of Sweden’s work with human rights. The realization of the legislation enacted in April of 2000 on the right to use Sami, Finnish and Meänkieli in contacts with authorities and courts of law has been insufficient. Individuals are unable to use the rights guaranteed by the law. An inadequate Swedish implementation of these rights questions Sweden’s international credibility.</p>
<p>According to the Council of Europe, additional measures will be necessary in order for Sweden to live up to its international obligations, inter alia  the support of the South Sami language will have to be improved and this will have to occur promptly. This means that Sweden has reached a cross-roads where international obligations are brought to the forefront. Well-meaning intentions are no longer sufficient for the South Sami language to regain ground and to survive in the long run. The criticism of the Council of Europe needs to result in concrete, decisive measures and better implementation of the provisions of the conventions. A number of measures to strengthen the protection of minorities have been proposed in the previously delivered report. 1</p>
<p>Since the Sami transcend state boundaries, Sweden should intensify the cooperation with Norway and Finland in order to find ways to promote the Sami peoples endeavour to preserve the Sami language and culture. Such cooperation has been suggested by the Council of Europe.</p>
<p>To Reclaim the Sami Language</p>
<p>Parallel measures need to be taken in order to halt and reverse the process of language shift. Revitalization of the Sami language will require conscious and long-term work at society, group and individual levels. The majority society can assist the Sami by creating a language-preserving environment and by giving the Sami the tools to reclaim their language. If the Sami are given the tools and the prerequisites to mould their own future, the strength of the group can be channelled to reverse the process of language shift. Measures are</p>
<p>needed to raise the status of the Sami language, and to revitalize and make the language more visible in society.</p>
<p>Children and youth are the “life insurance” of a threatened language, since they are the future bearers of the culture. The number of Sami speakers can consciously be increased by giving parents better knowledge about additive bilingualism and by pre-schools and schools actively supporting the Sami language development of children and youth. If adults with passive knowledge in Sami are given the opportunity to improve their language skills, the number of active speakers can be increased. The Sami that wish to reclaim the Sami language should be given the opportunity to do so.</p>
<p>The Administrative Area for the Sami Language Needs to Be Expanded</p>
<p>Enactment of language legislation is one way to raise the status of the Sami language in society. If the right to use Sami in official situations is expanded to the South Sami area, more Sami will be given the opportunity to use and develop their language through versatile usage. The language would also become more useful, which would motivate more young people to learn it. Individuals would also be given the right to pre-school and care-of-the-elderly partly or completely in Sami in an additional number of municipalities.</p>
<p>The administrative area for the Sami language is proposed to be expanded so that it would also include the municipalities of Arvidsjaur, Berg, Dorotea, Härjedalen, Krokom, Lycksele, Malå, Piteå, Skellefteå, Sorsele, Storuman, Strömsund, Umeå, Vilhelmina, Vindeln, Åre, Åsele, Älvdalen, Älvsbyn and Östersund. It is of crucial importance that the expanded administrative area will be large enough so that a majority of Sami living in Sápmi be included in the measures and that Sami strongholds be included. The proposed additional municipalities and authorities should take advantage of the proposed three-year information and educational effort to improve their language competence and competence in minority rights policy. Government grants are proposed to cover additional costs of the municipalities in the administrative area.</p>
<p>Enhanced Sami Language Efforts</p>
<p>The Sami Parliament of Sweden (Sametinget) should, as a publicly elected body for Sami, establish the goals of Sami language efforts. It is essential that the goals to promote, preserve and develop the Sami language be democratically anchored. The Sami Parliament should also be given increased influence on the establishment of Sami placenames.</p>
<p>The establishment of two Sami language centres are proposed in the South Sami area. Additional language centres should eventually be established in the North Sami area. The language centres are to take active, publicly-oriented, language-revitalizing action among the Sami on local and regional levels. The language centres should act under the auspices of the Sami Parliament. The language centres can also be supportive resource centres in the administrative area. Sami language surveys need to be conducted at regular intervals in order to gain better knowledge on the efficiency of the measures taken.</p>
<p>Revitalization Efforts in the Field of Education</p>
<p>Children who belong to the national minorities have the right to acquire their minority language and to develop a minority or indigenous identity. Reports by the National Agency for Education (Skolverket) show that mother tongue teaching is unsatisfactory. Bilingual teaching is almost non-existent. The regulations on mother tongue teaching need to be altered so that municipalities will be obligated to arrange such teaching by remote teaching until a local teacher can be found. Methods for remote teaching need to be developped even more.</p>
<p>All Sami children in the country must be given the opportunity to learn Sami and the opportunities for mother tongue teaching and teaching in Sami must be improved. The possibilities to arrange integrated Sami teaching should be improved and expanded. The Sami School Board (Sameskolstyrelsen) should be given the assignment to find new ways to arrange mother tongue teaching for Sami pupils. More educational material in Sami is needed and available locally-produced educational material need to be disseminated. A South Sami homepage is needed on the “Mother tongue” government website. The Sami Parliament and the Sami School</p>
<p>Board should take measures to create a network for mother tongue teachers in Sami and to establish a close cooperation with universities where Sami is being taught. An academic guidance councillor to Sami pupils should be appointed.</p>
<p>A government commission should be appointed to analyse the possibility to enact a statutory right to bilingual teaching in preschool and compulsory school in national minority languages and to establish a national program for the promotion of national minority languages. Many European states have taken greater responsibility for educational situation of their national minorities than Sweden. Sweden should learn from other states’ experiences. Since it is essential that an immediate improvement is made, the government should assist municipalities with government funding so that bilingual teaching will be arranged while the matter is being investigated. Ways to improve the availability of minority language teachers needs to be looked into as well.</p>
<p>The opportunity for all adult Sami to develop literacy in Sami needs to be safeguarded as long as the need remains. Individuals must be given the financial means to participate in literacy training in Sami.</p>
<p>Measures for Children and Youth</p>
<p>The Children’s Ombudsman should be given a clear assignment to monitor the needs of children belonging to national minorities. Youth organizations that represent national minorities should be given the support and opportunity to influence the national minority policies.</p>
<p>Reading in one’s own language is a fundamental necessity in order to acquire the language and to strengthen the development of the language. Measures are needed to improve availability of children’s and youth literature in national minority languages. Public library activity directed towards national minorities should be increased. Library advisory officers should be appointed for the national minority languages and activities towards children and youth should be given priority. A permanent financial solution should be found for the Sami library buses.</p>
<p>Minority language culture has a revitalising and identity-strengthening effect. The Swedish National Council for Cultural Affairs (Statens kulturråd) should give special consideration to the needs</p>
<p>of children and youth when deciding on government funding for national minorities. The government should consider increasing government funding for culture in order to better fulfil the needs of national minority children.</p>
<p>The opportunities of national minority children and youth to acquire their minority language must be independent on the family’s financial situation. Special funding should be set aside for scholarships for activities that aim to strengthen the language development or the development of a minority or indigenous identity of children and youth.</p>
<p>Active Measures for Making the Sami and the Sami Language More Visible in Society</p>
<p>The situation of the Sami can be improved by making the Sami and their language more visible in society. This would increase the majority’s understanding for the Sami and strengthen the cultural identity of Sami, especially Sami children and youth. This would also promote language revitalization. To facilitate this, the 6th of February, the Sami peoples' day, should be made a public Flag Day. The efforts to display Sami placenames on public sign-posts should be intensified. Official Sami placenames should also be usable as valid postal addresses.</p>
<p>Additional Proposals</p>
<p>The national responsibility for supervision of the Act on National Minorities and Minority Languages, which has been proposed in the first report, should be divided between the County Administrative Board and the Sami Parliament. The Sami Parliament, in its role as a government authority, should be given the task of supervision of the Sami language in the municipalities. This includes inter alia  direction, supervision, distribution of government grants and coordination.</p>
<p>Experience has shown that the Sami and National Minority Policies are not being sufficiently coordinated within the central government. This has resulted in a situation where the needs of the national minorities are not dealt with in a comprehensive way. In order for decision making to rely on a better comprehensive view</p>
<p>and for revitalization measures to be more efficient, a coordination secretariat for Sami and National Minority Policies should be established within the Ministries. Such a secretariat would also facilitate inter Nordic cooperation in these matters.</p>
<p>Fundamental administrative law statutes and statutes that affect national minority rights, Sami culture, language and industry should be translated into Sami. The same applies for Finnish and Meänkieli. This would improve rule of law in use of government powers within the administrative areas and it would also develop the languages.</p>
