<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Delegation for Trust-Based Governance has had the remit from the Government of mapping and analysing the introductory courses that government authorities (i.e. government agencies and the courts) provide for their employees and presenting proposals for how and when a common, compulsory introductory training for government employees can be introduced (terms of reference 2019:6 and terms of reference 2020:49). The background to this remit is an announcement by the Riksdag (Swedish Parliament). So this remit has been initiated by and has the support of both the Riksdag and the Government.</p>
<p>With the assistance of a large number of authorities the Delegation has obtained knowledge about how the authorities currently work on their introductory courses, what specific needs they have of a common training and what the content and form of such a training should be like to meet their needs. The Delegation for TrustBased Governance considers that a common training should be seen as an important investment for all government employees and should, in line with the Government’s intentions, contribute to greater public confidence in central government administration and ultimately to greater confidence in democracy.</p>
<p>The Delegation proposes introducing an act on a common training in central government administration to apply to government agencies and to courts. The Delegation proposes that the training should also cover authorities under the Riksdag. This means that, for constitutional reasons, the training needs to be regulated in an act of law. There is also a need for a stable and long-term solution for a training of this kind, and an act can make this possible.</p>
<p>The proposals in this report are based both on an obligation regulated by statute and on commitment and voluntary participation on the part of every authority, especially regarding the delivery of the training.</p>
<h2>Training to cover all government employees</h2>
<p>The Delegation’s terms of reference state that the Delegation is to produce a proposal for a common compulsory introductory training for government employees. Our terms of reference do not state explicitly that the training has to be an introductory training solely for new employees who have not previously worked in the central government administration or whether all government employees should be covered. The Delegation has chosen to include all government employees in its proposed training, irrespective of previous central government experience, since the overall objective of the Government in introducing the training is to increase confidence in central government as a whole and in its employees. The Delegation’s assessment is that only training employees who are completely new to central government administration is not sufficient to attain such a far-reaching objective. Nor is there any evidence that it is only new employees without previous central government experience who risk making errors of judgment in their role as government employees. We also know, on the basis of previous research on learning, that an organisation needs to foster collegial learning to increase skills and achieve effects of the type of training involved here. All personnel need to be involved in work of this kind. The Delegation therefore proposes that the training should be compulsory and that the principle should be that the obligation to complete the training should cover everyone working in government agencies, authorities under the Riksdag and the courts, and not just new employees. The training covers both managers and other staff members.</p>
<h2>A common training is important for greater equivalence, quality and confidence in central government administration</h2>
<p>Previous training initiatives for government employees have lacked a long-term stable structure, even though a training actor in central government has been needed. At present there is no authority that has sole responsibility for providing training about the role of government employees. However, certain authorities are tasked with training government employees in specific areas.</p>
<h2>Equivalence of current introductory courses low</h2>
<p>With the assistance of the Swedish Agency for Public Management, the Delegation for Trust-Based Governance has conducted a survey that shows low equivalence among current introductory courses for new employees. There is a great difference in what training they get, depending on what authority they work for. There is variation in content, scale and the extent to which the training is compulsory.</p>
<p>Currently most introductory courses have the overall purpose of giving employees an understanding of the activities of their authority and guiding new employees to enable them to settle into their work quickly. In general, the introductory courses have not had the purpose of describing the role of the authority in a broader context. However, most agencies say that they cover basic legal principles and the role of government employees in some way. The components of introductory courses that concern the role of government employees can, for example, deal with basic values of central government, public access to official documents and secrecy, knowledge about public administration and its distinctive character, basic administrative law or information about the governance of central government. Large authorities, authorities with supervisory tasks and authorities with extensive citizen-centred service provision state more often than small authorities that their courses include information about the basic values and governance of central government.</p>
<p>Over 80% of the authorities included in the survey have a compulsory introductory course for new employees on open-ended contracts. There are, however, differences between sectors. For instance, compulsory introductory courses are seldom found at higher education institutions.</p>
<p>The scale of the training also varies between authorities. Around 40% of the authorities state that their training is between 9 and 16 hours long. As a rough assessment, authorities devote about 4 of these hours to training concerning the role of government employees.</p>
<h2>Many authorities see a need for a common training</h2>
<p>A majority of authorities have replied through the Delegation’s questionnaire or in other contacts that there is a need for a common introductory training. Two reasons are given repeatedly. One is to ensure that all new employees in central government are given the same basic introduction to their role as government employees and that a common training creates better conditions for quality assurance of the content of the training. A second reason is that it would be more efficient if central government coordinated the training instead of as, at present, having each authority produce and provide training on their own.</p>
<h2>Conditions for learning and importance of the commitment of all concerned</h2>
<p>If a training is to be able to achieve a change in the knowledge and behaviour of government employees, formal training needs to be combined with informal and continuous learning. We know from research and previous experience that knowledge is spread and reproduced through procedures and cooperation. Organisation and leadership are essential for continuous collective and collegial learning. Discussion, exchanges of experience and critical reflection are also needed to foster learning, at the same time as participants in a training can benefit from engaging in self-study before and after group discussions and lectures.</p>
<p>In its work, the Delegation made the assessment that an e-training course should be an important part of the training. Experience shows that it is important to take account both of integrity and security aspects and of potential financing when producing such a training course. One important principle, both for the technical design of the training course and for its delivery is to seek to design and deliver the training course in the simplest possible way. The Delegation considers that simplicity needs to be accompanied by a high degree of shared responsibility and commitment, in which authorities clearly bear the common commitment and view the training as a good investment for their activities and for central government administration and trust in it. This shared responsibility can also contribute to good cost-effectiveness in delivery. While simplicity and commitment by the authorities are its starting point, the Delegation also proposes statutory regulation.</p>
<h2>We propose an act for common training covering everyone working in central government administration</h2>
<p>An act on a common training in central government administration that applies to government agencies, authorities under the Riksdag and the courts should be introduced. This obligation will therefore cover both managers and other staff members.</p>
<p>The act should apply to employees, contractors and people doing a work placement in a government agency or at a court. Here a contractor refers to a person who has an assignment regulated by statute. It should also apply to doctoral students who have been admitted to a third-cycle course or programme at a state higher education institution without being employed by the institution.</p>
<p>The Delegation proposes that the act should not apply to government ministers, the Auditor-General, the Deputy Auditor-General, an acting Auditor-General, the Parliamentary Ombudsmen, the Chancellor of Justice or permanent judges. This is because of their role in the constitutional system and the importance of safeguarding their independence. In our assessment, the law should not apply to locally engaged employees in Sweden’s foreign representation who do not have Swedish citizenship, either.</p>
<p>Those who are covered by the law have the obligation to participate in basic training in central government administration. This obligation does not apply to those who have previously participated in such training or who are working to a minor extent in a government agency or at a court. The authorities shall ensure that a person who is covered by the obligation to participate in basic training does so as soon as an opportunity is given. The basic training should be provided at least twice a year. A person who has participated in basic training in central government administration should then be given further training.</p>
<p>A council for training in central government administration should be established as a separate decision-making body at the Swedish Agency for Public Management. The task of the council should be to decide on the content of the common training in central government administration. The overall regulation of the council should take place by law. The council should consist of equal numbers of members elected by the Riksdag and appointed by the Government. The reason for regulating the work of the council by law is to create a balance between the Riksdag and the Government and to create the best possible conditions for long-term and sustainable work on values that apply under the Constitution, for instance, to the whole of central government administration. These are values that enjoy broad political support and that stand the test of time.</p>
<h2>The aim is greater knowledge, understanding and ability</h2>
<p>The Delegation considers that the expectations of the results of the training must be reasonable in the light of its scale. At the same time, it is important that the training makes a difference.</p>
<p>The common training in central government administration is intended to strengthen the ability to handle the special role held by a person working in a government agency or at a court and to increase knowledge about basic legal principles and sets of regulations that apply in central government administration.</p>
<p>The recommendation of the Delegation is that the objective of the training should be to give participants knowledge that enhances their knowledge and understanding of:</p>
<p>• the basic standards, legal principles and sets of regulations that apply to central government administration; and</p>
<p>• their ability to handle the special role that follows from working in central government administration.</p>
<p>The training should not only enhance knowledge but also establish identity. This common identity is a central part of the role of government employees. It is part of understanding the context in which they operate, as well as how this role differs from, for instance, being employed in the private sector. The training should therefore start from the individual and their role as a government employee.</p>
<h2>Training with four components</h2>
<p>The Delegation recommends that the training should consist of the following four components: 1. The role of government employees in a democracy under the rule of law. 2. The role of government employees in central government administration and the role and mission of authorities. 3. The conditions, possibilities, approaches and risks in the  day-today role as government employees. 4. Different tasks, situations and demands that government employees face on a  day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>The Delegation’s assessment is that there are number of areas that it is relevant to include within the framework of these components. They are the basic values of central government, basic legal principles and sets of regulations that apply in central government administration, the constitutional foundation of central government, human rights, the objectives of administrative policy, the role of a government employee, a good administrative culture and conduct in contacts with the public.</p>
<p>Moreover, knowledge about what generates confidence in central government administration should be taken into account so as to ensure that the basic training contributes to the achievement of objectives and so as to achieve the aim of the training. Here the eight guiding principles for the approach for trust-based governance and management are also of central importance.</p>
<h2>Self-study should be combined with physical meetings for discussions and reflection</h2>
<p>The Delegation makes the assessment that the basic training should be 10 hours long. This enables the training to produce results at the same time we assess its delivery as realistic.</p>
<p>The training should consist of basic training and further training. The basic training should be delivered both electronically and through physical meetings. Our proposal is that the participants from different authorities at regional level should hold group discussions at physical meetings. The sites of the meetings should be chosen in the light of the authorities’ workplaces.</p>
<p>The Delegation proposes that the group discussions should be led by supervisors appointed on the basis of proposals by the authorities. They should be individuals who are employees or contractors either in a government agency or at a court included in the geographical area where meetings are to be held. The individuals leading group discussions should have completed a supervisor training.</p>
<h2>Basic training followed by further training</h2>
<p>The Delegation considers it necessary to ensure that training in the role of a government employee is held continuously. A short basic training is not sufficient to develop and strengthen that role. By providing further training, the knowledge and understanding given by the basic training can be enhanced and the long-term effects of the training improved. Continuous further training contributes to employees being able to have recurring discussions about the role of government employees. This will give them the opportunity to strengthen their skills and their assessment ability so as to be able to act in a professional and ethically responsible way in their role as government employees; this can, in turn, contribute to greater confidence in central government administration.</p>
<p>The Delegation therefore proposes that a person who has participated in basic training in central government administration should be given further training. The purpose of the further training is to maintain and develop the knowledge and experience the participant received through the basic training.</p>
<p>Government agencies and the courts should provide the further training; this will give each authority the opportunity to adapt the further training to their own needs. The authorities should, at the same time, be given equivalent support for their further training. The agency responsible for producing training material for the further training could therefore have the task of identifying a theme each year and developing study material and discussion questions that can contribute to strengthening and developing employees in their role as government employees.</p>
<h2>Two agencies should be responsible for the training</h2>
<p>The Delegation’s assessment is that common training requires capacity, a long-term perspective, legitimacy and educational competence in the agency responsible for the training. At present, no agency evidently meets all the criteria identified by the Delegation. Our assessment is therefore that the tasks that follow from coordinating the training should be split between two agencies.</p>
<p>The Delegation proposes that a large university should provide the basic training in the common training in central government administration. The university should deliver the training and its main tasks should be to:</p>
<p>• be responsible for the technical solutions needed to deliver the training electronically;</p>
<p>• designate and train supervisors to arrange and lead the physical meetings included in the basic training;</p>
<p>• decide on exemptions from the obligation to participate in the basic training when justified in view of the individual’s tasks or personal circumstances; and</p>
<p>The Council for Training in Central Government Administration should be established as a separate decision-making body at the Swedish Agency for Public Management. The Council should decide on the content of the training and decide on the geographical division for the physical meetings.</p>
<p>The Swedish Agency for Public Management should be the host agency for the Council for Training in Central Government Administration. The tasks this involves are to handle administrative tasks for the Council and to issue regulations about the content of the training in accordance with the decisions taken by the Council. This applies to both the basic training and the further training. As the host agency, the Swedish Agency for Public Management also needs to contribute supporting information for council decisions on, for instance, the content of the training and geographical areas for physical meetings.</p>
<p>The university and the Council will be responsible for the delivery of and conditions for the training. However, the single most important actors for the achievement of the objective of the training and the sustainability of its results over time will be all the government agencies and courts.</p>
<h2>Gradual implementation to ensure training capacity and quality</h2>
<p>In view of the large number of people who will be taking the training, a well-arranged introduction is essential. There should be time to test the content and form of the training. So as to be able to guarantee access to training and supervisors, the training needs to be implemented in stages in central government administration.</p>
<p>The Delegation proposes testing the basic training in a pilot study before its implementation at full scale. The pilot study should cover employees and contractors at certain agencies under the Government and certain courts. The university designated by the Government should be responsible for the implementation of the pilot study and decide which authorities should take part. The authorities that take part in the pilot study should ensure that their employees and contractors take the basic training. The pilot study should be regulated in a temporary government ordinance.</p>
<p>Employees and contractors in agencies under the Government and at courts that did not take part in the pilot study should then take part in a basic training over a period of four years. The government agencies and courts should also be responsible, in this stage, for their employees and contractors participating the basic training. This should also be regulated in the temporary government ordinance.</p>
<p>The permanent act and the supplementary government ordinance should enter into force once the basic training has been introduced for employees and contractors in agencies under the Government and at the courts. The temporary government ordinance should then cease to apply. This will transfer the obligation to participate in the training to the individuals covered by the act.</p>
<p>When the permanent act has entered into force, the training will have to be delivered for authorities under the Riksdag and for others covered by the common training in central government administration. Then the rules on further training also start to apply.</p>
<h2>Following up the training is important from various perspectives</h2>
<p>A follow-up is needed for individuals who are covered by the law as they are obliged to complete the basic training. A follow-up is also important for the government agencies and the courts, who have to make sure that their staff complete the basic training. At the same time, the Delegation makes the assessment that the follow-up should be carried out in a way that does not become an additional administrative burden for the authorities.</p>
<p>In the case of the authorities, the Delegation proposes linking the check of participation in the basic training to the physical meetings. This check can be made in a relatively simple way by the supervisor in charge of the training session noting which individuals are present. In the case of individuals, we propose that, following participation in basic training, they should be able, on request, to receive a course certificate from the university that was responsible for providing the basic training.</p>
<p>In the assessment of the Delegation a follow-up is also needed at aggregate level of how many complete the training from various authorities and regional areas. This is to ensure that the planning of the delivery of the training will be correctly dimensioned.</p>
<p>After a couple of years, it would, in the assessment of the Delegation be valuable to evaluate the training and its effects.</p>
<h2>Authorities need to adapt their introductory courses</h2>
<p>Authorities need to adapt their introductory courses to the basic training. This should be done by each authority so that its need for training can be met regarding both authority-specific content and what is common to central government administration.</p>
<p>All authorities have an important responsibility for introducing their new employees to their authority and giving them relevant training. Authorities have different tasks and competencies and have good awareness of what knowledge their activities require new employees to have to enable them to feel secure with their work duties and tasks. Introductory courses thus have the overall purpose of giving employees an understanding of the activities of their authority and of guiding new employees to enable them to settle into their work quickly. The common basic training has a partly different purpose from the introductory courses currently provided by central government authorities. Its overall purpose is to strengthen employees’ role as government employees and provide knowledge of common rules. So the basic training proposed by the Delegation will mainly complement the authorities’ introductory courses. However, some components of several authorities’ introductory courses will need to be adapted when the basic training is introduced. The authorities will themselves be responsible for how and when to make this adaptation.</p>
<p>When it comes to further training, the principle is that all authorities should receive an equivalent level of support for this. The support should be designed to enable authorities to adapt it to the circumstances and needs of their own activities. There are authorities that already carry out further training in the form of dilemma exercises and the like. The Delegation’s view is that the further training proposed here should be seen as a complement since it is at an equivalent level for all authorities. Authorities are also able to make their own decisions on how to deliver the further training.</p>
<h2>Obligation alongside commitment and voluntary resourcing</h2>
<p>In the view of the Delegation, lasting effects of learning require long-term commitment by the authorities concerning the common training. For authorities to be able to bear this responsibility, the training needs to be as simple, accessible and cost-efficient as possible. The training should be regarded as an important investment for authorities and for central government administration as a whole. The importance of the training and the purpose of taking the training needs to be backed by all concerned, especially managers and senior authority management. There needs to be clarity that resources in the form of time can be prioritised for the training and that all parties can contribute in various ways. It will have to be simple to allocate the time needed, and delivering the training will have to be simple, at the same time as its value should be seen as relevant and knowledge-enhancing.</p>
<p>A clear commitment on the part of authorities is needed regarding access to supervisors, for instance. They will be appointed on the basis of proposals from authorities themselves and be given time and training to handle their assignment. The system of supervisors is essentially based on the authorities contributing resources on a voluntary basis.</p>
<h2>A basic training can be a first step towards a common virtual learning environment for central government</h2>
<p>The Delegation’s overall assessment is that self-study in the basic training should be available on a technical platform that is open so that as many as possible can access it. Making training transparent and open is a strength in terms of citizens’ possibilities of getting an insight into the role of government employees. It may be individual citizens, schools or municipalities and regions that choose to access the training.</p>
<p>In the longer term, the virtual learning environment can also be designed so that it can be expanded by adding different modules, and also linked up with existing training provided by other authorities. It is important to bring such training courses together at one and the same place. This increases cost-efficiency and accessibility, and also increases the opportunities for developing the skills of government employees. In the longer term this strengthens confidence in central government and ultimately the democratic legal order.</p>
