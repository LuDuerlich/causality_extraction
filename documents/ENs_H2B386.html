<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>Our remit was to conduct an overall review of the expenditures financed through appropriation 1:12 ‘Legal counsels, etc’. We have been instructed to consider what measures can be taken that could have a cost-limiting effect on the appropriation. Within the context of this review, we were tasked more specifically with:</p>
<p>• looking into whether it is justified to limit to any extent access to public defence counsel and injured party counsel in certain cases;</p>
<p>• considering a tightening of the rules concerning the repayment obligation for convicted persons;</p>
<p>• proposing limits to the possibility of changing public defence counsel;</p>
<p>• considering adjusting the income ceiling and the fees for legal aid;</p>
<p>• proposing different levels in the hourly rate system for public defence counsels and injured party counsels;</p>
<p>• proposing time limits in the hourly rate system for injured party counsels;</p>
<p>• proposing increased use of standard remuneration, a ‘tariff’, in criminal cases; and</p>
<p>• proposing an hourly rate system for receivers in bankruptcy.</p>
<h2>Our starting points</h2>
<p>An initial starting point for us was that the appropriation is intended to safeguard legal security for both the accused and the victims of crime. This includes safeguarding the right to a fair trial. The system is also intended to help maintain public confidence in the judicial system, which is fundamentally important in a state governed by the rule of law.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s view, society has an obligation to provide support to both suspects and victims of crime, in accordance with their needs, in the form of qualified legal support, both to create a balance in the process and to meet the requirements of a fair trial. This view has very much influenced our considerations.</p>
<p>Another starting point was to also examine all possibilities for making savings, as long as this does not result in unacceptable consequences for the individual. The question of whether it is reasonable for the State to contribute to paying costs should always be subject to examination.</p>
<p>Several legal instruments and conventions linked to these issues have been drawn up in the EU and in other international cooperation. Two examples that can be mentioned are the EU Charter and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Directive 2013/48/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings, etc. should also be mentioned in this context. Such documents have also underpinned our considerations.</p>
<h2>Public defence counsels</h2>
<p>The costs to society of public defence counsels are considerable and have risen sharply in recent years. This sharp increase can be assumed to have several causes. The number of criminal cases brought before the courts has risen and the nature of the cases has changed. Cases have become more extensive and complex. Processing times have increased. New technology has given rise to new types of offences. Developments have created new platforms of crime. More cases are now family-related. The number of priority cases has increased.</p>
<p>The trends in cases before Swedish courts are also a result of the investments made in the judicial system. More and more crimes are being reported and investigated. Particularly costly are efforts to combat organised crime, which have led to increases in costs. Increasingly extensive and complex criminal cases are requiring increased investments in defence counsels.</p>
<p>Our conclusion with regard to the rise in costs for public defence counsels is that it has essentially been caused by what can be regarded as inevitable consequences of trends in crime and other circumstances that cannot be attributed to the existing regulatory framework. There is nothing to indicate that the current provisions are not essentially being applied as intended. Against this background, we consider that the provisions on the situations in which a public defence counsel is to be appointed are well-balanced. Therefore, we do not propose any amendments.</p>
<p>There are currently no legislative rules concerning the possibility of changing public defence counsel. Changing public defence counsel entails additional costs as the new public defence counsel has to become familiar with the case. For other counsels, e.g. legal aid counsels, there are explicit provisions on changing counsel. We therefore propose the introduction of an explicit provision on changing public defence counsel. We do not envisage any amendment to current established practice concerning change of public defence counsel.</p>
<h2>Injured party counsels</h2>
<p>Since 2004, the percentage increase in the costs for injured party counsels has been greater than the increase in the number of criminal cases concluded. The rate of increase has been high and relatively stable. The costs to society of injured party counsels are considerable. Here too, this sharp increase in costs can be assumed to have several causes. The number of reported crimes in which an injured party counsel is usually appointed has risen. A new category of crime is internet-related crime involving sexual elements. Injured party counsels are normally appointed in such cases, which often involve several injured parties. Injured parties now receive better information about their right to an injured party counsel.</p>
<p>Some of the increase during the period can be explained by the amendments made in 2005 to the sexual offences legislation.</p>
<p>Although there are explanations for the rise in costs and the increase in the number of injured party counsels appointed, some perceive that injured party counsels are sometimes appointed somewhat routinely and that the criteria for appointing an injured party counsel are not fully considered. It is important that the resources of the judicial system are concentrated to situations in which the injured party has a real need of counsel. Therefore, to address the importance of a proper examination being carried out in each individual case, we propose certain amendments to Section 1 of the Injured Party Counsel Act.</p>
<p>The ‘More modern court proceedings’ reform has led to a general reduction in injured parties’ needs during court proceedings in the court of appeal. We therefore propose that an injured party counsel’s appointment should end once the time limit for appealing the judgment of the district court has expired. If the injured party so wishes or if there are other grounds for doing so, a new examination should be carried out to determine whether or not an injured party counsel should be appointed for proceedings in a higher court.</p>
<p>To ensure that only people who are suitable for the assignment are appointed as injured party counsels, we propose the introducetion of a special provision stating that the court’s permission must be sought in all cases of substitution of an injured party counsel in a main hearing. The court will thus be able to determine in individual cases whether substitution is appropriate.</p>
<h2>Income ceiling and fees for legal aid</h2>
<p>Currently, legal aid may be granted to people whose ‘economic basis’ does not exceed SEK 260 000. According to available statistics, this means that approximately 43 per cent of the population are currently eligible to receive legal aid. When the 1996 Legal Aid Act entered into force, it was expected that the income ceiling would be reviewed at regular intervals. A suitable guideline given was that a review be carried out every three years, although there could be certain occasions where there would be grounds to deviate from this. The current income ceiling has applied since 1999. In light of this, we propose that the income ceiling for eligibility for legal aid be raised to SEK 400 000. This proposal means that approximately 80 per cent of the population will be eligible to receive legal aid.</p>
<p>We do not propose any change to the way in which legal aid fees are calculated. A person who has been granted legal aid must also pay a legal aid fee in the future. This fee is determined by the costs of the legal aid counsel and the applicant’s economic basis. However, we propose that an additional level be included in the fee system and that the fee, and the minimum fee, be changed at the different levels. Moreover, we propose a raise in the deduction for children when calculating the applicant’s economic basis.</p>
<p>To enable more effective cost control, we propose that the Government instruct the Swedish National Courts Administration to look into the possibility of developing the data systems of the Legal Aid Authority.</p>
<p>From what we have learnt, cases involving inexperienced and unqualified legal aid counsels tend to take longer and cost more than cases involving experienced and qualified counsels. There should be more careful checks of the people being appointed legal aid counsels. We do not propose any change to the rules regarding who should be eligible for appointment as legal aid counsel. The aim of guaranteeing, as far as possible, that legal aid counsels are sufficiently qualified should be achieved by those appointing counsels carrying out more careful checks of the counsel’s qualifications.</p>
<p>If the legal aid system is to function and if those entitled to legal aid are to receive it, it is important that the regulatory framework concerning the fees system is observed. The Swedish National Courts Administration and the courts should therefore ensure that the people at the courts responsible for processing legal aid applications receive the relevant training and guidelines for processing such applications.</p>
<p>For legislative reasons, we propose an amendment to Section 19 of the Legal Aid Act. No amendment to the substance is intended.</p>
<h2>Repayment obligation for convicted persons</h2>
<p>The provisions on the repayment obligation for convicted persons are often applied far more generously than warranted by the regulatory framework. This entails increased costs for the State. To make it easier for the courts to deal with the repayment obligation correctly, we propose the development of systemic support. The issue of systemic support should be left to the Swedish National Courts Administration to investigate.</p>
<p>In addition, we propose making the repayment obligation for convicted persons more stringent in various ways. However the link to legal aid legislation should be kept.</p>
<p>We propose introducing a minimum level for the repayment obligation for people convicted of crimes. The amount the convicted person is to repay for the costs of public defence counsel – and where relevant certain other counsels – should not fall below SEK 5 000. However, the amount to be repaid must never exceed the costs. The possibility of adjusting the repayment will be kept, but it should only be possible to adjust the repayment down to the minimum amount at the lowest. The minimum amount should not apply if the convicted person has not reached the age of eighteen on the date of the judgment or if the convicted person was suffering from a serious mental disturbance when he or she committed the crime.</p>
<p>The repayment obligation should also apply in proceedings concerning the setting aside of a penalty and the imposition of another penalty for a crime, or concerning another measure relating to an imposed penalty.</p>
<p>We propose a special provision stating that a defendant is to reimburse the State for all of the costs paid from the public purse for remuneration to public defence counsels, and where relevant other counsels, in the higher court if the case has lapsed due to circumstances attributable to the defendant. However, this should not apply if the defendant was lawfully absent and it was not possible to report the absence in time, or if the case is reinstated.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the repayment obligation for convicted persons also cover saliva samples taken to carry out DNA analysis when investigating a crime.</p>
<p>The person in charge of the preliminary investigation is to inform the suspect of the provisions that apply concerning the repayment obligation.</p>
<h2>Remuneration for public defence counsels and injured party counsels</h2>
<p>In light of the increase in costs for public defence counsels and injured party counsels, there is reason to consider ways of keeping costs down. One way of keeping costs down could be to have different standard hourly rates for public defence counsels and injured party counsels. Likewise, a restriction in the hourly rate system for injured party counsels could be considered.</p>
<p>In our assessment, different standard hourly rates for public defence counsels and injured party counsels should not be introduced. One argument against having different rates is that this could make it more difficult to find qualified lawyers willing to take on the task of injured party counsel. Moreover, lower remuneration for injured party counsels than for public defence counsels does not sit well with general developments in terms of support for the victims of crime. It is not appropriate to generalise and assert that the tasks of an injured party counsel are less skilled than those of a public defence counsel. It is also necessary to highlight the risk that different standard hourly rates would jeopardise the continued supply of lawyers specialising in law governing individuals.</p>
<p>We do not consider that a restriction should be introduced in the hourly rate system for injured party counsels. This kind of rule is not appropriate for criminal proceedings, which are very different from civil proceedings. In criminal cases, the primary interest is for the State to prosecute people for crimes. Criminal proceedings are largely steered by the prosecutor and the defendant. In many cases, the injured party and the injured party counsel do not have any influence over proceedings.</p>
<p>We have investigated whether the area covered by the tariff could be broadened. We propose that the current criminal case tariff be extended to cover two accused persons with the same counsel or one counsel each and/or two injured parties with the same defence counsel or one defence counsel each. This kind of tariff would probably result in cost reductions for the State, or it would at least mitigate any cost increases. It would also facilitate the processing of cases for courts and counsels. We propose that the Swedish National Courts Administration be tasked with broadening the tariff.</p>
<p>We have considered whether it would be suitable to extend the current tariff to cover full-day cases, i.e. cases in which the main hearing lasts up to six hours. However, we have decided not to submit such a proposal, primarily because the studies upon which the tariff is based are very old and do not reflect changes in the legal environment brought about by the ‘More modern court proceedings’ reform, for example. In our view, introducing a full-day tariff may have advantages.</p>
<p>We have considered whether one way of improving cost control with regard to counsel fees would be for decisions on remuneration for counsels to be taken separately and not in connection with a judgment or decision in a case. Remuneration issues would thus be given greater attention and receive the time necessary for a thorough examination. However, this kind of system would involve some inconveniences. Processing would inevitably become more complicated, for example. In light of this, we consider that the current provisions should be kept.</p>
<p>Effective cost control is a prerequisite if the costs of legal counsels are to be kept at a reasonable level. We have therefore considered whether there is reason to extend the cost control carried out by the State with regard to the remuneration of legal counsels. We have considered whether there is reason to allow prosecutors to have a greater say in remuneration claims than is currently the case and whether the obligation to inform the Office of the Chancellor of Justice about awarded remuneration should be extended. In our assessment, the current ceilings for when a prosecutor is to express an opinion and when the Office of the Chancellor of Justice is to be informed about remuneration claims should be kept.</p>
<h2>Remuneration for receivers in bankruptcy</h2>
<p>Remuneration for receivers in bankruptcy has increased moderately in recent years and has not driven up the cost of the appropriation to any great extent.</p>
<p>Fees and reimbursement of expenses to a receiver are a bankruptcy cost that should primarily come from the bankruptcy estate. In cases in which bankruptcy is written off in accordance with Chapter 10, Section 1 of the Bankruptcy Act (1987:672) because the assets of the bankruptcy estate are not sufficient for paying the costs of the bankruptcy, the receiver may receive remuneration from the State in accordance with a special receiver tariff. If the assignment required considerably more work than normal, a higher fee can be set and paid to the receiver. In such cases, the fee does not follow an hourly rate system with a standard hourly rate. Instead, the court is to decide on a reasonable level of remuneration, taking into consideration the work required for the assignment, the care and skill with which it has been carried out and the size of the estate.</p>
<p>We have considered whether an hourly rate system should be introduced for receivers. In our view, an hourly rate system is not very suitable for bankruptcy cases. The circumstances of bankruptcies differ from other situations in which legal counsels are remunerated from State funds. In our view, one potential risk of introducing an hourly rate system is that it might negatively affect the possibility of investigating suspicions of crime or recovery. It cannot be taken for granted either that an hourly rate system would bring savings for the State in the long run. There is also a welldeveloped system for checks and supervision when handling bankruptcies. In our assessment, an hourly rate system for receivers in bankruptcy should not be introduced.</p>
<p>Instead we propose that the current tariff be extended to cover 16 hours’ work and that the tariff include remuneration for a time loss of one and a half hours. This proposal means that more bankruptcies will be included in the area covered by the tariff than is currently the case. It can be assumed that this change will eliminate the minor increase in cost that has occurred in recent years, without the change resulting in the disadvantages that the introduction of a standard hourly rate may entail.</p>
<h2>Entry into force, etc.</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the legislative amendments enter into force on a date determined by the Government.</p>
<p>We propose certain transitional provisions concerning the proposals for a stricter repayment obligation for convicted persons and concerning legal aid.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>On the whole, the implementation of the proposals we have made would not cause any increase in costs for the public purse. Rather, our calculations indicate a certain amount of increased financial scope, even if the income ceiling for legal aid is raised. However, the financial consequences are difficult to assess and are based on estimates.</p>
<p>Several of the proposed changes will require training and infor- mation for staff in the judicial system. We consider that these costs can be covered by the current appropriations. In the same way, some of the proposals will entail development costs, primarily for the Swedish National Courts Administration.</p>
<p>If our proposals are implemented, they are estimated to bring savings within the framework of appropriation 1:12 ‘Legal counsels, etc.’ of approximately SEK 16–19 million per year, after deducing the costs of raising the income ceiling for legal aid. Without deducting the costs of raising the income ceiling, the savings can be estimated to amount to approximately SEK 34 million.</p>
<p>The proposals on a stricter repayment obligation for convicted persons are estimated to provide increased revenue for the public purse of approximately SEK 27 million. This increased revenue will not go to the appropriation for legal counsels. Funds that the State receives on account of the repayment obligation are reported against income heading 2811 ‘Other income from central government acti- vities’.</p>
<p>If our proposals are implemented, they should therefore bring savings for the public purse of a total of approximately SEK 43–46 million, including a deduction for the raised income ceiling for legal aid. Without such a deduction, the savings can be estimated at approximately SEK 61 million.</p>
