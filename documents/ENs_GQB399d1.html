<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Why do boys in the age of zero – twenty in Swedish municipalities of Storfors (3.5 per 1,000 boys), Fagersta (4.7), and Karlskrona, Arboga and Norberg (4.9) have the lowest injury rates in the country, whereas those in Ödeshög (26.8), Strömsund (23.9), Nordanstig (21.5), Motala (21.3) and Vännäs (20.9) have the highest rates?</p>
<p>Girls in the age of zero – twenty generally show a lower injury rate than boys, but why are there differences between municipalities even in this respect? The lowest injury rates in Sweden are in the municipalities of Pajala (2.3 per 1,000 girls), Skinnskatteberg (2.4), Hallstahammar and Övertorneå (2.9), and Örkelljunga (3.5). The highest are in Söderköping (14.9 per 1,000 girls), Härryda (14.4), (Mellerud 14.1), and Varberg and Valdemarsvik (13.9).</p>
<p>In this Child Injury Atlas we primarily describe how many children have received inpatient hospital care, but we also point out that injury is by far the most common cause of death among children aged one year or more. When we speak of injury in this context, we are referring to an outcome resulting from an accident or act of violence, or something that is self-inflicted.</p>
<p>Despite the large number of injuries reported here, Sweden can still be regarded as a pioneering country with regard to the prevention of child injury. This results from the view that child injury is a public-health problem that has to be taken seriously. From an extremely high level of injuries to children, with as many as 450 children under 15 dying due to accidents during 1954, Sweden has shown a unique trend. In 2000, there were just 49 injury-related child deaths. The explanations for this are regarded as lying in favorable economic and social development, and also the conscious efforts made with regard to child safety in a variety of social sectors. Nevertheless, far too many children are killed or severely injured “quite unnecessarily”, and Sweden needs to continue to work intensively so as not to lose its leading position from an international perspective.</p>
<p>The relatively successful situation in Sweden can also be attributed to the work of The Joint Committee for the Prevention of Accidents to Children,  established in 1954, which was the precursor of other social initiatives – such as those taken by the National Child Environment Council, the Children’s Ombudsman, and the Child Safety Commission  fairly recently set up by the Swedish Government.</p>
<p>This Child Injury Atlas has been produced in order to draw attention to injuries among children, and thereby provide a factual base for measures to be taken by government agencies, municipalities, county councils, voluntary organizations, etc. Its primary purpose – by means of maps, tables and charts – is to demonstrate geographical differences and similarities in the extent of child injury within the country. It is also aimed at increasing awareness of the existence of registry data and the opportunities available to use injury statistics as a basis for preventive action – at municipal, county or national level – or even within specific sectors (such as with regard to traffic injuries).</p>
<p>Currently, there are a number of Swedish municipalities and county councils that organize injury-prevention activities in accordance with modern principles. However, the pace of development has been slow, and there is still a need to deepen the content of programs to prevent child injuries and get all Sweden’s municipalities involved.</p>
<p>In this report we have chosen not to go into any in-depth analysis of the varying injury patterns and trends in particular areas. We leave this work to health-planning officers, local politicians, municipal planners, other researchers, health-care personnel, nationalgovernment agencies, parents’ organizations, and private individuals, among others. Persons at local-government level (municipal or county) are particularly important since injury outcome shows striking variation from area to area.</p>
<p>The initiative for the Atlas was taken by both a group of researchers and Sweden’s Child Safety Commission. It has been produced by the Karolinska Institute’s Department of Public Health Sciences (Division of Social Medicine) – in close collaboration with the Epidemiology Center at the National Board of Welfare, and Statistics Sweden (SCB).</p>
