<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Current rules</h2>
<p>The current Swedish right of priority legislation is set forth in the Right of Priority Act (SFS 1970:979).</p>
<p>The rules become applicable after property that belongs to a party other than the bankrupt debtor (in U.K. the debtor in insolvent liquidation) is excluded from the estate. This means that property belonging to, for example, consignors, sellers under sales pursuant to retention of title clauses, and lessors, is not included in the estate. With respect to retention of title clauses, however, it should be noted that under Swedish law retention of title clauses are invalid against the buyer’s creditors if the buyer had obtained permission to resell, process, or use the property prior to making payment to the seller. Nor is property that a person has purchased from the future debtor in bankruptcy included in the estate. With regard to chattels, there is, however, an important additional condition. In order to be protected against the seller’s creditors, the buyer must have taken the purchased chattels into his possession, or have registered his acquisition with the court, prior to the granting of the bankruptcy petition.</p>
<p>Under Swedish law, creditors possessing security interests in personal or real property are creditors in the bankruptcy. They possess the superior right to payment from the security interest (section 4 of the Right of Priority Act). Property subject to security interests cannot be encumbered with expenses of the bankruptcy other than such as are related to the custody or sale of the property (Chapter 14, section 18 of the Bankruptcy Act, 1987:672). Creditors with possessory liens, e.g. as a result of a contract for repair, are equated with security interest holders.</p>
<p>Before the other creditors can obtain dividends, the estate’s expenses and liabilities must be paid from those assets in the bankruptcy which are not encumbered with security interests (Chapter 11, section 1, and Chapter 14, section 18 of the Bankruptcy Act). Subject to certain simplifications, the following then applies with respect to the right of priority.</p>
<p>Firstly, the assets are applied to the payment of the creditors’ costs for placing the debtor in bankruptcy and the payment of loans which have been granted during an attempt at business reorganisation prior to the bankruptcy (the administrator’s fees and any operating loans with the administrator’s consent; section 10 of the Right of Priority Act). Where possible, payment of these claims is made from assets other than those which would result in a reduced dividend to the creditors with rights of priority in accordance with sections 5 and 8 of the Right of Priority Act (see below).</p>
<p>Thereafter, certain assets are applied to the payment of not more than three months rent on real property and to claims secured by business mortgage (section 5 of the Right of Priority Act). Business mortgages are governed by the Business Mortgage Act (1984:649). Rights of priority for rent and for business mortgage constitute floating charges, which apply to all property presently, owned by the debtor, subject to certain exceptions. These exceptions include, among other things, bank balances and cash, negotiable promissory notes, shares and bonds, as well as property which can be pledged through registration, such as real estate and ships (see Chapter 2, section 1 of the Business Mortgage Act 1984).</p>
<p>Thereafter, creditors have rights of priority in property on which execution has been levied, provided that the execution can not be avoided as a preferred transaction on the grounds that it was carried out less than three months prior to the bankruptcy (section 8 of the Right of Priority Act).</p>
<p>Thereafter, the remaining assets are applied to the payment of auditors’ fees (section 10a of the Right of Priority Act).</p>
<p>Thereafter the remaining assets are applied to claims by the State for taxes and fees (section 11 of the Right of Priority Act).</p>
<p>Thereafter, the remaining assets are applied to claims for wages which became due and payable not more than three months prior to the granting of the bankruptcy petition or which relate to wages following notice of dismissal pursuant to the Employment Protection Act and claims for holiday compensation for the current and preceding year (section 12 of the Right of Priority Act). Wage claims, which have a right of priority in a bankruptcy, are guaranteed by the State up to a total amount of SEK 100,000 per employee (Wage Guarantee Act, 1992:497). Where the State has paid compensation pursuant to the wage guarantee, the State is subrogated to the employees’rights in the bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Finally, the remaining assets are divided among what are commonly referred to as creditors without any right of priority, in proportion to their claims (section 18 of the Right of Priority Act).</p>
<p>The claims of certain creditors may, however, be subordinated pursuant to agreements with the debtor, and such creditors receive payment only after all other creditors have received full satisfaction of their claims.</p>
<h2>Certain financial information</h2>
<p>In conjunction with bankruptcies, the largest amount of claims relates to creditors without rights of priority. The amount of their claims equal the amount of all other creditors. Claims by creditors (usually banks) whose claims are secured by business mortgage constitute an amount more than half the size of claims of creditors without rights of priority. Thereafter, the State’s tax claims constitute an amount half the size of claims secured by business mortgages. Wage claims, in their turn, constitute an amount approximately half the size of tax claims.</p>
<p>On average, floating charges provide a dividend of approximately 45% of the amount of the claim. Tax and wage claims usually yield approximately 10%, while on average creditors without right of priority receive only 3%. It is, however, difficult to talk in terms of averages in this context. Thus, the median dividend on wage claims is 0%, from which it is evident that, for the employees, wage guarantees are more important than rights of priority for wage claims.</p>
<h2>The tasks of the Right of Priority Committee</h2>
<p>The rules with respect to composition were previously set forth in an Act from 1970 (no. 847). This entailed, primarily, that individual execution measures were prohibited during the period of time in which composition negotiations were pending and that, following a qualified majority vote, the claims of creditors without rights of priority could be reduced, normally to a minimum of 25%.</p>
<p>In 1992, a committee designated as the Insolvency Committee presented a proposal (SOU 1992:113) for a Business Reorganisation Act which was intended to replace the Composition Act and, hopefully, increase the number of compositions. In fact, Sweden has had only approximately 50 judicial compositions per year, while there are approximately 9,000 bankruptcies. Following prolonged consideration by the Ministry of Justice, the new Act was enacted in 1996 (no. 764). The changes were not great. Where possible, company reorganisations should be brought forward and can now be initiated as soon as payment difficulties arise, even though there is not necessarily a situation of insolvency. During the attempted reorganisation, financing is facilitated by a new right of priority for loans to the debtor under reorganisation (section 10 of the Right of Priority Act). The debtor under reorganisation should also more easily be able to retain advantageous contracts. In Chapter 2, section 20 of the Business Reorganisation Act, a rule has been introduced whereby, following the initiation of a reorganisation, the opposite party to an agreement may not terminate the contract as a result of any grounds of termination which arose prior thereto, if the debtor under reorganisation performs, or provides security for, that which relates to the period since the commencement of the reorganisation. The restriction on termination cannot be contractually excluded. Ipso facto  clauses are not covered by the rule other than where, possibly, by analogy. Certain other proposals including, inter alia , the abolition of the right of priority for tax claims and the redrafting of the right of priority for certain wage claims and business mortgage were not, however, carried out.</p>
<p>In the Swedish Parliament, politicians from all political parties were unhappy with the fact that the Ministry’s handling of the proposals of the Insolvency Committee took such a long time and that the proposals were only partially implemented. In various motions, it was stated that the new Act would not result in any appreciable reduction in bankruptcies or an increase in the number of business reorganisations.</p>
<p>The Right of Priority Committee (JU 1996:02) 1  was thus appointed in 1996 with the task, once again, of reviewing the right of priority rules which are relevant when choosing between business reorganisation without bankruptcy, and bankruptcy. The aim was, thus, to promote business reorganisations through compositions, without bankruptcy. However, the Committee was also naturally to take into consideration that the rules would not threaten the provision of loans to solvent companies. The subjects which were specifically mentioned in the terms of reference were business mortgage (which, however, it was presupposed would essentially remain), rights of priority for tax claims, and rights of priority for wage claims. With regard to wage claims, the Committee was to provide employees, in the event of bankruptcy, with protection which would be as comprehensive as possible but, at the same time, pursuant to supplementary terms of reference which were issued 1 1/2 years later, would save SEK 300 million, or approximately 30-50% of the State’s expenditures on wage guarantees. In addition, the Committee was charged with the task of investigating whether a debtor under reorganisation should be able to terminate contracts prematurely. _______________</p>
<h2>Summary of the proposals</h2>
<p>The Committee primarily proposes as follows: - that the right of priority for rental claims be abolished; - that the right of priority for business mortgage be converted into a right of priority in 50% of all property; - that the right of priority for tax claims be abolished; - that the right of priority for wage claims be restricted to wages which accrued during a period of three months prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition until one week after the granting of the petition, subject to a ceiling of ten times the statutory base amount (currently approximately SEK 36,000, i.e. 360,000). These claims and claims for wages following notice of dismissal, which correspond to what is paid pursuant to the Employment Protection Act (1982:80), i.e. for a period not exceeding six months, are protected through a State wage guarantee with a ceiling of four times the statutory base amount (currently approximately SEK 145,000). Where an employee whose employment has been terminated works for the estate in bankruptcy commencing one week after the granting of the petition, the wages shall be paid from the estate without the possibility of utilising the wage guarantee; - that the wage guarantee be extended to apply also to business reorganisations controlled by the court, without bankruptcy, to the same extent as compensation would have been paid in an bankruptcy. Prior to the annulment of a business reorganisation order by the court, the debtor must repay to the State any funds which has been paid from the wage guarantee, while the State’s claims with respect to wages following notice of dismissal to those who have not worked can be reduced through a composition. If the business reorganisation is converted directly into a bankruptcy, funds, which have been paid from the wage guarantee during the reorganisation, are deducted from what may be paid in wage guarantee under the bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The overall aims of the proposals are as follows: - to focus decisions with respect to loans more on the borrower’s repayment ability than on security; - to facilitate business reorganisations without bankruptcy through earlier reorganisations and through a reduction of special interests in composition negotiations; - to abolish the possibility of competition on unequal terms that arises due to the fact that an estate in bankruptcy can continue to conduct the business as a result of fact that wages to dismissed employees who work for the estate are compensated from the wage guarantee.</p>
<p>Through the abolition of the right of priority for rental claims, the limitation on the property which forms the basis for business mortgage, and the abolition of the wage guarantee for those who work for the estate during the period following notice of dismissal, it is estimated that the State’s net costs in respect of the wage guarantee (payroll taxes on the wage guarantee and dividends on wage claims less payments) will be improved by at least SEK 300 million.</p>
<p>The Committee also presented certain other proposals, which are passed over in this summary.</p>
<p>Set forth below is a more detailed account of the Committee’s considerations with respect to tax claims, wage claims, and business mortgage.</p>
<h2>The right of priority for tax claims</h2>
<p>During the past few decades, the right of priority for tax claims has been abolished in many foreign countries. In Sweden, such a proposal was first presented in SOU 1970:75. Thus far, however, the Government has consistently opposed such abolition. The reasons cited through the years have been that  the State cannot refrain from giving credit and cannot freely choose its debtors; that  the State finances would be detrimentally affected; that  the debt collection climate would become tougher; that,  in certain cases, tax claims relate to funds which are held on behalf of the State; and that  tax morals would be detrimentally affected. However, when considering the proposals of the Insolvency Committee, the Government was content to cite the difficult budgetary situation as a reason not to abolish the right of priority for tax claims.</p>
<p>The Committee concluded that the State is not alone in providing credit involuntarily. Creditors who are owed damages, particularly creditors owed damages in tort, also provide their credit involuntarily but have no right of priority. Nor do creditors who are owed damages possess the State’s possibility to make office holders personally liable for payment.</p>
<p>According to information compiled by the Committee, the debt collection climate can hardly become tougher. Already today, if security exists it is taken in conjunction with grants of respite.</p>
<p>Approximately 2/3 of the State’s claims relate to withholding taxes and VAT. Nevertheless, where withholding taxes are involved, the person subject to taxation cannot be said to hold the funds on behalf of the State to any greater degree than applies to other debt relationships, since payment takes place with funds which the person subject to taxation has acquired without any connection to the withholding tax liability. VAT funds, however, are collected precisely for the payment of VAT, but in this context it should be noted that other creditors holding funds in trust (e.g. wards in relation to guardians) do not have any right of priority where the funds held in trust are co-mingled with the debtor’s own assets.</p>
<p>The assumption that higher tax morals might be promoted through a right of priority for tax claims is probably based on the notion that a right of priority for tax claims is predicated on a general opinion that the State’s claims should be satisfied first. Against this, it can be objected that, thanks to the right of priority, the State can obtain payment without the person subject to taxation being required to pay the tax. A greater feeling of responsibility is created by the fact that office holders, through separate legislation, may incur a personal payment liability if the State does not obtain full payment of its tax claims.</p>
<p>During the circulation for comments of the proposals of the Insolvency Committee, one tax authority asserted that compositions would be made more difficult if the right of priority for tax claims was abolished. This opinion was presumably based on the fact that, in conjunction with composition negotiations, if the right of priority for tax claims were to disappear, one would also need to persuade the State to vote in favour of the composition. However, a composition becomes meaningless if only a small portion of the claims can be reduced; the requisite financial relief is not attained. In practice, a successful composition usually presupposes the voluntary participation of the State, even though the State need not do so since the State has rights of priority (compare Chapter 3, sections 3 and 8 of the Business Reorganisation Act). The State’s interest in preventing spurious corporate activities does not require that the State should, in practice, possess a veto on compositions. Rather, this can be satisfied through other means, e.g. through voting rights in conjunction with composition negotiations and through prohibitions on trading. In Denmark, where the right of priority for tax claims was abolished as early as the 1960s, the highest tax authority informed the Committee that only a couple of cases have arisen in which compositions were adopted against the wishes of the State.</p>
<p>The remaining nut to crack is thus the State’s interest in the State coffers being strengthened through dividends from bankruptcies. The Committee regards this argument as unconvincing, since all creditors can invoke the same reason, and the creditors in bankruptcies should not bear greater liability for the State’s finances than is borne by other taxpayers. In addition, the sums of money involved are small, in relation to the claims. If we disregard bankruptcies at the beginning of the 1990s, in which the State’s dividend at most reached SEK 685 million (1996), we note that the tax dividend in bankruptcies is normally SEK 200 million per year. The State’s revenues in 1997 amounted to SEK 945 billion. Thus, a normal dividend amounts to 0.02% of tax revenues.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Committee proposes that the right of priority for tax claims and public fees be abolished. As already emphasised, the State will be fully compensated as a consequence of the Committee’s other proposals (primarily, a halving of the basis for business mortgage) whereby the State will obtain an increased dividend (approximately 30%) where the State, after payment of wage guarantees, presents proof of the employees’ wage claims with a partial right of priority and whereby the dividend to creditors without right of priority (including tax claims) will increase to approximately 10%.</p>
<h2>Right of priority for wages and wage guarantee</h2>
<p>The Committee has been obliged, if possible, to improve wage protection in conjunction with bankruptcies and, at the same time, to save SEK 300 million per year in wage guarantees. This corresponds to approximately 50% of what was paid annually during the 1980s. In 1992, the maximum amount of SEK 5 billion was reached, after which payments have fallen to just over SEK 1 billion per year. At the same time, revenues amount to approximately SEK 1.5 billion per year in payroll fees and dividends in bankruptcies, most of which (SEK 1.2 - 1.5 billion) relate to payroll fees.</p>
<p>In addition, the Committee has been bound by an EC directive (80/987/EEC) which obliges Sweden to provide a wage guarantee for three months wages in the event of insolvency proceedings.</p>
<p>The Committee has regarded it as important that the employees who are normally socially dependent on earned wages and who, in a weak labour market, cannot snub certain employers and, naturally, cannot save their workpower for later delivery, should enjoy wage protection in the event of the insolvency of the employer. However, the Committee has chosen to limit the wage protection for earned wages such that the employees’claims contribute to the early initiation of insolvency treatment, before all liquid funds have been consumed, and in such a manner that abuse of the wage guarantee is counteracted. In addition, it has been regarded as important that the continuation of business during a suspension of payments or bankruptcy takes place subject to the same terms and conditions as apply to the debtor competitors, so that solvent enterprises are not driven out of business by insolvent ones. Finally, the Committee has chosen to counteract the preference by insolvent businesses for bankruptcy instead of business reorganisation, in order thereby to more easily obtain financing for continued operations (through the wage guarantee). The choice should, instead, be determined by other factors, such as the need to retain ongoing contracts, to be quit of the current owners and the current management, and to avoid belowcost sales, etc.</p>
<p>Concretely, the Committee proposes the following:</p>
<p>Wage guarantees should be capable of being utilised in conjunction with reorganisations pursuant to the Business Reorganisation Act. In order that this not result in increased costs in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy, the debtor in the business reorganisation must repay any wage guarantee payments provided or must provide security for the repayment before a business reorganisation order can be revoked. However, a composition may decrease the State’s claim for repayment of wages paid during the period following notice of dismissal. Where the business reorganisation is converted into a bankruptcy without any interruption, the business reorganisation and the bankruptcy should be viewed as a single unit and the wage guarantee payments provided in the business reorganisation are deducted from that which can be received in the bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Wages for a maximum period of three months prior to the petition for bankruptcy or business reorganisation will enjoy both rights of priority as well as wage guarantees. In terms of time, this means a certain limitation, since currently it is sufficient that the wage claim became due and payable not later than three months prior to the filing of the petition for bankruptcy (which means that the employees can wait up to four months before filing a petition to place the employer in bankruptcy but nonetheless benefit from the wage guarantees for all wages earned). However, certain provisions should be made for cases where the employer could not be served with process or where the wage claim was the subject of a dispute. Should an attempt at business reorganisation have preceded a bankruptcy, then the employee may choose, as today, to enjoy priority for wages during three months prior to the petition for business reorganisation if that is more advantageous than wages during three months prior to the petition for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the right of priority and wage guarantee for wages exist up until an order commencing the business reorganisation or bankruptcy plus an additional week. It should not matter whether the employee worked for the debtor in reorganisation or the bankruptcy estate during this brief transitional period.</p>
<p>The rights of priority for the wage claims dealt with above seldom have significance for the employee. In most cases, all assets are used up for creditors with superior rights of priority and, therefore, the wage guarantee is of central significance. However, the employee may have a level of wages which results in the ceiling of the wage guarantee being surpassed. In such cases, he can exercise his right of priority, where funds exist in the estate, however subject to a new limit of ten times the statutory base amount (approximately SEK 360,000). Otherwise, the right of priority serves the purpose of increasing the dividend to the State when it has paid out wage guarantees and is exercising its right of recourse. Among other things, the Committee’s financial restrictions have necessitated that the right of priority be maintained in this respect.</p>
<p>In the event work is performed on behalf of the debtor in reorganisation or the estate in bankruptcy later than one week after the commencement of the insolvency proceedings, the wage claim will not enjoy either a right of priority or a wage guarantee. Instead, the wage claim is paid in full by the business, which means that it is not affected by a composition and does not constitute a debt for the estate in bankruptcy. An analysis must be made of each employee’s efforts. Corresponding liability for the estate is proposed regarding rent for premises which are used by the estate, regardless of whether the estate has become a party to the agreement or not. This principle can probably be applied to other types of contracts.</p>
<p>Currently, the right of priority regulations in conjunction with reemployment pursuant to the Employment Protection Act need not be observed when an estate uses certain employees during the period following notice of dismissal. Since the proposed responsibility for the assets of the estate counteracts the unjust enrichment which would otherwise arise and its only purpose is to prevent an estate in bankruptcy from being able continue operations under conditions other than those of its competitors by utilising the wage guarantee, following the notice of dismissal, for employees with whom the estate has thus not entered into employment agreements, this new responsibility with the estate's assets should not lead to any new opinion regarding the applicability of the regulations governing the right of priority to re-employment.</p>
<p>Claims for wages following notice of dismissal are, from a right of priority perspective, not as important as the above-stated wage claims since for this period, the employee generally enjoys unemployment benefits in an amount of 80% of his salary, subject to a five day qualification period and a ceiling of approximately SEK 16,000 per month. Therefore, it is proposed that the right of priority for wages following notice of dismissal be abolished, whether termination takes place during a business reorganisation or bankruptcy. The Committee also discussed eliminating the wage guarantee for wages following notice of dismissal. However, such a solution would not be in accord with the terms of reference to improve wage protection, where possible, in conjunction with bankruptcies. It is, therefore, proposed that wages following notice of dismissal corresponding to those referred to in the Employment Protection Act should enjoy wage guarantees, whereupon the State would be permitted, however, to pursue a right of recourse without enjoying the right of priority and would thereby be subject to a composition with respect to the wages following notice of dismissal. The Committee estimates that this solution can be realised within the restrictions of State finances.</p>
<p>The right of priority for holiday wages remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Severance compensation should enjoy rights of priority and wage guarantees to the extent such rights would have existed had the employee instead received ordinary wages following notice of dismissal. It is uncertain whether this rule satisfies the requirements which are set forth in the International Labour Organisation’s 1992 convention, no. 173 regarding protection for employees’ claims in conjunction with the insolvency of the employer. Sweden should not, therefore, ratify the Convention now either.</p>
<p>The ceiling for the wage guarantee is increased from SEK 100,000 to four times the statutory base amount (currently approximately SEK 145, 000). The maximum period for the wage guarantee is extended to eight months.</p>
<h2>Business Mortgage</h2>
<p>Despite the fact that in the terms of reference, the Government only envisaged marginal changes in the rules concerning business mortgage, this was discussed freely by the Committee.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, business mortgages is a floating charge and provides security in the debtor’s assets subject to certain exceptions. Liquid funds, assets which can be pledged through registration, and financial instruments are not included. The security is created through registration which carries a one-time fee of 1% of the registration amount, followed by the surrender of a business mortgage certificate to the lender.</p>
<p>The justification for the existence of business mortgage is that the security is assumed to increase, and render access to credit cheaper. It is difficult to determine to what extent the business mortgage actually has this effect.</p>
<p>Statistics have been compiled in order to illustrate the extent to which business mortgages are taken out. It is apparent from these statistics that business mortgage are unusual for the smallest companies and newly-started companies and for service companies, while they are quite prevalent with smaller and mid-sized companies with an emphasis on manufacturing and trade, and are thereafter of less significance to large companies. It has not been possible to determine to what extent the business mortgage certificates actually are pledged as security. There is no appreciable difference related to the different sizes of municipalities.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Chapter 2, section 13 of the Banking Operations Act (SFS 1987:617), banks may lend money only where the borrower is believed to possess the ability to repay the loan. In addition, sufficient security must be provided unless special cause exists. The Committee interviewed bank representatives in Sweden, Denmark, and Finland.</p>
<p>The Swedish bank representatives stated that the business mortgage, despite the fact that the underlying property has a limited borrowing value, is of significance in conjunction with borrowing by some companies. It can be noted in this context that claims secured by business mortgage receive an average dividend of approximately 45% in bankruptcies. It has been claimed that the abolition of business mortgages would result in certain loans no longer being available and other types of security would be demanded to a greater extent.</p>
<p>In Denmark, there are no floating charges. Suppliers have greater possibilities than in Sweden to obtain an exclusion of stock in trade from the assets of the estate in bankruptcy, which may be resold prior to payment through what is known as a credit consignment. The Danish Finance Council (which corresponds to the Swedish Banking Association) has recently requested legislation creating floating charges in Denmark as well. In its petition to the Government, it was emphasised that the purpose is to obtain access to simple and inexpensive security, while it cannot be expected that the volume of credit will increase or that interest rates will be lowered. From our interviews, it was also apparent that the debtors were somewhat opposed providing other security which would decrease their ability to deal with their assets (creation of a charge over stock in trade) or which might give the debtor a bad reputation (factoring).</p>
<p>In Finland, a business can grant a floating charge by way of a business mortgage over 50% of its property. This percentage was selected in conjunction with the abolition of certain superior rights of priority (for wage and tax claims). Depending on the focus of the banks, they stated in our interview that the business mortgage was good supplemental security or, respectively, that the total abolition thereof would not make any difference. No complaints were relayed regarding the impossibility to use all of a debtors property as the basis for a floating charge.</p>
<p>In Norway, there is an equivalent to the Swedish business mortgage through three different registered charges, namely over personal property, stock in trade, and book debts (factoring charges). In 1993, a committee proposed (NOU 1993:16) that the registered charge over stock in trade and book debts be abolished; the borrowing value was deemed to be too low (25-50%). Instead, it was believed that the banks were combing enterprises for security which did not have any major significance for the decision to extend credit. The proposal will probably not lead to any amendment to the legislation (compare Ot Government Bill no. 26 1998-99).</p>
<p>The Committee has further noted that there is no corresponding instrument to the floating charge in many countries and that the banks in such countries must, in addition, accept that, in conjunction with a bankruptcy, stock in trade and receivables primarily go to suppliers according to the rules governing retention of title which are more generous than in Sweden. Thus, in Germany suppliers often have a better right than the banks to stock in trade and outstanding accounts receivable which arose in conjunction with sales of the goods through expanded retention of title clauses, while the banks have better rights than creditors without priority due to the fact that the banks obtain security with secondary priority in the debtors’current and future stock in trade and accounts receivable, without the debtor being deprived of the ability to deal with his property, and without the security being made public. In reality, this results in the banks acquiring the superior rights in a fraction of the value of what in Sweden constitutes the basis for the business mortgage.</p>
<p>The Committee has obtained legal-economic studies from Theodore Eisenberg (Cornell Law School, USA), Clas Bergström (the Stockholm School of Economies) and Stefan Sundgren (the School of Economics, Vasa, Finland) and Karin Thorburn (Dartmouth College, USA). The Committee has also studied other legal-economic literature, inter alia , regarding consideration of amendments to the U.S. insolvency legislation (Uniform Commercial Code, article 9, see no. 6 of 82, Cornell Law Review 1997).</p>
<p>In the Committee’s evaluation of the business mortgage, the Committee has assumed that the business mortgage does possess certain significance in lending. When the risks are deemed to be too great, they cannot be compensated with interest where the business only has a normal level of profitability. However, lending to businesses in Sweden is the most profitable investment for Swedish banks, and somewhere the deposits must receive interest. A transition to other forms of security is not simple, since fixed assets are already financed through instalment payment purchases and leasing, and since a charge over stock in trade and accounts receivable requires that the business give up its ability to deal with the assets (compare the Danish views). Considering the prevailing foreign conditions, the Committee assumed that a limitation on the underlying property in a business mortgage would not materially diminish the availability of credit to enterprises. In addition, it has been assumed that a limitation would lead to loans increasingly being directed to businesses with the best profitability prospects, rather than to those which can offer the best security.</p>
<p>The Committee has also asked the question whether it is reasonable that the strongest lenders, i.e. those which, through alternative investment possibilities, possess the best negotiating position, are to be given the possibility to always mortgage almost all of the debtors assets, whether the security was necessary for the loan or not. The tax creditor (the State) and tort creditors can not negotiate regarding credit, albeit the State has, to a certain extent, assumed personal payment liability. Employees must, to a great extent, accept the work which is offered (otherwise they cannot receive unemployment benefits) and they cannot periodically ration their labour in order to work even more later on. In addition, the provision of credit which takes place from suppliers of goods with limited marketability is often only apparently voluntary, if the supplier is to be rid of the goods in time. In order to prevent this transfer of the credit risk to persons who involuntarily provide their credit or, in any event, occupy an inferior negotiating position, one could consider providing the State and employees with rights of priority superior to floating charges and introducing more generous regulations regarding retention of title. Thus, the current situation is not a given one. However, the Committee believes that the right of priority regulations should be streamlined rather than being made more complicated. The introduction of retention of title provisions which are valid in rem  with respect to goods which the purchaser has a right of disposition prior to payment to the seller would result in a situation where neither the party with the floating charge nor the seller would be able to rely on the fact that the stock in trade is available for recourse as security in the event of an bankruptcy.</p>
<p>When a company becomes insolvent, the business mortgage has largely negative effects.</p>
<p>The existence of security may result in the secured party not taking action before the security is threatened, and by then the company is often in such bad shape that a successful reorganisation is impossible. Even if certain reorganisation actions have a positive current value (the chance that they will become profitable exceeds the risk of loss), security holders tend to oppose such proposals since, in the event of success, they can only obtain a limited portion of the profits (the difference between the current value of the security and the claim) while, in the event of poor results, he can lose even more (the entire value of the security). If the security only applies to certain types of assets, the picture becomes even more complicated. The best situation would be if all creditors were in the same boat when a reorganisation is discussed.</p>
<p>Series bankruptcies, which are based on the owner of a limited liability company being able to purchase the company’s assets after having rolled the loan over to a new company so that his guarantee need not be utilised, presuppose that the party which provided the loan to the company in bankruptcy receives the entire purchase price (corresponding to the loan) as a dividend in the bankruptcy by means of a business mortgage. This phenomenon, which in various contexts has troubled the legislature, would cease to exist if the business mortgage were abolished or significantly restricted.</p>
<p>The above-stated considerations have resulted in some members of the Committee wishing to abolish the business mortgage entirely, while others have expressed doubt regarding a limitation on the business mortgage, citing the provision of credit to smaller and medium-sized companies, most of which never become insolvent nor the subject of reorganisation proceedings. However, the Committee has also taken into consideration the fact that a restriction on the underlying property of a business mortgage is necessary if the right of priority of tax claims is also to be abolished, as well as the right of priority of wage claims for wages following notice of dismissal, at the same time as the wage protection for employees is improved and the prescribed savings are carried out in the State budget. Certain persons have conditioned their continued acceptance of the current rules regarding retention of title provisions, which are disadvantageous to suppliers, on a limitation of the business mortgage. In conclusion, the Committee has united on a proposal that the business mortgage, as in Finland, may only encumber 50% of the debtor’s property . _______________</p>
<p>As a consequence of the above, the Committee presents certain proposals designed to strengthen the remaining business mortgage so that the actual change does not result in a halving of the borrowing value. The idea is that, within the framework of 50%, the business mortgage will be as reliable a form of security as possible.</p>
<p>In this context, the most important proposal is to reconstitute the business mortgage into a general right of priority in all of the property of the business. It will thereby not matter whether the accounts receivable of the business are converted into liquid funds immediately prior to a bankruptcy. Upon a recalculation of the dividend in all bankruptcies as they appear today, this would only result in a marginal improvement (2-3%) while the reliability should be significantly more valuable in conjunction with the extension of credit. In addition, the abolition of the right of priority for rent claims is designed to strengthen the remaining business mortgage.</p>
<p>Today a business mortgage creditor can expect, on average, a dividend of 45%. As a result of proposed reform he may expect to receive 22,5% plus increases related to the extended basis of the business mortgage, the abolishment of priority for rent claims, and the improved dividends to unsecured creditors, altogether approximately 30%. Furthermore, he needs not to worry about a risk that significant stock in trade or receivalles in his specific case will fall outside the security because they were converted to liquid funds immediately prior to insolvency proceedings.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the new regulations regarding business mortgage enter into force following a transition period of 1.5 years during which holders of business mortgage will have the possibility of terminating the credit and, where necessary, carrying out an bankruptcy according to the current rules. cle to reorganisation and oppose the emphasis on the competition-distorting effects of the wage guarantee. They do not wish the wage guarantee to be used in business reorganisations outside bankruptcy and do not accept that wages from the wage guarantee during the business reorganisation may be deducted if the reorganisation is converted into an bankruptcy. They wish to retain the link between the right of priority and wage guarantee. They believe that the proposals do not provide sufficient levels of wage protection, either with regard to times, ceilings, saved holidays, etc. In addition, they believe that the liability of the estate in bankruptcy for wages when certain employees are used during the period following notice of dismissal should result in the re-employment priority regulations in the Employment Protection Act being applicable. They propose that wages earned prior to the bankruptcy and two months’wages following notice of dismissal should be subject to the wage guarantee, even if the employee works for the estate during the period following notice of dismissal and, in addition, these wage claims should have priority over business mortgage. However, the restriction on the business mortgage to 50% of the current basis is accepted.</p>
<h2>Subordinated claims</h2>
<p>Among the Committee’s other proposals, it may be noted that fines, conditional fines, and claims as a consequence of forfeiture, or other legal effects due to crimes shall once again be subordinated by law.</p>
<h2>Ongoing agreements, etc.</h2>
<p>The Committee has been charged with considering the implementation of regulations according to which a debtor in a business reorganisation will be able to prematurely terminate onerous, long-term agreements. The purpose is, naturally, to facilitate a business reorganisation.</p>
<p>This task raises the question of whether it is reasonable that creditors who have entered into advantageous, long-term agreements are to contribute to a reorganisation to a greater extent than other creditors who have entered into advantageous agreements, but who can file a claim for their entire loss upon breach.</p>
<p>The Committee believes that, in this context, it is also appropriate to consider the right which a debtor possesses pursuant to Chapter 2, section 20 of the Business Reorganisation Act to demand future performance without having to pay for performance received prior to the commencement of the reorganisation proceedings. If this rule is retained, the question arises as to whether the rule should not also be applicable in conjunction with bankruptcies.</p>
<p>A closely related question is whether a creditor should be permitted to set off a claim due to him which is based on performance which was made prior to the commencement of the insolvency proceedings and which is, therefore, without a right of priority against a claim for payment which is based on performance which the debtor in reorganisation or the estate in bankruptcy made during the insolvency proceedings (such a right of set off is currently deemed to exist regardless of whether the claims arose out of the same contractual relationship; NJA 1916, p. 154 and 1996, p. 368).</p>
<p>The Committee will deal with these issues in a final report which it is anticipated will be published in December 1999.</p>
