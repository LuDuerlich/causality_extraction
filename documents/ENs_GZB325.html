<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Commission’s remit has been to consider how Swedish law enforcement agencies, i.e. the police, the Swedish Prosecution Authority, Swedish Coast Guard and Swedish Customs, should be enabled to receive a greater degree of help from agencies in the EU and the Nordic region, including operations that may involve the exercise of public authority in relation to individuals. It has also been part of the Commission’s mandate to consider the issues that arise when Swedish officials correspondingly participate in operations abroad.</p>
<p>There has long been police cooperation within the EU and the Nordic region. This cooperation is pursued primarily through exchange of information, but also via more direct forms of assistance, e.g. in connection with criminal investigations. But active operational cooperation of the kind covered by this Commission’s terms of reference has, so far, been less developed. Schengen cooperation, however, offers the possibility of law enforcement cross-border  observation  and cross-border  pursuit . This means that officials from one Member State are permitted to continue ongoing observation of a suspected offender or the ongoing pursuit of a wanted person into the territory of another Member State. Operational cooperation between Swedish and Danish police is also permitted under special regulations on police cooperation in the Öresund region . These regulations mean that Danish police officers have the same powers as Swedish officers to intervene against threats to public order and safety on the Öresund Link, the bridge-tunnel complex connecting Copenhagen in Denmark and Malmö in Sweden.</p>
<p>Apart from these forms of cooperation, in principle there is currently no possibility for foreign law enforcement officials to take part in police operational activities in Sweden, that involve the exercise of public authority in relation to individuals.</p>
<p>In accordance with its terms of reference, the Commission bases its considerations on the cross-border police cooperation made possible by the 2008 EU Council decision on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime (the ‘Prüm Decision’), and by the Council decision of the same year on the improvement of cooperation between the special intervention units of the Member States of the European Union in crisis situations (the ‘Atlas Network Decision’).</p>
<p>The Commission has also taken into consideration a draft agreement on joint service between Nordic police officers, drafted by a working group appointed by the Nordic Committee of Senior Officials for Legislative Issues and currently being processed at the Government Offices.</p>
<p>When the Commission’s terms of reference were decided in April 2009, the Prüm Decision only included the EU Member States. Iceland and Norway have subsequently also acceded to the decision. The fact that all the Nordic countries are now part of the Prüm cooperation raises the question of the need for joint service between Nordic police officers . In the Commission’s view, this form of cooperation, as defined in the current draft agreement, does not provide for broader cooperation than the Prüm Decision. The Commission, therefore, notes that there is little reason to pursue this project in its current form. However, with the primary aim of providing the broadest possible basis for consideration, the Commisson has, nonetheless, chosen to base its considerations and proposals on the assumption that the Nordic draft agreement would result in a future agreement with broadly the same content as the current draft. It is therefore described throughout the report as the ‘Nordic Cooperation Agreement’.</p>
<h2>The need for cooperation</h2>
<p>First of all, the Commission assessed the law enforcement agencies’ needs for support from equivalent foreign agencies in operations that may involve the exercise of public authority in relation to individuals. The assessment shows that the police have some need for this kind of support. The need for support can be divided into occasional collaborative operations and more ongoing cooperation.</p>
<p>Occasional operations  could mean reinforcements to basic police capabilities in the form of increased numbers or durability for a major event, e.g. public assemblies, public events and other major incidents. It could also mean support in the form of specialist expertise (e.g. bomb disposal technicians and helicopter pilots) or equipment (e.g. vehicles and protective equipment). Furthermore, it could mean special operations of the kind handled in Sweden by the Swedish Police Counter Terrorist Unit. Depending on the situation, the Counter Terrorist Unit may need support to reinforce its capacity. Such support could be in the form of increased numbers, durability, expertise or equipment.</p>
<p>Ongoing cooperation  refers to collaboration of a more continuous nature, over a longer period of time and often covering a larger geographical area. It could involve joint patrols along Sweden’s borders with Denmark, Finland or Norway, for example.</p>
<p>However, other law enforcement agencies, i.e. the Swedish Prosecution Authority, the Swedish Coast Guard and Swedish Customs, have, as far as the Commission has found, no need for new forms of support covered by the Commission’s remit.</p>
<h2>Points of departure</h2>
<p>Internationalisation and the decreasing importance of geographical national borders in people’s lives have opened the door to crossborder crime that increasingly requires international cooperation on both crime prevention and law enforcement. Broader international operational police cooperation provides scope to prevent and fight crime more effectively than is possible at present. Deeper cooperation also means that the police have the opportunity to perform their duties more cost-effectively. Instead of designing their activities so that the police can deal with every conceivable situation, which inevitably requires a certain level of overcapacity, Swedish police and foreign law enforcement agencies can further rationalise their activities through joint use of resources. One point of departure for the Commission´s considerations has been that the same standards of legal security for the individual and quality in police work must apply to duties carried out in the framework of international police cooperation, as if the duties were carried out nationally. From the point of view of both individuals and participating agencies, it is also important that the regulations governing cooperation are clear, well-defined and easy to apply.</p>
<h2>New forms of cooperation</h2>
<p>The Commission proposes in its report the introduction of four new forms of cooperation: 1. Joint patrols  or similar operations, whereby foreign law enforcement officials participate in operations on the territory of another state, with the aim of maintaining public order and security and preventing crime ( joint operations ). Joint operations may be undertaken with other EU Member States, Iceland and Norway. 2. Assistance in connection with mass assemblies  and similar major events, disasters and serious accidents, with the aim of maintaining public order and security and preventing crime ( assistance under the Prüm Decision ). Assistance may be requested from other EU Member States, Iceland and Norway. 3. Assistance from a special intervention unit  to deal with a situation believed to involve a crime that presents a serious direct physical threat to persons, property, infrastructure or institutions ( assistance under the Atlas Network Decision ). Assistance may be requested from other EU Member States. 4. Joint service between Nordic police officers  with the aim of maintaining public order and security and preventing crime ( Nordic Joint Service ).</p>
<p>As indicated, these four forms of cooperation have one thing in common: they all aim to maintain public order and security and prevent crime. These forms of cooperation do not, therefore, include formal investigations of offences; they are in this respect merely a complement to the forms of criminal law cooperation already available within the EU.</p>
<h2>Regulations</h2>
<p>Under the proposal, a request for support from a foreign law enforcement agency must be made by the Government  or, by a decision of delegation of the Government, the National Police Board . A local police authority will not have this option, therefore. The reason for this level of authority is that the question of operations involving foreign law enforcement officials on Swedish territory is a matter of such importance, that the decision should be taken only at the highest level. Moreover, the National Police Board already has a number of responsibilities and powers, involving area of international police work. The Board also has the necessary overview of national police resources and can ensure consistency in considering the issues.</p>
<p>For every collaborative operation, the Government or, where appropriate, the National Police Board is to conclude a separate agreement  with the responsible agency in the other state. The agreement should outline the operation and set limits in terms of duration and geographical scope. Necessary practical issues can also be regulated in the agreement.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, only foreign officials working at law enforcement agencies may participate in operations in Sweden. For operations under the Prüm Decision and the Atlas Network Decision, police officers, other officials with police powers and officials with a special function and expertise , for example bomb-disposal technicians and helicopter pilots, may participate. For Nordic Joint Service, only police officers may participate, in accordance with the provisions of the Nordic Cooperation Agreement.</p>
<p>Foreign officials may not act independently in Sweden; they must always be under Swedish police command . However, there is nothing to prevent foreign officials being accompanied by their own superior officers exercising internal command over their officials. Nonetheless, a condition of the participation of foreign officials is that they are integrated into the command structure in Sweden and are placed under over all Swedish police command and leadership.</p>
<p>When foreign police officers or other officials with police powers take part in operations in Sweden they can, like Swedish police officers, be faced with situations where they have to use force or coercion to carry out their duties. In order for a collaborative operation to work in practice, it is virtually a requirement that, in such situations, participating foreign officials have the same powers as</p>
<p>Swedish police officers have under the Police Act . Otherwise, there is a risk that the supposed support becomes a burden instead, that safety cannot be maintained and that operational effectiveness is therefore compromised. The Commission, therefore, proposes that these officials have the same powers of initial intervention as Swedish police officers have under the Police Act. Limiting these powers to the initial stage means that they are intended to be exercised for a preliminary limited period of time, until Swedish police officers gain full control of the situation.</p>
<p>Unlike police officers and other officials with police powers, other officials who may participate in operations in Sweden, i.e. officials with a special function and expertise are not normally exposed to situations where it is necessary to use force or coercion. Instead, they play a supporting role in police work. Their powers are therefore limited to the applicable provisions of Chapter 24, Section 7, second paragraph of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure, i.e. the right of any citizen to intervene and use force under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>In brief, other proposals contain the following:</p>
<p>• Foreign officials will normally be allowed to carry service arms and other necessary equipment. However, the Government or, by decision of the Government, the National Police Board may prohibit the use of certain weapons or other equipment.</p>
<p>• To facilitate the handling and  cross-border transfers of weapons and other equipment, foreign officials will be exempted from certain permit requirements under the Military Equipment Act, the Firearms Act, the Flammable and Explosive Products Act and the Ordinance concerning permits for the import of certain dangerous objects.</p>
<p>• The same traffic regulations that apply to Swedish police officers will apply to foreign officials.</p>
<p>• Foreign officials will be entirely equal to Swedish police officers in terms of criminal liability and protection.</p>
<p>• The Swedish state will pay compensation for any damage caused by foreign officials involved in operations in Sweden. The amount of such compensation will be the same as if the damage had been caused by a Swedish police officer.</p>
<p>• The foreign official’s employer and the Swedish police authority leading the operation will both be responsible for the working environment. The division of responsibilities between them will be equivalent to that between employers that provide temporary workers and those that employ temporary workers under the Work Environment Act.</p>
<h2>Involvement of Swedish officials in operations in other states</h2>
<p>In the same way that foreign officials may be involved in operations in Sweden under the Prüm Decision, the Atlas Network Decision and the Nordic Cooperation Agreement, Swedish law enforcement officials may be involved in such operations abroad. In such cases, the Swedish officials’ powers will be governed by the national regulations of the receiving state. In view of this, no Swedish legal regulation of Swedish officials’ powers to exercise authority in other states is required . However, the Commission offers proposals on other issues that may arise in connection with operations abroad. In summary, they contain the following:</p>
<p>• Swedish courts shall have unrestricted jurisdiction to examine the case of any offence committed by a Swedish police officer, customs officer or coastguard carrying out duties in another state.</p>
<p>• Compensation for damage caused by Swedish officials involved in operations abroad will be paid by the receiving state. The Swedish state will therefore not pay compensation for such damage.</p>
<p>• It may be assumed that Swedish working environment requirements largely correspond to those in receiving states. There is therefore no reason to make the Swedish working environment regulations applicable for operations abroad.</p>
<p>• Swedish police authorities will be able to take firearms and associated spare parts and ammunition out of Sweden without a permit under the Military Equipment Act, as long as the weapon will be brought back.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>The proposals mean that, through cooperation with foreign law enforcement agencies, the police will be able to perform its duties more effectively, entailing certain cost-saving measures. It is also expected that the proposals will lead to more effecient crime prevention and law enforcement, which should result in reduced crime rates and, consequently, an overall reduction in costs to society.</p>
<h2>Adoption of a Bill by the Riksdag and entry into force</h2>
<p>The delegation of powers that may be assigned to foreign officials under the Commission´s proposals entail that certain Swedish administrative duties be formally transferred to another state. The Commission proposes that the Riksdag, pursuant to the Constitution (Chapter 10, Section 8 of the Instrument of Government), shall entrust the Government or, by decision of delegation of the Government, the National Police Board with taking decisions on such transfers on a case by case basis. The adoption of these legislative measures requires the application of special qualified voting rules in the Riksdag under the Constitution. Provided that the Riksdag takes a decision under these rules, it is expected that all the relevant legislative amendments could enter into force on 1 July 2012.</p>
