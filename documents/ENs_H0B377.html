<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Committee’s remit</h2>
<p>The present part of the Police Organisation Committee’s remit involves analysing the consequences of a possible reorganisation of the Swedish Security Service into an independent police authority within the police service and presenting the proposals that such a reorganisation would require (additional terms of reference to the Police Organisation Committee, ToR 2012:13).</p>
<p>The remit should be seen in the context of the proposals the Committee presented in its report SOU 2012:13, which called for the reorganisation of the National Police Board, the 21 police authorities and the National Laboratory of Forensic Science into a single unified authority and the reorganisation of the Swedish Security Service into a separate authority independent of the rest of the police service.</p>
<p>In the additional terms of reference, the Government has indicated that separating the Security Service from the rest of the police service would have a number of consequences. The main issue concerns the form of management the independent Security Service should have, and associated issues. Moreover, questions arise concerning cooperation between the Security Service and the National Criminal Police, as well as cooperation with the county police authorities. A further consequence to which the additional terms of reference draw attention concerns the relationship between the Security Service and the police staff disciplinary board.</p>
<h2>Organisation and management structure of the Security Service</h2>
<p>At present, the National Police Board is the central administrative authority for the police services, over which it exercises supervision. The National Police Board is led by the National Police Commissioner. The Security Service is a part of the National Police Board but not formally a separate authority, even though it operates as such in practice.</p>
<p>The Security Service is led by a Head of the Swedish Security Service. The Head of the Swedish Security Service takes both operational and administrative decisions, both of a policy nature and in current business. However, matters that come under the ambit of the Swedish Security Service but have substantial consequences for other parts of the police service may be subject to decision by the National Police Commissioner. The National Police Commissioner may also make decisions in other matters if there are special grounds for this.</p>
<p>The Government governs the activities of the Security Service by a range of instruments, including statutes, appropriation directions with guidelines for the direction of activities, and special decisions. However, the fact that the Security Service is a part of the National Police Board has no influence on the form or content of the governance that the Government now exercises. The Security Service currently has independent status, with its own Director-General, its own appropriation, its own appropriation directions specifying the objectives of its activities, and its own ordinance containing instructions to the Security Service.</p>
<h2>The responsibilities and operations of the Security Service</h2>
<p>The core operations of the Security Service are to protect national security and the Swedish polity against criminal attacks. The main emphasis of its responsibilities is on preventing crime, whereas criminal investigation comprises only a small proportion of its activities. Unlike other police operations, items of business handled by the Security Service derive only in exceptional cases from reports of crimes.</p>
<p>The Security Service conducts extensive security intelligence to produce assessments of threats and vulnerabilities. These assessments provide a basis for deciding on measures the Security Service will take in its preventive work. The assessments also provide a basis for decisions on dignitary protection or other protective security measures.</p>
<p>Security intelligence assumes a well-developed and functioning exchange of information with security services in other countries. Effective information-gathering methods are also required. In addition, the Security Service’s methods and know-how must not be revealed to outsiders.</p>
<p>The focus of the Security Service is not on prosecution but on obtaining decision-making data for measures to reduce threats and vulnerabilities, and on taking such measures. International cooperation is an essential element of this work.</p>
<p>Given the responsibilities of the Security Service, its focus and methods differ markedly from those of the regular police service.</p>
<h2>Partnership and cooperation with other actors</h2>
<p>For the Security Service to be able to fulfil its main responsibilities, the organisation has a great need of cooperation and partnership with the defence intelligence agencies. Much of this cooperation concerns exchanges of information and experience to improve assessments. One example of more formal cooperation is the National Centre for Terrorist Threat Assessment, where these agencies and authorities together produce strategic assessments of the threat posed by terrorism.</p>
<p>Another cross-agency cooperative forum in which the Security Service participates is the Counter-Terrorism Cooperative Council. The Council is a forum for partnership and knowledge exchange and brings together 14 agencies that have various roles before, during and after a terrorist attack.</p>
<p>The Security Service also participates in the national mobilisation scheme against serious organised crime. The purpose of this scheme is to make effective use of expertise from different agencies and authorities to hamper criminal networks. The National Criminal Police is responsible for national coordination in combating serious organised crime, while the Security Service has the main national responsibility for preventing serious organised crime from having an unlawful impact on important public services.</p>
<p>With regard to preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the Security Service works with the Swedish Customs, the Swedish Agency for Non-Proliferation and Export Controls, the Swedish Defence Research Agency, the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority and the Swedish Armed Forces.</p>
<p>Access to foreign intelligence is vital to the ability of the Security Service to conduct its activities. Internationally, the Security Service cooperates primarily with security and intelligence services in Nordic and European countries. The Security Service is also dependent on regular collaboration with security and intelligence services in other parts of the world. In addition, it participates in various multinational organisations.</p>
<p>The Security Service and the regular police service collaborate and cooperate to a varying degree, depending on points of contact between the operational branches concerned. This cooperation is based on relations and contacts that are built up over the long term. It is described in greater detail in section 4.6.</p>
<h2>Why should the Security Service be reorganised as an independent authority within the police service?</h2>
<p>The background to the need to reconsider the organisation of the Security Service is that the Committee has presented a proposal for a reorganisation of the regular police service that will make it impossible to retain the Security Service as part of the National Police Board. The Committee has not perceived its task to involve suggesting any changes in the responsibilities of the Security Service. What is involved here is rather the organisational structure within which the Security Service should operate in future.</p>
<p>The Committee starts out from the proposal in SOU 2012:13 that the Security Service should be reorganised as an independent police authority. This proposal was based purely on administrative considerations. In this report, the Committee elaborates on the administrative reasons for reorganising the Security Service and then goes on to examine whether the most appropriate solution from an operational perspective is to make the Security Service an independent authority within the police services.</p>
<p>As in its previous report, the Committee has chosen to be guided by a principle of prudence. One of the implications of this principle is that when operations are working well, they should not be changed more than is absolutely essential for their continued development. Further, if changes do need to be made, each change should be examined on the basis of a well-defined picture of the problems to be addressed.</p>
<p>Administrative considerations</p>
<p>The Security Service already has an independent status relative to the National Police Board. In certain respects, the Government governs the Security Service as if it were a body completely detached from the rest of the police service. This manifests itself in various ways: the Government lays down rules for the work of the Security Service in separate instructions, and it appoints and employs the Head and Deputy Head of the Swedish Security Service. Moreover, the Security Service has its own appropriation and appropriation directions.</p>
<p>A reorganisation of the Security Service as an independent authority would not entail any real change, in practice, in the way in which the Government governs operations under the ambit of the Security Service. The reorganisation also ensures a wellbalanced division of power within the new police organisation.</p>
<p>Making the Security Service an independent authority will clarify the division of responsibilities. The operations of the Security Service will be placed formally directly under the Government. The Head of the Swedish Security Service will be more clearly accountable for its operations and management and responsibility issues will be clarified. The National Police Commissioner will no longer have the power to decide in matters that can be classified as within the ambit of the Security Service. This will mean a clearer decisionmaking mandate for the Head of the Swedish Security Service but will also require certain mechanisms for division of responsibilities in situations where regular police operations coincide with the work of the Security Service.</p>
<p>If the Security Service is reorganised as an independent authority within the police services, it will naturally be necessary to clarify the regulatory framework that applies in its area. A clearer regulatory framework will provide better conditions for internal management. Furthermore, an independent authority can take its own decisions on the regulations and general advice that apply to its operations.</p>
<p>A reorganisation of the Security Service will also make it clearer to the general public that the responsibilities and operations of the Security Service have a different focus than those of other police services.</p>
<p>Operational considerations</p>
<p>Because of its responsibilities and main areas of activity as national security service, the Security Service occupies a unique position in the police service. Many parts of its operations have few points of contact with other police operations. This applies, for example, to its work in the areas of counter-espionage, protective security and preventing the proliferation, acquisition and production of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>Turning to the focus and purpose of national intelligence operations, the points of contact between the Security Service and the regular police service are too limited for these operations to benefit from incorporating the Security Service in the new Police Authority. The intelligence gathered in many parts of Security Service operations rarely focuses on the types of crime that the regular police service works on. The Security Service also obtains information from other channels.</p>
<p>The fact that the Security Service will continue to operate separately from the rest of the police service will safeguard international security intelligence activities. Incorporating the Security Service in the Police Authority, and thereby strengthening the link to the regular police service, would obviously risk undermining the confidence that the Security Service has built up with other countries’ securityand intelligence services. This is undesirable bearing in mind the key role of intelligence in the Security Service’s operations and its ability to perform its task of protecting national security.</p>
<p>The Committee has also made the assessment that the Security Service and the regular police service do not have to belong together in organisational terms in order to enjoy a well-developed partnership. See sections 6.4.1 and 6.4.4.</p>
<h2>Reorganisation of the Security Service as an independent authority</h2>
<p>Organisational framework</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the Security Service itself should decide on its organisation. Given the nature of its operations, the Security Service must be able to adapt to changes in crime trends and security policy over time. The authority requires flexible management to respond effectively to such changes. The Government can also demand clearer accountability of the management if the authority is allowed to decide on its own organisation.</p>
<p>Form of management of the new authority</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the Security Service be an authority without a board, governed by a head of authority directly answerable to the Government. This proposal is motivated by the special nature of the operations, the need for rapid adaptability to external changes and the Government’s need to govern the Security Service with clarity. Management of the Security Service will be vested in a head of authority.</p>
<p>Advisory council</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the Security Service should have an advisory council. This council should be able to observe all the operations conducted by the Security Service. The members of the advisory council should be nominated by all parties represented in the Riksdag. However, given the special features of the Security Service, it is appropriate to ensure that the group of persons with access to its operations does not grow too broad. Advisory council members should also be subject to security clearance.</p>
<p>The work of the Security Service includes operations of a sensitive nature for personal integrity, where transparency to citizens and democratic influence are important. An advisory council can provide knowledge, breadth and diversity to support the authority’s management.</p>
<p>Appointments</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the head of the Security Service be given the title of Head of the Swedish Security Service. This title is already well established. Further, the Committee proposes that the Head of the Swedish Security Service personally should appoint her or his colleagues at management level. This proposal is in line with the rules laid down in the Government Agencies Ordinance and general administrative policy considerations.</p>
<p>Staff mobility</p>
<p>Staff must continue to have good opportunities to move between the Security Service and the regular police service. The Committee proposes that the Government prescribe in an ordinance that staff will be permitted a leave of absence from the Police Authority without a special decision being required, in order to hold a temporary position in the Security Service.</p>
<p>Opportunities to work in the other organisation, and the associated improved career opportunities, are of great importance to employees and employers. It is an advantage to the Security Service that there are good prospects of recruiting staff who have a police background. This applies to all staff, but especially close protection officers and surveillance officers.</p>
<p>Right to transfer staff</p>
<p>Reorganising the Security Service as an independent authority will not affect the need to be able to transfer an employee to another position in certain exceptional situations and for operational purposes. Consequently, after the organisational changes, when an obligation to transfer arises – and a new position in the regular police service is concerned – the new Police Authority will be the authority that decides on such positions.</p>
<p>Processing of cases involving offences committed by Security Service employees</p>
<p>Cases involving offences committed by Security Service employees are to be processed at the Police Authority’s special investigations division. The Committee proposes that this be stated in the instructions to the Security Service. The reason for this arrangement is that the ordinance regulating these cases has police employees in view, i.e. employees of both the Police Authority and the Security Service. In its previous report, the Committee proposed that cases involving offences committed by police employees should be processed at the Police Authority’s special investigations division.</p>
<p>Staff disciplinary board</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the Security Service should have a staff disciplinary board. This proposal follows the general rule that staff disciplinary issues should be examined by the agency or authority employing the staff member concerned. Moreover, the Security Service having a staff disciplinary board of its own is the arrangement that will best suit the purpose. The relatively large number of employees is another argument in favour of the authority having its own disciplinary board.</p>
<p>Partnership and cooperation</p>
<p>The Committee’s assessment is that if the Security Service is reorganised as an independent authority within the police service, this will have no effect, in practice, on the possibility of partnership and cooperation with the regular police service. The Security Service must continue to have a good partnership and efficient cooperation with the regular police service and other national agencies and authorities. In addition, there must be effective collaboration with other countries, foreign authorities and international organisations. The Committee proposes that it be specified in the Security Service's instructions that the Security Service is to continue to work in partnership with these actors.</p>
<p>In certain special situations, however, mechanisms will be needed to decide on the division of responsibilities between the</p>
<p>Security Service and the Police Authority. The Security Service and the Police Authority jointly must make a clear agreement regarding division of responsibilities in the event of a special situation of this kind arising.</p>
<p>A reorganisation of the Security Service as an independent authority will not require any changes in current secrecy provisions to allow an efficient exchange of information between the authorities.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the Committee’s proposals</h2>
<p>Consequences from a citizen perspective</p>
<p>The proposed advisory council will strengthen democratic transparency and control in Security Service operations. Confidence between the authority and citizens will be enhanced by clarifying issues of responsibility, ensuring good conditions for democratic transparency and providing unchanged opportunities for the public to contact the Security Service.</p>
<p>Consequences from a judicial chain perspective</p>
<p>After reorganisation as an independent authority, the Security Service will continue to be in a good position to contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of the judicial chain and to work in partnership with authorities in the justice system.</p>
<p>Consequences for operations</p>
<p>One consequence of the proposal that the Security Service decide on its own organisation is that this will give the authority’s management, and ultimately the Head of the Swedish Security Service, organisational flexibility for conducting operations. The Government will also be able to demand clearer accountability of the management if the authority is allowed to make its own decisions on its organisation. The Committee’s proposals enable the authority’s management, and ultimately the Head of the Swedish Security Service, to take comprehensive responsibility for the operations of the</p>
<p>Security Service and the results achieved. This will create better conditions for strategic management and governance.</p>
<p>The Security Service is to cooperate with the Police Authority where this is necessary for operations. The Security Service must also seek good arrangements for working in partnership with the new national operations division. It is essential that both police authorities together identify areas where there is potential for developing partnership and cooperation. In the Committee’s opinion, reorganising the Security Service as an independent authority will not affect the ability of the Security Service to maintain its good cooperation with other government agencies and internationally.</p>
<p>Secrecy and discretion will continue to be needed for certain parts of Security Service operations and certain employees. How the Security Service handles issues of discretion should not be regulated by law or other statutes; it is more appropriate for the authority to make its own rules on this, either on its own or in agreement with another authority.</p>
<p>In connection with the reorganisation, the Security Service will initially need certain resources to take stock of and produce the regulations required to conduct operations as an independent authority. However, in the longer term, this work will lead to greater clarity and more suitable provisions for operations.</p>
<p>A reorganisation of the Security Service presupposes that it acquire certain skills and functions, such as specialist staff with expertise in labour law, human resources and procurement.</p>
<p>Consequences in the areas of employer responsibility and staff policy</p>
<p>It is important that the Security Service continues to plan well ahead and maintains an ongoing dialogue with the Police Authority when staff need to be recruited.</p>
<p>Consequences for staff</p>
<p>Separating the Security Service from the rest of the police service will clarify that the Security service is the employer of the staff.</p>
<p>The reorganisation will have no impact on the existing obligation of Security Service staff to serve in accordance with orders, nor will the organisational considerations affect the obligation of police officers in the Security Service to intervene when off duty.</p>
<p>Consequences for the Government Offices</p>
<p>The proposal to reorganise the Security Service may lead to a certain amount of extra work for the Government Offices (the Ministry of Justice). This work will derive from the reorganisation itself and will end once the new authority has been established. There will be no change in financial governance, as the Security Service already has its own appropriation.</p>
<p>Financial impact</p>
<p>The Committee’s proposal to reorganise the Security Service will have financial consequences. These concern, firstly, that the Government should reallocate current appropriations that now accrue to other police services and, secondly, financial consequences directly attributable to the reorganisation itself. The Committee estimates that the one-off costs of reorganisation will come to approximately SEK 10 000 000.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>The Committee proposes that the Security Service should lead the work of preparing and implementing the reorganisation. This work should not be incorporated in the implementing organisation proposed by the Committee to prepare the creation of the new Police Authority. However, it is important that the Security Service establishes good contacts with the implementing organisation for the Police Authority.</p>
<p>The reorganisation of the Security Service should be coordinated in time with the transition of the regular police service to a new structure.</p>
