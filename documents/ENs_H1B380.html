<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Inquiry has been instructed to present proposals under which information reported by businesses to government authorities would, as a rule, only need to be submitted once, to one place. This concerns information that is required to be reported under an act, ordinance or authority regulation. The remit of the Inquiry includes presenting the legal and technical conditions for creating a system which allows information to be used by several authorities and leads to information exchange between the authorities. The report of the Swedish Companies Registration Office, Proposal on reduced reporting by businesses (AD  62-1047/2008), on how reporting by businesses to government authorities could be reduced is to serve as a basis for the work of the Inquiry.</p>
<p>On 4 March 2013, the Inquiry submitted an interim report including a preliminary proposal on how some information that is submitted by businesses to government authorities should, as a rule, only need to be submitted once, and to one place, an account of how the coordination of the continuing efforts to reduce and simplify reporting by businesses can be organised, etc., and an account of the costs of implementing the preliminary proposals.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s initial considerations</p>
<p>A key starting point of the Inquiry, which is reflected in the final proposal on reduced and simplified reporting requirements, is the large number of government authorities and the significant differences that exist in how reporting by businesses to each individual authority is organised.</p>
<p>The Inquiry does not see the attempt to standardise the various technical systems and procedures of different authorities as an end in itself. However, within the framework of efforts to reduce and simplify reporting by businesses, it will be necessary to make some</p>
<p>adjustments to the authorities’ existing procedures and technical systems with regard to case processing, etc., in order to achieve the overall objective.</p>
<p>To effectively conduct efforts to reduce and simplify reporting by businesses, authorities must ensure that this task has high priority in their day-to-day activities. Experience shows that strong leadership and clear management of these efforts at all levels are crucial for a positive outcome.</p>
<p>An explicit objective of the Inquiry’s work is, as already mentioned, that businesses, as a rule, should only need to submit the information once, to one place. This means that there should be a single entry point for businesses when submitting information. Our work has therefore focused on the initial meeting (the point of contact, interface) between business and authority. Furthermore, we believe that the approach of having a single entry point should mainly build on eServices.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we propose the establishment of a Service Centre that will serve as a single entry point to the authorities’ eServices concerning businesses and entrepreneurship. However, there should be no case processing within the framework of the Service Centre.</p>
<p>The authorities will be required to connect their eServices (case services) to the Service Centre. Use of the Service Centre will not be mandatory for businesses; they can contact the eServices of each authority directly or meet their reporting obligations in another way if possible.</p>
<p>Experience shows that the authorities strive to ensure that reporting is completed on the initial contact. Simplification efforts should therefore focus on identification and contact information and other basic information about businesses that authorities often request in connection with reporting. Such frequently requested information should be shared between the authorities in a simple and rapid manner within the framework of the Service Centre so that businesses do not need to repeat it.</p>
<p>As an initial step, the General Business Register – as a comprehensive register of information about businesses – should be developed and used as a source of basic information about businesses. The General Business Register should be linked to the Service Centre. This would take place through the Service Centre passing on the information contained about an individual company in the General Business Register to the authority to which the company is reporting via the Service Centre.</p>
<p>Passing on basic information would only take place as a service to the authority and the business reporting information. Passing on information in this way is not intended to affect the legal relationship between the business reporting information and the authority that has statutory support for the reporting requirement.</p>
<p>In order for the Service Centre to result in reduced and simplified reporting by businesses, the authorities will be required to adapt their eServices so that the information that is passed on through the Service Centre can be used by each eService.</p>
<p>The authorities must also, as part of efforts to reduce and simplify reporting by businesses, systematically and regularly review each reporting requirement and carefully consider what basic information about the business the authority needs for its processing and whether the business operator really needs to report this information.</p>
<p>Under the Personal Data Act (1998:204) and/or applicable legislation on registers, many authorities are not permitted to process all the information about a business that is contained in the General Business Register. The basic information about businesses that is passed on via the Service Centre must therefore be adjusted so that it may be processed by the receiving authority.</p>
<p>Reporting requirement register</p>
<p>A reporting requirement register has a crucial role to play in creating the conditions for coordination and information exchange between authorities and providing access to reliable statistics on reporting by businesses.</p>
<p>In addition, the reporting requirement register is a key component of the Service Centre. When the authorities take stock of their reporting requirements, for each of the requirements they will have to decide what basic information, passed on by the Service Centre, is necessary for the processing of the case in question.</p>
<p>Reporting requirements are statutory requirements on businesses to submit information to government authorities. Reporting requirements are specified in detail in acts, ordinances or authority regulations. A reporting requirement may necessitate the submission of several different types of information. Reporting can be required at regular intervals or following a certain event.</p>
<p>The terms ‘business’ and ‘business operator’ refer to natural or legal persons who run business operations in Sweden. The terms also</p>
<p>include natural or legal persons who intend to run business operations, dormant businesses and businesses and business operators that are in the process of winding up business operations.</p>
<p>The authority to which the business is required to report must notify the authority responsible for the register of reporting requirements (i.e. the business data authority proposed by the Inquiry) and describe the reporting requirement.</p>
<p>The business data authority responsible for the register of reporting requirements may issue detailed regulations on the information to be submitted.</p>
<p>There should be no restrictions on the right to gather information from businesses in the case of a failure to notify the register of a reporting requirement or incomplete notification. The business data authority should not have the power to decide that an authority is to refrain from gathering information from businesses or to decide on requirements for sharing of information between authorities.</p>
<p>If businesses submit the same or similar information to several authorities and the authorities do not take any joint measures to facilitate or limit reporting by businesses, the business data authority may request that the authorities cooperate. The business data authority will have no power to force the authorities to take specific measures. However, authorities receiving such a request will be required to give an account of the measures taken as a result of the request.</p>
<p>The information in the reporting requirement register can be used in the Service Centre to show which reporting requirements apply to businesses in a certain sector. To-do lists tailored to individual businesses will give businesses a much better overview of the reporting requirements an individual business must meet. The authorities would also benefit from to-do lists if more businesses then meet their reporting requirements in time. In order to create to-do lists and enable the creation of accurate lists for individual businesses, it will be necessary, in future, to find out whether the authorities know which businesses are to meet a certain reporting requirement.</p>
<p>Chapter 9 describes the Inquiry’s overall objectives. The Inquiry has also developed a prototype based on the overall objectives. This prototype is described in Chapter 10.</p>
<p>Legal issues</p>
<p>The Service Centre brings many different legal issues to the fore. The regulations that primarily warrant attention in this context are the Freedom of the Press Act, the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400), the Personal Data Act (1998:204) and special register statutes, and the Archives Act (1990:782).</p>
<p>In addition to the customary review of current law, the legal analysis is based on the guidance on operational development issued by the eGovernment Delegation in June 2013. The purpose of this guidance document is to describe and explain the key legal issues in the area, present certain types of technical solutions (IT architecture) and finally bring together legal and technical dimensions in a lawful and appropriate manner.</p>
<p>The guidance document defines a number of core concepts for eGovernment, with IT services as a base. Our Service Centre proposal follows the conceptual structure of the guidance document, featuring basic services, case services and presentation services. However, the IT services that make up the Service Centre will not lead to the initiation of cases or the completion of reporting; these will take place, as now, at the relevant authority. Therefore, in our proposed infrastructure slightly different requirements are placed on the construction of services, compared with the services that the eGovernment Delegation’s guidance primarily has in mind.</p>
<p>The IT services that make up the Service Centre do not include a ‘personal space’, which is a prerequisite for the services described in the guidance document. The personal space described in the guidance document is based on the exception in Chapter 2, Art. 10, first paragraph of the Freedom of the Press Act, which states that a document held by a public authority solely for the purpose of technical processing or technical storage on behalf of another is not deemed to be an official document held by that authority.</p>
<p>A fundamental assumption for the Inquiry was that the proposed infrastructure should not make it possible to chart users’ contacts with authorities more extensively than is now the case. If businesses feel that they are being monitored in a negative way when they use the Service Centre, there is a risk that use will decline and the positive effects for both businesses and authorities will be lost.</p>
<p>Before the final technical solution for the Service Center and the initial survey of the specific reporting requirements to be included in the to-do list have been carried out, it is difficult to more precisely</p>
<p>consider the issue of secrecy. Thus, we do not present a proposal in this regard.</p>
<p>Although the business data authority will process personal data, it is possible to reconcile the authority’s processing of personal data with requirements concerning protection against violation of privacy. It is proposed that the Business data authority will only be permitted to process personal data to the extent required to run the Service Centre. The Business data authority has no need to process sensitive personal data. In the technical design of the Service Centre, great emphasis should be placed on the authority not gathering or otherwise processing sensitive personal data.</p>
<p>Organisation, financing and economic impact</p>
<p>A new authority should be established – the Business data authority</p>
<p>– with the overall task of acting to achieve the Government’s objective of reducing and simplifying reporting for businesses.</p>
<p>The Business data authority will facilitate reporting by businesses through consultation and supervision.</p>
<p>The Business data authority will be responsible for the reporting requirement register and the Service Centre.</p>
<p>The Business data authority will be linked to a council of representatives (appointed by the Government) of large and small authorities as well as the business sector, focusing on the best interests of businesses.</p>
<p>The Service Centre will be financed by fees from connected authorities. The Business data authority’s other activities will have to be financed through reallocations within the central government budget.</p>
<p>The Business data authority’s overheads are expected to be between SEK 10 million and SEK 20 million annually. The investment costs for the proposed infrastructure are expected to amount to between SEK 31 million and SEK 39 million. The annual overheads for the technical part of the infrastructure are expected to amount to between SEK 21 million and SEK 25 million. Investment costs and overheads are estimated on the assumption that the business data authority invests in a new physical and organisational operational environment for the system. On the other hand, if the system is set up in an existing operational environment at another</p>
<p>authority, both investment costs and overheads can be expected to be lower.</p>
<p>The work the authorities will have to put in initially to identify information requirements and keep them up-to-date is relatively limited in relation to subsequent work to actively reduce and simplify reporting by businesses. The increased cost of information management incurred by authorities as part of distributing or receiving information from other authorities has previously been estimated at between SEK 2 million and SEK 6 million per year. The authorities’ work on identifying information requirements, adapting their IT systems to the Service Centre and performing other work to coordinate information requirements, must be managed within the framework of their appropriations.</p>
<p>Estimates of the benefit of the proposals are subject to considerable uncertainty. However all previous economic assessments indicate that creating a reporting requirement register and making active efforts to coordinate information requirements so as to reduce and simplify reporting by businesses will benefit the economy.</p>
<p>The costs will be borne exclusively by the State while businesses will see the benefits.</p>
