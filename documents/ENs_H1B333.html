<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Directives</h2>
<p>The Inquiry was assigned to review the current emergency services system in Sweden, including the emergency number 112 and SOS Alarm centers, to ensure that it is secure and effecient.</p>
<p>A central starting point has been to ensure that citizens in a situation of emergency may be assissted by emergency services by the police services, ambulance and other rescue services. Another requirement is to enhance coordinated actions, and ensure quick responses as well as the optimal use of resourses. The importance of coordinated actions in crisis management and public security is emphazied in the directives.</p>
<h2>Current Situation</h2>
<p>For a long time Sweden has had a comparably well-coordinated emergency services system based on the single emergency number 112 (formely 90 000 in Sweden) and integrated emergency services centres run by SOS Alarm, a company owned by the Swedish Government and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions. The original motive for coordination was that the individual easily and quickly be able to get in contact with emergency services in an emergency situation, and to ensure coordinated actions by the police services, ambulance and other rescue services. Also, cooperation was believed to be cost-efficient.</p>
<p>According to the Inquiry, the fundamental reasons for coordination of emergency services are still essentially valid. However, the analysis of the investigations shows that the current model has has some weaknesses. Firstly, the model of coordination is voluntary, which means that each authority can choose how to connect their services to the SOS Alarm emergency services centers. Government agencies with emergency rescue services including the Police, have never been coordinated to these emergency centers.</p>
<p>Further, SOS Alarm today operates in a market where new players are establishing as operators of emergency services. Several municipalities and counties express that they intend to choose other providers of emergency services, and some have already done so, especially in more urban areas. A further problem is that there is no basic regulation or law for emergency services, and no general requirements established for e.g. technical support systems, sharing of information and communication and overall coordination.</p>
<p>The assessment of the Inquiry is that the emergency services system is becoming increasingly complex and fragmented. In the long run this may pose a risk to public safety and security and crisis management.</p>
<h2>Proposals</h2>
<p>The proposals comprise the following issues:  Strengthened national governance  National authority for emergency services  Legislation on emergency services  Monitoring and control</p>
<p>Strengthened National Governance</p>
<p>The Inqury proposes measures to strengthen national governance to safeguard that emergency call services and across the country.</p>
<h2>National Authority for Emergency Services</h2>
<p>A national authority is proposed for ensuring safe, efficient and equal emergency services across the country. The authority will be responsible for receiving emergency calls on number 112, evaluate the need for assistance and, in case of urgent need for assistance, alertering the appropriate emergency rescue service. The services of the authority will encompass emergency calls to rescue services in municipalities and state agencies, ambulance service and police services. The authority will also offer support to rescue services and authorities, for exemple public warning services or coordination services during major or serious incidents, or in crisis management.</p>
<p>Focus on emergencies</p>
<p>The services of the authority will have a stronger focus on genuine emergencies, i.e. when there is an imminent danger to life, health or property and urgent assistance is needed. Non-urgent emergency calls will be directed or forwarded to other information numbers or services provided by cooperation authorities. An overall objective is that the authority should be sufficiently robust to perform its services even during a prolonged crisis. The proposed authority should not provide commercial services.</p>
<p>Organization</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a structure with fewer and more robust emergency service centers in order to improve efficiency and harmonization of service to the citizens across the country. Larger and more robust centers are also better placed to meet the requirement for fast, safe and effecient emergency services.</p>
<p>The number of emergency centers are proposed to be reduced to 5 or 7 centers. Considerations on the regional breakdown and suitable locations for the centers need to be made on the basis of the interaction with rescue serices and authorities at different levels of society.</p>
<p>Cooperation with rescue services and authorities</p>
<p>Services are proposed to be carried out in close cooperation with the authorities and emergency services on local, regional and state level. Improved technical support systems will be an important part of cooperation in emergency respons actions. In time, a closer interaction can also be achieved through co-location in emergency services and response centers.</p>
<p>Monitoring and control</p>
<p>Measures are proposed to improve monitoring, following-up of response actions and quality of services. The Swedish Civil Contingenies Agency is proposed to answer for supervision and control of emergency call services and emergency respons services overall.</p>
<h2>Emergency number 112</h2>
<p>To safeguard national coordination, the emergency number 112 will continue to be the single public safety answering point for emergency calls in Sweden. The emergency number need to be further restricted to urgent emergency calls. Therefore, non-urgent calls will be directed to information numbers and other contact points. Measures are proposed to enhance public information on available emergency and information numbers and what number to use in different situation.</p>
<p>The Inquiry recommends that requirements be raised on telephone companies to provide reliable and robust telecommunication services, as a prerequisite for emergency call services on 112. Also, there are gaps in telecommunication services in some parts of the country that may impair emergency services.</p>
<h2>Legislation</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that certain fundamental provisions concerning emergency services should be regulated by law.</p>
<h2>Costs and Financing</h2>
<p>Costs for the implementation of the proposed emergency service authority are estimated to 550 million SEK. The inceased costs for central government are proposed to be financed through reallocations within the State Budget, including an adjustment between central government and municipalities and local authorities. Temporary cost for restructuring and adjustments are estimated to approximatly 30– 50 million SEK for a period of three years.</p>
<h2>Implementation Plan</h2>
<p>The new authority for emergency services is proposed to be established on 1 January 2015. The implementation of the proposals needs to be prepared in several steps. Changes concerning the company SOS Alarm requires that the Government state engages in negotiations with representatives of the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions.</p>
<p>An special committee is proposed to be set up to prepare the proposed emergency services authority and changes in the stucture of emercency service centers. The overall implementation should be carefully planned and properly monitored to maintain quality and safety in emergency services.</p>
