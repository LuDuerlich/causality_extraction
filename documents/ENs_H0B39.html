<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit of the Inquiry</h2>
<p>The overall remit of the Inquiry is to propose measures that can increase participation in the labour force and speed up introduction in the labour market of recently arrived women and family member immigrants who were born abroad. As a special part of its remit, the Inquiry is to make a survey of the parental benefit claims of recently arrived women and men. It is this survey that will be described in the interim report ‘ Benefit and trap – parental benefit claims by recently arrived immigrants ’.</p>
<h2>First period in Sweden important for good integration</h2>
<p>One of the most important means of achieving good integration is by providing those migrating to Sweden with the necessary resources for entering the labour market. Through employment and the opportunity to support themselves and their families, their sense of belonging can grow stronger. For successful establishment, the first period in Sweden is important. It is then that a new language is to be learned, new networks created and skills built upon or validated so that they are viable in the new country. At the same time, we know that people born abroad, particularly women, have lower labour force participation than people born in Sweden also after several years in the country.</p>
<p>Several thresholds into the labour market</p>
<p>There are several reasons for the lower level of employment among women and men born abroad. The duration of residence  in Sweden is an important explanatory factor. As recently arrived immigrants, they need to learn the language , they often possess less viable human capital  for Swedish conditions, and they have less welldeveloped networks  in working life, all of which affect their opportunities to find a job. High demands for skills  in the labour market and discrimination  are two other thresholds to be crossed for immigrants to find work. Women and men from the refugee and family reunification/formation immigrant groups meet the greatest difficulties in becoming established in the labour market.</p>
<p>The lower level of employment of women and men born abroad does not, however, appear to be due to the lack of a will to work. Instead, the Inquiry’s assessments show that women and men born abroad who are seeking work have a more positive attitude to work than those seeking work who were born here. They also seek work more intensively than people born in Sweden.</p>
<p>The thresholds for entering the labour market are particularly high for women. Recently arrived women, like women in general, often take greater responsibility for the unpaid work of the home, which affects their opportunities for participating in the labour force. But the connection may also work in the opposite direction. The difficulties of entering the labour market may lead to women being referred to taking care of home and family to a considerably greater extent than they would wish themselves. Some people migrate to Sweden together with children, and fertility rates are high just after arrival. Long-term and intensive claims for parental benefits may lead to a delay in learning the language and becoming established, or to this not beginning at all. There is a risk of the thresholds for contact with key actors like the municipality and the Public Employment Service becoming higher, the longer a person stays in Sweden with few contacts outside his or her close family. For recently arrived immigrants covered by the Act on introduction activities for certain newly arrived immigrants, more lengthy claims for benefits may lead to their losing the right to participate in special introduction activities.</p>
<p>Focus on parental benefit claims</p>
<p>The aim of the interim report is to survey parental benefit claims among recently arrived women and men born abroad. This survey is intended to provide a better basis for analyses of how these claims affect opportunities for recently arrived women to work, and take part in introduction activities aimed at getting them established in the labour market. One in three women between the ages of 18 and 50 years who migrated to Sweden in 2006–2009 as a refugee, a person otherwise in need of protection, or a family reunification immigrant, claimed parental benefit in 2009. For those coming as family member immigrants to other Swedish residents apart from refugees, the corresponding proportion was 22 per cent. The men claiming parental benefits had considerably smaller claims, compared with those of women.</p>
<p>The impact of parental benefit claims on opportunities to participate in Swedish for Immigrants (SfI) courses and other activities to prepare people for employment can be assumed to depend on the extent of these claims and how they are placed in terms of time. In this interim report, the Inquiry has determined the extent to which recently arrived immigrants’ claims apply to full or part time, at the flat rate level of compensation and over a longer, consecutive period.</p>
<p>Parents may also claim parental benefit for older children who migrate to Sweden with them, and the number of days is the same (480 days) for recently arrived older children as for a new born child. In 2006, some 6 100 children under the age of eight were granted residence permit as refugees or on family reunification/formation grounds, 85 per cent were one year old or more. The Inquiry has examined whether the possibility of claiming parental benefit for older immigrant children has also been used in practice, and the extent to which this has occurred.</p>
<h2>The result of the survey of recently arrived parents’ parental benefit claims</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has commissioned a study of parental benefit claims of recently arrived parents who came to Sweden in 2006 over the first four-year period. Among those migrating from countries outside Europe that year, there were 6 700 women, who in the following years were entitled to parental benefit, either for children who migrated together with them or for children who were born during the first four years in Sweden. In this survey, four patterns are apparent that are of special importance for an analysis of how parental benefit claims affect recently arrived women’s participation in the labour force: 1. Intensive claims delay introduction in the labour market for many recently arrived mothers</p>
<p>A comparatively large group of recently arrived women have fewer opportunities to become established in the labour market during their first years in Sweden as a result of their care of older children. One in three women (or 730 persons) born outside Europe who migrated to Sweden in 2006 with children under the age of eight, and who do not  give birth to more children during that period claim at least 200 days in the first year after migration (2007).</p>
<p>Among women born outside Europe who come with children and who also give birth to further children after their arrival in Sweden, almost half (or 640 persons) claim at least 200 days in 2007.</p>
<p>In total, this involves almost 1 400 women, or 40 per cent of mothers migrating with children from countries outside Europe. The year after they migrate to Sweden, these women have such high parental benefit claims that they can hardly begin courses in Swedish or other activities that can open doors into the labour market. 2. Extensive claims for several consecutive years among mothers giving birth to further children</p>
<p>One out of four, and one of ten mothers respectively, arriving with children from countries outside Europe and who give birth to further children in Sweden during the period claim at least 200 days for two, respectively three consecutive years. These claims almost always involve full days, which means that these women have few opportunities to participate in introduction activities in parallel with their care of their children.</p>
<p>Of the group of women born outside Europe who migrate to Sweden in 2006 with children, but who do not give birth to more children in Sweden during the period, however, only three per cent claim more than 200 days for two consecutive years. Extensive claims for several consecutive years can thus be attributed to the recently arrived mothers giving birth to further children during their first years in Sweden. 3. Many recently arrived parents do not claim any days at all</p>
<p>The survey also shows that many parents migrating to Sweden do not make use of parental benefit at all. One in four women who migrate to Sweden in 2006 with children under the age of eight from countries outside Europe and who do not give birth to more children in Sweden during the period do not claim any parental benefit at all during the first four years in Sweden. The proportion of men not making use of their right to parental benefit in this group is even higher, 60 per cent.</p>
<p>Particularly remarkable is the result that seven per cent (some 300 persons) of women migrating to Sweden in 2006 from countries outside the EU/the Nordic region, who give birth to children during their first years in Sweden, do not claim a single parental benefit day during the whole period.</p>
<p>One explanation for this low rate of claims may be that knowledge about this insurance among recently arrived parents is so minimal that it limits their access to parental benefit. Other explanations may be partly that the flat rate of compensation (SEK 180 per day) does not represent an alternative if greater benefits can be obtained by seeking jobs or by participating in introduction activities, and partly the unregistered emigration that occurs. 4. Neither particularly advantageous nor flexible for recently arrived parents</p>
<p>Recently arrived mothers have more difficulty in making use of the flexibility in the insurance system, probably as a result of financial limitations. Almost without exception, they receive compensation at the flat rate level (SEK 180 per day). They usually also only claim the full days of parental benefit and they claim considerably more days during the same year than the reference group. It is unusual to combine gainful employment with parental leave in this group, and similarly it seems to be unusual to combine parental benefit claims with participation in introduction activities. These women’s parental benefit claims are far too concentrated to allow time for this.</p>
<p>Municipalities, the social welfare allowance and parental benefit</p>
<p>In a questionnaire that the Inquiry addressed to Sweden’s municipalities, it emerges that recently arrived parents’ parental benefit claims may be influenced to a great extent by the municipality’s practice for assessing allowances. In many municipalities, a recently arrived parent applying for a social welfare allowance has no other choice than to claim parental benefit. When dealing with an application for a supplementary welfare allowance from a family with a child of four years of age in which the mother participates in a SfI course but has no income and is not entitled to an introduction benefit, four out of ten municipalities answered that they would urge the woman to break off her course, and instead to claim parental benefit full time. In two out of ten municipalities, persons received as refugees with the right to an introduction benefit would be urged to claim full parental benefit when they apply for a supplementary social welfare allowance. Only three out of ten municipalities with guidelines for financial support also apply the National</p>
<p>Board of Health and Welfare’s recommendations for both parents to have the opportunity to use part of the parental benefit. Since women have weaker connections with the labour market than men, this practice probably contributes to newly arrived women claiming parental benefit more extensively.</p>
<p>Both a benefit and a trap</p>
<p>In summary, our survey shows that parental benefit claims are relatively extensive during the first year after migration to Sweden for mothers migrating together with children under the age of eight. After that, claims decrease for older children who migrate to Sweden at the same time as their parents. Parental benefit claims for older children thus lead to a delay in their introduction in the labour market of at least one year for some 40 per cent of the recently arrived women who migrate to Sweden together with children. A parental benefit claim for several consecutive years is, however, unusual among those women who migrate to Sweden in 2006 together with children under the age of eight, and who do not give birth to more children in the years following their migration to Sweden. Mothers with a high rate of parental benefit claims for several consecutive years are to be found instead among those who both have children with them when they migrate to Sweden and then give birth to further children in Sweden.</p>
<p>The benefits of the Swedish parental insurance system – remuneration that, to a high degree, compensates for loss of income and considerable flexibility for parents to decide themselves how they are to take out parental benefit so as to best meet the family’s needs – can seldom be taken advantage of by recently arrived parents. Only on extremely rare occasions have recently arrived mothers and fathers been eligible for income-related compensation; instead, almost all these parents receive an allowance at a flat rate level, i.e., SEK 180 per day. With a low allowance, and without an established connection with the labour market, it is difficult to take advantage of the flexible opportunities to claim parental benefit according to one’s needs. Recently arrived mothers and fathers claim parental benefit over a much more concentrated period than other parents, and their claims for this benefit refer almost exclusively to full days.</p>
<p>The conclusion is thus that parental benefit delays introduction in the labour market for a considerable number of recently arrived mothers and that it can become a trap, particularly for those who are in need of a supplementary social welfare allowance.</p>
<h2>Difficult issues require several answers</h2>
<p>The considerably lower participation in the labour market of women born abroad does not have a single cause, but depends on a combination of many factors. In order to achieve greater employment among newly arrived women, measures therefore need to be taken in a range of different areas. The first years in a new country are particularly important to reduce the risk of long-term unemployment. Solutions to the problems arising because women are absent from working life during these first important years due to the care of children need to be sought for and designed in different ways, depending on the age of the children and the family ʼ s situation otherwise.</p>
<p>Need for the regulatory framework to be reviewed</p>
<p>In view of the purpose of parental insurance – to make it easier for parents to combine work with care of children in connection with the birth or adoption of a child – the current design of parental insurance appears to be structurally unsound. For children born abroad, parental benefit days are allotted ‘retroactively’. Thus, in the overall view of the Inquiry, there is reason to make changes in the regulatory framework of parental insurance so as to reduce the risk of parental benefit claims for older children  delaying the introduction of recently arrived women in the labour market. This can be achieved either through a general limit to how long parental benefit can be claimed or using an “age-graded model” where the number of parental benefit days is related to the child’s age when he or she migrated to Sweden.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s continued work</p>
<p>When absence from the labour market and introduction initiatives involves the care of small children , the solution is not to limit opportunities for parents to be at home with their children. The</p>
<p>Inquiry’s remit includes proposing measures that can make it easier for recently arrived women and men to combine parenthood with work and participation in introduction activities to prepare people for work. We have, in this interim report, identified several issues that will be important in the Inquiry’s future work:</p>
<p> Should the target group for the right to special introduction activities be extended?</p>
<p> Should it be possible to increase the period of introduction activities when parental benefit is claimed part time?</p>
<p> Do expectations and treatment of central actors affect access to relevant activities for recently arrived women?</p>
<p> Is information about the advantages of  pre-school for such matters as children’s language development adapted to the target group?</p>
<p> Are there flexible opportunities to participate in SfI courses so that the care of children and language studies can take place in parallel?</p>
<p>According to its terms of reference, the Inquiry is to submit its final report, including proposals for legislative amendments, no later than 15 October 2012.</p>
