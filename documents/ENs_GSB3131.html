<p>Terms of Reference</p>
<p>The Committee has previously submitted the interim report ”Reformerad konkurrensövervakning – Konsekvenser i Sverige av EG:s nya tillämpningsförordning (SOU 2003:73)” – Reformed monitoring of competition – Consequences in Sweden of the EU’s new implementing regulation (Swedish Government Official Reports 2003:73) and the interim report “Rätten till skadestånd enligt konkurrenslagen (SOU 2004:10)” – The right to damages under the Competition Act (Swedish Government Official Reports 2004:10).</p>
<p>Through the supplementary terms of reference, dir. 2003:175, the Committee's terms of reference were extended to cover the issue of making it a criminal offence to infringe the prohibitions on anti-competitive behaviour in articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty and their Swedish equivalents. The assignment includes the technical task of drawing up a concrete legislation model and making an in-depth legal analysis. The trends in Community law shall be followed as well as developments in other EU states etc. as regards criminalisation in the area of competition law.</p>
<p>The impact of criminalisation on the existing programme for remission and reduction of the administrative fine as defined in the Competition Act shall be included in the analysis. Procedural issues shall also be analysed.</p>
<p>Under the supplementary terms of reference a report shall be submitted at the latest by 31 December 2004.</p>
<p>In this final report, which constitutes the third stage of the assignment, the Committee reports on the results of its deliberations in the matter of criminalisation. The Committee’s assignment is thereby completed.</p>

<p>Considerations of the Committee</p>
<p>Criminalisation should be limited to cartels</p>
<p>The Committee has been instructed to draw up a concrete legislation model for criminalisation in competition law. Under the terms of reference the criminalisation model shall be directed towards what should qualify as particularly serious cases and refer to a core area of such injurious behaviour.</p>
<p>The Committee has made the assessment that, if infringement of the prohibitions in competition legislation is to be criminalised, the criminal area should be limited to horizontal cartels. Vertical restraint of competition and abuse of a dominant position should not be criminalised. If the prohibitions in competition law are to be punishable under criminal law, this should be effected by introducing a new crime with the following purport.</p>
<p>Any person entering into an agreement that is prohibited under section 6 or under article 81 of the EC Treaty and which implies that companies at the same production or trade level set selling pri-</p>
<p>ces, restrict or control production or divide up the market, if the agreement was designed to seriously impede, restrict or distort competition in the market, shall be sentenced to prison for a maximum of two years for anti-competitive  crime . The same applies to a person who puts such an agreement into practice.</p>
<p>If the crime is regarded as serious, the penalty for gross  anti-com-  petitive crime  shall be imprisonment for a minimum of six months and a maximum of six years. When determining whether the crime is serious, particular consideration shall be given to whether the proceedings were of an extensive nature or whether the act was otherwise of a particularly dangerous nature.</p>
<p>Forfeit</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that it should be possible to declare the proceeds from anti-competitive crime forfeit, unless this is evidently unreasonable.</p>
<p>When assessing whether it is evidently unreasonable to declare the proceeds forfeit, among other circumstances, consideration shall be given to whether there is reason to assume that payment of damages will be ordered or otherwise effected or that an administrative fine under the provisions of the Competition Act will be imposed.</p>
<p>Criminal investigations</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that The Economic Crimes Bureau in Sweden shall be the responsible Public Prosecution Office for investigation and criminal proceedings against anti-competitive crimes. The Swedish Competition Authority shall report to the Economic Crimes Bureau in Sweden, if there is suspicion of anti-com- petitive crime.</p>
<p>The pre-trial investigation of anti-competitive crimes shall be determined and led by a prosecutor at the Economic Crimes Bureau in Sweden.</p>
<p>General rules on pre-trial investigation for questioning, suspicion of crime, the right to engage a defence counsel, the use of coercive measures etc. shall also be applicable to investigation of anti-competitive crimes.</p>
<p>The Swedish Competition Authority shall assist the Economic Crimes Bureau in investigating anti-competitive crimes. The Competition Authority shall carry on general investigations and take initial measures as regards compliance with the competition legislation.</p>
<p>Duty to prosecute</p>
<p>The Committee considers that the general rules of the Code of Judicial Procedure concerning the duty to prosecute shall be applicable with regard to anti-competitive crime.</p>
<p>The Swedish Competition Authority’s investigations</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that an investigation at the Swedish Competition Authority shall be possible to continue in parallel, when a criminal investigation is in progress.</p>
<p>It shall be possible to pass on information at the Economic Crimes Bureau in Sweden covered by pre-trial investigation secrecy to the Swedish Competition Authority.</p>
<p>A criminal investigation in progress implies that the guarantees of legal protection established in the European Convention on Human Rights must be observed in favour of a suspect also in the Competition Authority's investigation. No separate enactment concerning this is necessary.</p>
<p>The programme for remission and reduction of the administrative fine as defined in the Competition Act</p>
<p>The programme for remission and reduction of the administrative fine for companies may remain even though a criminal penalty regulation is introduced for anti-competitive crime. However, the programme’s function of revealing cartels will be lost to a large extent.</p>
<p>The network co-operation between the competition authorities in the EU</p>
<p>According to the Committee, the Swedish Competition Authority is best suited to meet the obligations imposed on Swedish competition authorities within the framework of co-operation under the Council Regulation (EC) no 1/2003 of 16 December 2002 concerning the implementation of articles 81 and 82 in the Treaty.</p>
<p>The Economic Crimes Bureau in Sweden should not be given any role in that co-operation.</p>
<p>Increased need for resources</p>
<p>Criminalisation implies an increased need for resources at the Economic Crimes Bureau in Sweden and the general courts, as well as the legal aid appropriation and the appropriation item for certain court costs.</p>
<p>According to a very rough estimate the annual cost may be expected to be about SEK 44 million.</p>
