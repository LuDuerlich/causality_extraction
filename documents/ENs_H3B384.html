<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The remit</h2>
<p>Organ transplantation is a safe and established method of treatment in health care. In cases where there is no other method of treatment, transplantation offers seriously ill people the possibility of survival. In other cases, transplantation can offer significantly improved health, a higher quality of life and a return to an active working life. In many cases, transplantation is also a cost-effective medical measure.</p>
<p>There is, however, a serious shortage of organs suitable for transplantation both in Sweden and abroad. Waiting times are long for transplantation and some patients die while waiting for a transplant. Studies show that there is a strong support among the Swedish population to donate organs, yet Sweden ranks below the European average when it comes to organ donation rates. This means that there is a need to review regulatory frameworks, routines, organisation and information to the general public in order to identify areas improvement in promoting donation in Sweden.</p>
<p>It is against this backdrop that the Inquiry was tasked with proposing how the number of organ donors and available organs in Sweden can be increased.</p>
<h2>Basis of the Inquiry’s work Ethical aspects</h2>
<p>Self-determination is a fundamental principle in Swedish health and medical care and has been an important point of departure for the Inquiry’s work. Therefore, the Inquiry’s proposal is based on selfdetermination, meaning that a person who wishes to donate his or her organs should be provided with the conditions to do so, just as a person who does not wish to donate his or her organs must also be respected.</p>
<h2>Donating organs should be a natural part of end-of-life care</h2>
<p>The Inquiry notes that one of several conditions for achieving an increased donation rate in Sweden is a clearly assigned responsibility for the parts of the care chain relevant to the donation process. This means that all relevant parts of the care chain, such as emergency care and intensive care staff, should perceive organ donation as an incontestable and natural part of their duties. Organ donation should be seen as a natural part of end-of-life care.</p>
<h2>Organisational aspects</h2>
<p>In order for people to be able to donate organs, health care must be organised so as to facilitate organ donation. In the course of the Inquiry, it has become clear that organisational conditions for health and medical care are the decisive factor for increasing the organ donation rate.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has focused on overarching organisational factors, such as division of responsibilities between the central government, regions and county councils, agency structure and implementation of national regulatory frameworks. The Inquiry’s conclusions on the need for national coordination are supported by international experience. The Inquiry notes that countries where special initiatives were made to strengthen national knowledge-based guidance on organ donation and transplantation report an increasing rate of organ donation. This kind of knowledge-based guidance should support the entire care process which encompasses organ donations. This includes identifying potential donors, adequate care of possible donors and staff training on how to talk to close relatives to establish whether or not consent has been given. Other important parts are division of responsibilities and systematic monitoring and follow-up of results, not least at local health care centres.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposal in brief General overview</h2>
<p>Organ donation activities have long been subject to special legal provisions. The Transplants Act (1995:831) has been in effect since 1996. The Act primarily regulates consent provisions and other rules connected to donation. The name of the Act is thus misleading and the Inquiry therefore proposes that it is changed to the ‘Act on donation of biological material for transplantation’.</p>
<h2>Medical measures to facilitate possible donation</h2>
<p>During the course of the Inquiry’s work, it has emerged that every year, a number of patients die who could have become donors. One reason for this is that healthcare management of patients with serious brain damage is not optimal with regard to identifying potential donors. This also applies in cases where donation consent can be obtained. An important reason for this is that the legislation is regarded as unclear and does not explicitly regulate medical measures that may need to be taken to facilitate donation where consent for organ donation has been given or an investigation to establish whether or not consent has been given is under way.</p>
<p>In cases where consent for organ donation has been obtained, the Inquiry considers that, if certain conditions are met, health and medical care has the task of taking into account consent to donate as part of end-of-life care. Fulfilling the wish of a dying person to donate organs may, in certain cases, require carrying out a consent investigation and certain medical measures to enable donation before death occurs. The Inquiry therefore proposes that it should be possible to explore a patient’s view on organ donation etc. following a decision not to start or not to continue life-sustaining treatment. Such a decision is to be taken by the attending doctor after consultation with another doctor and documented in the patient’s medical records. Following such a decision, medical measures may be started and continue for a reasonable time while investigation into consent is carried out. Consent investigation is to be carried out without undue delay and with respect for the patient and the patient’s close relatives. If the investigation concludes that organ donation is possible, medical measures may be started and continue for a reasonable time, if required for safeguarding organs or other biological material for transplantation. In cases where conditions for organ donation are not met, for instance where there is no consent for organ donation, life-sustaining measures are to be withdrawn and care is only to focus on palliative measures.</p>
<h2>Donation after circulatory death</h2>
<p>Donation after circulatory death was the form of organ donation that was in effect in Sweden until 1988 when new legislation introduced brain-related death criteria in Sweden. This legislative amendment meant that care services moved from donation after circulatory death to instead apply donation after brain death.</p>
<p>Besides donation after brain death, donation after circulatory death is a form of donation that is applied in a number of other countries with good results. The Inquiry considers that there must be legal prerequisites in Sweden to also carry out donation after circulatory death. The legislative amendments proposed by the Inquiry on identifying consent and preparatory medical measures prior to donation establish the legal prerequisites for also carrying out donation in cases after circulatory death.</p>
<p>To enable donation after circulatory death, certain medical measures to maintain organ functions may need to be taken after death occurs. The Inquiry therefore also proposes an amendment to current legislation to clarify that it should not only be permitted to continue, but also to start, medical measures after death occurs in order to enable donation.</p>
<p>Experience from countries that apply donation after circulatory death and that the Inquiry has studied has shown that work on donation after circulatory death was preceded by coordinated action to prepare national protocols and guidelines between national authorities with responsibility in the area and profession of donation. The Inquiry considers that similar work should be carried out in Sweden to ensure uniform national application.</p>
<h2>Strengthened governance in order to promote organ donation</h2>
<p>Both the findings of this Inquiry and international experience show that the main potential to increase the number of organ donations lies in changing attitudes and the organisation of, and approach to, the practical activities in hospitals. National coordination and clear governance of activities is what is primarily needed in order to realise this potential.</p>
<h2>Legislative clarification of health and medical care responsibility for organ donation</h2>
<p>During the course of the Inquiry’s work, it has become apparent that organ donation activities are important and form a natural part of Swedish health and medical care. Legislation should therefore be clarified to clearly state that current activities form part of official duties of health care. In the Inquiry’s view, such a clarification will send an important signal.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, the Inquiry proposes the introduction of a provision in the Health and Medical Services Act indicating that hospitals providing intensive care are to have the staff and other resources, such as equipment and premises, necessary to safely carry out organ donation. In addition to premises, equipment and staff, hospitals providing intensive care must also have the requisite procedures drawn up for identifying and taking care of potential organ donors.</p>
<h2>Regulations and knowledge-based guidance</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes the introduction of a new authorisation in the Transplants Act to issue binding regulations on procedures, approach and follow-up for organ donation.</p>
<p>The main national responsibility to promote organ donation is to rest with the National Board of Health and Welfare and be accomplished by means of active knowledge-based guidance. The National Board of Health and Welfare will be tasked with producing a strategy for effective governance with knowledge in the area of organ donation and for information to care providers and health workers on new rules and approaches in the activities.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Council for Organ and Tissue Donation be phased out. The Council’s operational tasks will be formally transferred to the National Board of Health and Welfare.</p>
<h2>Information aimed at the general public</h2>
<p>The Inquiry notes that information and opinion formation on organ donation should remain a central government responsibility. The central government is, in any case, to have overarching responsibility at national level to ensure that such information and opinion formation takes place. The Inquiry notes that campaigns conducted in this area have had a limited and quickly fading effect and that there is a need for more regular information. Nevertheless, information and opinion formation aimed at the general public play an important role, provided that such measures are conducted with precision to achieve the greatest possible effect. In other words, they must be cost-effective.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the National Board of Health and Welfare be given responsibility for information and influencing attitudes on issues of organ donation, with the general public as the target group.</p>
<h2>Routine information and possibilities for individuals to make their decision on organ donation known</h2>
<p>The issue of the various ways of taking a decision on organ donation as an individual is closely linked to the issue of information to the general public. A prerequisite for making your view known is having knowledge of the various ways you can do so. The Inquiry has noted that such measures need to be effective in terms of dissemination and costs. The Inquiry does not consider there is reason to proceed with alternatives where ‘set information mediums’, such as driving licences or ID cards, are used as a way for individuals to make their decision on organ donation known.</p>
<p>Instead, the Inquiry considers that, in addition to the channels of information already used, the most natural ones are in contact with various health services and in other situations connected with health and medical care. This conclusion is supported by the attitude survey carried out by the Inquiry among the public. The Inquiry considers that a suitable alternative would be to link information on organ donation to the patient’s medical records and ‘My Healthcare Contacts’. ‘Personal health care accounts’ are still under development, but the Inquiry considers that this can be one of several care-related platforms for informing the public about organ donation.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the National Board of Health and Welfare, which is to be responsible for information to the public at overall national level, be given responsibility for ensuring that progress is made on cost-effective alternatives for routine information dissemination and possibilities for individuals to make their decision on organ donation known.</p>
<h2>Donor register</h2>
<p>One of the points of departure for the Inquiry has been to make it easier for individuals to make their decision on organ donation known. The attitude survey commissioned by the Inquiry shows that the ways in which individuals want to make their decision on organ donation known vary; for instance, not everyone wants to discuss the issue with close relatives. A majority emphasised the importance of being able to indicate a decision on organ donation in a confidential register. There is no alternative to the National Donor Register for those who wish to make their decision known in a privacy-protected register. The Inquiry considers that there is a continued need for the National Donor Register and alternatives for submitting an expression of will to donate to the National Donor Register should remain unchanged. However, an evaluation of the National Donor Register should be carried out if alternatives are developed that can be considered to replace the current function of the National Donor Register.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposal in the parts covering preparatory medical measures for organ donation and organ donation after circulatory death means that it is important for authorised staff to have access to the data in the National Donor Register before death occurs, in order to ensure that a potential donor’s selfdetermination is fully taken into account. However, so as not to undermine confidence in donor activities, the possibility to consult the National Donor Register before death occurs should only be permitted in limited and carefully regulated circumstances. The Inquiry therefore proposes that the National Donor Register be regulated in a special ordinance which would strengthen privacy protection for individuals listed in the National Donor Register while upholding confidence in donor activities.</p>
<h2>Living donors</h2>
<p>Although organ transplantation is mainly carried out using organs from deceased donors, every year, approximately 150 living donors donate one of their kidneys. Living donors can also donate a part of their liver, although this happens less often. On the whole, living donors make prolonged life and better quality of life possible for many seriously ill people. Every kidney that is transplanted from a living donor also helps reduce waiting times for other patients. At the same time, all operations are associated with certain risks and therefore, donation from a living donor demands thorough investigation and informed consent.</p>
<h2>Remuneration for expenses and loss of income to living donors</h2>
<p>Remuneration to living organ donors is not calculated in a uniform manner by the authorities responsible for medical care. It is also difficult for the donor to predict. In general, the donor needs to be on sick leave after the operation and will also have sick leave before the operation for preparatory measures such as information and examinations. The Inquiry has based its work on the principle that remuneration provided for organ donation is to indemnify the donor from all financial consequences, i.e. the donor is to be remunerated for actual expenses incurred (patient fees, pharmaceutical products, travel costs) and loss of income in connection with donation.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the right to remuneration for costs that arise in connection with donation and are not compensated in another way, are to be regulated by law.</p>
<p>To ensure uniform national application, the National Board of Health and Welfare will be tasked, in consultation with the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions and the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, with developing guidelines for how assessments and calculation of remuneration is to be carried out.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes a simplified remuneration procedure where the donor applies to the Swedish Social Insurance Agency for high-risk protection. The employer is to pay sick pay during the first two weeks. The Swedish Social Insurance Agency and the county council is then to coordinate information so they can each pay their share (the Swedish Social Insurance Agency is to pay the sickness benefit qualifying part and the county council is to pay the difference up to the full salary level). The donor will simply need to complete an application.</p>
<p>Finally, it is proposed in this part that authorities responsible for medical care set up a central function for administration of remuneration cases for organ donation.</p>
<h2>Group of living donors</h2>
<p>There has been significant development in transplantation activities since the Transplants Act was introduced in 1996. The risks associated with organ donation have decreased, while transplantation outcomes have improved. There are also completely different medical prerequisites as to who can be a living donor. As a result of today’s anti-rejection medication, genetic family relationships have little impact on the outcome of transplantation.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore proposes that current legislation should be changed to more clearly state that under certain circumstances, people with no connection to the recipient, may also be relevant as donors. The Inquiry considers that the National Board should grant authorisation in cases of anonymous living donors or other types of living donations where there is no connection to the recipient. The Inquiry proposes amending Section 7 of the Transplants Act in order to specifically regulate situations where organ donation is carried out from a living donor who does not have any connection to the recipient.</p>
<h2>Registration of patient data for organ donation</h2>
<p>Scandiatransplant is responsible for a Nordic database used to match available organs with possible recipients. It can also constitute a supplementary tool, in addition to national registration functions, to trace donors and recipients in case of infection. The Inquiry considers that the registration functions administered by Scanditransplant, which have been in use for nearly fifty years, work well. The Inquiry proposes a legislative amendment of the registration requirement and the information this contains. A regulation of this kind already exists in, for instance, the area of tissue, but is still lacking in organ retrieval and transplantation.</p>
<p>It is the Inquiry’s opinion that consent to donate organs also includes consent to register personal data, which is a prerequisite for organ donation. However, the Inquiry considers that this should be regulated by law to clarify the legal situation.</p>
<h2>Expected results</h2>
<p>Should the Inquiry´s proposals be implemented a low estimate is that this could over time result in about 100-150 additional organ donators annually in Sweden. This means that there is potential to over time double the number of donators in Sweden to between 250 and 300 annually. This would of course have an important impact when it comes to decreasing the waiting list for transplantation that currently consists of over 700 patients.</p>
<h2>Implementation of the proposals</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the legislative proposals enter into force on 1 July 2017.</p>
