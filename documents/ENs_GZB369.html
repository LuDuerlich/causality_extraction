<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit of the Inquiry</h2>
<p>Our remit consisted of three parts. The first part concerned the prohibition by EU law of state aid that has not been approved by the European Commission, the second part concerned the regulations on audit certificates contained in the Insight into Certain Financial Relations and Related Matters Act (2005:590), and the third part concerned application of the local government prime cost principle in certain cases.</p>
<h2>Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union standstill obligation and Swedish law</h2>
<p>The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) contains rules aimed at ensuring well-functioning competition in the internal market. Among these rules are provisions on state aid. These are found in Articles 107–109 of the TFEU and are intended to prevent the distortion of competition in the EU by Member States giving improper economic favours to certain undertakings or the production of certain goods.</p>
<p>Under Article 107(1) of the TFEU, the basic premise is that state aid is prohibited. Nonetheless, it may be possible for a state to grant aid that is compatible with the internal market. However, as a rule, the aid can then only be granted after it has been reported to the European Commission, and the Commission has approved it. This standstill obligation is stated in Article 108(3), final sentence of the TFEU. State aid that is granted without having been approved by the Commission is called ‘unlawful aid’.</p>
<p>State aid is aid granted by a Member State or through state resources which threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings and which affects trade between Member States. State aid not only refers to aid granted by a state at central level; municipalities, county councils and publicly owned companies can also provide state aid. State aid is not limited to direct grants; the prohibition also covers other measures that give economic favour to certain undertakings, such as tax relief, sales below market prices, guarantee commitments without a market value guarantee fee and capital contributions without requiring market value returns.</p>
<p>The TFEU state aid rules not only mean that state aid may not be granted unless it has received prior approval by the Commission. Case law from the Court of Justice of the European Union shows that Member States are also required to order the recovery of aid granted without the approval of the Commission, and that the beneficiary is required to repay the aid plus interest</p>
<p>The Court of Justice has considered the standstill obligation to have a direct effect, which means that it can be cited by certain individuals, primarily competitors, before national courts. Competitors to beneficiaries are therefore to have access to effective legal remedies that can ensure the competitive situation is not changed by unlawful state aid. They are to be able to prevent aid in the process of being granted by presenting a motion to a court that the aid be immediately stopped. They are also to be able to institute court action to require the repayment of the aid. Competitors that have suffered damages by the fact that unlawful aid was granted may also have the right to compensation for the damages.</p>
<p>The Commission’s role regarding state aid is not confined to examining notifications of plans concerning state aid; the Commission also monitors to ensure that aid is not granted in violation of the standstill obligation. If this occurs, the Commission can decide that the Member State is to recover the aid. However, the aid is to be recovered even if such a decision is not taken.</p>
<p>What legislative amendments should be made?</p>
<p>We propose the introduction of a new act concerning application of the European Union’s state aid rules. The act should contain regulations concerning the responsibilities of providers and beneficiaries when aid is in the process of being granted or has been granted in violation of the standstill obligation. These rules should make clear that anyone who has received unlawful aid is to repay the aid plus interest, and that the party that has granted the unlawful aid is to recover the aid.</p>
<p>The proposed act also contains procedural provisions in cases concerning unlawful aid. These provisions cover legal action brought by a provider concerning repayment of unlawful aid by a beneficiary, and actions brought by a competitor of a beneficiary. Actions brought by a competitor can deal with a prohibition on granting unlawful aid, the repayment of unlawful aid, the recovery of such aid and damage claims resulting from such aid.</p>
<p>With regard to actions brought by competitors, the procedural provisions aim to deal with certain problems that result from the fact that the disputes concern three stakeholders, i.e. the competitor, the provider and the beneficiary. The competitor is to have access to effective legal remedies, while an alleged beneficiary is to have the right to a fair trial. The premise in Swedish law is that it is not possible to bring an action regarding another party’s rights, i.e. third party action. Under the general rule, it is therefore not possible to initiate an action seeking to have someone pay a third party, or a prohibition on someone else to do something with regard to a third party. The proposed act provides explicit exemptions from this prohibition. A competitor will therefore be able to bring an action against a beneficiary seeking to have him or her repay unlawful aid to the provider, or bring an action against a provider seeking to have them either be prohibited from granting aid to a beneficiary or recover unlawful aid from the beneficiary.</p>
<p>We also propose that a competitor to a company that is in the process of receiving unlawful aid should be able to bring an action against the provider and the beneficiary at the same time, seeking a prohibition on implementing the aid. This would satisfy these parties’ right to a fair trial, while the competitor would gain access to an effective legal remedy since the decision would have legal force with respect to all three parties.</p>
<p>In addition, we propose that it should be possible for a competitor to a beneficiary to bring an action against the provider, seeking a declaration that the provider is obliged to recover unlawful aid. This would waive the normal requirement that an action must be specific, since the competitor does not need to state from whom the provider is to recover the aid. This is because it can be unreasonably difficult for the competitor to state which companies have received aid in schemes that have resulted in aid being granted to a large number of companies.</p>
<p>If a competitor brings an action for a prohibition solely against the provider, or brings an action for recovery against a provider, the decision does not have legal force as regards the alleged beneficiary. Since the decision can have a negative impact on the alleged beneficiary despite this, we propose that the beneficiary should have the option of joining the proceedings as a party with the defence when the action is initiated.</p>
<p>Cases regarding unlawful aid deal with distinctive legal issues that require special legal expertise. Such cases have many points in common with certain cases under the Competition Act. We therefore propose that cases concerning unlawful aid should be examined in the same order as competition cases that the Stockholm District Court examines as the court of first instance. Actions concerning prohibitions on granting unlawful aid, repayment of unlawful aid, a declaration of an obligation to recover unlawful aid and compensation for damages caused by granting unlawful aid should therefore be brought before the Stockholm District Court. An action concerning damages may also be brought before a district court that is competent under the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure’s rules on competence. Appeals against judgments and decisions by the Stockholm District Court in such cases shall be addressed to the Swedish Market Court. The composition of the Stockholm District Court in such cases should correspond to its composition in competition cases. During the main hearing in a case concerning unlawful aid, the district court should therefore consist of two legally trained judges and two economic experts.</p>
<h2>The regulations on audit certificates in the Insight into Certain Financial Relations and Related Matters Act (2005:590)</h2>
<p>Our remit also included examining whether the requirement on audit certificates in the Insight into Certain Financial Relations and Related Matters Act (2005:590) (the ‘Transparency Act’) should be abolished or amended. This Act was adopted in order to implement European Commission Directive 80/723/EEC, known as the Transparency Directive. The aim of the Directive and the Act is that the Commission is to have insight into the financial relations between public authorities and public undertakings. This insight is to facilitate the Commission’s application of the TFEU competition rules, particularly the rules on state aid. To achieve this aim, certain requirements are stated in the Directive and in the Act concerning the accounts of the relevant undertakings. The provisions mean that the undertakings are to clearly account for public funds that have been provided to the undertaking by public authorities and how the funds have been used (transparent accounting separation). The Act also means that undertakings that conduct both economic activities with a legal monopoly or a similar exceptional position and other business activities are to account separately for revenues and costs for the two areas (separation of accounts). The Transparency Act states that the undertaking’s auditor is to examine whether the Act’s accounting requirements have been followed and issue a certificate regarding this examination. The Transparency Directive contains no such examination or certification requirements.</p>
<p>The reason we have been instructed to examine whether to remove or amend the accounting requirement is that auditors of undertakings have expressed a great deal of doubt about issuing certificates.</p>
<p>We have been able to establish that the fundamental problem with the regulation is that it is unclear what is meant by transparent and separate accounting. Therefore, undertakings that are obliged to render accounts do not know what the requirements are regarding their accounts. Since there are no clear and detailed provisions as to how the accounts are to be rendered, it is not possible to conduct an audit to check that the accounting requirement has been fulfilled. It is, however, inappropriate to supplement the Transparency Act with administrative provisions concerning how the accounts are to be drawn up.</p>
<p>Thus the examination conducted by the auditors is only a general examination, and cannot be more detailed than this. However, the general examination is worthwhile. It is therefore our opinion that the requirement concerning audit examinations and audit certificates should not be removed. We propose, however, that the requirements of the Transparency Act concerning examination be amended so that they correspond to the examination that the auditors are able to conduct, i.e. a general examination.</p>
<h2>A general exemption from the local government prime cost principle</h2>
<p>Finally, our remit included examining whether a general exemption from the local government prime cost principle under Chapter 8, Section 3c of the Local Government Act is necessary for optional business activities conducted by local governments. The provisions state that municipalities and county councils may not levy charges exceeding the cost of the services or utilities provided by the munici- pality or county council (the prime cost). The prime cost principle does not entail an obligation to finance an activity through charges; instead, a local government can choose to permit an activity to be funded through taxes. The prime cost principle thus only entails a maximum level, not a minimum level, for charges. The aim of the prime cost principle is mainly to protect members of the munici- pality or county council from monopoly pricing.</p>
<p>The issue of a general exemption from the prime cost principle has been reviewed many times during the last twenty years, most recently in 2007 by the Inquiry on the powers and authority of local government (Kommunala kompetensutredningen). These in- quiries have concluded that local government business activities in competitive markets that are conducted under the prime cost principle lead to distorted competition and thus to socio-economic losses. In light of this, they have concluded that local government business activities in competitive markets should be exempted from the prime cost principle. In order to obtain supplementary and updated information, we organised a hearing that included repre- sentatives of business organisations, the Swedish Competition Autho- rity and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions.</p>
<p>We have found that the prime cost principle mainly aims at pro- tecting members of a municipality or county council from over- pricing in local government activities in which local governments have a monopoly. This reason for maintaining the prime cost prin- ciple does not exist in markets with functioning competition.</p>
<p>We consider that the main reason for making an exception from the prime cost principle would be that local government business activities conducted under the prime cost principle affect com- petitors in an undesirable manner. At our hearing, both the Swedish Competition Authority, whose task is to promote efficient com- petition in private and public activities, and various business orga- nisations which represent the very competitors that would be pro-</p>
<p>tected through an exemption, stated that local government business activities based on the prime cost principle do distort competition to a certain extent, but that the problem is not so extensive as to justify an exemption. According to the Swedish Competition Authority and business organisations, developments in recent years also make the issue less and less relevant. They therefore consider that the disadvantages of a general exemption clearly outweigh the advantages, and that such an exemption should not be introduced. The Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions is of the same opinion, even if their reasons for this are somewhat different.</p>
<p>Particularly in light of the fact that the Swedish Competition Authority and business organisations make it clear that they do not consider there to be a need for a general exemption from the prime cost principle, we have concluded that an exemption of this kind is not necessary.</p>
<p>In addition, the Swedish Competition Authority and business organisations have stated that such an exemption could have negative consequences. The Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions has stated that the issue cannot be considered on its own. We therefore consider that a general exemption from the local government prime cost principle should not be made.</p>
