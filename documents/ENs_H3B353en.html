<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>It is a recurrent theme in policy debates whether an extended welfare state impedes or promotes economic performance measured by e.g. per capita income or growth. Viewpoints on this issue are often closely aligned with political observations, but what can research teach us about this question?</p>
<p>Sweden and the other Nordic countries are particularly interesting in this context. The so-called Nordic model is well known for relying on a large public sector and pursuing egalitarian objectives, and yet average incomes are among the highest within the OECD. How have Sweden and the other Nordic countries managed to square large public sectors and high tax burdens with comparatively strong economic performance?</p>
<p>A large theoretical and empirical amount of research provides insights on this question, and this report aims at providing a selective overview with a focus on explaining how a large public sector, egalitarian outcomes and strong economic performance are reconciled in the Nordic model. This is not only of retrospective interest, but important in a forward perspective pointing to possible ways to address policy challenges so as to maintain the hallmarks of the Nordic model.</p>
<p>While the Nordic model has some key characteristics as a large public sector, high tax burdens, organized labour markets etc., two overarching points are worth stressing. First, going one step deeper one easily identifies significant differences across the Nordic countries in specific policy choices despite the similar aggregate characteristics and performance indicators. This strongly suggests that the model is defined in terms of overall objectives and not in terms of specific policies. Second, the model is not static but has seen ongoing reforms and has been adapted to changes in both changes in the economic environment and in society more widely.</p>
<p>In comparative perspective the model has shown a large adaptability, perhaps this is as important as the models other characteristics.</p>
<p>Discussions of the role of the public sector often take outset in the basic text-book setting where public intervention to achieve a more egalitarian income distribution via various taxes and transfers distort incentives, leading to a reduction in economic efficiency. In plain words, attempts to distribute the cake more equally shrink its overall size. There is thus a trade-off between equality and economic performance. The Nordic performance does not refute the existence of such a trade-off, but it does question whether it is very sharp and whether it can be muted by policy design.</p>
<p>The simple textbook view needs to be qualified in several dimensions. First, the role of taxes for economic performance cannot be settled without specifying what taxes are financing. The overall performance of the economy for a given tax burden is not the same irrespective of whether taxes finance say education or early retirement schemes. Second, and related, the overall incentive effects depend not only on the level of taxes and transfers but also on other conditions attached to the social safety net. These conditions may have important implications for the employment incentives. Thirdly, moving into the realm of market failures, public intervention may be motivated on efficiency grounds, in which case no trade-off need exists. Or to put it differently, if public intervention overcomes market failures, it may up to some point be conducive for both economic performance and equality.</p>
<p>The welfare model is often dubbed a “cradle-to-grave”-model due to the strong age dependence in when the average person benefits from and contributes to the welfare state. Since welfare arrangements for obvious reasons are biased towards the young (child care and education) and the old (pensions, old age care and health) and the financing is via taxation of income, it follows that the young and old are net-beneficiaries and the working-age group (the “middle-aged”) are the net-contributors. This is an implicit or social contract across generations. It is sometimes suggested that this arrangement is simply reshuffling resources across the average person’s life time, implying that it does not have any net effect. This is misleading for at least two reasons. If capital markets are imperfect, the social contract offers possibilities which otherwise</p>
<p>would be left unexploited. E.g. if financing of education is difficult or very expensive, some talented young may refrain from education (or their parents may be unable to finance it), which implies that the full human capital potential in the population is not fully exploited with detrimental effects on income and growth. The implicit contract may overcome this market failure with non-trivial effects for both economic performance and (in)equality. Actually it can do more when it is front-loaded in the sense that the early in life net-benefits in present value terms matter more than later contributions and benefits, as they do empirically. It implies that the investments early in life matter more than passive support later in life, which in turn has positive effects on economic performance.</p>
<p>The reasoning above brings out the importance of decomposing public expenditures and their financing into categories, rather than looking at gross numbers when discussing how the public sector affects economic performance. At some simplification, some expenditures may be termed “active” and others “passive” depending on their effects on performance indicators like employment and income. An active expenditure would e.g. be labour market relevant education, while an early retirement scheme allowing healthy workers to retire early would be a passive scheme (but may be motivated on other grounds than economic performance). Similar, some modes of financing are less distortionary than others. The importance of these distinctions is supported by recent empirical evidence.</p>
<p>A large number of empirical studies have tried to shed light on the relation between the size of public sector and economic performance measured in terms of e.g. per capita income or growth. Despite the intensive research, this branch of the literature leaves weak support for any strong relation between the overall size of the public sector and economic growth. However, more recent work having decomposed expenditures and their financing find more clear empirical evidence. Active or productive expenditures have a positive effect on economic performance if financed by the least distortionary modes of taxation, and vice versa for passive expenditures financed by distortionary taxation. This shows why the discussion on the role of the welfare state for economic performance cannot be answered simply, but has to take into account the structure and orientation of the welfare state. The</p>
<p>empirical evidence shows that the Nordic countries not only have large public sectors, but also have a stronger orientation of their expenditures towards active spending. However, the mode of financing is not similarly aligned since e.g. property taxation contributes a relatively small share of tax revenue, despite this being one of the least distortionary modes of taxation.</p>
<p>Turning to the equity side of the welfare state, the distinction between active and passive modes carries over. Traditional (re)distribution policies may be characterized as passive since they via taxes and transfers attempt to transform a distribution of market incomes considered unfair into a more fair distribution of disposable income and thus consumption possibilities. A more active approach to redistribution would be to design education and labour market policies so as to ensure that the distribution of market incomes meets the distributional objectives.</p>
<p>The Nordic countries are known to be among the countries with the most equal distribution of disposable income. Although passive redistribution plays a role, it is often overlooked that the basis for the egalitarian outcome is created already in the labour market in the sense that the distribution of market incomes is among the most equal. Moreover, evidence shows that an equal distribution of market incomes relies on an equal distribution of qualifications. This points to the importance of education in its broad sense as being important for equality. An equal distribution of income requires a relatively equal distribution of qualifications. Education possibilities may be constrained by both financial and social factors. Public education can overcome both and in this way contribute not only to more human capital but also to a more equal distribution of qualifications and thus income. While passive redistribution puts the public budget under pressure, it is opposite for the active approach which over time reduces the number of people being unable to support themselves at a politically acceptable level.</p>
<p>The implicit or social contract encompassed in the welfare state has also a strong intragenerational link. Various elements of the social safety net ensure income in the case of events like unemployment, illness, loss of working capabilities etc. At a given movement this entails redistribution from those not being affected by these events to those being affected. However, since such events</p>
<p>may arise for all, these arrangements also constitute an insurance function. All individuals know that the social safety net and welfare services are there if they are exposed to an event reducing their ability to support themselves. This is an implicit insurance effect which has a direct positive welfare effect if agents are risk averse and have no access to other means by which to diversify such shocks. It may also be conducive to risk taking and flexibility, which in turn improves economic performance. Hence, even for the social safety net it is not possible to make a sharp distinction between effects on economic performance and equality. There is a tradition in the Nordic countries of an active orientation of the social safety net – the workline – by stressing that these arrangements are only available to individuals unable to support themselves and by including various employment conditionalities (requirements on active job-search, participation in activation programmes etc.). This is a contributory factor in explaining why the labour force is so large and employment rates are so high in the Nordic countries, despite a relatively generous social safety net. The flipside is that such programmes are resource demanding.</p>
<p>The Nordic comparative position with respect to both economic performance and inequality reflects thus policy designs. Underlying this are several factors. One is that an extended welfare state relies on a high employment rate. If the employment rate falls, tax revenue decreases and social expenditures increase. Therefore the model has a built-in requirement of an employment focus. Likewise, being small and open economies facing international competition has been a background factor all along.</p>
<p>The demise of the Nordic model has been predicted several times. As for Mark Twain it may be said on behalf of the Nordic welfare model that rumours on its death are widely exaggerated. The Nordic model is not crisis free, and deep economic crises are part of the history for the Nordic countries. Despite the turbulence, the model has proven resilient and stands out in international comparisons as an example of how to reconcile social objectives with a well-functioning economy. Accordingly, the Nordic countries rank in the top in most international league tables comparing country performance. Part of this is a strong legacy ingrained in institutions and policies, constituting a social and</p>
<p>political capital also making it possible to implement far reaching reforms in due time to ensure the viability of the model.</p>
<p>In a forward perspective some of the trends to be coped with are ageing, globalization and requirements to publicly provided services. These challenges are as such global and not specific to the Nordic model, and some countries face larger challenges than e.g. Sweden and Denmark, which have been front-runners in pension reforms. The quest is to find solutions in accordance with the goals of the Nordic model.</p>
<p>Ageing, as an example, is a universal challenge, and changes in pension systems (including retirement ages) are inevitable. The main driver is increasing longevity, in itself a welfare improvement. Having retirement ages increasing with longevity ensures that the balance between years contributing to and benefitting from the social contract underlying the welfare state is maintained. Reforms along those lines cannot in any meaningful way be categorised as retrenchments of the welfare state. Although there is a substantial element of healthy ageing, the changing age composition puts pressure on the health and old-age care system – two key responsibilities of the welfare state. Ageing thus induces an upward pressure on passive expenditures which may squeeze active public spending. Given the tight public finances and the upward pressure on passive expenditures, tight prioritization is called for in the future. To this end it is important to clarify which public sector activities may support productivity, employment possibilities and thus competitiveness for the private sector. This also brings the financing of the public sector in play; are there any ways to reduce the negative incentive effects of tax financing and are there alternative modes of financing?</p>
<p>Globalization is not a new phenomenon for the Nordic countries, and the constraint to remain competitive is deeply ingrained in policies. However, it poses ongoing challenges. Globalization in combination with technological advances tends to widen the wage distribution and thus create more inequality. A major reason is an upward drift in the demand for qualifications. One response would be passive redistribution to counteract this trend, but pressure on public finances and the possible distortionary effects of such a move make this a less attractive solution. Active measures aiming at improving education along</p>
<p>both the qualitative and quantitative dimension have a different perspective. In particular, a reduction of the “residual” group not receiving any labour market relevant education may be the single most important factor in improving employment and ensuring a more equal distribution of incomes. Migration – including migrating workers – is another important aspect of globalization. Migration may introduce selection mechanisms in the implicit or social contract underlying the welfare state if immigrants tend to benefit from the system and emigrants tends to be net contributors. The empirical evidence on direct welfare driven migration is scant. However, irrespective of the motive for immigration, a large inflow of individuals with low qualifications would put the model under pressure by either challenging the distributional goals or the possibilities of maintaining a high employment level. Finally, the needs and demands to the welfare state are not static. This not only applies to changes in the labour market, but also to the service provision. The objective is to deliver welfare services of contemporary standards meeting the needs of most people. Alongside developments in society this is a moving target, most visible due to steady improvements within lifesciences which clearly have tremendous welfare effects but also tend to increase health expenditures and thus putting public finances under pressure. At the same time it may be difficult to improve productivity for some services – those intensive in human interaction like care – and they thus tend to become relatively more expensive. These developments imply a continuous debate on how to finance and produce services, including how to make the public sector more productive and efficient.</p>
