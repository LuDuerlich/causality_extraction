<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The global financial crisis which came to a head in autumn 2008 revealed weaknesses in the regulations and supervision intended to maintain financial stability. It became evident many financial institutions had excessive leverage, their capital was inadequate and of excessively poor quality to cover risks and their liquidity buffers were insufficient. The crisis triggered worldwide activity to review and tighten international standards and banking regulations. In late 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision agreed on the Third Basel Accord. Then, in 2011, the European Commission presented proposals on how the Accord should be introduced in Europe, as well as various other changes to the European regulatory framework for banks and other financial institutions. These proposals were in the form of a Directive and a Regulation (commonly known as CRD IV and CRR). After negotiations in the Council and the European Parliament, the Directive and the Regulation were finally adopted in June 2013. This report proposes the legislative amendments necessary to adapt applicable Swedish law to the legal acts thus adopted, namely Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and the Council (the Directive), and Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (CRR).</p>
<p>The legislative changes proposed as a result of the Directive involve the introduction of a new act, the Capital Buffers Act, in applicable law. This Act contains provisions requiring credit institutions and investment firms to maintain capital buffers to strengthen the financial system’s resilience to financial crises and dampen procyclicality in the financial system. The capital buffers, which are to consist of Core Tier 1 capital, are to apply over and above the Regulation’s own funds requirements and decisions on special own funds requirements. To ensure that Swedish institutions are well capitalised, and thus reduce the risk of future financial crises and the potential cost to taxpayers, the Inquiry has made the assessment that Sweden should take the opportunity to implement in Swedish law all of the capital buffers in the Directive. For the same reason, it is proposed that the provisions on the capital conservation buffer and the relevant provisions on the countercyclical capital buffer should take effect from the moment the Directive applies.</p>
<p>The size of the capital requirements will vary depending on the existence of cyclical and structural systemic risks in the financial system. This means that some of the capital requirements will vary over time, while others will vary as a result of the structural conditions within the financial system. Capital requirements may also vary between institutions depending on where their exposures lie.</p>
<p>Unlike other buffers, the capital requirement that follows from the capital conservation buffer  is a permanent addition of 2.5 per cent of an institution’s total risk-weighted exposure amounts that will apply to all credit institutions and at least the larger investment companies. The countercyclical capital buffer  is applied to address the build-up of systemic risk associated with excessive credit growth in the country and will thus vary over time. The countercyclical capital buffer should also apply to all credit institutions and at least the larger investment companies.</p>
<p>The new Act also includes  capital buffers for systemically important institutions , which will apply to institutions designated as systemically important. The size of this capital requirement depends on whether a systemically important institution operates globally or not. For a global systemically important institution, the buffer should be between 1 and 3.5 per cent of its  risk-weighted  exposure amounts. Other systemically important institutions may be subject to a capital requirement of up to 2 per cent.</p>
<p>Finally, the new Act proposes a possibility of applying a systemic risk buffer  to offset structural systemic risk that may have serious consequences for the stability of the financial system and the real economy. The size of the systemic risk buffer will vary depending on the exposures it is to apply to, among other things.</p>
<p>The capital buffers are to be combined into a single combined buffer requirement . If an institution is subject to a systemic risk buffer that is applied to exposures in another country, as well as a capital buffer for systemically important institutions, only the highest of these buffers is included in the calculation of the combined buffer requirement.</p>
<p>The Act contains specific provisions for action in the event that an institution fails to meet the combined buffer requirement. The ability to take action in the event of failure to comply with the combined buffer requirement is more limited than in the case of an institution failing to meet the funds requirement under the CRR.</p>
<h2>Choice of authority to decide on capital buffers</h2>
<p>The Inquiry also presents proposals on which competent authority should be appointed to determine the countercyclical capital buffer at national level. The Inquiry, which was required to base its work on the proposals of the Financial Crisis Committee regarding a structure for macro-prudential supervision in Sweden, believes that this task should be assigned to the Riksbank (Swedish central bank). However, the Riksbank is to make its decision following consultation with Finansinspektionen (the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority). On the other hand, in accordance with the conditions specified in the Directive and after consultation with Riksbanken, Finansinspektionen should decide on the systemic risk buffer, manage the regulations on capital buffers for systemically important institutions and be responsible for macro-prudential supervisory measures that may be taken under the CRR.</p>
<h2>New requirements on institutions’ corporate governance</h2>
<p>The proposed adjustments to applicable law mean that new agency regulations should be issued to improve the institutions’ risk monitoring. The proposals involve restrictions on the number of directorships a director may hold simultaneously and require institutions to establish a risk committee and independent risk control.</p>
<h2>Rules governing remuneration</h2>
<p>The proposals presented demand qualified majority decisions at the general meeting of shareholders when deciding on variable remuneration for executive management and others that exceeds their fixed remuneration. However, the variable remuneration may not be more than twice the fixed remuneration.</p>
<h2>Supervision</h2>
<p>The proposals involve new requirements on supervision by Finansinspektionen which require it to evaluate the risks that an institution poses to the financial system, in addition to the risks to which the institutions themselves are exposed. Furthermore, adjustments to the regulations on supervisory responsibility for branches of credit institutions established in other Member States are proposed.</p>
<h2>Penalties, etc.</h2>
<p>It is proposed that Finansinspektionen be given the right to take action, by making an order or decision on special own funds requirements, against institutions that do not follow the applicable regulations if they are likely to violate the regulations within twelve months.</p>
<p>It is further proposed that Finansinspektionen be given the possibility of deciding on higher penalty fees than previously. Under applicable law, such a fee may not exceed SEK 50 million, but according to the proposal, Finansinspektionen will be given the possibility of deciding on a penalty amounting to 10 per cent of an institution’s annual turnover. Finansinspektionen will also have the right to set the fee at twice the sum of the profit gained from the infringement or twice the sum of the costs avoided.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the proposals introduce a possibility of imposing on the institution’s board members and managing director a penalty fee for the infringement that the institution has committed if he or she is responsible for the infringement. The fee charged to a natural person may not exceed EUR 5 million, or twice the sum of the profit gained from the infringement, or twice the sum of the costs avoided by the person in question as a result of the infringement.</p>
<h2>Protection for whistleblowers</h2>
<p>The proposals will require both institutions and Finansinspektionen to implement appropriate systems for dealing with reports of suspected infringements by the financial institution (‘whistleblowing systems’).</p>
<p>The institution in question and Finansinspektionen are to afford people who choose to report suspected irregularities absolute secrecy protection with regard to information that may reveal their identity.</p>
<h2>Legislative amendments in connection with the EU’s new Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR)</h2>
<p>The CRR contains a number of provisions previously found in various EU directives which have already been implemented in Swedish law. The fact that the provisions are now contained in an EU regulation that is directly applicable in EU Member States means that, from</p>
<p>Sweden’s point of view, the Capital Adequacy and Large Exposures Act (2006:1371) must be repealed and a large number of consequential amendments made to other acts. The parts of the Capital Adequacy Act that are nevertheless to remain in force are to be transferred to a new act, the Supervision of Credit and Investment Institutions Act.</p>
<h2>Special procedure for processing penalty cases</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has also analysed and considered whether there is a need to introduce a special procedure for processing penalty cases. In this respect, the Inquiry proposes that Finansinspektionen should retain the right to impose penalties on financial companies and their managements.</p>
