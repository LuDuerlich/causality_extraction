<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The task of the Inquiry was to map and analyse existing quality of life measures, as well as to propose measures for quality of life development in Swedish society. The proposed quality of life measures were to supplement GDP and other traditional welfare measures to allow broader illustration of societal development based on economic, social, environmental and subjective perspectives, among others. The remit also included proposing a method for compiling and reporting existing and any new measures.</p>
<p>Quality of life measures that could form a basis for political decisions should depend on circumstances related to the decisions. If these circumstances change for the better or for the worse the quality of life measures must be able to indicate this to a corresponding degree.</p>
<p>Fundamental criteria for indicators used to assess quality of life include:  being well supported by current research,  being in line with Swedish and international recommendations,  enabling analysis of distributions and differences between social groups,  being able to present change over time, and  being relevant as a basis for policy.</p>
<p>A quality of life measure refers to the current situation and how it has changed in the preceding years. Collecting data at individual level makes it possible to investigate and report the distribution of quality of life in the population, the extent to which it varies between population groups and whether problematical circumstances are concentrated to specific groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretations of quality of life</h2>
<p>There are four main interpretations of what quality of life entails that recur in the scientific literature and in international work in this field. These are quality of life as affluence, happiness, meaningfulness and freedom of action.</p>
<h2>Quality of life as affluence</h2>
<p>Affluence or standard of living is an important component of the conditions under which people live. Material conditions may be assumed to be of particular importance in communities where the economic standard is low, but appear to be an insufficient foundation for determining quality of life when individuals have reached a level where other improvements in conditions of life seem more important. The fact that income, or more generally scope for consumption, is an incomplete measure of welfare in a society such as Sweden should not, however, result in ignoring the major significance of economic resources for different aspects of human welfare, such as health, housing standard and leisure activities.</p>
<h2>Quality of life as happiness</h2>
<p>In the research on happiness many authors differentiate between emotional or affective well-being and life satisfaction, where wellbeing refers to an immediate and momentary state, while life satisfaction refers to a more considered assessment of how life has turned out.</p>
<p>Well-being is usually measured either as a direct question about how happy a person is or as the proportion of time in a day when negative feelings are more apparent than positive. Life satisfaction is measured with questions on how satisfied people are with their lives.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether happiness is measured as well-being or life satisfaction, fairly small differences between different population groups are found.</p>
<p>Differences between countries in average life satisfaction clearly covary with GDP per capita, and the same applies to crossectional data for the relation between life satisfaction and income at individual level. Despite this, over time it is found that in most industrialised countries there is no change in either average life satisfaction or well-being, despite the fact that GDP per capita and average income have changed considerably. All in all, the results indicate that neither average life satisfaction nor happiness tend to change in the developed industrialised countries, probably mainly because individuals tend to adapt their subjective assessment to the circumstances they are experiencing at the time.</p>
<p>The fact that average happiness in the population cannot be expected to change over time means that happiness cannot either be expected to vary with changed social conditions. Thus happiness is not an appropriate measure of life quality for official use, even more so as political measures should aim to influence conditions in society and not people’s consciousness.</p>
<h2>Quality of life as meaningfulness</h2>
<p>Living a meaningful life is interpreted in the psychological literature as living in accordance with human nature and there are a number of attempts to measure quality of life in this sense. In many cases reference is made to Aristotle’s concept of eudaimonia, which can perhaps be said to mean living well and doing good. Even if the separate scales have been given different names they can be collectively entered under the term Eudaimonic Well-Being.</p>
<p>To achieve quality of life in the form of meaningfulness humans need to live in accordance with their true self and their true nature. Everything that gives momentary satisfaction (affective well-being) does not need to be compatible with this, which means that quality of life as happiness is not identical with quality of life as meaningfulness. Empirical measures of happiness and meaningfulness tend, however, to be highly correlated. As meaningfulness has been operationalised it is closely associated with mental health.</p>
<p>Just as for happiness, quality of life as meaningfulness cannot usually be expected to vary over time. It follows from this that quality of life interpreted as meaningfulness cannot either be expected to vary in connection with political measures. Thus, all in all, meaningfulness is not an appropriate official measure of quality of life either.</p>
<h2>Quality of life as freedom of action</h2>
<p>Quality of life as freedom of action refers to the extent to which people have resources to direct their lives according to their own values and wishes. This approach largely underlies the Nordic tradition of welfare measurement. It has since attracted major attention internationally with reference to the Stiglitz report, which was to propose measures of quality of life to complement GDP per capita.</p>
<p>The freedom of action of individuals – the extent to which they can direct their lives at their own discretion – depends on the resources they have at their disposal and the surrounding environment. Together they determine what individuals can achieve. For an overall determination of individuals’ quality of life in a country it is only possible to define a limited set of components in the form of resources and outcomes. The same conditions recur in component lists from different countries, which may be interpreted to mean that on the whole there is agreement as to the most important aspects. These lists provide a basis for descriptions of citizens’ freedom of action. Using freedom of action as a basis thus leads to the measurement of quality of life in terms of a number of central conditions of life, similar to the way in which it has long been decided to describe welfare in society.</p>
<p>In summary, we find that quality of life as freedom of action provides measures that can be expected to change if individuals’ conditions change for the better or worse and that this interpretation can provide a basis for assessing how society is developing in terms of quality of life. If the degree of freedom of action is measured on the basis of a number of components, the approach will be comparable to what is currently done internationally and this also means that people’s living conditions will be described in a way that relates to earlier Nordic welfare statistics. The degree of freedom of action expresses the degree to which individuals can achieve a life that is desirable to them.</p>
<h2>Ten quality of life components</h2>
<p>Based on the interpretation of quality of life as freedom of action, we propose that quality of life from an official perspective should be measured and reported using indicators for the following ten components: 10.Living environment.</p>
<p>The components have relatively low mutual correlations, which means that quality of life cannot be assumed to be a uniform expression of an underlying dimension. From this it follows that quality of life should not be summarised in one single measure.</p>
<p>Measures of quality of life should as far as possible be based on citizens’ circumstances rather than the supply of social services. For example, the aim should be to measure citizens’ health rather than the number of visits to the doctor, as a low number of visits may be due to the overall health of the population, but could also be due to many people not consulting doctors for some reason despite health problems. Similarly, a measure of security should for the same reason refer to citizens’ exposure to crime rather than the number of police officers.</p>
<p>Indicators should depend as little as possible on a varying tendency of people to take action for the same problem. For example, one should ask whether individuals have been exposed to violence and not be satisfied with looking at the number of reports to the police. We propose indicators for all the ten components that together can constitute a basis for a report on the quality of life in Sweden. In addition, the data we propose should be collected will enable more in-depth studies.</p>
<h2>Selection and data collection</h2>
<p>A measure of quality of life in Sweden should primarily refer to the situation of the adult population, in other words everyone aged 18 and over living in Sweden should be included in the material. Children could possibly be the subject of a separate survey, but should not be included in the measure outlined here, since many of the questions put to adults are not meaningful when put to children.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that a quality of life report should be submitted every fourth year in which interview data, supplementary register data and global indicators are included as reference. Apart from being presented as averages, dispersions and associations, the results should be compiled by gender, age groups, social classes, regions and a breakdown by length of stay in the country. It would also be of value to obtain data on foreign-born individuals by country of origin, broken down into a number of regions.</p>
<p>The Inquiry further proposes that an overall presentation of register data and global indicators should be compiled in the years when no main report is published. This report should be descriptive and published in a simple fact sheet and online.</p>
<h2>A separate and better adapted Living Conditions Survey (ULF)</h2>
<p>To enable the Swedish Living Conditions Survey (ULF) to have the design and scope required for a comprehensive account of quality of life in Sweden, the Inquiry considers that the ULF and EU-SILC surveys should be carried out separately. We consequently propose that Statistics Sweden conducts the EU-SILC in accordance with Eurostat's instructions, while the questionnaire for ULF is extended with all the necessary questions to make it possible to create all the indicators required for detailed quality of life reporting.</p>
<p>Statistics Sweden should collect the data for ULF annually with a net sample of 5 000 interviews to form a basis for reports to be published every fourth year.</p>
<p>The overall responsibility for the work of compiling and reporting data on quality of life in Sweden should be given to Statistics Sweden in cooperation with a research institution and agencies responsible for the policy areas concerned.</p>
<p>It is essential that the material collected is retained and used for research and production of statistics so that the investment made can continue to give a return in the form of knowledge and deeper understanding of quality of life in Sweden.</p>
<p>An enabling condition for data as described above to be collected and processed is that they are dealt with in compliance with laws that regulate the use of sensitive personal data.</p>
