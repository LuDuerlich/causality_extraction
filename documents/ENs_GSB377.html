<h1>Summary and conclusions</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Further developing international military testing and training in Sweden:</p>
<p>• is fully compatible with Sweden’s security policy and promotes Swedish interests;</p>
<p>• responds to documented inquiries from a number of countries;</p>
<p>• makes Sweden visible as an active and loyal contributor to international crisis management and  peace-keeping;</p>
<p>• contributes to a cost efficient improvement of the Defence Forces’ international capabilities, their knowledge and skills as well as the operational capability for joint action in peacekeeping operations (i.e. interoperability);</p>
<p>• strengthens Sweden’s role in European cooperation on defence equipment and creates possibilities for Swedish defence industry to develop and market Swedish defence materiel, with, as appropriate, support from the Defence Materiel Administration and the Defence Forces;</p>
<p>• creates possibilities for tactical and operational evaluation of military units by making educational facilities and training grounds available, primarily for EU  peace-keeping and crisis managment forces;</p>
<p>• does not require changes in the existing legal framework or major revision of existing administrative procedures or responsibilities. Governmental permission for conducting training exrcises with military units should be based on the same criteria that apply to exports of armaments from Sweden. Developing the Defence Materiel Administration’s activities in the field is possible with in the existing framework and procedures;</p>
<p>• Would, however, be substantially simplified by adopting the legal framework for regulating the status of foreign forces suggested by the Special Inquiry on  peace-keeping cooperation with other countries, the so called PFP-inquiry (SOU 2003:117);</p>
<p>• Would benefit from special and differential treatment of countries where the goals and principles of Swedish foreign policy do not act as an impediment and with which Sweden shares common values, i.e, in the first instance the Nordic Countries, Member States of the European Union and the traditionally neutral countries of Europe. As appropriate longterm agreements could be envisaged;</p>
<p>• should be underpinned by clear and consistent political support at the highest level and active international marketing efforts, in particular  vis-à-vis European partners. In order to maximize efficiency, the marketing efforts should be made in close cooperation between the Defence Materiel Administration, the Defence Forces, the Government Offices and the defence industry, e.g. under the leadership of the Government’s special coordinator for exports of defence equipment;</p>
<p>• would be facilitated by the creation of a reference group where interested parties, notably the Government Offices, the Defence Forces, the defence industry, the Defence Materiel Administration could consult and streamline decision making. This Group can usefully be modelled on the present Coordination and Reference Groups for Defence Equipment Exports (KRG). Representatives from the region should be attached to the reference group in an appropriate fashion;</p>
<p>• would, in particular for the Defence Materiel Administration, be facilitated by a pricing model which is more flexible than the present principle of full recuperation of costs. Cost recuperation should of course be sought, but should be seen in a broader perspective and be achieved over time;</p>
<p>• has positive implications for growth and employment, but it is not at present possible to translate them into concrete figures. Data from local authorities clearly show that there are positive economic effects;</p>
<p>• can, for certain activities, easily be accomodated within existing environmental concessions or those currently being processed, for other activities there may be some scope;</p>
<p>• concerns primarily the northern part of Sweden where the combination of large, scarcely populated areas, the climate and existing military infrastructure creates partly unique conditions for military testing and training.  Cost-efficient development is considerably facilitated by the existing military training facilities and infrastructure in the area;</p>
<p>• would benefit from the establishment of a reference group to further develop the concept ”Test Region North”. The group should speedily be constituted so as to identify the obvious synergies that exist between the different test clusters that exist or are under discussion in the region: military testing and training, civilian testing in the automotive industry, tests of railway equipment, and the activities of the Swedish Space Corporation at the rocket launch site at Esrange. The Governor of the Province of Norbotten should be entrusted with forming and leading the group. The Government should allocate seed money for a three year period so that the group can start its work quickly and efficiently;</p>
<p>• might entail greater utilization of facilities that are currently  moth-balled or severely underutilized (e.g. Jokkmokk, Gunnarn, the artillery range in Älvsbyn), and could in the NBC-area lead to greater usage of the combined resources of the the Defence Research Establishment (FOI) and the Army’s NBC unit (Skyddscentrum) and lead to a significantly higher occupancy rate at the high-tech Dynamic Flight Simulator in Linköping.</p>
