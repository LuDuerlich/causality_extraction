<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The overall task in accordance with the directives given to the Government Commission is to map out and evaluate the application of the current regulations on the handling of trade union fees and fees paid to employers’ organisations from a fiscal point of view. The different systems of rules shall be compared with special emphasis on whether or not the application means that employees’ and employers’ fees for membership in their respective organisations are treated on an equal basis from the fiscal point of view. If an analysis shows that the treatment from this point of view is not uniform, the Commission shall make proposals on changes of the systems of rules in order to achieve a fair and uniform treatment of the fees to the respective organisational activity.</p>
<p>The directives specially emphasise the importance of achieving uniformity of the treatment of the membership fees from a fiscal point of view. According to current fiscal legislation, the basic principle is that the trade union fee constitutes a non-deductible private cost of living, whereas the fee paid to an employers’ organisation is deductible to the extent it is related to conflict purposes.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission shall show to what extent the employers’ organisations take advantage of the possibility to establish special service companies and analyse the consequences of this in the light of the fact that there is no corresponding possibility for the trade unions.</p>
<h2>The trade union fee</h2>
<p>The results of questionnaire surveys made by the Commission show that the average trade union member fee, including the fee to the Unemployment Benefit Fund, amounts to SEK 271 per month for the unions belonging to the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (LO). For the unions belonging to the Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees (TCO), the corresponding amount is SEK 211 and for the associations belonging to the Swedish Confederation of Professional</p>
<p>Associations (SACO) SEK 235. If the fee to the Unemployment Benefit Fund is not included, the average trade union membership fee for the LO-unions amounts to SEK 188 per month, for the TCO-unions SEK 146, and for the SACO-unions SEK 166.</p>
<h2>The fee to the Unemployment Benefit Fund</h2>
<p>The average membership fee to the Unemployment Benefit Fund is SEK 88 per month for union members and SEK 94 for individually associated members.</p>
<p>Today, the co-operation between the Unemployment Benefit Funds and the trade unions is primarily manifested by the fact that the membership fee paid by an employee also includes the fee to the Unemployment Benefit Fund. The trade union then transfers this fee to the Fund.</p>
<h2>The fee to Employers’ Organisations</h2>
<p>The membership fee to an Employers’ Organisation is usually calculated on the basis of a certain percentage share of the member companies’ total wage/salary amount, in some cases combined with a fixed part of the fee. Companies who are members of SAF (The Swedish Employers’ Confederation) pay about 0.25 per cent of the total salary/wage amount as membership fee to SAF and its own association.</p>
<p>Most of the associations on the Employer side have formed service companies that are tied to the respective association activity. The major part, i.e. between 90 and 95 per cent of the total membership fee, is paid to the service companies and, thus, constitutes a deductible operational cost in the respective service company. The remaining, non-deductible part of the membership fee covers the actual activity of the association.</p>
<h2>The proposals</h2>
<p>The Trade Union Fee</p>
<p>The Commission has mapped out the activity carried out by the trade unions. Of the fee that the members pay to their trade union, it is estimated that 62 per cent is used for general trade union work, i.e. work that should be considered to be an activity which – if it had been</p>
<p>carried out by an association on the Employer side – would have been assigned to a service company and which, consequently, would have been deductible service costs (operative expenses in a company).</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the part of the fee that is related to general trade union work, i.e. 62 per cent of the fee excluding the fee to the Unemployment Benefit Fund, shall entitle to a tax reduction. With a calculated tax-rate of 40 per cent the result is a tax reduction of about 25 per cent of the total fee the member has paid to his union during the tax year.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that a tax relief should be introduced as regards fee paid to an Unemployment Benefit Fund in the form of a tax reduction of 40 per cent of the total fee that has been paid to an Unemployment Benefit Fund during the tax year.</p>
<p>Obligation to submit a statement of salary/wages received</p>
<p>An obligation to submit a statement of salary/wages received is proposed for trade unions and Unemployment Benefit Funds. These organisations shall provide the tax authority with a statement showing the fees that a member has paid during the tax year.</p>
<p>The part of the membership fee to an employer organisation that is allocated to a conflict fund today entitles the respective employer organisation to a deduction on the basis of a clearly stated regulation in the Income Tax Act. In addition to this, and in most cases, the employer actually already has a right to make deduction for the major part of the fee to its employer organisation through the existence of service companies. The Commission proposes no change as regards these rules.</p>
<p>The conflict compensation</p>
<p>Nor does the Commission propose any change from the fiscal point of view, when it comes to the treatment of the conflict compensation granted.</p>
<p>The Commission does not propose that the share of the trade unions’ activity costs allocated to conflict funds should be subject to any tax reduction corresponding to the Employers’ right of deduction for allocation related to conflict purposes.</p>
<p>Consequences of the proposals and their financing</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposal on a tax reduction amounting to 25 per cent of the trade union fee is estimated to cause a state financial cost of SEK 1.62 Billion. The cost of the proposal on a tax reduction amounting to 40 per cent of the fee to an Unemployment Benefit Fund is estimated to be SEK 1.39 Billion.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the declined revenue from taxation should be financed through an increase of the general payroll fee included in the employers’ social security contributions amounting to 0.70 percentage units. Such an increase, i.e. from 3.09 to 3.79 percentage units, gives an estimated permanent budget strengthening of SEK 3 Billion.</p>
