<p>The Commission’s task</p>
<p>At the behest of the Swedish Government, the task of the Commission on Managing and Financing the Defence is to assess and evaluate the forms of governance and financing for Sweden’s military defence. The review covers the Swedish Armed Forces and the other central defence agencies, i.e. the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration, the National Service Administration, the Swedish National Defence College, the Swedish Defence Research Agency, the National Defence Radio Institute and the National Fortifications Administration. The Commission focuses, according to its directives, on how to improve the governance and monito- ring exercised by the Riksdag and the Government. The internal management of the Swedish Armed Forces and the use of the pur- chaser-provider-model are also discussed. The Commission sub- mits improvement proposals based on the results of its assessment. The commission has been authorized upon the request of the Riksdag.</p>
<p>The Commission’s points of departure</p>
<p>Compared to many other central government activities, those of Armed Forces are very varied, extensive and complex. They are of outmost importance for guaranteeing the sovereignty and democ- racy of Sweden.</p>
<p>The Armed Forces are undergoing an extremely radical transi- tion from defence against invasion to an operational defence force. This places particular demands on governance. The Commission feels, however, that there is sufficient room for necessary impro- vements in the forms of defence governance within the framework of the Swedish public administration model.</p>
<p>The forms of governance are to be well suited to their purpose so as to maximise the impact of defence-related decisions taken by the Riksdag and the Government. The Riksdag shall be able to exercise its financial power regarding defence issues, as it is able to do within other areas. Within a clearly set framework, the appro- priate pre-conditions should be created for the Swedish Armed Forces to be able to supply the type of defence ordered by the Riksdag and the Government. The Swedish Armed Forces and other central defence agencies must therefore not only be governed individually but also jointly as a sector.</p>
<p>The problems associated with defence governance have been highlighted many times in recent years in different contexts inclu- ding by the the standing committeeCommission on Defence of the Riksdag, government audit bodies, government commissions and the Swedish Defence Research Agency. The conclusions reached by the Commission in its assessment do not essentially change the problem scenario that has emerged.</p>
<p>The Commission’s assessment</p>
<p>Defence governance exercised by the Riksdag</p>
<p>Parliamentary governance by the Riksdag is a form of performance management that allows the Government and the Armed Forces considerable freedom to choose the means by which they imple- ment the defence-related decisions of the Riksdag within essenti- ally one single economic and organisational framework.</p>
<p>The goals set by the Riksdag for the defence sector are specific objectives to guide the Government and the defence agencies as to which activities are to be pursued. It is difficult to determine whether these goals have been achieved. The reason for this is that the armed forces basically develop military units that stand in rea- diness and are not used for their actual purpose and therefore don’t give rise to any direct effects.</p>
<p>The Commission’s opinion is that it is possible to formulate monitorable demands on operative capability (defence effect). This would necessitate a more precise definition of operative capability, however. Evaluations of this must be performed. Solely using simple key indicators cannot monitor goal achievement.</p>
<p>The Riksdag needs background data that will enable it to follow the relationship between threat or crisis scenarios, required defence capability, the need for combat units and the costs involved. Such background data is currently unavailable to the Riksdag.</p>
<p>It must also be possible to present the realistic costs involved in running an operational defence force, i.e. mechanised battalions, anti-aircraft battalions, surface combat vessels, JAS 39 squadrons, etc. Neither the Government nor the Armed Forces are currently able to submit well-founded estimates of how much a specified operational defence force will cost. The Commission feels, howe- ver, that the situation is beginning to change for the better with the introduction of the Armed Forces’ new financial management system, which facilitates estimates of operational unit costs.</p>
<p>An appropriations structure that corresponds to an organisatio- nal structure based on operative capability would provide the Riksdag with greater scope for governance. The Riksdag would then be able to exert direct influence when the requirements for operative capability are being considered. Regarding the issue of whether the Riksdag should decide on individual procurements of defence materiel, the Commission feels that the information recei- ved by the Riksdag, as a result of the detailed presentation in the Government’s budget bill, is sufficiently comprehensive to allow the Riksdag to exert the necessary influence over materiel procu- rements and thereby exerting its financial power.</p>
<p>The Riksdag decides on the basic organizational structure of the armed forces, i.e. its regiments, aircraft wings, schools, centres, etc., thereby limiting the scope of the Government and the Armed Forces to decommission or relocate a unit without parliamentary approval. The Government must have the consent of the Riksdag to undertake any changes in that structure. The day-to-day gover- nance of the defence organisation is left to the Government.</p>
<p>The lack of coherence between defence and budget bills has pre- viously been a problem. The new system, whereby regular defence policy decisions are no longer taken by the Riksdag but are now part of the annual budget process, has solved this problem. The budget bill needs to be reformulated, however, so that it ties together long-term objectives with annual activities. Results, goal analyses and resource utilisation can also be presented to the Riksdag as part of a special communication, which could also give the Riksdag an overview of the activities conducted by the other central defence agencies.</p>
<p>Monitoring the performance of the defence sector is relatively easy regarding the number of operational combat unitsset up and the total costs involved but more difficult when it comes to measu- ring the quality attained by the units. No evaluations are performed by independent actors (i.e. not from within the Armed Forces). European cooperation provides new scope for assessment within the military field, however, enabling Swedish units involved in international duties to be more easily evaluated.</p>
<p>Defence governance exercised by the Government</p>
<p>The governance exercised by the Government focuses almost enti- rely on the Armed Forces, which in turn governs the other defence agencies by allocating them tasks. Governance exercised by the Government of the other defence agencies manifests itself mainly by means of ‘owner governance’ (i.e. the governance of agency efficiency and organisation).</p>
<p>No other policy area is as comprehensively planned as defence. This planning involves assessment and analysis of both political and military actions. Politicians and military personnel must meet and have a dialogue on these issues in order to formulate proposals. The Government and the Ministry of Defence have to play a more active role in the planning process.</p>
<p>The large number of objectives set down in the appropriations directions given to the Armed Forces and other central defence agencies means that the agencies themselves must decide how to balance all the objectives and priorities. Instead of improving governance, this weakens it.</p>
<p>The Government also defines appropriation items and maximum amounts for various purposes, large and small. Governance is however less detailed regarding actions to be taken to achieve ope- rational goals, apart from for intelligence and peace-promotion operations. On a number of occasions, the Government has altered the conditions on which the Armed Forces bases its planning by capping expenditure and reducing appropriations, which has led to consequences in the form of delays and price increases in conjunc- tion with the delivery of materiel.</p>
<p>The Government doesn’t instruct the operational force to do anything other than what the Riksdag has decided on, apart from decisions relating to levels of preparedness and materiel.</p>
<p>Governance is now increasingly focused on specifying combat units and levels of preparedness. The Commission still feels, howe- ver, that the Armed Forces has considerable scope for making its own assessments of military unit design.</p>
<p>The Government demands a large amount of information from the defence agencies. It is difficult for the Government to adopt positions on the information submitted. Evaluations make up only a small part of reporting requirements. There are several shortco- mings in the way the reporting requirements are formulated, howe- ver.</p>
<p>Internal management exercised by the Swedish Armed Forces</p>
<p>The use of the internal debiting system within the Armed Forces has provided benefits in the form of more time to tackle core acti- vities and better quality maintenance services. On the other hand, it conflicts with the centralised management system. Incentives for cost-efficiency are thereby removed. The control exercised by the Armed Forces Headquarters over its logistics arm, Armed Forces Logistics (FMLOG), and the military units is also partly flawed and unclear. This concerns not only the ground rules but also accountability and the chain of management.</p>
<p>The planning process in the internal debiting system is both complex and resource-demanding, allowing little leeway for evalu- ation. The principles applied for pricing and over-capacity at FMLOG contribute to the non-fulfilment of the aims of the inter- nal debiting system.</p>
<p>There is also a lack of economic perspective on the units, which affects the scope for linking activities and finances. This results in unit commanders not being held sufficiently accountable.</p>
<p>The Purchaser-Provider relation between the Armed Forces and the other defence agencies</p>
<p>The Purchaser-Provider model has come in for harsh criticism, but the Commission has not found a better model of governing the support to the Armed Forces provided by the other defence agen- cies.</p>
<p>A closer review of the various support agency services indicates that the existing distribution of appropriations and fees is basically appropriate In order to realise the aims of the purchaser-provider model the basic principle should however be that the end-user of</p>
<p>the service should also be the one who orders and pays for it. However some adjustments have to be made regarding the finan- cing of the National Service Agency’s enrolment and enlistment activities and of the international operations at the Swedish Defence Research Agency.</p>
<p>Persevering with the Purchaser-Provider model brings added significance to the purchasing skills of the Armed Forces. These have in some respects improved in recent years, but the problem of high internal personnel mobility still remains unsolved. Neither does the Armed Forces carry out any systematic evaluation of the services provided by the support agencies.</p>
<p>The Armed Forces is well placed to be able to control the price and resource consumption of a service, but seldom does so. The Commission’s assessment is that it is important to pursue a discus- sion about prices and resource consumption when a purchase is made.</p>
<p>The purchasing processes between the Armed Forces and the support agencies are sometimes not adjusted to suit the complexity of the various services, i.e. the process is complicated even if the service is simple. Materiel purchases are one such example. There is therefore reason to review the purchasing processes.</p>
<p>Coordination agreements drawn up between purchasers and providers help to formalise the purchasing process. There is, howe- ver, no mention of how the tasks are distributed among the agen- cies regarding quality assurance, evaluation and reporting.</p>
<p>Defence governance in other countries</p>
<p>The Commission’s comparative study of defence governance in Denmark, Finland, Norway and the UK has produced a few gene- ral conclusions.</p>
<p>Effective governance demands understanding and consensus in defence issues at an early stage. It also requires clearly formulated goals and a common understanding of what these entail as well as efficient monitoring and financial control systems. Closer coope- ration between military and civilian personnel when preparing deci- sion supporting documents results in better understood and more effective defence decisions.</p>
<p>Overall analysis of governance in the defence sector</p>
<p>There are good reasons for a discussion of the governance of the defence sector as a whole. The Commission discusses both the chain of governance (the Riksdag-Government-the Armed Forces- central defence agencies) and the Government’s integrated gover- nance of the sector as a whole.</p>
<p>Possibilities for the Riksdag to govern and control defence poli- cies and the Armed Forces have been weakened in several respects. Goal achievement cannot be monitored, resource allocation and costs are not reported in ways relevant to policy goals and imple- mentation.</p>
<p>The Purchaser-Provider model involves delegating decision- making regarding the type and scope of services and goods the Armed Forces should purchase from other defence agencies in order to achieve its goals. The Armed Forces themselves cannot hold them accountable, however, other than via the requirements specified in the purchase orders.</p>
<p>This financing option and the wording of instructions given to central agencies allows and stimulates the support agencies to turn to customers outside the defence if orders from the Armed Forces decrease.</p>
<p>According to the Commission, the Government should exercise a more integrated governance of the defence sector. The Government should consider what functions the agencies shall have and in what areas they shall operate. The responsibility for securing long-term planning in the various agencies also lies with the Government, especially when savings are to be made.</p>
<p>The transition the defence is undergoing places particular demands on the Government to be clear on what has to be done and who is responsible. It also places demands on the communica- tion between the Riksdag, the Government and the personnel and management of the central defence agencies.</p>
<p>Defence governance is also influenced by cultural differences between the political and military sphere. To overcome cultural differences politicians and militaries have to communicate extensi- vely in order to come to an understanding of the competences and work conditions of both parties.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposals</p>
<p>The Commission’s point of departure is to keep within the frame- work of the Swedish public administration model.</p>
<p>Governance exercised by the Riksdag</p>
<p>The goals should on the other hand be sufficiently clearly defined so that an assessment can be made as to whether or not they have been achieved. Regarding operative preparedness capability, the Government should also report the status of the operational force and its state of preparedness.</p>
<p>Prior to new operative capabilities being formulated in a way that enables them to be monitored and evaluated, the Riksdag should in future decide on the operational force. The Commission proposes that the Riksdag should decide on the main features of the operational force, i.e. type and approximate number of units.</p>
<p>The Commission has not found grounds for altering the basic forms of financing the defence sector. The two appropriations placed at the disposal of the Government should be retained. The Riksdag should also decide on appropriations to the basic consc- ription at the National Service Administration and defence reserach carried out by the Swedish National Defence College and the Swedish Defence Research Agency. The Riksdag should also state an appropriate balance of resources going into national defence and international operations. Furthermore, the Riksdag should conti- nue to authorise the Government and the Armed Forces to pur- chase defence materiel. The Riksdag’s decisions on frameworks, the upward and downward adjustment of scope and appropriations should also be made simpler and more transparent.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that that the Government at first opportunity proposes to the Riksdag clear principles for when the Riksdag and the Government is to decide on the basic organisatio- nal structure of the Armed Forces.</p>
<p>There are shortfalls in the decision supporting documents sup- plied to the Riksdag by the Government. The Commission there- fore proposes that the Government submit an annual ‘scorecard’, in the form of a consolidated report for the defence agencies which provides as well an overall picture of the entire military defence sector and its aggregated results as accounts for each individual</p>
<p>agency. The budget bill should also be shortened and focus on information that is relevant to parliamentary decisions. Separate defence bills should only be put before the Riksdag when impor- tant policy decisions are to be taken.</p>
<p>Governance exercised by the Government</p>
<p>The Government’s governance and monitoring must be strengthe- ned. The Commission therefore proposes that a coordinating body be established for the defence sector, chaired by the State Secretary at the Ministry of Defence and including the supreme commander of the Armed Forces and directors-general of the defence agencies. Owner governance issues should also be given a prominent place in the activities of the Ministry and a chief administration officer should be appointed. There should also be a unit within the Ministry of Defence that is given the responsibility and resources to carry out evaluations. Efficient financial accounting is required in order for the Government to be able to exercise control over the defence sector.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of the Commission that defence planning sho- uld be coordinated by the Ministry of Defence. The analysis, plan- ning and control capabilities of the Ministry should be strengthe- ned in order for it to manage this role. This can be achieved by rec- ruiting suitable personnel with the right skills to the Ministry. The threatening and conflict situations that form the basis of planning should be communicated to the Riksdag so that it can make infor- med decisions about the operational force.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the Government’s decisions on operative partial capability be supplemented by decisions on goals that are well suited to the activities pursued by the support agen- cies. In addition to this, the Government should also take decisions on concrete goals concerning, for example, military unit readiness horizons. The Government should also reduce the number of other goals, priorities, tasks and reporting requirements in relation to the defence agencies.</p>
<p>The Commission also proposes that the large number of smaller maximum amounts be replaced by statements of accounts. As regards the major restructuring problems facing the armed forces, the Commission feels that the Government should be restrictive</p>
<p>with limits and appropriation capping or put forward a budget for the armed forces containing an adequate budgeting margin.</p>
<p>The Government makes a large number of appointments within the armed forces. The Commission proposes that the Government consider allowing the Armed Forces to appoint its own chief finance officer, chief legal advisor and chief personnel officer in the future.</p>
<p>There are frequent informal contacts between the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces. These are often important. The Commission proposes that they are tightened up by directives decided by the Government or the Ministry of Defence regarding composition, tasks and debriefing times.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes the abolition of the Swedish Armed Forces Public Control Council, which has not fulfilled its intended purpose.</p>
<p>The intertwined activities of the defence agencies, created by the Purchaser-Provider model, basically make up a self-sufficient system, but this also needs to be governed. In other words, the Government must take a firmer grip of its governance and establish rules of the game for the agencies. The Commission proposes that the Government identifies the areas in which the support agencies may be active and have customers other than the Armed Forces. This would clarify the rules for both purchaser and provider.</p>
<p>Regarding governance exercised by the Riksdag, the Commission has proposed the compiling of an overall report for the armed forces. In order to paint a complete picture, the Commission proposes that the Government instruct the Armed Forces to report whether and how it has derived benefit from the services of the provider agencies. The Commission also proposes that the support agencies report key indicators relating to efficiency and cost development, which can be inserted into the annual report submitted to the Riksdag.</p>
<p>New goals need to be established for the support agencies that provide a closer link between their activities and the requirements for operative capability.</p>
<p>Internal management of the Swedish Armed Forces</p>
<p>Two different management models are currently combined within the Armed Forces. One is a centralised and detailed task oriented model and the other is an internal debiting system employing a purchaser-provider model. The two models conflict with each other in such a way that the benefits of the internal debiting system cannot as a result be fully realised. The Commission therefore pro- poses that the Armed Forces adapt its task oriented management model to enable the incentives of the internal debiting system to have an impact.</p>
<p>The Commission also proposes that military units, schools and centres be allowed to negotiate themselves with the National Fortifications Administration on their rents and premises. Combi- ned with a modified internal management style, this would provide better incentives to review efficiency of premises.</p>
<p>The internal debiting system has provided a number of benefits, but there are also shortfalls in its application. The Commission therefore proposes that the Headquarters of the Armed Forces take a firmer grip on the internal debiting system by establishing the rules of the game, roles and responsibilities that are to apply for military units, schools and centres. The Headquarters should also take over some of the controlling tasks that are currently the responsibility of FMLOG.</p>
<p>The Commission also proposes that the Government instruct the Armed Forces to perform a systematic review and examination of which maintenance activities should be pursued within the Armed Forces and which should be contracted out. This has only sporadically occurred previously.</p>
<p>The pricing principles within FMLOG have been relinquished by the Armed Forces. The handling of over-capacity and surplus and shortage is not in accordance with how the internal debiting system is intended to function. The Commission therefore proposes that the Armed Forces decommission as far as possible long-term over- capacity in FMLOG and that FMLOG be allowed to balance sur- plus and shortage in order to achieve balanced finances in a few years’ time.</p>
<p>The Commission also proposes that the planning process that takes place in connection with task oriented management be simp- lified and harmonised with the internal debiting system. The num- ber of steps and activities in the process should be reduced.</p>
<p>The Purchaser-Provider model</p>
<p>The Commission has not found an alternative model to the Pur- chaser-Provider model that would be better. The Commission the- refore assumes that the model should continue to be the funda- mental principle to base relations between defence agencies on. A number of changes need to be made, however. In order for the model to serve its purpose, the end-user of a service should be the one who orders and pays for it. The Commission therefore propo- ses that the international activities pursued by the Swedish Defence Research Agency be financed via direct appropriations to the agency. The Commission also proposes that the components of the National Service Administration’s enrolment and enlistment acti- vities, which the Armed Forces can influence, be financed by the Armed Forces.</p>
<p>The Armed Forces must have good purchasing skills for the Purchaser-Provider model to be function efficiently. The Commission proposes that the Armed Forces continue to work systematically in order to improve its purchasing skills. This can be achieved by allowing people in strategic purchasing positions to hold their positions for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>The number of steps in the purchasing process should also be reviewed in order to simplify and shorten it. The purchasing pro- cess concerning arms and supplies is an example of how the pur- chasing of straightforward services is equally long-winded as the purchasing of much more complex services.</p>
<p>Coordination agreements constitute a platform for cooperation between the Armed Forces and the other defence agencies. These have worked well. The Commission proposes however that they are reviewed and supplemented with clauses regulating issues rela- ting to disputes, quality assurance, evaluation and inter-agency reporting.</p>
