<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The Government has commissioned me to conduct a review of the recruitment of permanent judges. Under the terms of my assignment, I am instructed to present proposals for changes that will enable the courts to continue to recruit permanent judges who are among the very most skilful and most suitable lawyers for the profession.</p>
<p>The assignment includes the task of considering whether, for the sake of ensuring good recruitment to the judicial profession, there should continue to be a specially organised career path for judges. If I conclude that there should be a specially organised career path for judges, I am also to present proposals on the future design of the career.</p>
<p>I am also instructed to consider and make proposals on how the courts’ needs for occasional additional and substitute judges can be met. The stated assumption here is that permanent judges should be available to fill these needs.</p>
<p>My thoughts on the future recruitment of judges</p>
<p>General principles</p>
<p>I have interpreted the terms of reference to mean that my assignment concerns only recruitment to judicial positions that are filled after a process of application. Accordingly, my proposals do not cover the appointment of Supreme Court or Supreme Administrative Court judges, presidents or heads of division at courts of appeal or administrative courts of appeal, or chief judges in the district courts or county administrative courts in Stockholm, Göteborg and Malmö.</p>
<p>In the light of the terms of reference, I have further assumed that the assignment has a broader purpose than merely to ensure good recruitment of judges. The essential point is to find a system for recruiting judges that will entail that our courts are able in future to meet the demands that judicial business needs to face.</p>
<p>If we can create the conditions that will allow representation in the courts of a broader range of professional experience than our judges have traditionally possessed, in my opinion it will be possible to satisfy citizens’ demands and expectations of the court system more adequately than is now the case. The courts must also be able to satisfy the justified demands of individual parties that court decisions maintain high levels of quality and competence. Moreover, recruitment to the judicial profession needs a broader base if it is to be possible to secure the services of the most skilful and most suitable lawyers. At the same time, it is essential to guarantee that all parts of the country have an adequate supply of judges. Opportunities should also be opened up for the courts to recruit lawyers with special qualifications so as to further raise the quality of judicial work. Taken together, measures mainly along these lines should result in both judges and the courts as a whole being better equipped to meet the demands that must be made now and in future.</p>
<p>Permanent judges have long been recruited almost exclusively from the group of lawyers who have completed the judicial training programme. However, there is no formal requirement for judicial training prior to appointment as a judge. The relative lack of success in recruiting lawyers who have not undergone judicial training is due in part to the fact that preference has been given to candidates who have judicial training. A judicial training programme will be less attractive if a person who has taken the programme does not have a reasonable chance of becoming a judge.</p>
<p>The judicial training programme has been of great value in that it has attracted competent lawyers who have proved well able to meet the courts’ needs for skilful judges. The question, however, is whether judicial training can be equated with the recruitment of permanent judges any longer. In itself, the judicial training programme does not provide the broader experience of life and work that is considered valuable in a judge. The desire to have judges with a variety of professional backgrounds is mainly provided for by according greater value to secondary qualifications in the form of service outside the courts – such as work for the</p>
<p>Government Offices or some other government employer – than to service in the courts alone, when appointing permanent judges. Lawyers appointed as judges rarely have any types of professional experience other than these. If there is to be any change in the current state of affairs, so that a greater breadth of experience is represented in the judiciary, we must depart from our present, closed system for recruiting permanent judges.</p>
<p>As things stand at present, moreover, the judicial training programme does not provide an adequate output to ensure that all courts in the country can be supplied with judges. Lawyers with judicial training are reluctant to move and due to this state of things trained candidates are not available for recruitment as judges everywhere in the country. The resulting recruitment problems are now affecting courts in county capitals and other regional centres, not just courts in smaller towns. It is important that the efforts that have been initiated to reform the system of district courts continue. Even if the reforms lead to courts being increasingly concentrated in larger and more central towns, this will not suffice to solve the problems. It will not remedy the difficulties that have arisen in recent times in recruiting judges to serve in county capitals and other regional centres, still less solve the recruitment problems in other towns.</p>
<p>For many years, the judicial training programme has enabled the state to recruit well-qualified lawyers. My considerations are based primarily on the assumption that my proposals should aim to address the courts’ need of skilful people who are suitable for the judicial profession.</p>
<p>Modifications in the present judicial training programme</p>
<p>In my opinion, the judicial training programme has intrinsic value. Strictly from the employer’s point of view, moreover, there are advantages to the way in which the judicial training programme makes it possible to attach skilful and suitable lawyers to the courts system and retain them for future employment as permanent judges. There is therefore reason to analyse whether it is possible to improve the recruitment of judges while retaining a special judicial training programme.</p>
<p>I do not take the view that there is any need to question the quality of the present judicial training programme. The question is</p>
<p>rather whether there is some other way of making the programme more attractive for skilful young lawyers. However, in my view the way forward is not to limit the number of places on the programme, so as to be able to “guarantee” those who have completed judicial training a position as a permanent judge.</p>
<p>My terms of reference suggest the possibility of concentrating judicial training to a smaller number of training centres than today. On my assessment, the result of any such step would be to exacerbate the problems that already exist in recruiting judges to serve in all parts of the country. Consequently, I do not see this as a solution for the future.</p>
<p>One solution I have considered is to postpone judicial training, so as to make, for example, a certain, relatively extensive period of experience of work as a lawyer a requirement for acceptance to the judicial training programme. On my assessment, in view of the limited recruitment needs, such a programme would need to be concentrated to a few training centres. It seems to me there is little likelihood of established lawyers being prepared to leave a place they have made their home in order to take the training programme. Furthermore, the problem of securing a countrywide supply of judges would remain in a model of this kind as well. I therefore do not see a postponement of judicial training as a way forward.</p>
<p>My overall assessment of the possibility of developing our present system of recruiting judges, which is based primarily on a special internal court career/judicial training, is that this system cannot satisfy the wish to be able to make different types of working and life experience available to the courts. Furthermore, in a closed system for recruitment the competition for employment as permanent judges is limited.</p>
<p>Apart from the above-mentioned circumstances the judicial training programme no longer provides an adequate supply of judges for the whole country. The present difficulties in inducing suitable lawyers to seek appointment as permanent judges in different parts of the country cannot be attributed to a shortage – or surplus – of lawyers who have completed judicial training. Nor is the explanation that the lawyers who have undergone judicial training lack the necessary skill to be judges. Consequently, I see no possibility of achieving a good level of recruitment of permanent judges throughout the country simply by making changes to the judicial training programme. Further changes may</p>
<p>even prove counter-productive. The attractiveness of the programme may suffer if changes are constantly being made to the conditions for training.</p>
<p>Recruitment of both lawyers with judicial training and lawyers without judicial training</p>
<p>The desire to have lawyers with experience from a variety of areas among the corps of judges can be satisfied if there is greater openness than at present to the recruitment of lawyers who have not undergone judicial training. One approach in that case can be to make substantial cutbacks in the number of places available in the judicial training programme so that the number of people who complete the programme only corresponds to a certain proportion of expected recruitment needs. Another approach can be to attempt to achieve broader recruitment by other means.</p>
<p>The principal purpose of a system in which both lawyers with judicial training and lawyers with other backgrounds are recruited as permanent judges is to ensure that both categories are represented at least at the great majority of courts. One major weakness in both models is that they cannot be expected to lead to this purpose being achieved.</p>
<p>A more general attempt to achieve broader recruitment would require that lawyers with judicial training and lawyers with other backgrounds are able to compete for appointment as judges on equal terms. This might have the effect of making the judicial training programme less attractive.</p>
<p>Consequently, I do not advocate a solution based on a combination of open recruitment and recruitment of lawyers with judicial training.</p>
<p>Completely open recruitment of judges</p>
<p>In the course of my investigation, I have become convinced that our judges and courts will be better equipped to meet the present and future demands if we abandon our closed system for recruiting permanent judges and switch to a completely open system of recruitment. One benefit of open recruitment is that the judges will have a range of professional backgrounds, which will be an</p>
<p>advantage in their judicial work. Open recruitment, moreover, will result in a substantial broadening of the recruitment base, which will create conditions for increased competition for judicial appointments. With more competitors there will be increased opportunities to select the most skilful and suitable lawyers for the judicial profession. Another advantage is that the courts that now have difficulties when recruiting judges will stand a better chance if lawyers working in local practices are able to seek appointment there. Open recruitment will make it easier to satisfy the courts’ needs for specialist qualifications.</p>
<p>One positive effect of open recruitment, in my view, is that lawyers will not need to decide early on in their career whether they might want to be judges later in life. This will give them the opportunity to try out different professions before making their choice. One weakness in our present system is that in practice the great majority of lawyers are excluded at an early age from the possibility of becoming permanent judges later in life. Naturally this group includes many well-qualified lawyers, who would make good judges.</p>
<p>Open recruitment, moreover, is free from another drawback that marks the present system. In a system in which in practice only those who have completed the judicial training programme are recruited as permanent judges, the problem arises that it is difficult when accepting candidates for the programme to assess how different people will develop later in life. The issue of appointment as judge does not arise until long after these initial assessments. It cannot be taken for granted that at a later stage in life, after completing the programme, a person will have the right qualities to make a good judge. Conversely, a person who has not been considered to possess the right qualities when young may mature and become a lawyer who would make a quite excellent judge.</p>
<p>One advantage of the present judicial training programme is that young lawyers acquire insight into the peculiar nature of the judicial profession. This is a kind of experience and knowledge that lawyers who have not been through the programme lack. In my opinion, however, the traditional programme of judicial training is not essential to prepare a person to work as a judge. The lack of specific training can be compensated by giving newly appointed judges basic training in connection with the assumption of their duties. I am convinced that experienced lawyers, given they have the right personal qualities and have undergone a certain amount of</p>
<p>individual introductory training in connection with their appointment, will relatively soon be able to serve well as judges.</p>
<p>If a system of open recruitment is to be successful, it is absolutely essential that there are lawyers in the public and private sectors who have the qualifications that are needed for the judicial profession and who are prepared to give up their profession to work as a judge.</p>
<p>In my considerations I have assumed that the organisational reform of the courts system will continue and that courts of suitable size will be established. In that case, by far the majority of courts will probably be located in the three metropolitan regions, county capitals and other relatively large towns. In the metropolitan regions (Stockholm, Göteborg and Malmö), the labour market for lawyers is so large and so diversified that it provides a very good basis for recruiting skilful lawyers. As regards the other towns in which courts may be concentrated, with almost no exceptions a relatively large number of lawyers are in practice there. In view of these observations, I believe there will be a good recruitment base throughout the country.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in my estimation the judicial profession has qualities that make it an interesting occupational choice for many lawyers who are active in different areas of the law.</p>
<p>Although the judicial training programme is not a formal requirement for employment as a permanent judge, it is extremely uncommon for lawyers with other backgrounds to apply for judicial positions. There may be several reasons for this, but one important explanation may be the present system of assessing applicants’ qualifications. Even if the present evaluation of qualifications assumes an overall assessment of the skills and suitability of prospective judges, there can be no doubt that candidates with judicial training are given priority because of the perceived value of the judicial training programme. In an open recruitment process, the system for evaluating qualifications must therefore be changed to enable a more equitable comparison and evaluation to be made of the relative advantages of judicial training and experience and other educational backgrounds and professional experience. This does not mean valuing judicial training less highly, but it does mean the knowledge and experience that such training has given a candidate must bear objective comparison with other qualifications.</p>
<p>An open system for recruiting judges also presupposes various marketing measures and a more active recruitment process with more refined methods of selection than at present.</p>
<p>It will be impossible to maintain a special judicial training programme if an open system for recruiting judges is introduced. The judicial training programme will become a less attractive option and there is a risk that it will attract fewer and less competent lawyers than at present. Keeping the programme will also obstruct efforts to enable lawyers with other backgrounds to secure employment as judges. Earlier attempts to broaden the recruitment base, not least, have shown that this is impossible as long as there is a special programme of judicial training. I therefore recommend closing down the special judicial training programme.</p>
<p>A step of this kind will not entail the courts system losing a valuable resource for recruiting permanent judges. Young lawyers who have an inclination and aptitude for the judicial profession will be able in future too to qualify themselves for appointment to the judiciary. I find it difficult to imagine that lawyers would refrain from applying for judicial appointments because they have not previously had the opportunity to train as judges.</p>
<p>Salaries</p>
<p>If a decision is made to switch to a system in which there is no longer any special career path for judges and all recruitment of judges takes place on the open labour market, there will need to be a possibility of greater flexibility than at present in the salaries offered newly appointed judges and an ability to use individual starting salaries as a tool in recruiting competent lawyers. However, I do not see any intrinsic value in an exaggerated wage spread among new appointees. In certain situations it will nevertheless be quite essential to abandon the basic salary level and exercise greater freedom when setting salaries, so as to be able to recruit the most skilful and most suitable lawyers for the profession. The committee that prepares decisions on judicial appointments should also decide starting salaries.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the issue of starting salaries, salaries during the period of appointment are also discussed. In my view, the time is not ripe to introduce individual salaries for permanent judges. It should, on the other hand, be possible to build further on the</p>
<p>system already introduced in collective agreements, so as to establish a system of personal salary supplements that can be given to a number of judges, independently of the court at which they are employed. I recommend that the special committee that prepares decisions on judicial appointments should also decide which judges should receive salary supplements.</p>
<p>Recruitment process</p>
<p>Requirements for prospective judges</p>
<p>In my opinion, the requirements that have applied until now – independence, objectivity, knowledge about and ability to apply the system of legal regulations, and personal qualities – are sufficiently general that it should be possible to retain them for use in an open system of judicial recruitment. In some respects, though, they should be supplemented and made more precise.</p>
<p>One new requirement that should be introduced is an ability to bring cases to a conclusion in reasonable time. This requirement follows from Article 6 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p>
<p>Another requirement that in my opinion should be emphasised is a judge’s ability to lead and stimulate collaborators in their work. As things stand at present, this requirement has particular importance only in connection with the appointment of judges in leading positions. However, even judges who are not in such positions often have responsibility for managing the work of nonjudicial staff, including reporting, clerks and court secretaries. In my opinion there is reason when making appointments to accord greater weight than has been formally allowed until now to the ability of applicants to lead and stimulate other staff in their work.</p>
<p>A judge should also have the ability, willingness and interest to take on different and/or new responsibilities and to work in general to ensure good overall results for the business of the court.</p>
<p>Alongside the basic requirements, I consider it should also be possible to introduce special requirements in individual cases as appropriate, e.g. because a court has a need for certain specialist skills.</p>
<p>General principles for assessing skill</p>
<p>For the sake of public confidence in the courts, appointments to the judiciary must be based on an objective and factual assessment of the ability of applicants to serve as a judge. This implies that it is not only the levels of skill and suitability that are required of a judge and are to be applied in assessing applicants for judicial appointments that should be set in advance; the principles for making the assessment should also be clearly established beforehand. Having said this, the development and formulation of detailed grounds for evaluating applicants should be largely the responsibility of the body preparing judicial appointments.</p>
<p>The basic principle should be that an overall assessment shall be made, taking into account all qualifications applicants have that are relevant for the position applied for.</p>
<p>This overall assessment, along with the skills required for the particular position, may mean that varying weight will be accorded to different factors.</p>
<p>The factors that should be decisive are in the first instance professional skill, personal qualities, education and training and professional experience.</p>
<p>In the interests of legal security and of individual parties and public confidence in the courts, it is extremely important that decisions made by the courts are of a consistently high quality. It is therefore essential that lawyers recruited to be judges have an excellent knowledge of the legal system. The judge must also be able to apply the legal rules according to generally accepted methods. The judge, in other words, must be a skilful lawyer, which also presupposes an ability to analyse the problems and issues he or she is confronted with.</p>
<p>A prospective judge must also have the right personal qualities, and these qualities, in my opinion, generally have great importance as grounds for assessment. In my report, I draw attention to a range of factors that should be taken into account in the assessment. The decisive consideration in assessing whether a person has the potential to be a skilful and suitable judge should be an overall picture of the applicant’s personal qualities.</p>
<p>Another important factor in assessing applicants is their previous professional experience. As I see it, no particular types of</p>
<p>experience can be singled out as particularly valuable. However, in my report I do indicate certain kinds of experience that are typically of great value in a judge. It is a matter, primarily, of experience in dealing with legal issues, but experience other than strictly legal work can also be of value. One such area, which I point out in my report, is parenthood. In my opinion, parenthood should be comparable with non-legal professional experience, as parenthood is also a source of life experience and personal maturity, which are valuable qualities for a judge. This arrangement will both promote gender equality and help prevent any disadvantage accruing to parents, whether women or men, who have taken active part in parenthood when competing for judicial appointments.</p>
<p>As regards education and professional experiences, judicial training must be weighed against other types of education. Judicial training and experience of service in the courts shall not, as at present, be accorded special importance when assessing applicants for judicial appointments.</p>
<p>As previously, gender equality shall be a further objective factor that can tip the balance in a judicial appointment when applicants’ qualifications are broadly identical. In the very few cases in which it is impossible to decide between candidates on the basis of an assessment of their skills, the outcome will be decided, as previously, by the period of service demanded.</p>
<p>Judicial appointments</p>
<p>General</p>
<p>I assume that judicial appointments will continue to be made by the Government. I assume, further, that judicial appointments currently based on a process of application will continue to be decided in the same way.</p>
<p>For reasons of principle and on practical grounds, I am unwilling to accept the idea of probationary appointments for judges.</p>
<p>I recommend a relaxation of the rules for adjunct judges in courts of appeal and administrative courts of appeal to make it possible to call in a broader circle of lawyers outside the judiciary to serve as adjunct judges. This will give lawyers working in other</p>
<p>areas an opportunity to try out the judicial profession before deciding whether to apply for a judicial appointment.</p>
<p>Preparation of judicial appointments</p>
<p>An open system of recruitment for judges should not lead to a departure from the present arrangement in which judges are appointed by the Government on the basis of proposals from a government agency in which judges exercise a decisive influence. This arrangement not only guarantees the independence of the judiciary and the autonomous role and position of the courts in our democratic legal system. It is also calculated to inspire confidence on the part of the general public and actors in the legal system that judicial appointments are not affected by inappropriate considerations.</p>
<p>The recruitment of skilful lawyers who are suited to the judicial profession makes special demands on the competence and working procedures of the body responsible for preparing judicial appointments. These demands will increase if judges in future are not recruited almost exclusively from among lawyers who are or have been employed in the courts system. The working duties involved, moreover, will become more onerous and demands on the general process ahead of new recruitment will grow. Consequently, if an open system of judicial recruitment is adopted, the composition of the body responsible for preparing appointments will need to be reconsidered, as also will its working procedures.</p>
<p>A new committee for preparation of judicial appointments</p>
<p>I propose that a new committee should replace the Appointment Review Committee.</p>
<p>The members of the new committee (which may be named the Committee on Judges) should include four judges, two advocates, one representative of the general public and the Director-General of the National Courts Administration. Each member should have a personal alternate. Two alternates should be available for the public representative.</p>
<p>The Government should appoint the judges and advocates on the Committee. The Chief Parliamentary Ombudsman in consultation with the other Parliamentary Ombudsmen should nominate the representative of the general public and his or her alternates.</p>
<p>The Swedish Bar Association should nominate the advocates on the Committee. A special nominations group consisting of a majority of judges should nominate the judges to serve on the Committee.</p>
<p>The members and alternate members of the Committee on Judges should be appointed for five-year terms. Reappointment of members or alternate members should not be possible.</p>
<p>In view of the unique constitutional position of judges, provisions relating to the composition of the Committee and the appointment of members and alternates should be set in a special Act on judicial appointments. This Act should also include fundamental rules on the duties of the Committee.</p>
<p>The Government should be able to instruct the Committee on Judges to also deal with other responsibilities now managed by the Appointment Review Committee.</p>
<p>The Committee on Judges should have its own office, which should be integrated in the Committee.</p>
<p>Procedures leading up to the appointment of a judge</p>
<p>Heads of courts should make continuous efforts to encourage suitable candidates to apply for judicial appointments. I see no reason why the courts and judges should not play an active part in this regard; on the contrary, I consider that the independence of the courts will be strengthened if they themselves are actively involved in the recruitment of judges. One important aspect in this connection is that attention is paid to efforts to promote gender equality in recruitment processes. Accordingly, the search for suitable candidates for judicial appointments should focus on encouraging both women and men to apply. If there is an a lack of gender balance at a court, in that most of the judges are men, in my opinion the court or head of the court should strive primarily to identify skilful and suitable women candidates for an appointment as judge.</p>
<p>With respect to the appointment of chief judges at district courts and county administrative courts, it should be the responsibility of the Committee on Judges to take a more active part in encouraging suitable candidates to seek appointment. Here too, gender equality considerations are naturally important. At present the proportion of chief judges at these courts who are women is very low. To achieve even representation of women and men among heads of courts, I think it is particularly important that the Committee on Judges attempts as far as possible to encourage women lawyers to apply for such appointments.</p>
<p>The Committee on Judges should also more generally be actively involved in the search for suitable candidates.</p>
<p>Processing of applications</p>
<p>An open system of recruitment will be more demanding in terms of the basis for the positions taken by the Committee on Judges. Written remarks will generally need to be supplemented by oral information from those providing testimonials.</p>
<p>Interviews should be a natural element in all cases. If the interviews are to serve their purpose properly, it is important that they be conducted in a professional manner.</p>
<p>Interviews and references will need to be supplemented by aptitude and personality tests. The use of different types of tests and their design is a matter on which the Committee on Judges will have to take a precise position.</p>
<p>The head of the court should take part in interviewing applicants. The head of the court should also have the right to participate in the deliberations leading up to the proposal from the Committee on Judges. The head of the court should, however, not be involved in the actual decision-making.</p>
<p>As far as possible, the reasons given by the Committee on Judges for its decision should reflect the factors that have been crucial in deciding between the different candidates.</p>
<p>The number of candidates proposed by the Committee on Judges should be limited to the number of appointments to be made (normally one).</p>
<p>The Government should not be bound by the proposal of the Committee on Judges.</p>
<p>No appeal should be possible against the proposal of the Committee on Judges in a case concerning a judicial appointment.</p>
<p>Secrecy</p>
<p>A regulation on secrecy will be needed for the personality test used in connection with judicial appointments. A secrecy regulation should not, however, focus on such cases alone, but should be formulated in more general terms.</p>
<p>A reversed requirement of damage, i.e. a presumption of secrecy, should be set. The secrecy must not infringe against informant protection.</p>
<p>Regulation of which judges are permanent judges</p>
<p>I consider that incorporating in the legislation more precise regulations to the effect that judges sitting in courts of appeal, administrative courts of appeal, district courts and county administrative courts must have permanent status should strengthen the constitutional position of judges. This provision should be taken up in the special Act on judicial appointments that I propose in my report.</p>
<p>The judge and the organisation for preparing cases</p>
<p>I consider that the existence an organisation for preparing cases that consists of well-qualified staff in various capacities plays a major part in making the judicial profession attractive. From the perspective of the judiciary and citizens in general it is also important that the organisation preparing cases meets exacting demands. In addition, in purely general terms, the availability at courts of staff who are able to relieve the judges of tasks that they do not necessarily need to take on themselves leads to increased efficiency and, not least, makes it possible to put the available economic resources to the best possible use. More importantly, a competent organisation for preparing cases allows the judges to concentrate on the court’s core activity, namely, judging. A development along these lines is conducive to high quality judging.</p>
<p>I have come to the conclusion that the legal basis for narrowing the focus of the judge’s responsibilities must remain that given in Chapter 1, Section 3e and Chapter 2, Section 4 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure and Sections 12 and 18 of the Administrative Court Act (1971:289). Under these provisions, measures that relate solely to the preparation of cases and that are not of a nature that they should be reserved for legally trained judges may be performed by other court officials who have sufficient knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>Tasks performed by officials other than judges are the responsibility of the member of staff entrusted with them.</p>
<p>In my opinion, each court is in the best position to assess the organisation for preparing cases at that particular court, taking into account local circumstances. The point of departure in the continued reforms should therefore be that the courts themselves as far as possible are entrusted to decide about their internal organisation and the distribution of tasks during the preparation of cases.</p>
<p>I consider that court secretaries and clerks will continue to constitute the essential structure of the organisation for preparing cases at the district courts. At county administrative courts, in addition to secretaries and clerks, the case preparation organisation should also include permanently employed case preparation lawyers. At district courts there may also be tasks (for example, in more complicated cases) that should be performed by specially employed case preparation lawyers. To guarantee the availability of clerking positions, lawyers should not be employed to perform tasks that can equally well be carried out by clerks.</p>
<p>Permanently employed reporting clerks should in future perform the case preparation at courts of appeal and administrative courts of appeal, which is now carried out by lawyers undergoing judicial training. A transition to a system in which case preparation tasks are managed by lawyers appointed specifically for this purpose should make for substantially increased continuity and stability in the case preparation organisations of courts of appeal and administrative courts of appeal, which in the longer term may also help enhance the quality of activities. One benefit of an extended period of service as reporting clerk is that it will allow scope for greater concentration and specialisation in different areas.</p>
<p>If the only consideration guiding the recruitment of lawyers for reporting clerk’s duties is the personnel requirements of the courts</p>
<p>of appeal and administrative courts of appeal, an additional advantage will be that the case preparation organisation at each court can be set up in the manner that is most appropriate and effective for that particular court.</p>
<p>As regards the case preparation organisation at the highest instances, future needs will have to be provided for by recruiting lawyers who have not undergone judicial training.</p>
<p>Training</p>
<p>Training of newly appointed judges</p>
<p>Special introduction and training programmes should be created for newly appointed judges. These programmes will need to be individually designed and adapted to the needs of the particular judge concerned.</p>
<p>The head of the court should be responsible for ensuring that the training plan is drawn up and implemented. The plan should be set up as soon as possible after the appointment is made and should involve consultation with the newly appointed judge and the National Courts Administration, which should be responsible for ensuring that it is possible to carry out the various parts of the training programme.</p>
<p>The training plan should include a certain period of service as an adjunct judge at the court of appeal or administrative court of appeal.</p>
<p>The court that has employed the newly appointed judge will have an important task in training him or her for judicial duties, and as at most workplaces, the main emphasis of training will be on the job work with the duties that the appointment entails. Collaborators, above all the other judges at the court, will have an important part to play.</p>
<p>Further training and continuing professional development for permanent judges</p>
<p>Alongside the need of the general public for competent judges, there is an interest in making substantial investments in training so as to enhance the attractiveness of the judicial profession. In my opinion, substantial gains can be expected from such investments</p>
<p>in terms of the quality of the work of the courts and attractiveness of the judicial profession.</p>
<p>Education and training has until now not been sufficiently extensive to satisfy the demands that need to be made. In future, efforts should be made to ensure greater coordination of the total needs of the court and a planned approach to the training actions needed both by individual judges and by the court overall.</p>
<p>The head of the court should be responsible for continuous analysis of training needs at the court. The head of the court should also be responsible for ensuring that the judges undergo necessary further education and training and that in terms of the workload scope is provided for these measures. With respect to any needs that may arise for specialised education or training, it should be the court concerned that determines the measures that may be required, as it is the court and its judges that are most aware of local needs.</p>
<p>The National Courts Administration should continue to administer and coordinate much of the education and training that is requested.</p>
<p>The judges should have a decisive influence on the form and contents of educational and training measures. With regard to the training of judges, the existing training council should be able to give judges influence over these important issues.</p>
<p>Pure education and training measures for judges should be organised so as to provide the maximum possible benefit for as many judges as possible.</p>
<p>Training of case preparation personnel</p>
<p>Personnel engaged in the case preparation organisation at the courts should be offered continuous, advanced further education and training.</p>
<p>It should be possible to design essential parts of this training as a joint programme for reporting clerks from all courts of appeal and administrative courts of appeal, with more specialised sections for particular types of court. The National Courts Administration should administer the training of reporting clerks much as it does at present.</p>
<p>Training of law clerks</p>
<p>I consider that the law clerks’ training programme should be retained and that as many lawyers as possible should be given the opportunity to engage in advanced law clerk service. In terms of substance, I consider that a high standard should be maintained irrespective of where the training programme occurs or which judges serve as instructors.</p>
<p>One point of departure for the training of law clerks should be that as their skills increase, law clerks should take on case preparation measures at their own responsibility. In order to enable a gradual extension of the duties and responsibilities assumed by law clerks, judges will have to take the time needed to train the clerks in the processing of cases and court business. Clarity, a good educational approach and general high quality in the treatment of law clerks will create conditions for an attractive programme for training law clerks; judges, meanwhile, in return for relatively limited efforts on their part, will obtain a legal service that will enable the judge’s work to concentrate on judicial responsibilities.</p>
<p>To give as many lawyers as possible the opportunity to serve as law clerks, the training period should be shortened to one year and six months. This will create an annual scope for an additional 100 places as law clerk.</p>
<p>Proceeding from the needs of the district courts and the county administrative courts for lawyers for case preparation purposes, a shortened programme for law clerks focusing primarily on legal tasks will have the same outcome as the present programme, in which the law clerks also perform other types of duties.</p>
<p>I consider that law clerks should continue to have the opportunity to decide relatively simple cases in the course of their training.</p>
<p>Broader opportunities should be available to combine law clerk training at a court with other advanced legal service. The National Courts Administration should have the task of considering other possible combinations.</p>
<p>In addition to measures aimed at making law clerk training seem an attractive alternative, young lawyers also need to be made well aware of the substance and future value of the programme. The information activities begun by the National Courts</p>
<p>Administration and the courts should therefore continue and be further developed.</p>
<p>Court needs for occasional additional and substitute judges</p>
<p>Already at the planning stage, the courts should be guaranteed an adequate number of judges to manage their activities. One necessary condition for this is that the organisational reform of the courts that has already begun is carried through. A change along these lines, leading to larger courts, should also help to make it possible for courts to solve problems involving substitute and additional judges (especially temporary problems) internally, thereby reducing the need for help from outside.</p>
<p>In cases where the issue of additional judges cannot be solved internally, the need for further resources should be met in the first instance by judges agreeing voluntarily to serve at other courts.</p>
<p>It should be possible to enlist the services of former permanent judges to meet temporary needs for additional judges.</p>
<p>In the absence of a constitutional amendment, I reject the idea of solving the problem of the availability of additional judges by a more general practice of appointing judges to serve at more than one court. Nor can any far-reaching obligation be imposed on a judge to serve at a court other than the one where he or she is employed. However, as a measure to solve a regional need for occasional additional judges, it should be possible to appoint a small number of judges who are authorised to sit in all the courts in the region. A similar solution should also be applicable for the sake of employing judges with specialist knowledge.</p>
<p>Gender equality</p>
<p>The opportunities to combine professional life and parenthood opened up by modern working arrangements and technology should be made use of as far as possible.</p>
<p>Changes at the courts, in working arrangements and other respects, should put women in a better position to compete with men.</p>
<p>The grounds for assessing skill in connection with appointments should be formulated so as to prevent any disadvantage accruing to women and men who have been active parents.</p>
<p>One of the aims when recruiting judges and heads of courts should be to achieve a balance between men and women judges. The heads of courts and the Committee on Judges should be responsible for ensuring that these objectives are achieved.</p>
<p>Implementation</p>
<p>A reform of the system for recruiting judges should be seen in an extended time perspective and implemented so as to gradually take fuller and fuller effect.</p>
<p>The first step should be to establish the new Committee on Judges. I propose 1 January 2006 as the date for this step. In connection with this, the new grounds of assessment for judicial appointments should begin to apply.</p>
<p>Marketing and information about the new system of recruitment and the judicial profession should be a priority once a decision on the change has been taken.</p>
<p>As regards closing down the judicial training programme, I propose that this should be done by stopping accepting new trainees at a certain point. Those who have already been accepted to the programme by then should be allowed to complete the entire judicial training programme as it now stands. The terms of employment and tasks of those who are following the programme or have completed it must not be affected by the fact that no new trainees are being accepted.</p>
<p>The question of when to stop accepting new trainees should be decided with reference to the various needs of the courts.</p>
<p>The courts of appeal and administrative courts of appeal should be able to manage the transition to recruiting permanently employed lawyers for case preparation purposes without any very long delay.</p>
<p>On my assessment, the effects of closing down the judicial training programme will not be felt by the Supreme Court and Supreme Administrative Court until at least four years after the programme stops accepting new trainees. This will give these courts sufficient time to establish routines for recruiting reporting clerks in future.</p>
<p>In the event of a discontinuation of the judicial training programme, reporting clerks will not be available for judicial duties at district courts and county administrative courts, nor will acting associate judges of appeal be available to act as judges in courts of appeal and administrative courts of appeal. A transitional period of 1-3 years should suffice before the resulting loss of resources for judicial work can be compensated by permanent judges taking over judicial duties and by other measures.</p>
<p>Turning to employers outside the courts system who for many years have recruited lawyers with judicial training, my assessment is that a four-year transitional period will give them enough time to find ways of employing lawyers with other backgrounds.</p>
<p>I propose that no more trainees be admitted to the judicial training programme after 1 January 2006.</p>
<p>Consequences of my proposals</p>
<p>Costs</p>
<p>The greater continuity and effectiveness resulting from permanently employed personnel should be able to provide full compensation for the increased costs that my proposals will entail for case preparation organisations at the Supreme Court, the Supreme Administrative Court, the courts of appeal and administrative courts of appeal.</p>
<p>With regard to costs for permanent judges, vigorous concentration on case preparation organisations along with a more efficient organisation of the courts should free up the resources that may need to be available in an open system for recruiting judges.</p>
<p>On my assessment, there will be a reduced need for extra judges, which will free up resources to a certain extent.</p>
<p>The new Committee on Judges will entail increased costs for the preparation of judicial appointments. The cost increase can be estimated at SEK 12 million per year.</p>
<p>The training of newly appointed judges should lead to increased costs of about SEK 10 million per year.</p>
<p>Financing the increased costs</p>
<p>I propose that the increased costs for training judges and the increased costs for preparing judicial appointments should be financed by a rise in the application fees in civil cases. The fee proposed is SEK 1 000. Receipts from application fees would then rise by about SEK 27 million per year. Another conceivable solution would be to raise the fees for non-contentious matters. I take no position on how large any such increase should be. If a system of full cost coverage were introduced, this would mean raising fees from SEK 275 or 375 to approximately SEK 2 200 per case, which would increase total receipts by some SEK 100 million per year. If both alternatives are chosen, this would yield additional income that would more than cover the increased costs an improved recruitment system would entail for the courts system and could also provide scope for other improvements in the courts system. Either solutions, or a combination of the two, are possible and reasonable measures to pay for the increased costs that would result from my proposals.</p>
<p>I draw attention to the fact that application fees payable to the administrative courts and fees for appeals to courts of appeal and administrative courts of appeal are a potential source of funding for the resources the courts system may need in the future.</p>
<p>Other consequences</p>
<p>The proposals should lead to a more even representation of women and men among permanent judges and above all to an increased recruitment of women to positions as judges in leading positions.</p>
<p>My assessment is that an open system for recruiting judges, such as I have proposed, combined with changes in recruitment procedures, should be able to some extent to help ensure that the corps of judges reflects the ethnic and cultural diversity of our country. However, if the interests of integration policy are to have any practical impact on appointments to the judiciary, measures other than those it has been my task to investigate will be needed.</p>
