<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>Policy objective</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Government propose that the Riksdag adopt a new overarching policy objective to enhance the tourism and hospitality industry’s contribution to economic, social and environmental components of sustainable development throughout the country.  The Inquiry’s starting point has been the great importance of these three sustainability perspectives being tackled holistically to ensure that political demands for environmental and social sustainability are balanced by incentives for economic sustainability.</p>
<p>Strategy, fields of action and sub-objectives</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that the Government develop, adopt and implement a national strategy for a sustainable and thriving tourism and hospitality industry  – a platform for the design and implementation of policy until 2030 – and that the development of this strategy take place in partnership with the tourism and hospitality industry, government agencies, regions, municipalities and civil society. The Inquiry proposes that the national strategy be divided into a number of strategic fields of action and that the overarching policy objective for a sustainable and thriving tourism and hospitality industry be broken down into measureable sub-objectives within these fields. The strategic fields of action the Inquiry proposes are: digital transformation; skills supply; developing innovation and research; accessibility; nature tourism; cultural tourism; culinary tourism; major events and meetings and business conditions . This proposal should be developed over time within the proposed strategic framework.</p>
<p>National tourism and hospitality industry forum</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that the Government establish a national tourism and hospitality industry forum that will be tasked with drawing up the national strategy for a sustainable and thriving tourism and hospitality industry, and subsequently with coordinating the strategy’s implementation. It is proposed that the national tourism and hospitality industry forum be established for a period of five to eight years, during the time the strategy is being developed and implemented.</p>
<p>New national development and innovation function</p>
<p>Innovation and continuous development is absolutely essential in addressing the potential, growth and challenges of the tourism and hospitality industry – not least from a sustainability perspective. In a globally competitive market, businesses and destinations need to offer experiences in the form of very high-quality products and services. This means that private and public actors must have a high level of innovative capacity that ensures the development of businesses, products, services and processes. The non-profit sector also has a role to play. An important prerequisite for this is that the sectors and needs of the tourism and hospitality industry coordinate with the innovation support system. In the Inquiry’s assessment, there is currently no forum with overall national responsibility for long-term knowledge development and innovation in several of the strategic fields of action the Inquiry is proposing, particularly digital transformation, nature tourism, cultural tourism, culinary tourism, events and major meetings . As both businesses and society have an interest in developing the tourism and hospitality industry and the locations – destinations – where tourism takes place, in the Inquiry’s view there is considerable value in organised cooperation between central government, regions, municipalities and the business community to create a more competitive and innovative tourism and hospitality industry.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes the formation of a new national function  with the role of promoting the long-term building of innovative capacity and knowledge development in a number of the strategic fields of action, and coordinating the tourism and hospitality industry’s sectors and their needs with actors within the innovation support system. The role of this national function will be to provide support to businesses’ and regions’ development efforts through the following:</p>
<p>• Promoting the points of contact between tourism and hospitality sectors, academia and the public sector in matters concerning innovation and research.</p>
<p>• Setting priorities – based on the national strategy for a sustainable and thriving tourism and hospitality industry – among strategic innovation initiatives, and developing methods for working with innovation in the tourism and hospitality industry.</p>
<p>• Coordinating, when relevant, national innovation and development projects and development and innovation funding applications in the strategic fields of action.</p>
<p>• Conducting surveys and analyses to support the development of the strategic fields of action of digital transformation, nature tourism, cultural tourism, culinary tourism and major events and meetings. This assignment should be designed so that it is implemented in coordination with relevant agencies.</p>
<p>• Developing  knowledge-based tools and models in the tourism and hospitality industry’s strategic fields of action of digital transformation, nature tourism, cultural tourism, culinary tourism and major events and meetings.</p>
<p>• Spreading these tools and models to businesses and organisations in the tourism and hospitality industry, the knowledge and innovation support system, and other public sector actors, nationally and regionally.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s assessment, the choice of responsible entity for this function will affect the long-term approach, the engagement of various actors, the link between tourism and hospitality sectors and the Swedish innovation support system, and the contribution future investments will make to knowledge development at doctoral level. The latter is important in the spread of information to the education system and thus in the longer term for skills supply in the tourism and hospitality industry. The Inquiry proposes three alternative responsible entities and presents the estimated strengths and weaknesses and the economic consequences of the various proposals.</p>
<p>Enhanced agency coordination</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Government strengthen the mandate of the existing coordination that takes place between 14 government agencies and state-owned companies within the framework of Besöksnäringens myndighetsgrupp , under the leadership of the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth.</p>
<p>Proposals for further action</p>
<p>In its work, the Inquiry has assumed that a policy for a sustainable and thriving tourism and hospitality industry is a natural part of the smart society we are building together. Sustainable development of the tourism and hospitality industry cannot be isolated from other development areas linked to urban and rural development. This applies at the local, regional and national level. Smart, sustainable, inclusive environments are highly attractive for many purposes – entrepreneurship, innovation, work, living and visiting.</p>
<p>In addition to the main task of proposing a coherent policy, the Inquiry’s remit has included surveying the tourism and hospitality industry’s needs and challenges, and obstacles to its sustainable development in the following areas, and subsequently proposing concrete initiatives and possible simplifications that may mobilise initiatives by other actors: – digital transformation, including digital accessibility; – research and innovation; – skills supply and continuing professional development; – transport supply in existing infrastructure regarding the tourism and hospitality industry; – making use of different types of environments, such as urban, natural and cultural; – employment; – nature tourism and cultural tourism businesses; and – data and statistics.</p>
<p>A number of concrete initiatives in these areas are proposed in the report. Examples include the following:</p>
<p>• a  four-year remit, and SEK 30 million, for the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth to develop a pilot project on sustainable development of the tourism and hospitality industry to interconnect urban and rural areas;</p>
<p>• a  two-year remit, and SEK 25 million, for the Research Institutes of Sweden AB (RISE) to identify work processes and initiate programs which strengthens collaboration between the tourism and hospitality industry and existing innovation structures;</p>
<p>• a  four-year remit, and SEK 60 million, to the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (Formas) to analyse – in collaboration with other relevant government agencies and in dialogue with higher education institutions and sector research councils – the research needs linked to the tourism and hospitality industry, and initiate and support strategic research and development of relevance for the tourism and hospitality industry;</p>
<p>• a  three-year remit, and SEK 25 million, for the Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems (Vinnova) to develop initiatives for sustainable events, with a focus on security; and</p>
<p>• a  two-year remit, and SEK 40 million, for the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth to increase work with better regulations for businesses in the tourism and hospitality industry.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry was instructed to submit proposals for a coherent policy for a sustainable and thriving tourism and hospitality industry. The aim has been to provide the Government with information to strengthen the tourism and hospitality industry as an engine for export growth and job creation throughout the country. The remit has included submitting proposals for a policy that creates conditions for growth, entrepreneurship and employment, and that encourages actors to mobilise their combined efforts in the tourism and hospitality industry. The remit has also included analysing the objectives of tourism policy and surveying the tourism and hospitality industry’s needs and obstacles to ensuring sustainable development, and proposing initiatives. The remit includes proposing how collaboration and coordination between industry and public sector actors can be developed. It also includes proposing how points of contact between government agencies, industry, academia and civil society can be developed.</p>
<p>One limitation of the remit was that the Inquiry was not to propose measures for the promotion of Sweden abroad. Nor was the Inquiry to conduct a review or produce proposals regarding rules for taxes and fees, or changes to tax procedures.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The last time the Swedish tourism and hospitality industry was the object of a government inquiry was in 2004. In the 13 years since then, the world has changed radically, not least through the digital transformation. The world has experienced a global financial crisis and then the largest migration crisis since the Second World War. Moreover, many of the terrorist attacks of recent years have targeted popular tourist destinations.</p>
<p>Recent years have seen the emergence of ‘hypertourism’, where rapidly increasing numbers of visitors in cities or at particularly attractive locations are burdening public services and impacting real estate markets in a way that is causing public opinion to turn against tourism’s continued growth. Although hypertourism is generally not a problem in Sweden, the number of visitors to several locations, such as Kungsleden, has increased dramatically in the last year alone.</p>
<p>Despite the impact of the global financial, economic and social crisis and other challenges, the tourism and hospitality industry has displayed resilient growth globally and nationally in recent years. Global tourism accounted for 1.24 billion arrivals in 2016, a 4.3 per cent rise on the previous year. According to the United Nations World Tourism Organisation, tourist arrivals increased to and within all parts of the world, with the exception of the Middle East, where arrivals declined by just over 4 per cent. Internal tourism consumption in Sweden was estimated at almost SEK 300 billion in 2016, employing some 170 000 people. The value of domestic tourist consumption comprised 60 per cent of the total tourism consumption. The remaining 40 per cent accordingly represents inbound tourism consumption, generating an export value of SEK 120 billion, or approximately 6 per cent of Sweden’s total exports. Unlike other forms of exports, these exports generated VAT revenue equivalent to SEK 17 billion.</p>
<p>The governments of numerous countries, including Sweden, realise that tourism can stimulate the economy, and that the tourism and hospitality industry accordingly offers opportunities to help achieve economic goals. The development of tourism policy is an increasingly complex process, with a longer time horizon and broader scope than previously. This requires an innovative and coherent policy approach that can develop goals and implement policies addressing and encompassing several policy areas.</p>
<h2>Impact of the proposals</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s overall assessment is that the proposals will have a positive socio-economic effect by enabling more efficient use of the combined public and private investments in the Swedish tourism and hospitality industry than is the case today. In the Inquiry’s assessment, the proposals may indirectly lead to businesses within the tourism and hospitality industry becoming more profitable, employing more people than if the proposals were not implemented. The employment effects will generate potential throughout the entire country. Tourism employs more people in metropolitan areas than in rural areas. On the other hand, the tourism and hospitality industry has greater relative importance in Sweden’s rural areas,</p>
<p>where the importance of each individual opportunity for entrepreneurship or employment is relatively greater than in rapidly growing cities. The tourism and hospitality industry is an industry that connects the different parts of Sweden with each other. The tourism and hospitality industry, and continued development of tourism in Sweden, has the potential to act as a cohesive force between various parts of the country, not least between urban and rural areas.</p>
<p>Given that the Inquiry’s proposals will lead to increased employment in line with the current pattern of employment distribution within the tourism and hospitality industry of women, men, people born in Sweden and people born abroad, the proposals will have a greater impact on women born in Sweden and abroad, and men born abroad, compared with measures that affect the entire business sector.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also sees an opportunity – in the proposed national strategy to be developed – for the Government to more clearly steer initiatives to contribute, for example, to the entry and establishment of newly arrived immigrants in the labour market. Access to knowledge is a prerequisite for following-up and improving gender equality and integration. The Inquiry’s proposals on increased research and the development of data and statistics aims to provide better tools enabling various actors to understand the tourism and hospitality industry’s structures and effects on different groups, which in turn can be assumed to contribute to the possibility of achieving gender equality and integration objectives. The proposal for a new national development and innovation function will be particularly important for small businesses. In the Inquiry’s view, small and medium-sized enterprises generally have more limited capacity to invest in research and development, and to acquire knowledge, than large companies.</p>
<p>In light of this, the proposals to strengthen research can be expected to offer the greatest benefit to larger businesses in the tourism and hospitality industry, while the proposals to evaluate initiatives in innovation and to close the gap between actors in the tourism and hospitality industry and public structures supporting innovation may provide the greatest potential for smaller businesses.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals concerning continuing skills development for government agencies and businesses aim to make it easier</p>
<p>for businesses in the tourism and hospitality industry to do the right thing, which is expected to have more impact on small businesses, which often have lower administrative capacity than large businesses.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals will have considerable impact on county councils and municipalities, since the tourism and hospitality industry is, by its very nature, local, and location-bound. As the proposals are voluntary for county councils, regions and municipalities, they will not affect municipal democracy or the division of tasks between central and local government. The Inquiry’s remit was to propose a coherent policy and propose how collaboration and coordination between industry and public sector actors can be developed. It goes without saying that these proposals will entail consequences for a number of government agencies and organisations.</p>
<p>In a rough estimate, the proposals are expected to entail costs of SEK 50–110 million, depending on which alternative is adopted. The Inquiry proposes that the costs be charged to the central government budget and, depending on which option is chosen for the new national function, may also be financed by regions, county councils, municipalities and tourism and hospitality industry. In addition, we estimate that the proposals will mean one-off costs of approximately SEK 275 million. We propose that this is financed from the central government budget.</p>
