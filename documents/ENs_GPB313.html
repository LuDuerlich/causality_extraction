<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>New conditions for learning and teaching in higher education in Sweden</h2>
<h2>Terms of reference</h2>
<p>A Committee of Enquiry into the renewal of learning and teaching in higher education in Sweden was appointed in April, 2000. Its terms of reference include an analysis of the pedagogical consequences of the recent expansion of higher education and proposals for measures to develop learning and teaching. The use of information and communication technologies is of specific relevance, as well as training of and other support for university teachers.</p>
<p>Given its time constraints and limited opportunities to carry out investigations of its own, the Committee has focussed on conducting an extensive review of current enquiries and conducting discussions with representatives of universities, authorities and organisations in Sweden and abroad. This information has been supplemented with questionnaires and visits to a few British and American institutions of higher education. A reference group consisting of representatives of universities and colleges and the National Swedish Union of Students has assisted the Committee.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Today there are almost twice as many full time equivalent students in Swedish tertiary education as in 1990. This expansion has resulted in greater numbers of students, with greater variation in their knowledge, experience, age, social and ethnic background, language proficiency and goals. Universities must now also provide adequate support for students with special needs. In addition, the number of places available to university students has increased more rapidly than the number of teachers.</p>
<p>The increased autonomy of universities has led to an increase in the number of administrative tasks delegated to institutions and their teachers. The new degree ordinance and the new bachelors’ and masters’ degrees introduced in 1993 have resulted in longer programmes requiring independent degree projects.</p>
<p>Developments in information and communication technology (ICT) have created new conditions for higher education, permitting learning and teaching to be less dependent on time and place. ICT also requires the development of new knowledge and skills. Altogether, both teachers and students face great challenges in today’s universities.</p>
<h2>Goals of Higher Education</h2>
<p>Various investigations show that working life today requires advanced skills and knowledge of specific areas, the ability to develop and renew that knowledge and those skills as well as the ability to identify and formulate new problems. Employers also look for the capacity to change as a result of changing external circumstances. Further requirements are the ability to work and cooperate in groups, networks and projects, social and intercultural competence, oral and written skills in Swedish and English and the ability to handle ICT tools.</p>
<p>These abilities musts be developed in academic programmes, and we therefore propose that the Higher Education Act be amended accordingly.</p>
<h2>Diversity in Higher Education</h2>
<p>While the increasing heterogeneity of Swedish university students during the last decade has broadened the perspectives of education programmes, it also presents a challenge recognised by today’s institutions of higher education. Efforts are being made to recruit students from homes without academic traditions, to facilitate the transition from secondary school to university, and to support students in both initial and subsequent stages of their university studies. Measures taken include introduction courses (whether short or long), mentors and language training (primarily in Swedish, but to some extent in English, as well). Other measures concern improved access via part time studies and distance education.</p>
<p>We find that increased diversity and changing goals have consequences for learning and teaching and implications for information to students and teachers. These changes require efforts to improve the educational competence of university staff.</p>
<p>Steps need to be taken to acquaint new students with the basic values and working methods of the academic world. Examples of how this can be achieved are to be found at several institutions now working systematically to increase and be inspired by social and ethnic diversity while clarifying their goals and strategies through the formulation and implementation of policies and action programmes.</p>
<p>Special funds should be allocated at both national and institutional levels for projects aiming at adapting, not merely student recruitment and introduction, but also the organisation and methods of teaching and learning, to the increased heterogeneity of student backgrounds and goals.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the government allocate 60 million Swedish kronor over three years i.e. 180 million Swedish kronor for measures for educational support to new groups in higher education. The use of these special funds is to be reported annually and the measures are to be evaluated continuously, prospective students applying to an introductory semester be admitted on a temporary basis without having to meet formal eligibility requirements other than in Swedish and English. For students successfully completing this introductory semester, temporary eligibility will be converted into general eligibility, pedagogical training for academic teachers and other staff actively consider the educational consequences of increasing diversity in Swedish higher education, networks be formed among institutions of higher education to develop measures for recruiting and supporting new groups in higher education. The funds proposed above should be made available for such purposes, as well, networks between secondary schools and higher education institutions be further developed to facilitate the transition from secondary school to university and the government allocate special funding to the Council for the Renewal of Higher Education for the support of major pedagogical projects of national interest as regards diversity in higher education; such projects should focus not merely on the educational challenges, but also on the advantages to be derived from this diversity.</p>
<h2>Equal Opportunities and Gender</h2>
<p>A number of development projects have been carried out in the 1990s aiming at supporting and improving equal opportunities in universities. Most such programmes have concerned measures to increase the proportion of women in science and technology programmes and to enhance their opportunities for successful studies. Far fewer efforts have been made to support men in programmes with a significant majority of women.</p>
<p>More development projects are needed, both at the institutional level and nationally. The Council for the Renewal of Higher Education should support further projects at the national level. Special efforts should be made to disseminate information about successful projects.</p>
<p>Various models of teaching and examination that provide support for the underrepresented gender should be implemented and evaluated. As current research does not conclusively indicate how different working methods affect women’s and men’s learning, and considerable variations may be noted within the respective genders, further studies of learning and the effects of teaching models should be carried out. It is important that learning environments that suit many different groups of students be made available.</p>
<p>Mentors and role models are important for students and teachers in programmes with a significant under representation of men or women. Priority should therefore be given to the recruitment and support of teachers of the underrepresented gender.</p>
<h2>Students with disabilities in higher education</h2>
<p>Today there are about 2 100 students with disabilities who either receive support from their educational institution or who have contacted the institution administrator in charge of handicap matters. Both absolutely and relatively, this is a smaller number than in upper secondary school.</p>
<p>The learning environment for disabled students can vary, but all institutions are required to have a policy programme and an action programme for disabled students. As mandated by Swedish law, special funding is available (financed by a compulsory contribution), corresponding to 0.15 per cent of their budget for undergraduate education. Universities that have taken measures requiring more funds may receive additional funding by the government.</p>
<p>Examples of such efforts include writing and spelling courses for dyslectics, help with note-taking and reading, sign language interpretation for the deaf and hearing-impaired, and alternative examination procedures including prolonged examination time. A great deal nevertheless remains to be done in order to guarantee reasonable accessibility and improved psycho-social study conditions. One of the major problems is information to students about support and assistance, and to institutions and teachers about the needs of disabled students. Few institutions have hitherto provided support for psychologically handicapped students, but universities are now rewriting their policies to include this category.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes better information to disabled pupils in secondary school wishing to pursue higher studies, as well as to disabled first-term university students and other students. Information to departments and individual teachers is also important in this context, early information from the National Admissions Agency (VHS) to institutions about applications from disabled applicants and early contacts between disabled students and their institution, an organisation at each institution with a disability-programme administrator reporting directly to the Rector. For the individual student, however, the primary responsibility must devolve upon the departments concerned, increased production of specially designed pedagogical material, measures to develop the competence of the institution, its departments and teachers when working with students with various disabilities and additional funds to institutions for pedagogical support in relationship to the number of students with disabilities.</p>
<h2>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in higher education</h2>
<p>One of the most important challenges in higher education in the 1990s is the development of ICT and its applications to teaching and research. All universities and colleges today have special departments for the development of ICT and many have an additional organisation for its use in learning and teaching. Major funding has been committed to development projects for learning and teaching at both the institutional level and centrally, through e.g. the Council for the Renewal of Higher Education. Over 50 per cent of the Council’s projects have dealt with various aspects of ICT implementation in higher education.</p>
<p>A key aspect of ICT is finding, handling and communicating information. ICT has become decisive for the development of distance education and flexible learning, while computers are now prerequisites for successful writing, advanced calculations and simulations.</p>
<p>Sweden is currently in the forefront as regards the use of campus-based ICT. On a national scale, a number of countries are now developing systems for distance education in co-operation between institutions. Finland, for example, is currently developing a “virtual university” which is expected to be fully operative in 2004. A first initiative in this direction has already been taken in Sweden, and these efforts should receive continued support.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that institutions be stimulated to continue the development of ICT in higher education as a natural tool in learning and teaching. Institutions should take particular note of the risk that students without easy access to computers may thereby find themselves in a relatively less favourable study environment; adequate measures should be taken to diminish this gap. Teachers and students should receive training that will enable them to use ICT effectively and an electronic “virtual university” be developed in Sweden. All higher education institutions should be offered the opportunity to participate and contribute, possibly together with other organisations and business and industry. Both courses and entire study programmes should be made available. The Government should allocate 30 million Swedish kronor per year over the next three years for the development of such a project.</p>
<h2>Support for renewal of learning and teaching</h2>
<p>Support for learning and teaching at the institutional level</p>
<p>The level of ambition regarding educational development at universities and colleges has been raised in the latter half of the 1990s. Most universities have had educational development units for many years and colleges are now in the process of establishing such centres. In both absolute and relative figures, however, more resources are still spent at the large universities. We maintain that centres for educational development should be established at all higher education institutions, as a result of increasing needs for renewal of learning and teaching.</p>
<p>The activities of such development units should include support to institutions, programmes and individual teachers. Many institutions finance local projects on learning and teaching, supervision of theses, examination, evaluation, aspects of equal opportunities, internationalisation etc. and publish the results. Several universities and colleges also organise recurrent conferences for their students and teachers, thus facilitating the dissemination of project results and encouraging discussion of issues concerning learning and teaching, examination and evaluation.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the individual teacher, the department and the institution to take initiatives that will develop learning and teaching. The role of the department is especially important in this respect. Each institution must allocate sufficient resources for educational development.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that all higher education institutions establish an organisation to support learning and teaching, particularly for smaller institutions of higher education, interuniversity cooperation as regards educational development be considered as an alternate approach and particular attention be paid to the department responsibility for educational development and further education of staff; this should be followed up in the university quality enhancement programme.</p>
<p>Research and national development projects</p>
<p>There is little funding at the national level dedicated to research on learning and teaching in higher education in Sweden today. A certain amount of research is, however, conducted at universities. Much of it continues the Swedish phenomenographic tradition from the 1970s. Other areas include studies on student-centred teaching approaches. A number of these studies deal with learning in specific programmes, especially teacher education and programmes for the caring professions. It is difficult to obtain overall information on these areas of research.</p>
<p>For development projects there is both national support and funding through internal allocation within each university. National support is channelled primarily via the Council for the Renewal of Higher Education. The Committee has a special brief to analyse the performance of the Council and to propose organisational changes. We find that the Council has been successful in its support of teacher-initiated development projects and that it has established important national networks and international contacts. Its role as a counterpart to the research councils has been of a certain significance in raising the status of undergraduate education but its impact on universities and colleges has been somewhat limited. As higher education institutions face new challenges the Council should modify its strategy and also focus on projects of importance to the long-term development of an institution. The position of the Council within the National Agency for Higher Education is unsuitable for the independent fulfilment of its mission, and another organisational solution should be found.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that support for research on learning and teaching in higher education be one of the priorities of a committee within the newly established National Research Council and the Council for the Renewal of Higher Education continue its activities. It should be transformed into an independent national agency with the additional charge to support key persons responsible for educational development at universities and colleges, the Council develop its activities to disseminate information on national and international research and development of learning and teaching in higher education and the Council focus more on projects in line with the strategic development of learning and teaching at universities and colleges.</p>
<h2>Pedagogical training of academic teachers</h2>
<p>National level</p>
<p>A number of people, including educational consultants, heads of departments and directors of studies, are responsible for training and educational development at institutions of higher education. It is important that these key persons be offered opportunities to participate in further training at the national level and to participate in and develop existing networks.</p>
<p>Institutional level</p>
<p>Pedagogical training for academic teachers is offered at most institutions today, but programmes vary in content, depth and extent. Previous commissions on learning and teaching have proposed that pedagogical training should be made a condition for tenure for academic teachers. The expansion of higher education today and the new demands facing academic teachers as a result of that expansion make it necessary to establish a minimum level of pedagogical training to obtain tenure. Part of this training could also be included as a course in postgraduate programmes.</p>
<p>Nearly half the number of teachers in academic institutions are lecturers (adjunkter) and they do the majority of undergraduate teaching, even though many of them have little or no experience of research. One of the main characteristics of learning and teaching in higher education is the link to research. We argue that in order to maintain this link it is important that lecturers be offered further research-based training in masters’ or doctoral programmes.</p>
<p>The committee proposes that for lecturers, associate professors and professors to receive tenure they should have completed a training course for academic teachers corresponding to ten weeks’ full time work, further training should be offered on a continual annual basis after the initial ten-week training, the government should allocate special funds amounting to 40 million Swedish kronor annually over a period of three years for the development of training programmes for academic teachers, it should be the responsibility of departments to actively encourage such training, 800 lecturers (adjunkter) without doctorates should be offered the opportunity to take a three-semester master’s degree focussing on research and/or didactics in their field of specialisation and that the government should support this through a special grant of 20 million Swedish kronor annually over six years and the government should provide a grant of 20 million Swedish kronor annually over a period of six years to support doctoral studies by lecturers (adjunkter).</p>
<h2>Rewarding good teaching</h2>
<p>The Higher Education Ordinance states that “the same care shall be given to the scrutiny of teaching skills as to that of scientific skills”. It is essential that higher education institutions establish criteria for teaching skills for the purposes of employment and promotion. Criteria for good teaching have been proposed by previous commissions and have been formally accepted by many universities and colleges. However, applicants do not always submit documentation of teaching experience, nor do experts and appointments boards pay sufficient attention to such documentation.</p>
<p>In a 1999 reform, it became possible for Swedish universities to promote qualified associate professors to full professor. This change has made it even more necessary for teachers to plan and document their careers and for heads of department to organise departmental activities so as to assist the future careers of their staff. Systematically developed portfolios have proved to be useful instruments both for teachers, heads of departments and promotion committees. It should be the responsibility of educational institutions to contribute to the establishment of such portfolios and to see to it that they are considered in employment, promotion and salary negotiations.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that for appointment committees one of the outside experts be assigned the task of reviewing applicants’ educational qualifications, the Higher Education Ordinance be changed to the effect that the same importance should be attached to teaching skills as to other grounds for eligibility, all institutions establish guidelines to be used by experts, committees and applicants for the assessment of pedagogical qualifications and all institutions prepare models for portfolios. These models should function as a basis for discussions between teachers and department heads and as a tool for systematic in-service training. They should also be an instrument for decisions regarding appointments, promotions and salary negotiations.</p>
<p>Other forms of rewards</p>
<p>The Committee finds it essential that excellence in teaching at universities and colleges be recognised and rewarded. Teaching awards are an important form of encouragement for the individual teacher. They also demonstrate that the institution supports good teaching. It is, however, just as important that good teaching be rewarded in other ways. Salary increases or sabbaticals for educational development work or for studies of university teaching in other institutions or other countries should be provided as equally valid forms of reward.</p>
