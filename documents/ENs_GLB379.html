<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The task of an insurance intermediary is to aid his principal (the insurance client) to purchase insurance that, as much as possible, corresponds to the client’s insurance needs. For a long time it was not possible for insurance intermediaries to operate in Sweden, as insurance undertakings had so called procurement agreements which meant that insurance only could be sold through the undertakings’ own employees or their agents. The main purpose of the Insurance Intermediaries Act (1989:508), which took effect on January 1st, 1990, was to clarify that it would be possible to acquire insurance from insurance brokers at the same time that it established requirements, that are important from a client’s point of view, for the activity of intermediating in insurance. The Insurance Intermediaries Act includes provisions for the activity of insurance intermediary that pertain to Business Law as well as some provisions pertaining to Civil Law.</p>
<p>The term ’insurance intermediary’ applies to both artificial and physical persons, who act as professional intermediaries in the sale of insurances directly to various principals, by insurers that are independent of each other, including insurers that are not established in Sweden. After certain review, insurance intermediaries are registered with the Financial Supervisory Authority and remain under the supervision of this body.</p>
<p>There has been a continuous, heavy increase in the number of insurance intermediaries in Sweden. At the beginning of 1997, approximately 830 physical persons and approximately 270 artificial persons were registered as insurance brokers. In most cases, the activity of intermediating in insurance is carried out within the framework of a limited company. Currently, approximately 30 per cent of the insurance volume is mediated by insurance brokers. The majority of the insurance brokers are members of the Swedish Insurance Brokers’ Association.</p>
<p>The purpose of this investigation was to use experience gained from the application of the existing law and from the developments in the insurance business to recommend necessary amendments to</p>
<p>the law, in order to secure a sound development in the activity of intermediating in insurance and to increase the protection of those who acquire insurance through insurance brokers.</p>
<p>The investigation was undertaken as present legal regulations proved to be inadequate in certain respects (which are specified in the directives of the investigation). The directives of the investigation did not include any hindrance to include also other matters (that are closely related to the matters specifically set out in the directives) associated with the activity of intermediating in insurance in the investigation. Furthermore, the directives declare that there are no plans to extend the legislation to include other parties that are active in the insurance business, e.g., insurance consultants and other advisers.</p>
<p>During the course of the investigation, the investigator was given the specific task of proposing rules that should govern the activity of cross-border insurance intermediating that brokers from other EEA countries may want to pursue in Sweden. This issue is related to the measures taken within the European Union regarding the activity of intermediating in insurance. In 1976, the EC Council adopted a directive concerning measures to facilitate the effective exercise of freedom of establishement and freedom to provide services for the taking up and pursuit of activities of insurance agent or broker and specifically concerning transitional measures for such activities (77/92/EEC). With reference to this directive, certain changes have already been made in the present Insurance Intermediaries Act. In 1991, the EC Commission adopted an additional recommendation concerning insurance intermediaries (92/48/EEC). This recommendation deals with certain qualifications and conditions, such as fitness and properness and professional indemnity insurance, and with registration of insurance intermediaries.</p>
<p>The investigation has resulted in a proposal for a law concerning the activity of intermediating in insurance. According to this proposal, the law’s area of application  is delimited by the definition of the term ’activity of insurance intermediary’ as opposed to a definition of the term ’insurance intermediary’ in the existing law. The purpose of this change is to improve the clarity of the law as to what kind of activities it covers. The intention is to include all activities that are normally pursued by a brokerage firm. The definition includes both the activity of intermediating in insurance, which is the core activity in a firm of brokers, and other activities that are pursued in the same company as the activity of intermediating in insurance that concern aid in insurance and risk</p>
<p>related matters.</p>
<p>In accordance with the changes implemented in the legislation a few years ago concerning the activity of intermediating in securities, an insurance broker shall, as a side activity  also henceforth, under certain conditions, be able to pursue the activity of intermediating in shares of securities funds. New, according to this proposal, is that it shall no longer be an obvious right to combine the activity of intermediating in insurance products with other activities. When special circumstances render it desirable, the supervisory authority shall, however, be allowed to permit the pursuit of certain other activities. A prerequisite for a permit is that it can be assumed that it will facilitate the activity of intermediating in insurance products.</p>
<p>When it comes to type of business , insurance intermediaries are currently free to carry on their activities both as a limited company and as a private firm. Based on an interest in increased stability in, and public control of, the activity of intermediating in insurance, the investigator has chosen to propose that only limited companies be allowed to intermediate in insurance products.</p>
<p>To  be registered as a firm of insurance brokers , independence of the insurers’ interests is still required, as well as a professional indemnity insurance for protection against any indemnity liability that may befall the company. A new general requirement for carrying on the activity of intermediating in insurance is that the activities shall be carried out in a manner that upholds the public’s general confidence in the business and also in a manner that meets the general requirements for a sound business. In order for a registration application to be approved, the planned business shall be deemed to be able to meet the requirements for a sound business. Further requirements for registration according to the proposal are that: the  share-capital  be adapted to the nature and scope of the business with a minimum amount set to SEK 200,000 (in lieu of SEK 100,000, as is stated in the Companies Act); a sufficient number, also with regard to nature and scope of business, of registered insurance brokers be on the Board of Directors, and – with regard to the specific nature of the activity of intermediating in insurance products – there be requirements for fitness and properness of members of the board, the managing director and the assistant managing director. The assessment of an application for registration shall, according to the proposal, henceforth be based on an  activity plan , i.e., a plan for the activities in the planned business.</p>
<p>Physical persons  who are to mediate in insurance products on behalf of an insurance broker shall also be registered  according to this proposal. Thus, the investigator has not found it appropriate to abandon the present order of also registering physical brokers, which makes it possible, when necessary, for the supervisory authority to intervene against an individual broker without having to go via the management of the brokerage firm. This decision has been made in consideration of the fact that the regulating of the activity of intermediating in insurance in the European Union is based on registration of the physical brokers in the other member states. The criteria for registration of a physical person shall be – as they currently are – fitness for the task and fulfilment of the requirement that is basic for the activity of insurance intermediary, i.e., independence of insurers' interests. A proposed additional requirement for education is that the applicant shall have experience in the planned fields of activities.</p>
<p>The registration  shall, as is the case at present, be administered by the supervisory authority, i.e., The Financial Supervisory Authority.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the registration henceforth be based on the classification system  used in the Insurance Companies Act, i.e., life insurance and damage insurance , rather than on the present system of personal insurance and damage insurance. If a firm of brokers or an individual broker specializes in intermediating in a certain type of insurance, it shall be possible to grant registration for the insurance classes that correspond to the competence in the brokerage firm or to the competence of the individual broker. The main rule shall be that a physical insurance broker shall not be able to register to intermediate in both life insurance and damage insurance. This shall, however, be possible for a firm of brokers if it possesses competence in both areas. The requirements that should be applied to the brokers' education and experience  shall be specified in directives issued by the government or by The Financial Supervisory Authority.</p>
<p>Ever since the introduction of the Insurance Intermediaries Act, the conditions of the professional indemnity insurance  have been a subject of discussion, and they have also been changed a couple of times. The main topic of discussion has been the basis of the conditions – whether they should be based on the principle of "causation" or the principle of "claims made". Conditions based on causation result in compensation for damages caused by the broker when the insurance is in force. To get compensation when the conditions are based on the principle of claims made, the damage</p>
<p>must be reported while the insurance is in force and have been caused after a certain date specified in the insurance policy. A main problem has been the non-acceptance on the international reinsurance market of conditions based on the principle of causation. According to the present regulations, causation is applicable in principle. When intermediating in damage insurance to clients who are companies with more than ten full-time employees, conditions based on the principle of claims made are allowed provided they are combined with a two-year supplementary protection to cover a situation where a firm of brokers has discontinued its activities.</p>
<p>The investigator’s proposal implies that the law, also henceforth, shall include only one general directive with regard to obligatory professional indemnity insurance for insurance brokers. Details of the directives are to be specified by the government or The Financial Supervisory Authority. The investigator proposes continued use of conditions based on the principle of causation with regard to the activity of intermediating in life insurance and acceptance of conditions based on the principle of claims made for the intermediation in all types of damage insurance, provided they are combined with a three-year supplementary protection to cover a situation where a brokerage company has discontinued its activities. The highest compensation to be paid in case of loss that is covered by a life insurance shall, according to this proposal, correspond to a minimum of 200 basic amounts. For damage insurance, this amount shall correspond to a minimum of 600 basic amounts.</p>
<p>A central point in the legislation concerning insurance intermediaries is that the insurance brokers shall be independent with regard to the interests of the insurer . The investigator does not propose specification of the requirement for independence in the law. The general requirements for being a sound business and the requirements for compliance with ethical conduct when intermediating in insurance products shall should form the basis for assessment of upcoming issues.</p>
<p>In the supervisory work conducted by The Financial Supervisory Authority, questions have been raised concerning the status of assistants  and others who aid insurance brokers with their tasks. Also on this matter, the investigator refrains from submitting any proposals for legislation. In view of the system of registering individuals who are deemed to possess the necessary competence, and in consideration of the requirement for ethical conduct with regard to the activity of intermediating in insurance, it should be</p>
<p>possible to handle upcoming issues without legislation. It is, among other things, pointed out as obvious that registered brokers shall make all important decisions and handle all important client contacts personally.</p>
<p>No change is proposed to the present system of remuneration to brokers  that applies in Sweden, as well as internationally. The broker can receive remuneration from his principal, work on commission or obtain another type of remuneration from the insurer. The present law states that an insurance broker, at the request of his principal, is obliged to inform the principal of any remuneration from the insurer.</p>
<p>The most common procedure is, actually, that the broker is remunerated by the insurer. At the end, however, it is the insured who pays this remuneration by means of the premium to the insurer. As the insurance broker represents the insurance client, it is pointed out in the considerations of the investigator that, in principle, it is natural that the insured is informed about the broker’s remuneration. This would also give the client a chance to find out if the broker has been influenced by interests that are irrelevant for his choice of insurance product that best corresponds to the client’s needs. Against this system that would extend the obligation to information, it has been alleged that the present remuneration systems, especially in the area of life insurance, are so complicated that it can be assumed that the client has great difficulties in comparing the available options on the basis of the information they are given. Furthermore, it has been stressed by insurance brokers that life insurance companies do not have obligation to information with regard to the commission these companies pay their own salesmen. The various considerations have resulted in a proposal that an insurance broker shall always inform a client who is a consumer of the remuneration he receives for the various insurance options from the various insurers. The rule is optional for clients who are companies, and the parties may thus agree on handling the matter differently. It can be added that the investigator takes it for granted that the obligation to provide information regarding commissions on life insurance is reviewed, in order to make it possible for an insurance client to compare various options at hand.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the  obligation to provide information with regard to consumer insurance be extended to apply throughout the period of validity of the insurance. A provision for this is, of course, that the broker’s mandate remains unchanged during this period. The principle should be that, as long as the broker’s</p>
<p>mandate remains unchanged, the firm of brokers shall have the same responsibility to provide information in accordance with Business Law as the insurer does. If the new Insurance Agreements Act, which is now being formulated, extends the insurance undertakings’ obligation to provide information to also include personal insurance and company insurance, the responsibility of the firms of brokers should be extended correspondingly.</p>
<p>With regard to the cross-border  activities  that may be carried on by insurance intermediaries from other EEA countries, the proposal assumes that the intermediaries are registered in ther home countries. No further registration shall be required according to Swedish law. However, The Financial Supervisory Authority requires a letter of intent one month prior to the start of the activities. To this letter shall be attached certificates with regard to professional experience and fitness in accordance with the rules in the Council directive of 1977, and proof of existing, satisfactory professional indemnity insurance for the business, or other indemnity of equivalent value. Brokers who are not registered in their home country are not allowed to carry on cross-border activities in Sweden. They shall have to establish themselves here through a subsidiary, whereby they have to register in accordance with the stipulations in the Insurance Intermediaries Act.</p>
<p>With regard to the supervisory rules , the investigator proposes that, as a general guideline for the supervisory work carried out by the Financial Supervisory Authority, it be stated that the Financial Supervisory Authority shall act to promote sound development in the activity of intermediating in insurance. Some changes are proposed with regard to the sanctional means of warning and revocation of registration. The present rules indicate that the Financial Supervisory Authority may choose between a warning, if such a reaction is deemed adequate, and a revocation, if registration requirements are no longer being met and for certain other serious offences. According to the law proposal, the Financial Supervisory Authority shall be able to use the sanctional means of warning if a firm of brokers or an individual broker exhibits inappropriate behaviour in the line of business. If the Financial Supervisory Authority determines that the registration requirements are no longer being met, the registration shall be revoked.</p>
<p>Specific transitional measures are proposed mainly due to the new requirements for type of business, increased share-capital and a special permit for side activities. The new law is proposed to take effect on July 1, 1998.</p>
