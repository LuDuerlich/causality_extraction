<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>A new national system for assessing knowledge</h2>
<p>The Inquiry on National Tests proposes a new national system for assessing knowledge, consisting of three components. The system comprises national tests, national assessment support materials and national knowledge evaluation. The National Agency for Education will be given an overall remit to develop the national tests, assessment support and knowledge evaluation components. The remit will include disseminating information about the new system for assessing knowledge and its various components, and providing training in the system.</p>
<p>A distinct purpose for each part of the knowledge assessment system</p>
<p>The national tests currently serve two purposes: to support equal and fair assessment and grading, and to provide data for an analysis of the extent to which the knowledge requirements are met at school level, education authority level and national level. These two purposes are difficult to combine in the same test. The Inquiry therefore concludes that the purposes of the national tests should be clarified and the tests should in future be constructed for a single intended purpose. We propose that this purpose should be to support grading. This will enable the national tests to reinforce equal grading and strengthen pupils’ legal rights.</p>
<p>The national tests should no longer be constructed for the purpose of providing data for an analysis of the extent to which the knowledge requirements are met at school level, education authority level and national level. This purpose will instead be served at national level by a new system for national knowledge evaluation. At school and education authority level, grades should be the primary source of data for an analysis of the extent to which the knowledge requirements are met. As a complement to the grades, local evaluation tests based on past national knowledge evaluation tasks can be used.</p>
<p>The National Agency for Education currently produces various types of assessment support materials. These vary considerably in their design. Because of the variation, it is difficult to obtain an overview of the existing types of assessment support. Moreover, the specific purpose of each type of assessment support material is unclear. In view of this, we propose that the purpose of the different types of national assessment support should be clarified. Assessment support should be compulsory or for voluntary use by teachers. Compulsory forms of assessment support should have a diagnostic purpose, i.e. they should be used to determine pupils’ knowledge levels with respect to syllabuses and knowledge requirements, and they should indicate pupils’ strengths and weaknesses in the subject concerned. Voluntary assessment support should have one of three purposes: support for grading, diagnostic or formative.</p>
<p>The National Agency for Education shall disseminate information about the national tests and the various forms of national assessment support materials and their purposes. In addition, the National Agency for Education shall disseminate information about the purpose of national knowledge evaluation.</p>
<h2>National tests</h2>
<p>At present, teachers conducting national tests take a predominantly positive view of the tests. Many consider that the national tests provide useful support in assessment and grading. Pupils also appreciate the national tests and the support they give the teachers in their grading, but many pupils find the tests stressful. The main downside from the teachers’ perspective is that the national tests are time-consuming. Teachers report that it takes a great deal of time to conduct the tests, mark and assess pupils’ answers and report and follow up on the results.</p>
<p>In recent years the number of national tests has increased, particularly in compulsory school and equivalent types of school.</p>
<p>Subject tests have been introduced in mathematics, Swedish and Swedish as a second language in year 3. The tests in English, mathematics, Swedish and Swedish as a second language that were previously voluntary in year 5 have now been made compulsory and are conducted in year 6. National tests in science subjects and social science subjects have been introduced in years 6 and 9. However, the year 6 tests in science and social science subjects were made voluntary in spring 2015 and were replaced by voluntary assessment support in spring 2016. In view of the large number of national tests, the spring term of year 9 is felt by both pupils and teachers to be particularly test-intensive. The national tests are very timeconsuming and interrupt teaching time. Research lends no real support to the idea that more tests improve teaching.</p>
<p>Instead of national tests conducted at specific times, many teachers would prefer various types of assessment support that they can use in their teaching. The advantage of such support is that the teachers can use it as and when appropriate for their pupils and their teaching. The Inquiry considers that the number of compulsory national tests should be reduced and some of the tests should be replaced by national assessment support materials. However, pupils should take compulsory national tests at certain points in time in compulsory school, special school and Sami school, as well as in upper secondary school and municipal adult education at upper secondary level, as the tests enable more equal grading and strengthen pupils’ legal rights. The term national tests  should be used in all types of school.</p>
<p>A reduced number of national tests</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the current national tests in mathematics, Swedish and Swedish as a second language in year 3 of compulsory school and Sami school and year 4 of special school should be</p>
<p>Inquiry’s remit therefore does not cover SFI. In cases where our proposals have direct consequences for tests in SFI, we have also made proposals on changes in those tests. In these cases it is a matter of consequential changes, not changes that materially affect the tests. One such change is that we propose that the term ‘national tests’ should be used in</p>
<p>SFI as well. replaced by national assessment support. Assessment support should be compulsory for teachers to use. The assessment support should have a diagnostic purpose, i.e. it should be used to determine pupils’ knowledge levels with respect to syllabuses and knowledge requirements for their school year, and to indicate pupils’ strengths and weaknesses in the subject concerned.</p>
<p>National tests should be held in years 6 and 9 of compulsory school and in upper secondary school. In special school, the same tests should be used as in compulsory school, but in years 7 and 10. The tests in year 6 of compulsory school should also be used in Sami school. The tests that are used in upper secondary school should also be used in municipal adult education at upper secondary level. In years 6 and 9 of compulsory school, national tests should be held in the subjects English, mathematics, Swedish and Swedish as a second language. They should be compulsory for teachers to use and pupils to take. With regard to year 6, the national tests in science and social science subjects have already been replaced by voluntary assessment support. The same should apply in year 9, i.e. the present national tests in science and social science subjects in year 9 should be replaced by national assessment support designed to support grading, which should be for voluntary use by teachers.</p>
<p>In upper secondary school, as at present, national tests should be held in the following courses: English 5 and 6, mathematics 1, 2, 3 and 4, and Swedish and Swedish as a second language 1 and 3. As upper secondary school is course-based, the grades in each course have a decisive influence on pupils’ final grades and their chances of obtaining a place in higher education. The more advanced courses in English and mathematics are particularly important since, in addition to contributing to eligibility for higher education, they can also give extra credit points. For this reason we propose that the national tests should be compulsory for teachers to use and pupils to take only in the highest final course in the programme. In the other courses, the national tests may be used on a voluntary basis. In addition, there will be voluntary national assessment support that provides support in grading and is similar to the national tests. In municipal adult education at upper secondary level, the national tests should be compulsory in those listed courses that a pupil is taking, just as at present.</p>
<p>Our proposal means that the number of national tests a pupil will have to take will decrease as compared to the present situation. In year 9 of compulsory school, a pupil now has to take five compulsory tests; under the proposal, this number will fall to three. For most pupils in preparatory programmes for higher education at upper secondary school, the proposal will halve the number of compulsory tests as compared with the present situation.</p>
<p>Oral test components in mathematics should be replaced by national assessment support to support grading</p>
<p>The oral components of the national tests are very time-consuming to conduct. In English, Swedish and Swedish as a second language, the oral content makes up a large part of each subject. The subject of mathematics, on the other hand, does not place as much emphasis on oral content. Teachers consider that the ability to communicate mathematics can be more suitably assessed in classroom lessons than in a national test. The oral test components in mathematics are time-consuming without sufficiently increasing the basis for assessment available to teachers. In light of this, the Inquiry considers that oral test components in mathematics should be replaced by voluntary national assessment support to support grading. This will give teachers access to support that can be used in lessons when teachers consider it appropriate. The assessment support also sends a signal that communication is important in mathematics, but there are better ways to test this ability than by a national test.</p>
<p>As regards the oral test components in English, Swedish and Swedish as a second language, we consider that in the longer term these should be recorded. This will provide documentation of the oral test components and facilitate co-assessment. These regulations should apply beginning when all national tests are computer-based and are conducted in a digital testing platform, so that the recordings can be processed by the system automatically.</p>
<p>Time devoted to the national tests should be reviewed</p>
<p>Even if the number of compulsory national tests decreases, there is still a risk of timetable congestion. To minimise this risk, the amount of time required by the national tests should be reviewed. The ambition should be that the total time pupils spend on tests should decrease compared with today. This can be achieved in various ways, for example, by reducing the number of test components or the time required by each test component, or by altering the division between different types of tasks in the national tests.</p>
<p>The current national tests consist of various types of tasks. Some of these only require short answers from pupils and are relatively easily assessed (e.g. multiple choice and short answer tasks). Others require longer answers from pupils and more complex assessments (e.g. essays, oral tasks and tasks in which pupils are required to show their solutions).</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the national tests should have a reasonable balance between different types of tasks. At present, some national tests contain few multiple choice or short answer tasks. As a result, the precision of measurement offered by these tests is not adequate and they are also very time-consuming for teachers. When the national tests are produced, we therefore feel that the designers should consider what abilities can be assessed using some kind of multiple choice or short answer tasks. However, more complex tasks, such as essays, oral tasks and tasks in which pupils must show their working should still be a part of the national tests.</p>
<p>The collection of national test results should be simplified</p>
<p>In order to see whether the national tests work as grading support, the Inquiry considers that test results should continue to be collected at national level. At present, a great deal of data has to be submitted: not only pupils’ national test results, but also background data. At upper secondary school level in particular, the background data is extensive. To facilitate reporting and reduce the time spent on it, we consider that the National Agency for Education should review its regulations with respect to what data education authorities are required to provide. The starting point for the review should be that only data necessary and useful should be collected. This may mean that some of the data that is collected at present will no longer be needed but also that new data is collected because it is necessary and needs to be used.</p>
<p>In our view, teachers do not have to be involved in reporting the results. When the national tests are conducted digitally, it will be possible to have results reported automatically via the digital testing system. Until then, we consider that the education authorities should develop their procedures for the reporting of test results, for example by allowing an administrator or assistant to conduct the reporting.</p>
<p>Measures should be taken to ease pupils’ workload during test periods</p>
<p>The national test periods are considered stressful by pupils. Although the Inquiry proposes that the number of compulsory national tests should be reduced, measures can also be taken by education authorities and schools. We consider that principals and teachers should take measures to ease pupils’ workload during test periods. Measures should include timely information to pupils about the national tests, what will be tested and what is required of pupils. Pupils should also be given access to examples of tasks from past national tests. In addition, teachers should carefully plan their setting of other tests and hand-in assessments during national test periods. In the subjects that are tested, teachers should also try to limit the number of other tests and assessments to be submitted during the period in which the national tests are taken. Long-term cross-subject or cross-course planning is necessary to make things easier for pupils.</p>
<p>Gradual digitisation of the national tests</p>
<p>Digitisation of the national tests should be launched, and implemented in stages. In an initial stage, pupils in year 9 of compulsory school, year 10 of special school, in upper secondary school and in municipal adult education at upper secondary level should write national test essays on a computer. This requires the schools to have sufficient access to computers and to be able to guarantee that essays can be written digitally in a secure manner. In the Inquiry’s assessment, most schools have sufficient access to computers to allow pupils in year 9 of compulsory school and in upper secondary school to write their essays on a computer. However, the problem is that computer access varies quite considerably between schools. There may therefore be some schools that need to invest in hardware to be able to meet the requirement that pupils must write essays on a computer.</p>
<p>In a second stage of the digitisation of the national tests, a pilot project of computer-based testing will be launched. This will be conducted between 2018 and 2021.</p>
<p>In a third stage, the new digital national tests will be rolled out across the board. The aim is for all national tests to be digitised by 2022. Principals and teachers should be offered training in connection with this. Example test tasks should also be available to help pupils prepare for the national tests.</p>
<p>More equal assessment of the national tests</p>
<p>To ensure that teachers assessing national tests do not know the pupils’ identities, thus risking an assessment that is influenced by their personal relationship with the pupil, and to ensure that fewer pupils perceive assessments as unfair, the Inquiry proposes that pupils’ answers in the national tests be made anonymous for marking when the tests have been undertaken on a computer. In the initial stage, this proposal means that pupils’ essays in year 9 of compulsory school, year 10 of special school, in upper secondary school and in municipal adult education at upper secondary level should be made anonymous for marking. As the national tests become digitised, all pupils’ answers can gradually be made anonymous. Under our proposal, in the second stage all pupils’ answers in the national tests in all year groups would be made anonymous for marking. This should be possible no later than 2022, when all national tests are due to be computer-based.</p>
<p>External assessment, i.e. when the assessment is made by someone other than the teacher who has taught the pupil, can help make assessments more equal and strengthen pupils’ legal rights. For this reason, we recommend that a higher degree of external assessment be trialled. We therefore propose that a pilot project of external assessment of national tests be undertaken as part of the trial of computer-based tests. This will be conducted between 2018 and 2021. Co-assessment of pupils’ answers should also be trialled in the pilot project.</p>
<p>Design of pilot project on computer-based tests, external assessment and co-assessment</p>
<p>The pilot project of computer-based national tests, external assessment and co-assessment proposed by the Inquiry should be planned and executed by the National Agency for Education. In the planning phase, the Agency should adopt guidelines and decide on the content of the pilot project, and make the necessary preparations with respect to technology, security, the development of new test tasks, assessment of the national tests and reporting of test results, for example. The Agency should also select which schools among compulsory schools, special schools, upper secondary schools and municipal adult education at upper secondary level are to be involved in the pilot project. Both municipal and private education authorities should be included. All school years in which national tests are conducted should be part of the pilot project. The selection of schools should be representative, and account should be taken of pupils with impairments.</p>
<p>The pilot project should be conducted in various formats: feasibility studies, user tests and trials, and also the gradual introduction of new digital national tests. The National Agency for Education shall decide when and to what extent each format should be used in the pilot project. External assessment of pupils’ answers on the national tests should preferably be organised among the different education authorities.</p>
<p>The National Agency for Education or another actor shall evaluate the pilot project. The aim of this evaluation is to determine how the national tests can best be digitised and introduced, and whether and how elements of external assessment and coassessment can be increased. The National Agency for Education shall give government grants to schools involved in the pilot project.</p>
<p>The Agency shall appoint a development group to support the pilot project and the introduction of new digital national tests across the board. The group should assist the Agency and the higher education institutions that develop the national tests. The group should include experts with broad expertise on both the development of tests and technical matters, and should thus also enlist international expertise. In addition, there should be experts in the group who take particular account of the possible needs of pupils with impairments, to ensure that the new digital national tests are, as far as possible, practicable and accessible for all pupils.</p>
<p>A clearer relationship between the national tests and grades</p>
<p>According to current provisions, one of the purposes of the national tests is to support grading. At present, however, there are no provisions outlining the extent to which the national tests should influence grades. It is up to teachers to interpret how national test results should be used to support grading. A number of the teachers we met in our visits to schools and education authorities consider that the role of the national tests in grading is unclear. This was also raised by the pupils we met. Some teachers use the national tests in the same way as any other assessment element, some say that the tests can only elevate grades, while others entirely equate the test results with final grades. The picture we gained from our visits is also borne out by public authorities, organisations and researchers.</p>
<p>The conclusion we draw is that regulation of the role of the national tests in grading is unclear. It is thus understandable that teachers differ in their perceptions. To make assessments more equal and strengthen pupils’ legal rights, the relationship between the national tests and grades must be clarified. We therefore propose that particular account should be taken of the national test results when setting grades in the subject or course. This does not mean that grades should be entirely dictated by the test results, but rather that the national tests should continue to act as a support for grading and that teachers should continue to use all available information about a pupil’s knowledge.</p>
<p>In addition to clarifying how the national tests can support grading at individual level, we believe that further measures are needed to facilitate understanding of the tests’ significance in terms of subject or course grades. We have therefore investigated a model for the relationship between national tests and grades at group level.</p>
<p>At present, the majority of pupils (approximately 65–70 per cent) receive the same subject or course grade as test result. All other pupils receive final grades that are either higher or lower than their test result. The proportion primarily varies between subjects, but also to some extent over time within the same subject. There are also substantial differences between different schools.</p>
<p>The differences between subjects make it difficult to create a uniform model for permitted divergence between national test results and grades at group level. For this reason, we have looked at a model that uses statistics to correct test results upwards in the subjects in which test results are lower than final grades – primarily in mathematics. However, the model has not been finalised: it requires further statistical analysis, which could not be completed within the timescale of the Inquiry. We do not, therefore, propose any model, but rather consider that the National Agency for Education should develop a model for the permitted divergence between national test results and subject or course grades at group level. The model developed by the Agency should build on the background material that we have produced. When the National Agency for Education has developed a model, it can be used as a basis for examining how well the national tests support grading. The model can be used by teachers, principals and education authorities to analyse the role of the national tests in supporting grading at school and education authority level, and as a basis for the Swedish Schools Inspectorate’s supervision.</p>
<p>Increased quality and stability for the national tests over time</p>
<p>Today, the average test results vary from year to year in all subjects and courses at both compulsory school and upper secondary school level. The smallest variations in average test results over time are in English, and the largest in mathematics. Above and beyond these shortcomings in the stability of the national tests, there are also differences between the different tests with respect to how the results are assessed and the principles used to arrive at an aggregated test grade.</p>
<p>To enable the construction of national tests of a high quality, the National Agency for Education should ensure that a common framework for the development of the tests is developed. The framework should outline quality criteria for the testing activities.</p>
<p>It should be used both in the National Agency for Education’s internal work and in the work undertaken in the higher education institutions tasked with developing the national tests. At the end of 2014, the National Agency for Education launched work on a common framework, but this is currently on hold pending the</p>
<p>Inquiry’s proposals. We deem it of the utmost importance that this work be resumed as soon as possible after our report has been submitted and circulated for comment. Once a common framework is in place, the higher education institutions developing the national tests should be tasked with formulating subject-specific frameworks for the various test subjects based on the common framework.</p>
<p>The information for teachers and assessment instructions that accompany the national tests are perceived, by many teachers, to be unclear and unduly comprehensive. In addition, many teachers consider it problematic that the instructions differ so widely between subjects and courses. In light of this, we consider that the common framework for the national tests should include issues of information for teachers and assessment instructions for the tests. The information and instructions should be clarified and developed to ensure that, as far as possible, they follow the same template regardless of subject.</p>
<p>Questions of adaptation of the national tests and access to assistive technology in test situations have frequently been discussed in our work. Both teachers and principals and disability organisations feel that the guidelines for adaptations and assistive technology are unclear. Although the National Agency for Education is already working to clarify these guidelines, we consider that more light needs to be shed on these issues. We therefore consider that the common framework for the national tests should also include issues to do with adaptation of the tests and access to assistive technology in test situations.</p>
<p>The National Agency for Education is tasked by the Government with constructing national tests. Test construction requires a high level of technical and scientific expertise that cannot be expected of the National Agency for Education as an institution. The Agency has thus in turn assigned test construction to various universities and other higher education institutions with documented development- and research-based experience in areas relevant to testing activities. These institutions are responsible for the technical and scientific basis in their respective subjects and tests.</p>
<p>To achieve an overarching technical and scientific basis and be in a position to discuss common issues of principle, the National Agency for Education should appoint a quality assurance group of Swedish and foreign experts with solid scientific expertise and proven experience in the area of test development. The group should monitor the Agency’s and the higher education institutions’ work on test development, follow-up and quality assurance. The quality assurance group should include individuals with special needs expertise to ensure consideration at the construction stage of the national tests for the needs of pupils with various impairments and to ensure that the tests are, as far as possible, practicable and accessible for all pupils.</p>
<h2>National assessment support</h2>
<p>The assessment support currently developed by the National Agency for Education is much appreciated by teachers. To ensure that teachers are supported in their assessments in the various subjects and courses, the Inquiry proposes that the Agency continue to produce assessment support. This should be known as national assessment support .</p>
<p>National assessment support should be digitised at the same time as the national tests, i.e. 2022. The National Agency for Education should be responsible for the process of digitising assessment support.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, there are a number of points on which the current assessment support is unclear, e.g. the aims of the support and what counts as assessment support. To address this lack of clarity, we consider that the National Agency for</p>
<p>Education should be responsible not only for a framework for the national tests, but also for the development of a common framework for the national assessment support. The need for a framework is particularly clear in the case of assessment support for grading.</p>
<h2>National knowledge evaluation</h2>
<p>At present, the national tests are used as the basis for monitoring knowledge at national and local level. However, the national tests are not designed to provide data that is comparable over time, which means that it is not appropriate to use them to measure trends. Experience from international studies such as PISA and TIMSS shows that it is possible to develop evaluations that permit national trends to be measured.</p>
<p>To be able to measure Swedish pupils’ knowledge development over time, and thus obtain more knowledge of the Swedish school system, the Inquiry proposes that a pilot project involving a new system of national knowledge evaluation be launched. The aim of the national knowledge evaluation should be to provide data about knowledge development at national level over time. The pilot project should be undertaken digitally in the form of random sample evaluations. The work on national knowledge evaluation should be governed by a common framework. In addition, subject frameworks should be developed for all subjects included in the pilot project. The system should encompass a considerable number of tasks, but each pupil should only have to answer a selection.</p>
<p>In an initial stage, English in year 9 of compulsory school should be included in the national knowledge evaluation trial. The first trial round should be implemented in the autumn term of 2019. The pilot project should subsequently be expanded to include mathematics and Swedish in year 9 of compulsory school and the final year of upper secondary school (autumn term 2021), science subjects in year 9 (autumn term 2022), social studies subjects in year 9 (autumn term 2023), and cross-disciplinary skills such as ability to cooperate, analytical skills, creativity, motivation and digital skills in year 9 of compulsory school and the final year of upper secondary school (autumn term 2024). The national knowledge evaluation tests in the pilot project should be accompanied by surveys to pupils, teachers and principals.</p>
<p>The National Agency for Education shall be responsible for the precise design of the pilot project. The Agency or another actor should be responsible for evaluating the pilot project. Based on the results of the pilot project, the actor that evaluates it should also produce material to enable the Government to determine whether, and how, the national knowledge evaluation should be made permanent. If it is made permanent, decisions will be needed on the scale and direction of the continued work.</p>
<p>We have proposed an extensive national knowledge evaluation pilot project over a long period of time, in which we in Sweden steer our own evaluation, which is not linked to the international studies. An alternative approach would be to supplement the international studies with a number of additional tasks in the form of a national module. The additional tasks would then correspond to the parts of Swedish policy documents that are not represented in the international studies. If the Government wishes to pursue this alternative approach, it would require further investigation. If the Government wishes to pursue our proposal but considers the pilot project too extensive – and thus costly and time-consuming – it could be scaled back.</p>
<p>In addition to providing data on knowledge development at national level, former tasks that are no longer used in national knowledge evaluation could, as previously mentioned, be used to create evaluation tests for follow-up at school and education authority level. In addition, national knowledge evaluation tests that are replaced after an evaluation round could be used in the national test in the same subject, as long as the tasks are subject to secrecy.</p>
<h2>Financial implications of the Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals involve both cost increases and decreases.</p>
<p>The savings that would result from the proposals are a reduction in the general government grants to the municipal sector due to the national tests in science and social science subjects being replaced with assessment support, and due to the national tests at upper secondary level only being compulsory for the highest final course</p>
<p>in the programme. In addition, digitisation of the national tests will reduce the costs to the education authority for the assessment of pupils’ answers, and to central government for printing and distribution. The cost increases in our proposals primarily consist of the costs of digitising the national tests, and the costs of the national knowledge evaluation. The National Agency for Education would also require additional resources for its work. The table below summarises the cost increases and decreases due to the</p>
<p>Inquiry’s proposals.</p>
