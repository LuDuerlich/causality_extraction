<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The proposals contained in this final report are generally aimed at improving the legal protection of individuals and assisting people who have suffered a violation to get redress and financial compensation for the injury suffered. The new rules should help to increase equality, improve equality between men and women and enhance understanding and openness among people. In a society where people with different interests, different backgrounds, different orientations and different values must live together, this is an ambitious objective, but it is considered that the legislation will have a positive influence on the formation of morals in both the short and long term and any lower level of ambition can hardly be contemplated.</p>
<p>Inadequate equality between men and women, inequality between people, xenophobia and exclusion, mistrust and fear regarding those who ‘are different’, racism and homophobia – these are all social problems that must be attributed priority in an open society. Reality cannot be changed by legislation alone. But legislation is one of several indispensable tools. This final report therefore – in accordance with the remit given to us by the Government – focuses especially on statutory proposals.</p>
<h2>Assignment of the Committee</h2>
<p>To summarise, the assignment of the Committee is to conduct a review of Swedish discrimination legislation and – above all else – deliberate first on having consolidated the legislation against discrimination covering all or most of the grounds of discrimination and areas of society, second the coordination or amalgamation of some or all of the Equal Opportunities Ombudsman, the Ombudsman against Ethnic Discrimination, the Disability Ombudsman and the Ombudsman against Discrimination because of Sexual Orientation. In the deliberations regarding the ombudsmen, the Committee should also when appropriate include the Children’s Ombudsman (Terms of Reference 2002:11 and Supplementary Terms of Reference 2003:69 and 2005:8).</p>

<p>• deliberating on joint legislation against discrimination covering all or most of the grounds of discrimination and areas of society,</p>
<p>• deliberating on whether the protection against disfavouring of people with disabilities owing to inadequate accessibility should be introduced in areas of society other than working life and higher education,</p>
<p>• deliberating on whether a protection against discrimination of all ‘transpersons’ should be introduced,</p>
<p>• deliberating on whether rules on active measures should be introduced in working life for grounds of discrimination other than sex and ethnic background,</p>

<p>• reviewing the areas of responsibility and tasks of the Equality Ombudsman, the Ombudsman against Ethnic Discrimination, the Disability Ombudsman and the Ombudsman against Discrimination because of Sexual Orientation,</p>
<p>• deliberating on the coordination or merger of some or all of these ombudsmen and also on whether the or those future ombudsman institutions that are proposed should report to the Government or to the Riksdag (Swedish Parliament),</p>
<p>• deliberating on the need of some special body/bodies with the tasks that the Equal Opportunities Board and the Board against Discrimination currently have, and in that case in which forms such an operation should be conducted,</p>
<p>• deliberating on how judicial procedure in discrimination cases should be framed,</p>
<p>• deliberating on whether the county administrative boards should be given a supervisory responsibility regarding active measures,</p>

<h2>The preliminary report</h2>
<p>In May 2004, the Committee presented the preliminary report Extended protection against sexual discrimination (Official Government Report - SOU 2004:55). The preliminary report contains proposals for amendments to the Equal Opportunities Act (1991:433), the Equal Treatment of Students at Universities Act (2001:1286), the Prohibition of Discrimination Act (2003:307) and others laws, with the aim of implementing three EC Directives on sex discrimination into Swedish law; namely the Equal Treatment Directive (76/207/EEC), the Social Security Directive (79/7/EEC) and the Self-employment Directive (86/613/EEC). The preliminary report also contains the Committee’s proposals on that part of the assignment regarding the issue of whether legislation against discrimination based on sex should also be introduced into the other areas covered by the Directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (2000/43/EC) than the area of working life and the area of higher education. These areas include access to and the provision of goods and services available to the public, including housing.</p>
<p>The Committee’s proposal contained in the preliminary report was dealt with in the Government Bill Extended protection against sexual discrimination (Government Bill 2004/05:147). New legislation entered into force on 1 July 2005 (Report 2004/05:AU7, Riksdag Communication 2004/05:267).</p>
<h2>Protection of human rights</h2>
<p>Prohibitions against discrimination are found in numerous places in conventions and other instruments on human rights. Article 1 of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that all people are born free and with equal value and rights. Discrimination is prohibited according to Article 2. According to this Article, everyone is entitled to all of the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. Prohibitions against discrimination are also contained in Articles 2.1 and 26 of the UN Convention on Civil and Political Rights, Article 2.2 of the UN Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 2 of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination of Women, Article 5 of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Article 2 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, Article 2 of the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention (no 111) concerning Discrimination in Respect of Employment and Occupation, and of Article 14 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (the European Convention).</p>
<p>The European Union (EU) is founded on the principles of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. This is provided by Article 6.1 of the Treaty on European Union (EU Treaty or the Maastricht Treaty). According to Article 6.2, the Union shall respect fundamental rights as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p>
<p>The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has declared that human rights constitute an integral part of the general principles of law and should be safeguarded by the courts, and that the protection of human rights also embraces the rights contained in the European Convention.</p>
<p>Through Article 13 of the EC Treaty, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and following consultation with the European Parliament, may take appropriate action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. According to Article 21.1 of the Charter on Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the EU Charter), any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.</p>
<p>We conclude that discrimination constitutes a violation of fundamental human rights. Legislation is one means of combating discrimination and thereby supporting fundamental human rights. Proposals for such measures are made in this final report.</p>
<h2>A new law against discrimination</h2>
<p>The situation as it currently stands, where there are numerous laws against discrimination, is difficult to comprehend overall. It could almost be described as patchwork legislation. Our aim is that the statutory proposals submitted in this final report will make the legislation both more effective and more comprehensible.</p>
<p>We therefore propose the introduction of a new Prohibition and other Measures against Discrimination Act. The Act shall have the purpose of combating discrimination and in other ways promoting equal rights and opportunities regardless of sex, sexual identity, ethnic background, religion or other religious belief, disability, sexual orientation or age.</p>
<p>The Act will apply to working life, education, labour market policy activities, the setting-up or running of business operations, practising professions, membership, etc., of employee, employer and professional organisations, goods, services and housing, public meetings and public events, social welfare services, etc., the social insurance system, unemployment insurance, health and medical care services, public study support, compulsory military and compulsory civilian service, and also regarding public appointments and public assignments.</p>
<p>The Act also contains provisions on active measures and prohibitions of discrimination. The Act is divided into four chapters. Chapter 1 contains introductory provisions, including the definition of what is meant by discrimination. Chapter 2 on working life deals with the relationship between employers and employees. Education and other areas of society are dealt with in Chapter 3. Chapter 4 deals with how the supervision of compliance with the Act should be arranged.</p>
<p>Simultaneously with the introduction of the new Act, the following will be repealed: The Equal Opportunities Act (1991:433); the Act (1999:130) on measures against discrimination in working life because of ethnic background, religion or other religious belief; the Prohibition of Discrimination in Working Life of People because of Disability Act (1999:132); the Act (1999:133) on a Ban against Discrimination in Working Life because of Sexual Orientation; the Equal Treatment of Students at Universities Act (2001:1286); the Prohibition of Discrimination Act (2003:307); and the Prohibition of Discrimination Act and other treatment that is unfair against children and pupils. Prohibitions against treatment that is unfair other than discrimination at school are dealt with by a new Chapter 14 a of the Education Act (1985:1100).</p>
<h2>A new, merged ombudsman authority</h2>
<p>We propose that the current four ombudsmen against discrimination –  the Equality Ombudsman (JämO), the Ombudsman against Ethnic Discrimination (DO), the Disability Ombudsman (HO) and the Ombudsman against Discrimination because of Sexual Orientation (HomO) – be amalgamated into one authority, the Office of the Ombudsman against Discrimination (the Ombudsman). The new Ombudsman will exercise supervision of discrimination based on sex, sexual identity, ethnic background, religion or other religious belief, disability, sexual orientation and age.</p>
<p>The Office of the Children’s Ombudsman (BO) should not however be amalgamated with the other ombudsmen.</p>
<p>The new authority should be headed by an ombudsman collective (comprising at least five). One of these should be the administrative manager and the head ombudsman.</p>
<p>We conclude that an important aspect of the issue of the Ombudsman’s autonomy and independence is that the areas of responsibility and the functions of the Ombudsman should be clearly defined by statute and not by ordinance. It is consequently the Riksdag that should determine the mandate and the Government would thereby not be empowered to unilaterally change the functions of the Ombudsman. In accordance with this, the areas of responsibility and functions of the Ombudsman should be included within the Act. In this way, a better safeguard is provided for the authority’s autonomy and independence, as any amendments in the areas of responsibility and functions of the Ombudsman must be presented to the Riksdag. Through the areas of responsibility and functions of the Ombudsman being regulated by law, emphasis is also placed on the importance of the Ombudsman’s activities, first for those who are subjected to discrimination, second for the government powers. The areas of responsibility and the functions of the Ombudsman should be regulated first in the new Prohibition and other Measures against Discrimination Act and second in a special Discrimination Ombudsman Act.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman should ensure compliance with the new Prohibition and other Measures against Discrimination Act. The Ombudsman should, in the first instance, try to persuade those who are subject to prohibitions against discrimination and victimisation, and to the provisions on active measures, to voluntarily comply with the Act. Those who are subject to the prohibition against discrimination and victimisation or to the provision on active measures should, upon request by the Ombudsman, be liable to 1. provide information about the circumstances regarding the operation that may be relevant to supervision, 2. provide information when the Ombudsman supports a request by an individual for the disclosure of information about credentials (working life and school), 3. give the Ombudsman access to workplaces and other premises where operations are conducted for investigations that may be relevant to supervision, and 4. attend deliberations with the Ombudsman.</p>
<p>The duty to provide information according to item 1 and 2 does not apply if there are special reasons against doing so in the individual case.</p>
<p>A party who fails to comply with a request, according to the above, may be ordered (subject to a default fine) by the Ombudsman to fulfil the obligation.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman shall, according to the Discrimination Ombudsman Act, 1. work to eliminate discrimination based on sex, sexual identity, ethnic background, religion or other religious belief, disability, sexual orientation or age does not occur in any areas of society, 2. also work generally to promote equal rights and opportunities, regardless of sex, sexual identity, ethnic background, religion or other religious belief, disability, sexual orientation or age, 3. work to promote equality between men and women and prevent and counteract racism, xenophobia and homophobia, 4. through advice and in other ways assist in ensuring that those exposed to discrimination can exercise their rights, 5. within their operational area – propose statutory amendments and other measures to the Government that can counteract discrimination, – provide information, – mould public opinion, – educate, – consult and have other contacts with authorities, business, individuals and organisations, – monitor international developments, – monitor research and development work, and – take initiatives for other appropriate measures.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman against Discrimination should for the time being be an authority reporting to the Government.</p>
<p>The Government should observe great restraint in the terms of reference for the Ombudsman.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman should be given an autonomous power to participate in the Government’s reporting to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, United Nations Commission on Human Rights, United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and also be given powers to communicate independently with the convention body.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the issue of a possible constitutional regulation of the status of the Ombudsman, and similarly the further constitutional deliberations on the answerability of the Ombudsman, be investigated separately. It may be suitable to conduct this investigation within the framework of the ‘Committee of Inquiry on the Constitution’.</p>
<p>It is important that the new authority is given sufficient resources to ensure that the work against discrimination can be strengthened and improved. As a comparison, it may be mentioned that the framework appropriation for JämO for the budget year 2006 amounts to 28 346 000 kronor, of which 450 000 kronor constitutes a framework appropriation for the Equal Opportunities Board (Government Bill 2005/06:01, area of expenditure 14, Report 2005/06:AU1, Riksdag Communication. 2005/06:109). For the DO, the framework appropriation for the budget year 2006 amounts to 31 239 000 kronor, of which 150 000 kronor constitutes the framework appropriation for the Board against Discrimination (Government Bill 2005/06:01, area of expenditure 8, Report 2005/06:SfU2, Riksdag Communication 2005/06:68). For the HO, the framework appropriation for the budget year 2006 amounts to 14 892 000 kronor (Government Bill 2005/06:01, area of expenditure 9, Report 2005/06:SoU1, Riksdag Communication 2005/06:111). For HomO, the framework appropriation for the budget year 2006 amounts to 9 218 000 kronor (Government Bill 2005/06:02, area of expenditure 14, Report 2005/06:AU1, Riksdag Communication 2005/06:110). Besides the tasks that currently lie with JämO, DO, HO and HomO, the new cohesive authority will be allocated responsibility for supervision of a number of new provisions contained in the new Act, including matters relating to new grounds of discrimination, prohibitions in new areas of society, protection of legal persons, extended provisions on active measures, measures for enhanced accessibility, etc. Significant increases in resources will be required.</p>
<h2>Penal provisions on unlawful discrimination</h2>
<p>We consider that the penal provisions on unlawful discrimination contained in Chapter 16, Section 9 of the Penal Code should not be repealed. Decriminalisation would, in our opinion, be inappropriate, both from the general preventive perspective and owing to the symbolic function of criminalisation. The fact that the government uses what may be regarded as the strongest expression of dissension – criminalisation – has a symbolic value and constitutes a means of emphasising that the government in Sweden views this issue as a matter for common concern. As we see the matter, government responsibility and the resources that the government provides via the police and prosecutor service cannot be replaced by a system where work against discrimination is entirely transferred to the private sphere. An opposite stance, where discrimination would only be combated via damages in civil cases, could possibly be perceived to mean that the government has abandoned its interest in the issue of discrimination.</p>
<p>We are also of the opinion that from the protective perspective it is not reasonable to decriminalise unlawful discrimination, as a private law regulation can never provide the same kind of protection for citizens. Despite problems regarding deficiencies in effectiveness and duplicity of regulation, we therefore consider that there is insufficient reason to repeal this penal provision.</p>
<p>The question as to whether the provision on unlawful discrimination should be made more stringent should be further investigated separately.</p>
<h2>Provisions in the new Act on Prohibition of Discrimination</h2>
<p>The grounds of discrimination</p>
<p>Discrimination should be prohibited according to the following grounds of discrimination: sex, sexual identity, ethnic background, religion or other religious belief, disability, sexual orientation and age. Of these, discrimination on the grounds of ‘sexual identity’ and ‘age’ are new in Swedish discrimination legislation. Age is not defined in the statutory text. However, ‘sexual identity’ refers to "a person’s identity, appearance or behaviour as regards sex, regardless of whether the identity, appearance or behaviour differs from what is traditionally deemed to constitute the norm for men and women respectively".</p>
<p>Sex, as a ground of discrimination, is defined as "the biological sex as registered for a person at birth or the sex that is later determined for her or him".</p>
<p>Through the discrimination grounds ‘sex’ and ‘sexual identity’, the discrimination legislation will cover the group ‘transpersons’. The group transpersons can generally be described as individuals who at times or always have been perceived to have or express or be perceived as expressing a sexual identity that at times or always differs from the norm for the sex that is registered for them at birth. This includes, for example, those who are or who are perceived to be transsexuals, transvestites, intergenders, intersexuals, transgenderists, drag kings or drag queens.</p>
<p>Ethnic background, as a ground of discrimination, is defined, in the same way as the current regulation, as "that someone belongs to a group of people who has the same national or ethnic origin, race or skin colour". The term ‘race’ should not be eliminated from the legislation where it appears. We conclude that there are no scientific grounds for dividing people into different races, nor is there consequently, from a biological perspective, any grounds for using the word ‘race’ for people. However, the term race is used in international conventions and EC directives to protect people from conduct that is based on a perception that there are different races and not because it is believed that various races exist or to underpin such a view. Sweden must satisfy its international obligations. In addition, there is a risk that protection against discrimination would be impaired if this term were to be eliminated.</p>
<p>Disability, as a ground of discrimination, is defined, in the same way as the current regulation, as “the permanent physical, mental or intellectual limitation of the functional capacity of a person as a consequence of an injury or an illness that existed at birth, having arisen thereafter, or which may be expected to arise”.</p>
<p>Sexual orientation has been used with various meanings in different acts. We propose that the meaning that the term has in discrimination legislation – homosexual, bisexual or heterosexual orientation – is used consistently also in Chapter 5, Section 5 and Chapter 16, Section 9 of the Penal Code, but replaced by ‘sexual life’ in the Act (2001:617) on Processing of Personal Data within the Prison and Probation Service.</p>
<p>Protection for legal persons</p>
<p>So far, the discrimination acts have only involved protection for natural persons. We now propose that the discrimination prohibition in the new Prohibition and other Measures against Discrimination Act should also apply to discrimination against legal persons in the areas of society where this is justified (cf. immediately below on the discrimination prohibitions).</p>
<p>The term ‘discrimination’</p>
<p>The term ‘discrimination’ in Swedish law is essentially taken from EC law. The Equal Treatment Directive (76/207/EEC), the Directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (2000/43/EC), the Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (2000/78/EC) and the Directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women in the access to and supply of goods and services (2004/113/EC) state that discrimination means direct discrimination, indirect discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment and instructions to discriminate. The various forms of discrimination are defined in the same way in the various Directives. The terms thereby have the same meaning, regardless of the grounds of discrimination.</p>
<p>One of the Committee’s points of departure is that protection against discrimination should resemble each other as far as possible in relation to the various grounds of discrimination. It may be assumed that a uniform formulation of the definitions of fundamental principles can contribute to the protection against discrimination being of equal strength, regardless of the grounds of discrimination. The meaning of direct discrimination, indirect discrimination, harassment and sexual harassment and instructions to discriminate in the new Prohibition and other Measures against Discrimination Act should consequently be the same regardless of the grounds of discrimination.</p>
<p>Direct discrimination means that someone is being disfavoured through being treated worse than somebody else is treated, has been treated or would have been treated in a comparable situation, provided the disfavour is related to sex, sexual identity, ethnic background, religion or other religious belief, disability, sexual orientation or age.</p>
<p>Indirect discrimination means that someone is being disfavoured through the application of a provision, a criteria or a means of proceeding that appears to be neutral but which is likely to disfavour particularly someone of a particular sex, particular sexual identity, particular ethnic background, particular religion or other religious belief, particular disability, particular sexual orientation or particular age, unless the provision, criteria or means of proceeding can be objectively supported by a justified goal and the means to achieve the goal are appropriate and necessary.</p>
<p>Harassment means conduct that is related to sex, sexual identity, ethnic background, religion or other religious belief, disability, sexual orientation or age, and which violates the integrity of a person.</p>
<p>Sexual harassment means behaviour of a sexual nature that violates a person’s integrity.</p>
<p>Instructions to discriminate means orders or instructions to discriminate against someone that are given to someone who has a subordinate or dependent relationship to the person who gives the order or instruction or who, in relation to such a person, has undertaken to perform a task.</p>
<p>A failure to implement reasonable measures for accessibility for people with disabilities is also deemed to constitute discrimination.</p>
<p>Discrimination prohibitions</p>
<p>The Equal Treatment Directive (76/207/EEC), which relates to ‘discrimination on the grounds of sex’, the Directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin (2000/43/EC), which relates to ‘discrimination on the grounds of race and ethnic background’, and the Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (2000/78/EC), which relates to ‘discrimination on the grounds of religion or beliefs, disability, sexual orientation and age’, prescribe different levels of protection for different grounds of discrimination. For instance, the EC provisions require more extensive protection for race and ethnic origin than, for example, for sex, disability and sexual orientation. However, the EC regulation is a minimum regulation. There is consequently no impediment for a Member State going further than required by the Directives. There is reason to do so. One of the points of departure of the Committee is that protection should be as equal as possible for the various grounds of discrimination.</p>
<p>For the grounds of discrimination covered by the current discrimination legislation – sex, ethnic background, religion or other religious belief, disability and sexual orientation – the protection is relatively similar as regards the areas of society that are currently within the ambit of the legislation. The gaps found in the current discrimination legislation are that sex is not subject to a discrimination prohibition as regards the social services, etc., and also health and medical care services, and that disability is not covered by the discrimination prohibition as regards the social services, etc., the social insurance system, unemployment insurance and health and medical care services.</p>
<p>As yet, there is no discrimination prohibition for sexual identity and age.</p>
<p>We propose that the discrimination prohibitions in working life, as regards education, labour market policy activities, the setting up or running of business operations, practising a profession, membership, etc., of employee, employer and professional organisations, goods, services and housing, public meetings and public events, the social services, etc., the social insurance system, unemployment insurance, health and medical care services, public study support, compulsory military and compulsory civilian service, public appointments and public assignments.</p>
<p>As regards the areas of society of goods, services and housing, public meetings and public events, the social services, etc., the social insurance system, unemployment insurance, health and medical care services, public study support, compulsory military and compulsory civilian service, public appointments and public assignments, further investigation is required before the discrimination prohibition based on age can be formulated. Otherwise the discrimination prohibitions apply to all the discrimination grounds dealt with in the final report: that is sex, sexual identity, ethnic background, religion or other religious belief, disability and sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Some of the discrimination prohibitions are carried over from current discrimination legislation. Some of the discrimination prohibitions are new. In particular, discrimination prohibitions relating to the new grounds of discrimination, sexual identity and age, can be mentioned here. Moreover, discrimination prohibitions as regards certain parts of the education sector, public meetings and public events, compulsory military and compulsory civilian service, public appointments and public assignments, are not currently covered by any prohibition rules. As regards sex, a discrimination prohibition has been lacking in the areas of society of social services, etc. and health and medical care services. As regards disability, there has not previously been any discrimination prohibition regarding social services, etc., the social insurance system, unemployment insurance and health and medical care services. Another new feature is also that the discrimination prohibition, as regards goods, services and housing, will apply to anyone providing goods, services or housing to the public. Private persons will therefore be subject to this prohibition. However, this prohibition will not apply if it is necessary considering the protection of private life. A prohibition of discrimination against legal persons shall apply as regards labour market policy activities, the setting up or running of business operations, membership, etc., goods, services and housing and as regards public appointments and public assignments.</p>
<p>For those who are protected by the discrimination prohibitions, the new rules on discrimination prohibition as regards sexual identity and age may be deemed to be of great positive significance. This new protection can be assumed to correspond to a great need in both areas. The issue of age discrimination is very topical and has been hotly debated. Several proposals in this area can probably be viewed as a first step towards even more advanced legislation as regards age discrimination. For transpersons (sexual identity), it is perhaps the first time that their vulnerable situation is emphasised in a major context of legislation. We consider that the new protection for sexual identity will have a great legal and moral significance for those persons who are subject to the new rules.</p>
<p>Increased requirements for active measures</p>
<p>The discrimination prohibitions are supplemented by active measures. Active measures can generally be described as measures that are taken to promote equality between men and women and other equal treatment. The active measures can basically be said to be targeted at the treatment of employees and others as groups and not as individual cases. Generally, it can be stated that active measures are intended to constitute a driving force and encouragement for further endeavours to counteract discrimination.</p>
<p>In our opinion, active measures are a truly important component of the discrimination legislation. They constitute a complement to the discrimination prohibitions, but are also valuable in their own right as being aimed at the future and more ‘positive’ initiatives than the discrimination prohibitions, which can be said to be of a more repressive nature. In contrast to the discrimination prohibitions, the provisions on active measures are formulated so that they invite creativity and recognize the wish to work effectively against discrimination and for equal opportunities and rights, which can be observed among, for instance, individual employers and union organisations. Work with active measures may impede individuals being adversely affected by discrimination, but it may also mean that employers and others avoid being vulnerable to allegations or accusations of discrimination or omissions to investigate and rectify harassment.</p>
<p>As stated already when the former Act on Equality between Men and Women was passed in 1979, the prohibition of individual injustices – that is to say, the discrimination prohibitions – was not sufficient for a true and rather rapid move towards equal opportunities between the sexes and equality, regardless of the other grounds of discrimination, to be achieved (cf. Government Bill 1978/79:175 p. 78.). Consequently, active measures are also required.</p>
<p>The rules on active measures should resemble as closely as possible those for the various grounds of discrimination. This means that the provisions on active measures – which currently exist for sex, ethnic background and religion or other religious belief – should also apply for sexual identity, disability, sexual orientation and age, and the rules should be similar wherever possible and appropriate for the purpose. We also propose that an obligation is introduced to implement active measures for all grounds of discrimination.</p>
<p>In addition, first the possibilities should be utilised to ‘sharpen’ the existing active measures in the sense that they should be made more efficient, second attempts should be made to try to find new kinds of active measures.</p>
<p>The proposals in this respect are primarily the following. Employers and employees should cooperate regarding active measures to achieve equal rights and opportunities in working life, regardless of sex (equal opportunity in working life), sexual identity, ethnic background, religion or other religious belief, disability, sexual orientation or age. In particular, they should counteract all forms of discrimination, as referred to in Chapter 2 of the Act. As regards discrimination on the grounds of sex, employers and employees – as currently is the case in the Equal Opportunities Act – should work particularly first to equalise and impede differences in pay and other terms and conditions of employment between men and women who perform work that is to be regarded as equal or equivalent, second to promote equal opportunities for development of pay for men and women.</p>
<p>Employers should also take active measures regarding recruitment, etc, education and development of skills, the opportunity for everyone to seek vacant jobs, to get applicants from the underrepresented sex and to seek to ensure that the proportion of employees of that sex increases over time to ensure that there should be employees from various ethnic backgrounds in the workplace, regarding pay issues, and prepare an annual equal treatment plan for their work with active measures to achieve equal rights and opportunities in working life, regardless of sex (equality in working life), sexual identity, ethnic background, religion or other religious belief, disability, sexual orientation or age. This plan should contain an overview of the active measures that are required at the workplace according to the Act together with a report on which of these measures the employer intends to commence or implement during the forthcoming year.</p>
<p>Active measures regarding education should be in place at all educational and other establishments referred to in the Education Act (1985:1100), education referred to in the Higher Education Act (1992:1434), education that can lead to a degree or diploma according to the Award of Certain Degrees Licensing Act (1993:792), or other educational or training establishments. This requirement should cover all grounds of discrimination.</p>
<p>Schools and others who conduct courses and training should implement active measures as regards goal-oriented work in order to prevent and impede discrimination and victimisation, and prepare an annual equal treatment plan.</p>
<p>Active measures as regards compulsory military service and compulsory civilian service involve requirements for goal-oriented work to actively promote the equal rights and opportunities of total defence service conscripts, regardless of sex, sexual identity, ethnic background, religion or other religious belief, disability or sexual orientation. These active measures shall relate to service conditions, measures to prevent and impede discrimination and victimisation, and the preparation of an annual equal treatment plan.</p>
<p>Employers, schools and the authorities that train and recruit total defence service conscripts, and who do not comply with the provisions of the Act on active measures, can be ordered (subject to a default fine) to fulfil their obligations.</p>
<p>Active measures in areas of society other than working life, education and compulsory military and civilian service should be subject to further investigation.</p>
<p>Positive special treatment</p>
<p>According to our proposals, positive special treatment on the grounds of ethnic background or sex should be allowed in working life. Exemptions from the prohibition against discrimination in working life are therefore introduced. The prohibition against discrimination does not apply if an employer’s means of acting on matters relating to employment, selection for employment interviews or other measures during the employment procedure, promotion or education and training for promotion, or other education and training, represent a step in an endeavour to promote equal treatment regardless of ethnic background (positive special treatment on the grounds of ethnic background). As regards positive special treatment relating to sex, the existing exclusion for positive special treatment contained in the Equal Opportunities Act (1991:433) is carried over to the new Prohibition and other Measures against Discrimination Act. This discrimination prohibition does not apply if an employer’s means of acting represents a step in an endeavour to promote equality in working life, and it is not a matter involving the application of pay or other terms and conditions of employment for work that is to be regarded as equal or equivalent (positive special treatment on the grounds of sex).</p>
<p>We also propose that positive special treatment on the grounds of sex should be allowed in respect of higher education studies, labour market policy activities and memberships, etc. of employee, employer and professional organisations. As regards membership, etc., the existing exemption contained in the Prohibition of Discrimination Act (2003:307) carried over to the new Prohibition and other Measures against Discrimination Act.</p>
<p>Measures to increase accessibility, etc.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the following shall apply in the new Prohibition and other Measures against Discrimination Act.</p>
<p>Those subject to the prohibitions under the Act against discrimination relating to education and areas of society other than working life may not disfavour a person with a disability by failing to implement such reasonable measures for accessibility as could possibly contribute to that person being able to gain access to goods, services or housing or the operations referred to on equal conditions as people without such a disability.</p>
<p>However, the liability to implement measures for accessibility does not apply to private individuals who provide goods, services or housing.</p>
<p>A failure to implement measures for accessibility should be regarded as discrimination.</p>
<p>Within working life – that is, the relationship between employers and employees – it is proposed that the current regulations contained in the Prohibition of Discrimination in Working Life of People because of Disability Act (1999:132) are carried over to the new Act. The discrimination prohibition for employers thereby also applies when an employer, in connection with employment, promotion or education/training for promotion, through implementing support or adaptation measures, can create a situation for a person with a disability that is comparable with that for people without such a disability, and it may reasonably be required that the employer implements such measures.</p>
<p>Prohibitions against victimisation</p>
<p>Victimisation means unfavourable treatment or unfavourable consequences that can adversely affect someone who has reported someone or presented a complaint regarding what he or she perceives to be discrimination or has made an allegation that the officer responsible within the operation has not, for example, implemented measures to prevent continued harassment. The characteristic feature of victimisation is that it is in the nature of a punishment.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the following prohibitions against victimisation are included in the new Act.</p>
<p>An employer may not subject a job seeker or employee to victimisation owing to the job seeker or employee having – rejected the employer’s sexual approaches, – complained about or pointed out that the employer has acted in violation of one of the provisions contained in Chapter 2 of the Act, or – participated in an investigation according to Chapter 2 of the Act.</p>
<p>This prohibition also applies in relation to someone who, without being an employee at a workplace, is seeking or completing practical work experience or performing work there as agency or borrowed manpower. When the prohibition is applied, the party with whom the work experience position is being sought or performed or the work carried out is deemed to be an employer.</p>
<p>A person who is subject to the prohibitions against discrimination as regards education/training and areas of society other than working life may not subject anyone to reprisals owing to he or she having – reported or complained about someone acting in violation of the provisions contained in Chapter 3 of the Act, or – participated in an investigation according to Chapter 3 of the Act.</p>
<p>Obligation to investigate and implement measures against harassment</p>
<p>Employers, schools and authorities that educate or recruit total defence service conscripts shall be liable to investigate and implement measures against harassment as follows.</p>
<p>An employer, who becomes aware that an employee considers that he or she has been subjected to harassment that is related to sex, sexual identity, ethnic background, religion or other religious belief, disability, sexual orientation or age or sexual harassment in conjunction with the work, is under an obligation to investigate the circumstances surrounding the said harassment and, where appropriate, implement those measures that may reasonably be required to impede continued harassment. The employer’s obligation also applies in relation to a person who, without being an employee at the workplace, is seeking or performing practical work experience or is performing work there as agency or borrowed manpower.</p>
<p>A school that becomes aware that someone who is participating in or applying for a course/training or activity considers that he or she has been subjected to harassment that is related to sex, sexual identity, ethnic background, religion or other religious belief, disability, sexual orientation or age or sexual harassment in conjunction with the course/training or activity, is liable to investigate the circumstances surrounding the said harassment and, where appropriate, implement those measures that may reasonably be required to impede continued harassment.</p>
<p>An authority that trains or recruits total defence service conscripts and that becomes aware that a total defence service conscript considers that he or she has been subjected to harassment that is related to sex, sexual identity, ethnic background, religion or other religious belief, disability or sexual orientation or sexual harassment in conjunction with compulsory military or compulsory civilian service, is liable to investigate the circumstances surrounding the said harassment and, where appropriate, implement those measures that may reasonably be required to impede continued harassment.</p>
<p>Sanctions</p>
<p>It is proposed that the mandatory nature of the Act is directly indicated by the wording of the Act. A contract that restricts anyone’s rights under the Act shall be invalid in that respect.</p>
<p>A provision in an individual contract or in a collective bargaining agreement that allows or entails that someone is discriminated against in a manner that is prohibited by the Act shall be adjusted or declared invalid if the party discriminated against so requests. If the provision is of such significance to the contract that it cannot reasonably be required that it should in other respects apply with unchanged content, the contract may also be adjusted in other respects or declared invalid in its entirety.</p>
<p>If someone is discriminated against through a notice of termination of a contract or through another such legal act in a manner that is prohibited according to the Act, such legal act shall be declared invalid if the person discriminated against so requests.</p>
<p>If someone is discriminated against through rules of procedure or similar internal provisions at the workplace in a manner that is prohibited according to Chapter 2 on working life, the provision shall be adjusted or declared invalid if the person discriminated against so requests.</p>
<p>Anyone, who breaches the prohibitions against discrimination – including the provisions applicable to support and adaptation measures – or victimisation, or fails to perform an obligation to investigate and implement measures against harassment and sexual harassment, shall pay damages for the violation that this entails (general or non-pecuniary damages) and for the loss that arises (economic damages). The severity of the violation shall be decisive for the amount of non-pecuniary damages. If there are special reasons, the damages may be reduced or lapse completely. The intention of the party committing the discrimination shall not constitute reasons for adjusting the damages.</p>
<p>We proposed in the preliminary report Extended protection against sexual discrimination (Official Government Report - SOU 2004:55 p. 314 f.) that the current limitation on economic damages in discrimination legislation should be removed. However, the Riksdag and the Government had a different view when the matter was dealt with in the spring of 2005 (see Government Bill 2004/05:147 p. 116 f., Report 2004/05:AU7, Riksdag Communication 2004/05:267). We are still of the opinion that EC law requires the removal of the link between discrimination legislation and the ‘ceiling rule’ for economic damages under the Employment Protection Act. However, we do not repeat our proposal now, but anticipate that the Government, when processing this matter in the future, will consider our deliberations on this matter.</p>
<p>Litigation</p>
<p>The Courts</p>
<p>Labour law discrimination cases should also in the future continue to be dealt with by the Labour Court (AD). We have concluded that the AD is an independent and impartial court in the sense referred to in Article 6.1 of the European Convention and that the AD also generally satisfies the requirements prescribed by this Article. However, in our opinion, there are no mandatory legal reasons to change the role of the AD or the composition of the bench of the court in discrimination cases. However, this is not to say that it cannot for other reasons be justified to propose changes in some respect. One important point of departure is that judicial procedures should be formulated in such a way that the interest in safeguarding the secure, rapid and uniform application of the law is promoted in the optimum way. Nor should any amendments create new difficulties that could be avoided under the current system.</p>
<p>The composition of the AD in discrimination cases should be changed. The Labour Disputes (Judicial Procedure) Act is amended so that only five members participate in such cases. The composition should be a chairperson, a vice-chairperson, a ‘third party’, an employer member and an employee member. In this way, the interest members will not be in the majority in cases, but are nonetheless included and can contribute with their special expertise about the labour market.</p>
<p>It would be an advantage for the adjudication if special expertise in discrimination issues was included on the bench of the court. One special way of ensuring that the court has such competence is that the independent official member (the ‘third party’), besides the requirement already applying for a special insight into the situation in the labour market, should also have a special insight into discrimination issues. This should be stated in the Labour Disputes (Judicial Procedure) Act (1974:371). The third parties are appointed from a special list which includes people with such competence. In this way, valuable expert knowledge could be brought into the court. Such a system would constitute a usable complement to the powers that the court and the parties already have to call in an expert(s) when this is considered necessary. A member with special experience or understanding of discrimination issues would constitute a valuable supplement for adjudication. The wish to have special competence in discrimination issues could also be satisfied within the framework of increased and targeted education/training initiatives.</p>
<p>An action in a case concerning discrimination that is brought by the Ombudsman against Discrimination should be instituted at the district court. The AD is a superior instance in the case of an appeal. Actions may not be brought against any judgment or decision of the AD.</p>
<p>The chairperson of the AD, who is currently appointed for three years, should instead be an ordinary judge in the AD.</p>
<p>Right of action</p>
<p>The Ombudsman against Discrimination should be empowered, as a party, to bring an action for an individual in a case concerning the prohibitions against discrimination and victimisation and an obligation to investigate and implement measures against harassment, if the person gives consent. If the Ombudsman brings such an action, the Ombudsman may also, in the same proceedings, bring other actions for the individual.</p>
<p>In working life, the right of action of the Ombudsman, as according to the current provisions, should be subsidiary in relation to the trade union right of action. When a trade union organisation is entitled to bring proceedings on behalf of the individual, in accordance with Chapter 4, Section 5 of the Labour Disputes (Judicial Procedure) Act (1974:371), the Ombudsman may only bring an action if the employee organisation does not do so.</p>
<p>A not-for-profit association that according to its rules protects its members’ interests, is entitled, as a party, to bring an action for an individual in cases concerning the prohibitions against discrimination and victimisation and the obligation to investigate and implement measures against harassment, provided the person gives consent.</p>
<p>In working life, the right of action of the association shall be subsidiary in relation to the trade union right of action. When the employee organisation is entitled to bring proceedings for an individual in accordance with Chapter 4, Section 5 of the Labour Disputes (Judicial Procedure) Act (1974:371), the association may only bring proceedings if the employee organisation does not do so.</p>
<p>The precondition for the right of action of an interest organisation is that the association, considering its operation and its interests in the matter, its financial capacity to bring proceedings and the circumstances generally, is appropriate to represent the individual.</p>
<p>Burden of proof</p>
<p>An evidential rule entailing a relaxation of evidence for someone who alleges that discrimination has occurred is necessary. We propose that this is formulated in the following way. If there is cause to assume that someone has been disadvantaged in a way indicated by the prohibitions against discrimination or victimisation, it is the defendant who must show that there has not been any discrimination or victimisation.</p>
<p>Time limitation</p>
<p>If someone brings an action as a result of notice of termination or dismissal, the following provisions contained in the Employment Protection Act (1982:80) shall apply: – Section 40 on time limits for actions concerning declaration of invalidity, – Section 41 on time limits for actions for damages or other claims of debt, and – Section 42 on lapse of right of action owing to time limit.</p>
<p>On matters concerning actions other than those referred to in the first paragraph, the following provisions of the Employment (Co-Determination in the Workplace) Act (1976:580) shall apply: – Section 64 on time limits for calling for negotiations, – Section 65 on time limits for instituting proceedings, – Section 66 on an extended time limit for a person who is not represented by an employee organisation, with the difference that the time limit referred to in Section 66, first paragraph, first sentence, should be two months, and – Section 68 on the lapse of right of action owing to time limits. If the proceedings relate to damages as a result of an employment decision that has been made by an employer with public status, the time limits are calculated in accordance with the second paragraph from the date when the employment decision entered into final force.</p>
<p>An action in a dispute that does not relate to working life shall be instituted within two years after the act complained of was implemented or the latest time by which an obligation should have been performed. Otherwise, the right to bring proceedings lapses.</p>
<p>Interruption of time limits</p>
<p>We propose a new rule on the interruption of time limits. The Ombudsman against Discrimination can, in a case relating to discrimination in working life other than notice of termination and dismissal, breach the time limit by ensuring that the employer receives a written communication stating that the Ombudsman is deliberating upon instituting proceedings. If the time limit is interrupted through such a communication, a new limitation period will start to run from the date of the interruption. The time limit cannot be interrupted more than once.</p>
<p>Secrecy</p>
<p>As regards secrecy, we propose the following. Secrecy in a case concerning the application of the new Prohibition and other Measures against Discrimination Act will apply to courts for details concerning an individual’s personal or financial circumstances, if it may be assumed that the individual or a closely-related person to the individual will suffer significant damage or significant inconvenience if the information is disclosed.</p>
<p>Secrecy will apply to the new Ombudsman against Discrimination for details concerning an individual’s personal or financial circumstances, if it may be assumed that the individual or some closely-related person to the individual will suffer damage or inconvenience if the information is disclosed in a matter under the new Prohibition and other Measures against Discrimination Act and also in other matters relating to advice for an individual.</p>
<p>Secrecy will apply to the new Discrimination Board for details concerning an individual’s personal or financial circumstances, if it may be assumed that the individual or some closely-related person to the individual will suffer damage or inconvenience if the information is disclosed in a matter under the new Prohibition and other Measures against Discrimination Act.</p>
<p>A new discrimination board</p>
<p>The Equal Opportunities Board and the Board against Discrimination will be replaced by a new Discrimination Board. The Board shall consider matters of orders subject to a default fine and appeals against matters in the same way as the former boards. However, the Board shall not be obliged to have any advisory operations in relation to the new ombudsman authority or have the explicit task of proposing amendments to legislation or other measures to the Government.</p>
<h2>Implementation of the Working Life Directive</h2>
<p>The EC’s Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation (2000/78/EC) has essentially been implemented into Swedish law through amendments in recent years to discrimination legislation. The main matter outstanding is a discrimination prohibition for age in working life. It is stipulated in Article 6 of the Working Life Directive that such a discrimination prohibition shall be introduced in the Member States of the EU. Through our proposal for a new system of rules, the EC Directive will, in that respect, be implemented in Sweden.</p>
<h2>Supervisory responsibility for the County Administrative Boards</h2>
<p>We consider that the question of introducing a regional supervisory responsibility with the Swedish County Administrative Boards for work with active measures should be postponed indefinitely.</p>
<h2>Information initiatives</h2>
<p>The Swedish discrimination legislation was last amended significantly through legislation that entered into force in 2003. As a consequence of the amended rules, a substantial sum was appropriated for information in relation to the public. A similar initiative will be necessary when the new rules enter into force.</p>
