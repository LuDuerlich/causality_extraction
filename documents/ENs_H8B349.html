<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The EU has adopted a new Regulation on market surveillance and compliance of products. This report proposes changes intended to adapt Swedish legislation to Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on market surveillance and compliance of products and amending Directive 2004/42/EC and Regulations (EC) No 765/2008 and (EU) No 305/2011, called the EU Market Surveillance Regulation here.</p>
<p>The purpose of the EU Market Surveillance Regulation is to make the rules in the area of product safety clearer and more uniform and to improve and simplify the system of market surveillance of prod- ucts in the harmonised area. Strong and more uniform market surveil- lance is held to benefit both consumers and economic actors and to contribute to growth by facilitating the smooth functioning of the internal market. Robust supervision of products is also essential to be able to protect public interests and create better conditions for fair competition in the Union market. The EU Market Surveillance Regulation regulates the organisation, financing and implementation of Member States’ market surveillance. In the main, the Regulation shall apply from 16 July 2021.</p>
<p>The remit of the Inquiry has included analysing what legislative amendments may be needed to be able to apply the EU Market Surveillance Regulation in an effective and appropriate way that strengthens market surveillance in Sweden and the EU.</p>
<p>New act supplementing the EU Market Surveillance Regulation</p>
<p>The EU Market Surveillance Regulation covers products regulated in a large number of Swedish statutes, known as ‘sectoral legislation’. The Inquiry proposes gathering the regulation of market surveillance of products covered by the EU Market Surveillance Regulation in a new cross-sectoral act supplementing the EU Regulation. The act should set out general provisions on market surveillance measures such as the powers of and penalties available to the market surveillance authorities. Provisions concerning product requirements should remain in sectoral legislation. This proposal results in consequential amendments to sectoral legislation. For instance, references to the new act are added and provisions that involve dual regulation in relation to the EU Market Surveillance Regulation are repealed.</p>
<p>Organisation of market surveillance in Sweden</p>
<p>The EU Market Surveillance Regulation requires Member States to designate one or more national market surveillance authorities. On the basis that Sweden's decentralised organisation of market surveillance shall be retained, the Inquiry proposes that 13 of the central govern- ment agencies currently responsible for surveillance be designated as market surveillance authorities under Article 10(2) of the EU Market Surveillance Regulation. They are the Swedish Work Environment Authority, the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning, the Swedish National Electrical Safety Board, the Public Health Authority of Sweden, the Swedish Chemicals Agency, the Swedish Consumer Agency, the Swedish Medical Products Agency, the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, the Swedish Post and Telecom Agency, the Swedish Energy Agency, the Swedish Board for Accreditation and Conformity Assessment (SWEDAC) and the Swedish Transport Agency. The Inquiry proposes that municipalities should no longer be market surveillance authorities but that they should continue to perform tasks involving market surveillance in connection with their regular supervision. The Inquiry also proposes appointing SWEDAC as the single liaison office under Article 10(3) of the EU Market Surveillance Regulation. The provisions about the single liaison office and the Swedish Market Surveillance Council should be set out in a</p>
<p>new government ordinance containing provisions supplementing the EU Market Surveillance Regulation and other provisions on market surveillance. To enable effective cooperation and exchange of infor- mation between the market surveillance authorities, the Inquiry pro- poses introducing provisions about an information obligation and coordination between the market surveillance authorities. Provisions should be also introduced on an obligation to observe secrecy for persons handling a matter concerning market surveillance under the EU Market Surveillance Regulation and the proposed act.</p>
<p>The EU Market Surveillance Regulation also requires Member States to designate one or more authorities in charge of the control of products entering the Union market. The Inquiry proposes desig- nating the Swedish Customs as the authority in charge under Article 25(1) of the EU Market Surveillance Regulation.</p>
<p>Powers of the market surveillance authorities</p>
<p>The EU Market Surveillance Regulation specifies a minimum level of the powers that Member State have to confer on their market surveil- lance authorities. These powers have to be sufficient to enable the market surveillance authorities to perform appropriate checks on the characteristics of products through documentary checks or physical checks, for instance. These checks can be carried out for a preventive purpose through random checks or following notification on account of, for example, an accident reported or a consumer complaint. The checks have to refer to products offered for sale both in physical shops and online or through other means of distance sales. In the main, the Inquiry’s proposal means assigning Sweden’s market surveillance authorities the powers set out in Article 14(4) of the EU Market Surveillance Regulation. This applies, for example, to the powers to request information and documents, to carry out unan- nounced on-site inspections; to enter any premises, land or means of transport, acquire product samples and demand restrictions on online interfaces such as websites and applications.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the power to carry out on-site inspec- tions should apply to all spaces used for business, including in dwellings. Unannounced inspections of spaces that are not accessible to the public should, on account of the intrusion entailed on the right</p>
<p>of the individual to privacy, only be permitted when it can be feared that a product is such a serious risk that it is not possible to await an announced inspection or the inspection would otherwise lose impor- tance. A market surveillance authority should, at on-site inspections, be allowed to take charge of documents and product samples when it can be feared that there is a serious risk and the economic operator does not immediately release documents or product samples requested or when it can be feared that the economic operator will withhold, distort or destroy documents or product samples. At on-site inspec- tions a market surveillance authority should also be able to request enforcement assistance from the Swedish Enforcement Authority and help from the Swedish Police Authority.</p>
<p>The power to acquire product samples is restricted in that anony- mous purchases, i.e. purchases under a concealed or assumed iden- tity, may only be made when essential to achieve the purpose of the check. After such a purchase has been carried out, the economic operator should be notified of it. The Inquiry proposes that a market surveillance authority should be able to order an economic actor to provide product samples free of charge.</p>
<p>The proposed act states explicitly that the power to require restric- tions or warnings to end users on online interfaces does not apply to online interfaces covered by the protection of the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that a market surveillance authority should be able to issue the orders and prohibitions needed for compliance with harmonised product legislation, the EU Market Surveillance Regulation, the proposed act or regulations issued pursuant to the act. It should be possible to combine an order or a prohibition with a conditional fine. If an economic operator does not follow an order or prohibition or if the operator cannot be reached, a market surveillance authority should itself be able to take appropriate measures to bring an instance of non-compliance to an end or to eliminate a risk.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes having a provision in the act containing provisions supplementing the EU Market Surveillance Regulation stating that a market surveillance authority should be able to reclaim all costs for market surveillance performed from a relevant economic operator if it turns out when a check is made that the product is non- compliant with applicable requirements under applicable harmonised Union law. Here, the Inquiry proposes the inclusion of a new autho-</p>
<p>risation giving the Government or the authority designated by the Government the right to issue regulations about reimbursement.</p>
<p>It should be possible to appeal the decisions made by a market surveillance authority to a general administrative court or, when the decisions concern Union law in the area of application of the Environ- mental code, a land and environment court. This applies to orders and prohibitions, decisions on market surveillance measures and penalties.</p>
<p>Penalties</p>
<p>Swedish sectoral legislation contains provisions regulating penalties for infringements of all harmonised product legislation covered by the EU Market Surveillance Regulation. The penalties are different for different kinds of products, and the Inquiry therefore proposes including new uniform provisions about conditional fines and admin- istrative fines in the act containing provisions supplementing the EU Market Surveillance Regulation to replace the penalty provisions in sectoral legislation. The provisions should also be applicable to infringements of the EU Market Surveillance Regulation. The fine should be levied even if the infringement did not occur intentionally or out of negligence, i.e. strict liability should apply. In minor cases no administrative fine should be imposed. If there are special reasons or if it would otherwise be unreasonable to impose the administra- tive fine in view of the circumstances, it should be possible to reduce the fine. The fine should be no less than SEK 15 000 and no more than SEK 15 000 000. The Inquiry proposes the inclusion of a new authorisation giving the Government or the authority designated by the Government the right to issue regulations about size of the administrative fine.</p>
<p>Impacts</p>
<p>The proposed legislation has positive effects for the market surveil- lance authorities and for the economic operators. The authorities’ possibilities of checking products and intervening against infringe- ments are improved, leading to safer products on the market and better conditions for fair competition.</p>
<p>The EU Market Surveillance Regulation means a higher level of ambition for market surveillance, which may lead, in the long term, to a need for higher appropriations for designated market surveil- lance authorities. The cost increases that the Inquiry’s proposals may result in regarding the authorities’ activities will be so limited that they are accommodated within existing appropriations.</p>
<p>For some economic operators, the proposals may result in higher costs due, for example, to the recovery of costs for market surveil- lance measures and higher administrative fines. However, this only affects operators who actually infringe against, or handle products not compliant with, the applicable requirements.</p>
<p>The expanded powers of market surveillance authorities and their amended possibilities of imposing penalties can be expected to result in a slight increase in the flow of cases to the general administrative courts and the land and environment courts.</p>
<p>The new Act and the other legislative amendments are proposed to enter into force on 16 July 2021.</p>
