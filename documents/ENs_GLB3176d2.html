<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Our terms of reference</h2>
<p>According to our terms of reference the Committee of Inquiry was to examine and propose how a law against discrimination of disabled persons in working life should be structured as well as which procedural rules should apply in regard to the Disability Ombudsman as a result of the new law. In addition, the Committee of Inquiry has had the task of collecting and reviewing the legislation of other countries in this field. Moreover, the Committee’s assignment included examining the Act (1974:13) on certain employment promotion measures (for the disabled and the elderly), which included taking a position on whether the rules on employment promotion measures can be removed from the law or whether they are needed to some extent in a revised form, as well as providing proposals regarding such measures.</p>
<h2>The need for legislation</h2>
<p>Already in the terms of reference the Government specified that the protection for the disabled against discrimination should be stated in law.</p>
<p>The Committee, in addition, comes to the conclusion that the proposal for new legislation is motivated due to reasons of principle as well as the actual need for a law prohibiting discrimination.</p>
<p>There is no law today in Sweden that specifically prohibits discrimination against the disabled in working life. Such laws do however exist in a number of other countries, e.g. the USA and Great Britain.</p>
<p>A survey carried out by Statistics Sweden on behalf of the Disability Ombudsman, published in July 1997, showed that a large portion of the approximately 5 400 disabled person interviewed, experienced or had experienced discrimination in working life. It is difficult to interpret the survey’s results in any other way than that discrimination does occur in some measure in working life, but that its extent is difficult to determine.</p>
<p>However, a presumably more important reason for a new law is that society in a clear manner should state its rejection of discrimination. A law can be expected to have a normative effect as well as lead to a change in the attitudes based on habit and prejudice against the disabled.</p>
<h2>The Committee’s Proposals</h2>
<p>The Committee, in this report, proposes a new law prohibiting discrimination against the disabled in working life. The report also includes proposed amendments to the Disability Ombudsman Act (1994:749) due to the broadened authority that should be given to the Ombudsman as a result of the new anti-discrimination law. In addition, there are some consequential changes proposed in existing legislation.</p>
<p>Proposal for a law against discrimination of the disabled in working life</p>
<p>The Committee proposes a labour law for the protection of both job applicants and employees.</p>
<p>A disabled person  is a person who was born with or due to an injury or illness has a physical or mental limitation of his or her ability to function. It is not the degree of the limitation in functioning that is decisive but the existence of a disability. However, the disability must be a lasting one.</p>
<p>The prohibition against discrimination is basically built up around three rules. Two of them state the prohibition against discrimination and the third indicates the processes to which the prohibition applies.</p>
<p>The first of these rules states the prohibition against direct discrimination. Direct discrimination refers to a situation where a disabled person is treated less favourably in terms of how another person without the disability has been or would have been treated in a similar situation. Less favourable treatment occurs when the disabled person is subjected to a detriment; e.g. is denied a particular post or is given less favourable terms of employment than other employees. To determine if a similar situation exists a comparison must be made between the disabled person and one or more other persons without a similar disability. However, an actual person to compare with is not a requirement: a hypothetical comparison is sufficient. In a job application situation, the comparison is expected, in the main, to involve qualifications in the form of education, experience and personal suitability for the work.</p>
<p>In comparison with other grounds of discrimination (sex, race, religion, sexual orientation etc.), a disability can significantly more often be assumed to have an affect on the individual’s ability to carry out a particular job. The circumstances in the workplace can therefore in many cases come to mean that the disabled person does not have the same ability to carry out the work in question in the same way as most others. Even if the disabled person otherwise has comparable qualifications, there is not a similar  situation in such cases. There is thus no issue of discrimination either.</p>
<p>Given the very special situation of the disabled, the proposal includes a rule through which the prohibition against discrimination also covers cases where the employer, through support and adaptation measures, can create  a similar situation and it can reasonably be required of the employer that such measures are undertaken. The measures that can be needed are e.g. the acquisition of technical devices and special work tools or changes in the physical working environment. They can even involve changes, e.g., in the work organisation, work assignments or work schedules. A certain duty, in the individual  case, is thus placed on the employer to adapt the workplace. In determining what is reasonable to require from an employer, various factors should be taken into account such as the cost of the measure, the expected effects, other types of inconvenience for the employer and the expected length of the employment.</p>
<p>The second discrimination rule states the prohibition against indirect discrimination. This means that an employer may not use a rule, criterion or procedure that seems neutral but that, when examined more closely, leads to a disadvantage for a significantly larger portion of the persons with a particular disability in comparison to persons without such disabilities. This constitutes discrimination unless the rule, criterion or procedure reflects an acceptable business need, and its usage is both suitable and necessary.</p>
<p>The decision processes to which the protection against discrimination apply are when an employer takes in job applicants for employment interviews, when an employer makes the decision to employ and when an employer takes other measures during the employment process. Furthermore, the protection applies when an employer makes a decision on promotion or chooses employees for training for promotion or uses a salary scale or other terms of employment, or takes management decisions, or gives notice, fires, lays off or otherwise undertakes other measures that have a serious effect on an employee. The existence of a decision to actually employ someone else is not a prerequisite to a finding of discrimination. Even if there is only a sole applicant who does not get the job, he or she can make a claim of discrimination. Even if an employment process is cut off, and nobody at all is employed, discrimination in the recruitment process or decision to not employ can still be challenged.</p>
<p>For a finding of discrimination, it is not necessary that the employer had a discriminatory intent in the meaning of a wilful intent to cause an injury or detriment to the job applicant or employee. It can basically be said that neither a discriminatory intent, nor even negligence, on the behalf of the employer is required. Thus both conscious and unconscious fall within the scope of the law.</p>
<p>However, a connection is required between the disability and the detrimental treatment. To the extent that there was a discriminatory intent, the necessary connection exists. Even if an employer has treated someone detrimentally as a result, e.g., of giving in to the desires of others to avoid having to deal with disabled persons, the connection exists. The disability does not have to be the sole reason or even the primary reason for a particular treatment. It is sufficient if it was one of several factors that affected the employer’s actions.</p>
<p>If the issue is one of direct discrimination, in order to find that a connection existed it is necessary that the employer knew or assumed that the person at issue was disabled. If the issue instead is one of indirect discrimination, which is focused on general behaviour such as the application of a specific criterion in regard to all job applicants, no knowledge or insight is needed by the employer in regard to whether or not those affected are disabled. It is sufficient that the effect of the criterion etc. on a general basis results in a disadvantage for one or more groups in relation to most others.</p>
<p>The Committee does not propose the introduction of a special evidentiary rule in the law but we recommend that the courts apply the rule of evidence proposed in the EC:s proposal for a directive on the burden of proof in sex discrimination cases. This means that a person who claims he or she has been discriminated against is to put forth sufficient factual circumstances so that there is reason to assume that discrimination has occurred. If the job applicant or employee is successful in fulfilling his or her burden of proof, then it will be up to the employer to explain his actions. If the employer cannot provide a satisfactory explanation for his actions, a finding of discrimination will be made.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes the adoption of a specific rule that imposes on an employer the duty to investigate the existence of reported harassment in the workplace on the basis of disability, as well as a duty to undertake the measures necessary to prevent continued harassment.</p>
<p>The term harassment refers to mobbing and other unwanted behaviour. The employer’s duty to investigate the circumstances around the harassment is triggered when the employer obtains the knowledge that a disabled employee considers themselves to be or have been the subject of harassment due to a disability by one or several of the other employees in the workplace. After carrying out an investigation, which should probably include discussions with the various parties involved, the employer should develop his own conclusions about the existence and type of harassment at issue. If the investigation gives the employer reason to assume that the harassment occurs, he or she shall undertake those measures which can reasonably required to prevent the continued occurrence of the harassment. The measures necessary will have to be determined on a case by case basis. It is assumed however that they can include everything from reprimands, warnings and transfers to the firing of the parties carrying out the harassment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Committee proposes the introduction of an express prohibition concerning retaliatory measures by employers against employees who utilise their right to report an employer for discrimination to the Disability Ombudsman or their union.</p>
<p>The most important sanction for a violation of the rules prohibiting discrimination is assumed to be the awarding of damages. A job applicant can only be awarded damages for the violation of his or her personal integrity that a discriminatory treatment can involve (general damages). An employer who discriminates against an employee can be required to pay damages for the violation of personal integrity he has caused as well as for the economic loss (economic damages) that may have been caused to the employee.</p>
<p>A contract that requires or allows for the type of discrimination that is prohibited according to this law is void. In addition, even certain discriminatory legal acts, such as a discriminatory termination of employment can be declared to be void by a court, if the employee requests it.</p>
<p>Changes in the Disability Ombudsman Act</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the Disability Ombudsman be given the responsibility of overseeing the enforcement of the new law. The Ombudsman should therefore be given the power to require the presence of employers for the purpose of discussions with the Ombudsman, as well as the power to issue an order requesting information concerning the employer’s relationship to his employees and job applicants. It should be possible to combine the duty to provide information with an order under penalty of a fine. The Disability Ombudsman is also to be given the right to bring cases in the Labour Court in accordance with the new law on behalf of job applicants and employees.</p>
<p>Other proposals</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Board Against Ethnic Discrimination, which should have its name changed to the Discrimination Board, should be given the power to examine appeals concerning the Disability Ombudsman’s issuance of orders under penalty of a fine.</p>
<p>We also propose, as a result of the new law against discrimination, changes in the Act concerning trials in labour-related disputes and in the Official Secrets Act.</p>
<p>Consultation</p>
<p>In carrying out its work the Committee has consulted with representatives of organisations for the disabled and the parties on the labour market as well as with the EDA Committee of Inquiry (SOU 1997:174) and the SEDA Committee of Inquiry (SOU 1997:175).</p>
