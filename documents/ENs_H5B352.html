<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>We live our lives both online and in the physical world. When we are on the internet we leave traces behind. These traces can be used to make our everyday lives easier, but also to make money from us and to conduct various forms of tracking and monitoring. It is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain control of how data is collected and re-used. The Privacy Committee’s general conclusion is that we, as private individuals, are being affected in a number of areas by a gradual deterioration of our privacy.</p>
<h2>The Privacy Committee’s objective</h2>
<p>The objective for our work in the Committee was to ensure that protection of privacy is strengthened so that this fundamental right is balanced with other fundamental rights and legitimate societal interests.</p>
<h2>The General Data Protection Regulation</h2>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation will begin to apply on 25 May 2018. The Personal Data Act will then cease to apply and a number of acts and other rules will have been adapted to the fact that we have directly applicable EU legislation instead.</p>
<p>To break the trend of a gradual deterioration of privacy, a concerted effort is needed in a number of areas. The timing of such a concerted effort is very apt right now in view of all of the areas of society that are currently putting a great deal of work into realising the intentions of the Regulation.</p>
<h2>Evaluation of constitutional protection</h2>
<p>The Privacy Committee considers that it is unsatisfactory that the provision in Chapter 2, Article 6, second paragraph of the Instrument of Government is applied in such different ways by inquiries and government agencies, and within the Government Offices.</p>
<p>In our view, a more consistent understanding and application of the provision would benefit both privacy protection and eGovernment as it would be clearer which considerations a proposal raises. Legislative work would not risk losing momentum, as is currently the case, due to the fact that preparatory material needs to be supplemented relatively late in the legislative process – which is sometimes not even possible. A more consistent understanding and application of the provision would also save resources for the overall work involved in the legislative process.</p>
<p>We consider that it is important that central government committees and inquiry chairs become better at drawing attention to and applying the constitutional requirement for legislative work, as stated in Chapter 2, Article 6, second paragraph of the Instrument of Government. We therefore propose that the Government introduce a provision in the Committees Ordinance stating that if a proposal has a bearing on privacy in the cases referred to in Chapter 2, Article 6, second paragraph of the Instrument of Government, the consequences in this regard must be described in the report.</p>
<p>The Committee also considers that the Government should evaluate, develop and, where necessary, update the Swedish Data Protection Authority’s guidance for privacy analyses.</p>
<h2>Information security</h2>
<p>As private individuals, we often have few possibilities to influence how data about us is processed and we have to rely on personal data controllers to protect our data. If data is spread without any control, distorted or destroyed, this can lead to violations of privacy. Shortcomings in information security therefore result in lesser protection for people’s privacy.</p>
<p>We note that there are several different inquiries and initiatives under way in Sweden and at EU level aimed at improving information security in society. The General Data Protection Regulation will also set standards for controllers in terms of both technical and organisational information security measures. But we also present a few proposals in this area.</p>
<p>Some of the protective measures that can be used, such as anonymisation, pseudonymisation and encryption, are difficult to introduce in certain sectors of society. There is therefore a need for coordination at national level, for example in terms of standards and norms. There is also a need to more closely integrate work to protect privacy with traditional information security work.</p>
<p>The Committee also considers that there is a need for more and better supervision of government agencies’ information security.</p>
<p>We therefore consider that the Government should look into an existing proposal stating that the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency should exercise supervision of information security in the state sector.</p>
<p>More proposals in this area are contained in chapter 12 on information security.</p>
<h2>Privacy enhancement efforts</h2>
<p>A number of different inquiries and initiatives are under way in Sweden and at EU level aimed at improving privacy protection in our society.</p>
<p>Several central government inquiries are working on adapting our legislation to the General Data Protection Regulation. The Data</p>
<p>Protection Inquiry proposes a new national regulation that supplements the General Data Protection Regulation at a general level. However, its work was not intended to broaden or restrict the possibilities of processing personal data, other than in cases where the General Data Protection Regulation requires such a change.</p>
<p>The Research Data Inquiry will, in turn, analyse what regulation of personal data processing for research purposes is possible and may be needed in addition to the general regulations that the Data Protection Inquiry proposes as a result of the Regulation.</p>
<p>The fact that the General Data Protection Regulation will begin to apply in less than one year gives particular momentum to efforts to strengthen privacy protection. All controllers must work on adapting personal data processing to the new provisions.</p>
<p>In addition, the Government Offices has been working on a national strategy for information and cyber security, which is based on the proposal presented in the report entitled ‘Information and cyber security in Sweden’ (SOU 2015:23). The strategy will be presented in the summer of 2017.</p>
<h2>The Privacy Committee’s proposals for measures</h2>
<p>Our main remit was to identify and analyse, from the individual’s perspective, the actual and potential risks of violations of privacy in connection with the use of information technology. We presented this investigation in our interim report entitled ‘What is the privacy situation?’ We have considered it our remit to also present proposals for measures that can strengthen protection of privacy.</p>
<p>In this final report, we therefore present a number of proposals for measures and assessments. The report presents the proposals on the basis of various areas of activity that process data about us as individuals. Some of the most important proposals are summarised below.</p>
<h2>Codes of conduct</h2>
<p>Associations and other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors can, in a certain industry or sector, present proposals for specifications on how to apply the General Data Protection Regulation in that area in practice. These kinds of specifications are called ‘codes of conduct’ in the General Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>A code of conduct can also cover activities conducted by the public administration. Further, a code of conduct can be described as a kind of sector-specific self-regulation aimed at concretising the regulatory framework. We believe that codes of conduct can be an effective aid to increase the protection of privacy in several areas.</p>
<p>Work to produce codes of conduct should be carried out by controllers’ or processors’ industry organisations, but under the General Data Protection Regulation, the work to promote, scrutinise and approve codes of conduct is a job for government agencies.</p>
<p>We propose, for example, that the Government task the Swedish Consumer Agency with initiating and supporting the drafting of codes of conduct for industries in which personal data is processed mainly for commercial purposes. The Committee considers that the remit should primarily focus on specifying application of the Regulation in terms of consent or balancing of interests as a legal basis for the processing of personal data, and content and form for the information that will be provided to data subjects. In its work to initiate and support the drafting of codes of conduct, the Swedish Consumer Agency could host consultations with industry organisations and other responsible agencies on the conditions for a code of conduct in that area (chapter 9).</p>
<p>We also propose that the National Agency for Education be tasked with initiating and supporting the drafting of a code of conduct for processing personal data in schools (chapter 5).</p>
<p>With regard to the processing of personal data in health and medical care and social services, we also propose that a government agency be tasked with initiating and supporting the drafting of a code of conduct. To further support controllers in the sensitive work of personal data processing, we also propose that the agency given the remit should establish a secretariat to support controllers in the practical work of drafting the code (chapter 7).</p>
<h2>Clearer regulations in law</h2>
<p>In certain areas, the Committee has noted that important regulation is lacking on how personal data should be processed. This shortcoming puts controllers in a difficult position. They have responsibility for interpreting the general regulation in the best way possible, but despite their good intentions they risk making the wrong assessments, which of course ultimately also risks affecting individuals.</p>
<p>In this area, we have not had the possibility to draft complete legislative proposals ourselves. We therefore propose further inquiries or preparation processes for previously presented legislative proposals in a number of areas, including the following:</p>
<p>A new Social Services Data Act</p>
<p>The Privacy Committee considers that a new regulation is needed for the personal data processing carried out in social services. Personal data processing within social services should be regulated in a separate act, as is the case with personal data processing in health and medical care. This act should be designed to take account of the legislative scope provided by the General Data Protection Regulation. Complete and clear legislation in this area would improve the prospects of the orderly introduction of welfare technology in social services. The Government should, on the basis of existing proposals, look into the possibility of passing new legislation that regulates the processing of personal data in social services and supplements and specifies the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (chapter 7).</p>
<p>New privacy-enhancing rules should be swiftly introduced in the Patient Data Act</p>
<p>The overall responsibility of care providers for the secure and appropriate processing of personal data in their activities should be more clearly and coherently expressed in the Patient Data Act. We believe that the Act needs a chapter that brings together the provisions clarifying the responsibility of both care providers and health and medical care staff for the secure processing of personal data in their activities. Rules that increase the level of detail in the Act could make it easier for activities in which the regulatory framework is to be applied (chapter 7).</p>
<p>Regulation of citizen profiling</p>
<p>In its interim report, the Committee noted that there are serious risks for privacy in the kind of control activities conducted by agencies that are intended to assess in advance the probability of a certain individual committing some form of error. These kinds of controls are sometimes called ‘smart controls’ or ‘selection profiles’, and in the interim report we used the term ‘citizen profiling’. We consider there is a need to identify how both government agencies and local government authorities are using smart controls and to propose the legislative amendments needed to give this activity a clear and legal basis and governance that take account of the need for controls and individual privacy and the right not to be discriminated against. The Committee therefore considers that the Government should look into this issue more closely (chapter 8).</p>
<p>Secrecy protection in schools</p>
<p>Increasing amounts of increasingly detailed data about pupils in schools is being generated – everything from how they use teaching aids and chat forums with their classmates to which friends they prefer to be seen with in school. For pupils in compulsory school and upper secondary school there is no secrecy or duty of confidentiality for the majority of this growing mass of data. We consider that the Government should investigate the issue of expanding secrecy protection to cover data about pupils contained in school IT systems (chapter 5).</p>
<p>Regulation in law of certain surveillance methods</p>
<p>Regarding the activities of the law enforcement agencies, we consider that there are tangible risks for privacy concerning surveillance methods that are sensitive in terms of privacy. This applies to the use of concealed body microphones, hand-held cameras, copying of mobile phones and computers, and tracking devices, for example. The use of fake base stations and the installation of spy programmes are also examples of such surveillance methods. We therefore consider that the Government should look into a legislative regulation of such surveillance methods that are sensitive in terms of privacy and that are currently not regulated or that are subject to weak regulation (chapter 11).</p>
<h2>Grants for interdisciplinary research on digitalisation and privacy</h2>
<p>We have noted that there is relatively little research on the effect of digital developments on people’s behaviour and their view of the world and themselves. Research into digitalisation and privacy is an area that deserves greater attention, both to increase the level of knowledge and to help find solutions to technical and legal challenges. We therefore propose that the Government task the Swedish Research Council with distributing grants for interdisciplinary research into the issue of how people and their behaviour are affected by the accelerated digital processing of their data and private spheres.</p>
<h2>Centre of excellence for issues concerning the acquisition and use of external IT services</h2>
<p>The Committee has drawn attention to the risks associated with shortcomings in agencies’ expertise in the area of IT development. A centre of excellence could help public administration become better at setting requirements in procurements, including the requirement for built-in privacy and information security. Better and clearer requirements from the public sector could also have an impact on the market outside the public sector. We therefore consider that the Government should task the agency given overall responsibility for the digitalisation of public administration with establishing a centre of excellence for issues concerning the acquisition and use of external IT services.</p>
<h2>The Swedish Agency for Public Management should be tasked with conducting an agency analysis of the Swedish Data Protection Authority</h2>
<p>We consider that the supervision of controllers is very important. Through supervision, the State takes action to protect us against the unlawful processing of our personal data. New ways of processing our data are being introduced at a very rapid pace. There is cause to assess many of these from a legal perspective. The regulatory framework is rather imprecise and kept intentionally vague. It is therefore often the case that suppliers and users do not receive any guidance until the supervisory agency has assessed a new phenomenon. The results of this supervision can then be used in the supervisory agency’s outreach and proactive work to disseminate knowledge. However, in the interim report we noted that the Swedish Data Protection Authority has gradually reduced its supervisory activities in recent years.</p>
<p>In its interim report, the Committee noted that a number of agencies have requested more guidance from the supervisory agency in connection with eGovernment. In several consultation responses to our interim report, the desire for clearer and more concrete guidance from the Swedish Data Protection Authority is also presented concerning privacy protection issues.</p>
<p>With the new General Data Protection Regulation, the Swedish Data Protection Authority will receive many new tasks and will also need to cooperate more both nationally and internationally. And at the same time, with the new Regulation, society will need much more support and guidance. Parallel to this development, the Swedish Data Protection Authority will – like all other government agencies – need to develop and improve its activities and its working methods.</p>
<p>To clarify which appropriations, which resources and which skills the Swedish Data Protection Authority will need over the coming years, we consider that the Government should task the Swedish Agency for Public Management with conducting an agency analysis of the Swedish Data Protection Authority in line with the model it presented to the Government in December 2008 in the report entitled ‘Model for agency analyses’ (2008:17).</p>
<h2>The agency given overall responsibility for the digitalisation of public administration should also promote protection of privacy</h2>
<p>The Privacy Committee believes that it is extremely important that the agency given the overall responsibility for the digitalisation of public administration, is also tasked with safeguarding protection of privacy. The instructions for the agency should therefore state that this agency is to promote protection of privacy, with a special focus on the introduction of privacy enhancing working methods and technologies. Naturally, the agency must work with the Swedish Data Protection Authority on these tasks.</p>
<h2>Consequences of our proposals</h2>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation will be implemented in Sweden. The alternative to the our far-reaching proposals on working with codes of conduct is therefore not for agencies and companies to refrain from taking measures or implementing change; instead, companies, agencies and other organisations would be forced to invest more resources in interpreting the legal situation.</p>
<p>We believe that a number of our proposals will entail reduced costs for both companies and agencies (both at central government and local level). The impact assessment is in chapter 17.</p>
