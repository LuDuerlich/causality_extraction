<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has reviewed the F-tax system (for the self-employed) and analysed the effects in certain respects of the formulation and application of the provisions.</p>
<p>In its final report, the Inquiry has analysed whether the formulation of the provisions on approval for F-tax in Chapter 9 of the Tax Procedures Act (2011:1244) make it possible to misuse the F-tax system to avoid paying taxes or contributions, whether measures are needed to facilitate and improve the Swedish Tax Agency’s follow-up of businesses approved for F-tax, such as provisional F-tax approval or time-limited approval for F-tax, and whether there is a need to introduce the possibility of refusing or revoking approval for F-tax in the event of criminal activity or infringement of competition provisions, which have not resulted in a trading prohibition. The Inquiry has also analysed whether, and in what way, the design of the F-tax system influences the conditions for starting, running and developing a business, and whether misuse of the F-tax system occurs to circumvent provisions on employee protection, and the degree to which the system can be perceived to result in such effects.</p>
<p>Where deemed appropriate in the areas above, the Inquiry has proposed legislative amendments. It has not been part of the Inquiry’s remit to consider abolishing the F-tax system. Nor has it been part of the remit to submit proposals in the field of labour law.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s starting points</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit has been extensive, including both taxand labour-law problems that have an impact on a competitive and dynamic business climate. The primary purpose of the tax system is to finance universal welfare, various public services and other public expenditure. To ensure that taxes can finance this in the long term, the general public and businesses must have a high level of trust in the tax system. In addition to securing good and stable tax revenues, the system must also create conditions for sustainable growth and high employment. A good business climate is fundamental for growth and job creation. The tax system should also create conditions for welfare that is fairly distributed, and contribute to an environmentally and socially sustainable society. Fair competition and decent conditions in the labour market are important factors in this respect.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit in its interim report was to determine whether the provisions need to be amended to combat tax evasion and tax avoidance, based on the phenomena of ‘bogus self-employment’ and ‘umbrella contracting’ or similar arrangements. The Inquiry found that there were grounds to consider amendments to the provisions on F-tax in Chapter 9 of the Tax Procedures Act. The Inquiry’s remit in its final report has been to conduct a review of the F-tax system based on other perspectives as well. It was therefore noted in the interim report that, based on the Inquiry’s continuing remit, there may be other grounds for amending the formulation of the provisions in Chapter 9 of the Tax Procedures Act.</p>
<h2>A healthy business climate</h2>
<p>Freedom to conduct a business is of fundamental importance for our modern society. Effective freedom to conduct a business also requires the protection of genuine businesses. Good conditions for healthy competition through equal terms for businesses contribute to a healthy business climate. For this reason, the Inquiry considers it important to combat the possibility of gaining any competitive advantage by circumventing provisions on employee protection or by businesses not paying the correct tax.</p>
<p>With regard to the significance of the F-tax system in this context, there is no requirement to be approved for F-tax to conduct business activities. However, approval is required for a business operator to take care of its own reporting and payment of taxes and contributions when it receives remuneration for any work performed. In practice, it can therefore often be difficult to conduct business activities in the services sector without approval for F-tax as this approval, and making reference to it, can be decisive for whether a business receives any orders. A decision to reject an application for F-tax approval, or to revoke such approval, can thus have far-reaching consequences for the individual.</p>
<p>In order to improve conditions for starting, running and developing a business, however, the F-tax system must be designed to protect genuine businesses and combat unfair competition. The main focus will therefore be on measures against those who do not meet their obligations.</p>
<h2>Appropriate protection for employees</h2>
<p>Collaboration between the social partners is one of the fundamental principles of a stable working life. The employment contract is a form of cooperation and may be considered as based on a mutual obligation of employers and employees to take account of each other’s interests.</p>
<p>Although the employment relationship is based on reciprocity, employees are often strongly dependent on their employer. Labour law therefore consists of an extensive regulatory framework to protect employees. In the same way that the design of the F-tax system can have a bearing on business conditions, its design can also have an impact in the field of labour law. An important task in designing the F-tax system is also to take account of the impact the provisions may have on employee protection.</p>
<h2>Secure tax revenues</h2>
<p>With regard to the impact of the F-tax system on the tax gap, it can be noted that the actual status of being registered for F-tax has no direct impact on the tax gap or central government revenues. An incorrect tax form, however, can indirectly lead to loss of tax revenue through lost revenues from other types of income, since approval for F-tax involves a greater degree of self-assessment, which is more difficult for the Swedish Tax Agency to check. It may also be the case that individuals who even at the time of applying have the intention to commit crime or evade taxes via a business are approved for F-tax. An incorrect tax form or a business used as an instrument of crime creates unfair competition in relation to the majority of businesses that conduct genuine business activities and want to do the right thing. For this reason, it is very important that the information about anyone approved for F-tax reflects their real circumstances. The design of the F-tax system thus has an impact on actual revenues, the tax gap and the legitimacy of the tax system. Moreover, a high level of trust is essential to ensure that taxes are able to finance our universal welfare, various public services and other public expenditure in the long term. A high level of trust in the tax system requires simple rules and good opportunities to do the right thing, as well as effective measures to combat tax crime, tax evasion and tax avoidance.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s assessments F-tax system’s impact on business conditions</h2>
<p>The provisions on approval for F-tax, including its legal consequences, have a major impact on the conditions for starting, running and developing a business. The provisions must therefore be simple, clear and easily managed, for both individuals and government agencies.</p>
<p>Misuse of approval for F-tax leads to unfair competition and has an adverse impact on the business climate. Consequently, the Swedish Tax Agency must have good possibilities to refuse or revoke approval for F-tax for anyone failing to compete on equal terms.</p>
<p>Implications of the concept of ‘business’ on business conditions</p>
<p>The wording of the concept ‘business’ in Chapter 13, Section 1 of the Income Tax Act (1999:1229) is suited to its purpose based on the impact the concept has on business conditions. There is no need to amend the current wording of the concept of business or its connection to the F-tax system.</p>
<p>Specifically on revoking approval for F-tax in the event of infringement of competition provisions</p>
<p>There is no reason to introduce the possibility of refusing or revoking approval for F-tax in the event of an infringement of the competition provisions that has not resulted in a trading prohibition.</p>
<h2>F-tax system’s implications on labour law</h2>
<p>Implications of the concept of ‘business’ and the F-tax system on labour law</p>
<p>The tax interpretation of the concept of ‘business’ in Chapter 13, Section 1 of the Income Tax Act, through its connection to the F-tax system, also has indirect implications on labour law.</p>
<p>Approval for F-tax is a circumstance that is taken into account in an examination with respect to labour law, but which on its own should not play any decisive role. There should therefore be no grounds for amending the current wording of the concept of business in Chapter 13, Section 1 of the Income Tax Act on the basis of labour law considerations.</p>
<p>Misuse of the F-tax system to circumvent employee protection regulations</p>
<p>The occurrence of ‘bogus’ self-employed workers shows that the F-tax system can be misused by individuals who do not fulfil the business criteria, yet are approved for F-tax. There may be several reasons for this occurrence, including a principal’s desire to circumvent protective labour law regulations. That an individual has been approved for F-tax, despite not fulfilling the criteria for business activities, can thus undermine employee protection regulations.</p>
<p>To combat the incidence of approval for F-tax by individuals not fulfilling the business criteria, the Swedish Tax Agency’s ability to follow up those who are approved should be facilitated and improved.</p>
<h2>F-tax system’s implications on preventing tax evasion and tax avoidance</h2>
<p>Follow-up of those approved for F-tax</p>
<p>To ensure that only those who conduct or have the intention to conduct business activities are approved for F-tax, the Swedish Tax Agency’s legal framework for effectively following up those who are approved must be improved. The provisions on approving and revoking F-tax registration should therefore be reviewed and adapted, based on a more automated method of working.</p>
<p>Misuse of the F-tax system to avoid taxes and contributions</p>
<p>The F-tax system can be misused by fraudulent individuals for tax evasion and tax avoidance. In order to prevent the misuse of the F-tax system, the ability of the Swedish Tax Agency to refuse or revoke approval for F-tax should be expanded.</p>
<p>Specifically on legal persons used as instruments of crime</p>
<p>The requirement that anyone approved for F-tax conducts or has the intention to conduct business activities means for a legal person that they will run an enterprise, i.e. some form of operation or activity.</p>
<p>Specifically on revoking approval for F-tax in the event of criminal activity</p>
<p>There is no reason to introduce a general provision that approval for F-tax be revoked in the event of criminal activity, even in cases when a trading prohibition has not been imposed.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the F-tax system is generally an effective and well-functioning system. However, there is reason to consider amendments to the provisions in the Tax Procedures Act in various respects. This includes amendments aimed at ensuring businesses have better conditions to compete on equal terms through measures that combat tax evasion and tax avoidance. Improved opportunities to check that only those conducting business activities are approved for F-tax may also combat the possibility of circumventing employee protection regulations. In its review, the Inquiry has also identified a need for legislative amendments in Chapter 9 of the Tax Procedures Act to make the regulatory framework clearer and more transparent.</p>
<h2>A simpler and more transparent regulatory framework</h2>
<p>It is important that the requirements for being approved for F-tax are clear in the Act. The equivalent naturally applies concerning situations in which the Swedish Tax Agency can revoke an approval. The Inquiry considers that the current design of the regulatory framework can be made more easily accessible and therefore proposes a structural revision of the provisions.</p>
<p>The requirements for approval should be divided into two different sections: one section that clearly states the circumstances comprising impediments to approval and a second that states the grounds on which the Swedish Tax Agency can revoke an approval for F-tax. The Inquiry considers that this will increase the clarity and predictability for both anyone applying and anyone who has already received approval. This will also enable outflows and inflows to the F-tax system to be regulated separately, which is better suited to the system’s structure and will enable the Swedish Tax Agency to more effectively design its system of controls. Certain substantive changes mean that the impediments to approval for F-tax will differ from the grounds for revoking an approval. This is also an argument for dividing up the provisions. The Inquiry proposes changing the headings and in certain respects ordering the sections differently. All these proposals aim to create a system that is clearer and more easily accessible.</p>
<p>There are also grounds to consider amendments aimed at designing the system on the basis of more automated and standardised processing. Often extensive manual efforts are required by the Swedish Tax Agency to assess whether there are any impediments to approving an application or to assess whether there are grounds for revoking an approval. Some manual processing is necessary to be able to consider the circumstances of an individual case. However, an increase in the automation and standardisation of processing may have a positive impact on processing times and increasing predictability for businesses, which is an argument in favour of adapting the system based on objective criteria that facilitate more automatic handling. This also means that resources can be redistributed at the Swedish Tax Agency and used for targeted checks where the risk of errors is considered greatest.</p>
<h2>A more flexible procedure for applying for approval</h2>
<p>A number of businesses liable to pay taxes, as well as those with limited tax liability, conduct business activities in Sweden for only a short period. In cases where they have applied and been approved for F-tax, most will be approved, often even when they are no longer conducting business activities in Sweden, until they send notifycation that they no longer want this approval. Considering the implycations an approval for F-tax can have for receiving orders, it must be possible to be approved even before business activities have actually begun. At the time of application, however, it is difficult for both the Swedish Tax Agency and the applicants to determine how the business will develop. In such cases, the opportunity for follow-up is therefore of great importance. The Inquiry considers that in this respect the current system can be made more flexible and more effective.</p>
<p>Approval may be time-limited in certain cases</p>
<p>A new provision should be introduced meaning that approval for F-tax may be time-limited. The validity period of decisions under the first paragraph must be limited if the applicant requests this or if the applicant does not yet conduct, but has the intention to conduct, business activities.</p>
<p>If an applicant requests F-tax approval for a limited time, validity will cease no later than the date the applicant requested. For an applicant who does not yet conduct, but has the intention to conduct, business activities in Sweden, the validity will cease no later than on a decision on final tax, the second year following the tax year in which the approval was granted. If, at the time the validity ceases, it is clear that business activities are being conducted, the approval will instead be extended until further notice without having to reapply.</p>
<p>Time-limited approval has the same legal consequences as approval until further notice.</p>
<h2>A more correct basis for decisions</h2>
<p>As the technological ability to gather and access information improves, there is also an increase in expectations that government agency decisions and measures are based on adequate and accurate information. A correct basis for decisions also contributes to greater legal security for individuals, who can feel confident that decisions will not be changed without acceptable grounds for making such a change. A case must be so well investigated that it can be expected to result in a materially correct decision. In this respect, the question of who has the best opportunity to show that a certain circumstance exists will be of great importance.</p>
<p>Obligation to provide information and potential to regulate those who are approved</p>
<p>A new section will be introduced into Chapter 9 of the Tax Procedures Act, meaning that anyone who is approved for F-tax must, if the Swedish Tax Agency so requests, provide any documents and submit any information the Agency needs to check whether the requirements for approval for F-tax have been fulfilled.</p>
<p>An expanded examination in certain cases</p>
<p>The provision on who will be examined when an applicant is a closely held corporation  is to be expanded. The examination must include business executives and other natural persons who have controlling influence in the business. The examination must also include any other closely held corporations in which the person is, or in the last two years has been, an executive or has had a controlling influence.</p>
<p>The provision on who will be examined when an applicant is a natural person, who in the last two years has been an executive in a closely held corporation, will be expanded. In addition to closely held corporations that the applicant is or has been an executive in, the examination will also include closely held corporations in which this person has had a controlling influence.</p>
<p>Anyone who, through shareholdings, other participating interests or memberships, controls more than 50 per cent of the total number of votes in a closely held corporation is considered to have a controlling influence.</p>
<h2>Impediments to applying and grounds for revoking approval in the event of shortcomings</h2>
<p>Anyone who has not been approved for F-tax is subject to A-tax. The aim of imposing requirements on anyone who wishes to be, or has been, approved for F-tax is to achieve, in individual cases, a more secure and efficient form of paying preliminary tax and social security contributions. This aim can generally be achieved by an approval being revoked and replaced by the individual’s A-tax. In that case, the principal essentially both makes tax deductions and pays social security contributions. Trading prohibition and bankruptcy essentially mean that the applicant or the individual approved is no longer entitled to conduct business activities. It goes without saying that these grounds constitute impediments to approval or grounds for revocation. When the trading prohibition expires, or when the bankruptcy has been concluded, there is no longer any impediment to being approved for F-tax. There may also be circumstances that constitute shortcomings, which the approved individual is often able to remedy on their own. When these shortcomings are removed, there is no longer any impediment to approval or ground for revocation. The Inquiry proposes the following changes concerning such shortcomings.</p>
<p>Anyone who has failed to comply with an order to fulfil their obligation to provide information</p>
<p>A new ground for revocation will be introduced when anyone who is approved for F-tax has not complied with an order to provide the documents and submit the information needed to check whether the requirements for approval have been fulfilled.</p>
<p>Those who fail to report or pay their taxes and contributions</p>
<p>The current regulations should be changed so that shortcomings in reporting or paying taxes and contributions are divided up and regulated separately in two different paragraphs.</p>
<p>The provision concerning impediments to applying should be expanded so that only when there are special grounds for doing so can approval for F-tax be granted to anyone who has failed to pay taxes or contributions that have been turned over for collection under the Tax Procedures Act or corresponding foreign taxes or contributions at the time of examination.</p>
<p>The wording of the provision concerning when there are grounds for revoking an approval for F-tax should be amended so that it includes anyone who has failed to pay taxes or contributions pursuant to this Act or have not paid corresponding foreign taxes or contributions, to an amount totalling at least a half price base amount at the time of the examination for F-tax was conducted.</p>
<p>Anyone who has failed to repay any amounts paid in error in connection with RUT or ROT work</p>
<p>A new impediment to approval and a new ground for revocation should be introduced for anyone who has failed to repay any amounts paid in error in claims for repayment pursuant to the Act on the procedure for tax deduction for domestic services ( lagen (2009:194) om förfarandet vid skattereduktion för hushållsarbete ).</p>
<h2>Impediments to applying and grounds for revoking approval in the event of misuse</h2>
<p>In addition to the circumstances described above that constitute shortcomings, misuse can also result in a revocation or a failure to be approved for F-tax. The current provision focuses on situations in which anyone who is approved has violated the conditions or in some other way misused an approval for F-tax. The application of the provision on misuse results in a waiting period aimed at emphasising the importance of using an approval correctly. Only once two years have elapsed since the incident of misuse is there no longer, in this respect, any impediment to approval for F-tax. The Inquiry proposes the following when anyone, who has been approved, has misused their approval for F-tax.</p>
<p>Anyone who has misused their approval</p>
<p>The provision concerning whether revocation should take place on grounds of misuse should be clarified. It should be clear from the provision that there are grounds for revocation if the misuse is not insignificant and has caused a risk that taxes or contributions are withheld.</p>
<p>The amendment aims to emphasise the importance that an approval is used correctly and that the ground for revocation of misuse should be used when there are conditions for this. A revocation means that anyone who has misused their approval will be subject to a waiting period. The Inquiry considers that the original reasons for the waiting period regulation in the event of revocation on grounds of misuse still apply. A waiting period of two years should continue to apply in cases of misuse. The waiting period should also continue to apply from the most recent incident of misuse. As previously, there should be no grounds for revoking an approval if the misuse is insignificant. This means that the provision should be applied restrictively and only when the misuse is of a more serious nature.</p>
<h2>A few further matters of importance</h2>
<p>The Inquiry notes that there is reason to review the conditions for exchanging information between the Swedish Tax Agency and the Swedish Companies Registration Office. Not only to make processing more effective and efficient, and provide a more correct basis for decisions, but also to make it easier for businesses. Direct access for the Swedish Tax Agency would provide many advantages. Direct access could include information on the beneficial owner registered at the Swedish Companies Registration Office, as well as information found in meeting minutes. This could contribute to reducing business administration and paperwork in the long term, as the information that businesses currently submit to the Swedish Companies Registration Office would need only to be submitted there to then be used by the Swedish Tax Agency. However, questions of direct access must be preceded by careful consideration concerning personal data processing and the purpose of the information, etc. This would require more extensive investigative work that what is possible to conduct within the framework of the Inquiry’s remit. The exchange of information between the Swedish Tax Agency and the Swedish Companies Registration Office would also include matters that largely lie outside the Inquiry’s remit. These matters should therefore be reviewed separately.</p>
<p>With regard to society’s ability to combat the problem of ‘fronts’ that arises in connection with more organised and systematic economic crime, the Inquiry considers there is reason to highlight the Swedish Companies Registration Office’s important role in connection with the registration of individuals. In the Inquiry’s view, it is important that the Swedish Tax Agency, in connection with its examination on approval for F-tax, can assume that the information registered at the Swedish Companies Registration Office reflects real circumstances. To prevent the problem of fronts, therefore, the conditions for the Swedish Companies Registration Office to combat the use of fronts must improve. In light of this, the Inquiry considers that it is particularly important to take a position on the proposals put forward by the Swedish Companies Registration Office, which would improve the Office’s conditions for working preventively to stop businesses from being used as instruments of crime.</p>
<p>Finally, the Inquiry also considers that the provisions on joint liability should be reviewed separately to investigate how to improve the formulation of the provisions in order to prevent the F-tax system from being used to i.e. supply undeclared labour and to prevent the misuse of approval for F-tax in other situations.</p>
<h2>Implications of the Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>The proposals aim to improve the functionality of the F-tax system, improve business competitiveness and prevent tax loss through fraud and tax avoidance. In the Inquiry’s assessment, amended legislation and a greater level of automation may result in a more economically efficient system. The Inquiry considers that the proposals will result in better opportunities for the Swedish Tax Agency to directly impact the tax gap. These proposals will also result in a more secure and improved collection. If the Swedish Tax Agency’s improved ability to assess the correct tax is accompanied by a continued high level of collection effectiveness, the proposals will result in increased revenues for central government. The proposals can also be expected to result in indirect effects on the tax base. These indirect effects refer to the consequences of the Swedish Tax Agency’s direct measures. The proposals will provide the Swedish Tax Agency with better data for assessing who fulfils the requirements for approval for F-tax and who does not. The proposals that combat unfair competition also have an indirect effect in the form of improved competitiveness for the majority of responsible businesses that follow the existing regulatory frameworks. Assuming that the demand for the services supplied by businesses operating outside the regulations for tax remains, it is reasonable to assume that this demand will benefit other businesses instead. This should consequently result in increased tax revenues.</p>
<p>With regard to the effects on government agencies, the Inquiry estimates that all proposals will be self-financed in the long term. Certain initial investments will need to be implemented, which may necessitate an increased appropriation to the Swedish Tax Agency. The proposals can be expected to have only a marginal impact on the activities of the Swedish Enforcement Authority and the administrative courts. The proposals are not expected to result in any consequences for other government agencies.</p>
<p>With regard to the impact on businesses and individuals, the Inquiry’s proposals will lead to a more flexible procedure when applying for approval for F-tax. The proposals will reduce the potential to misuse the F-tax system, which will result in an improvement in the conditions for preventing businesses from gaining any competitive advantage by circumventing labouror tax-law regulations. The Inquiry therefore estimates that the proposals will strengthen business competitiveness and create better and more equitable rules for entrepreneurship. The proposals will impact businesses in the services sector, primarily small businesses/enterprises. The Inquiry does not expect that the proposals will have any overall effect on businesses’ administrative burden.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers several of the proposals will have a direct impact on combating tax-related crime and strengthening crime prevention work. The proposals are not expected to have any impact on gender equality or integration policy objectives. Nor does the Inquiry expect the proposals to have any major effects on employment.</p>
<p>Finally, the proposals are considered to be compatible with fundamental principles of freedom to conduct a business and comply with the obligations that follow from Sweden’s membership of the European Union. The proposed provisions are not considered discriminatory. Nor are the proposals expected to give rise to any restriction that is contrary to EU law.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the provisions enter into force on 1 January 2021. In the Inquiry’s view, there is no need for any transitional provisions.</p>
