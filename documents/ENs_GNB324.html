<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The committee on the geographical structural funds’ programmes has gathered and analysed experiences from the first period during which Sweden has received assistance from the EU’s structural funds. The committee also presents proposals for the programming and implementation of the structural-fund programmes for the next period, 2000– 2006. These experiences and proposals only concern geographically defined objective areas as well as Community initiatives Interreg IIA and Leader II. During the current programme period the objective areas have been called objective 2, objective 5b and objective 6. In the next programme period they will be called objective 1 and objective 2.</p>
<p>Experiences from the programming and implementation of the programmes</p>
<p>The overall impression is that the structural-fund programmes have instilled a new way of working on regional-development issues in Sweden. The programmes have paved the way for increased co-operation in new constellations, not least across municipal and county boundaries.</p>
<p>The time allotted for programming was much too scarce, which hampered the process of establishing the programmes, and there was little opportunity to fully engage the partnership in the process. The private sector did not participate in the programme work to the extent that had been hoped. In certain regions, the question of the organisation for implementing the programmes, rather than the content of the programmes, dominated the agenda.</p>
<p>Programme management committes and monitoring committees are two new types of organisation that were set up for the implementation of the structural-fund programmes. Through the partnership a wide range of participants were active both in the programming and implementation stages.</p>
<p>In respect of the implementation of the programmes the work of the programme management committees  and monitoring committees  has</p>
<p>shown varying results, as has the participation of the partnership. In certain regions reference groups and framework programmes have been created to increase the participation of the partnership in the programme work. Although burdened by a heavy workload, the programme secretariats  have built up broad expertise and gained a lot of experience.</p>
<p>Co-financing   and the prohibition against advance payments  from the structural funds have created difficulties primarily for smaller project owners. The participation of the private sector in the implementation of the programmes has been small due to the fact that private assets  are not admissible as co-financing. The possibility of appealing  project decisions, through which paying authorities may overrule an programme management committee’s decision on aid, has created uncertainty among project owners.</p>
<p>The administration of payments  has been surrounded by problems and obscurities. Different control and accounting requirements apply for the various funds. At the same time, Sweden has tried to co-ordinate the administration of payments. The authorities responsible for payments have developed different supervision systems for these. Uncertainties in the division of responsibility between programme secretariats and the paying authorities have led to a lot of unnecessary double work. In addition, project owners have been late in claiming structural-fund assistance.</p>
<p>Flaws in IT systems  and in the co-ordination of information in the national database have resulted in a loss of efficiency as well as security problems in the administration of the structural funds.</p>
<p>Conclusions and recommendations</p>
<p>The successful use of structural-fund assets in Sweden requires active participation by the partnership both in the programming and implementation of structural-fund programmes. The composition of the partnership could vary from one time to another, depending on local conditions. Drafting groups and framework projects are two models for how a partnership could work. The members of such a partnership could be representatives of county councils, municipalities, unions, employers’ associations, county employment boards, local co-operatives, private sector organisations, educational associations, environment groups or equal-opportunities organisations.</p>
<p>To allow individual companies to participate actively in the implementation of the structural-fund programmes, it should be possible to base structural-fund assistance on private assets.</p>
<p>The programme management committees should be abolished and replaced by boards set up at county administrative boards and the organs of self-government in the trial counties. The boards which take decisions on projects should also be given authority by the government to make payments. That would solve the current problem of appeals.</p>
<p>A pool for county-wide projects should be set up in the new programmes. The pool should make up at least 20 per cent of the programme budget and could be used for various ventures in tourism, IT and R&D.</p>
<p>In projects aimed at the Saami, the Saami Parliament should be appointed executive and paying authority.</p>
<p>On the assumption that the archipelagos will constitute objective areas also during the next programme period, an executive board with the right to disburse funds should be established at the county administrative board nominated by the government.</p>
<p>The Leader programmes should retain the current executive organisation. For Interreg programmes in which Sweden bears prime responsibility my main model for decisions and payments should apply. In cases where prime responsibility for an Interreg programme is borne by another state, I recommend that the current system with programme managament committees be used.</p>
<p>A general possibility of advance payments of structural-fund assistance should be introduced. If this proves impossible, interest on liquid assets should be made eligible for assistance.</p>
<p>The monitoring committees should be strengthened as strategic political organs. Therefore, committees should primarily consist of elected representatives from local authorities and county councils, but organisations and representatives from the private sector should also be represented. The committees should participate in the design of programmes.</p>
<p>In Sweden only one managing authority should handle the administration of the structural-fund programmes. This could be a new authority or NUTEK, the Swedish National Board for Industrial and Technical Development.</p>
<p>Responsibility for the programmes which will be phased out should be borne by the same organisation that decides on and makes payments of aid money.</p>
