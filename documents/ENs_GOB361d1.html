<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The new budget process has on the whole worked well. It contributed to the improvement in public finances in the late 1990s. As a proportion of GDP, public expenditure has fallen from a peak of around 70 per cent in 1993 to approximately 55 per cent in 2000. Net lending has been turned from a large deficit to a surplus, and debt has declined sharply.</p>
<p>There is strong support for the main elements of the new budget process. This is indicated by a survey carried out by the Commission among State Secretaries and officials of the Government Offices. The new process is felt to have increased long-term thinking in the budget policy, because decisions on expenditure ceilings and expenditure frames in the budget process are taken early in the process, and this is considered to have led to a better control of expenditure.</p>
<p>But there are also two major problems. One is that two similar budget processes are conducted per year, in both the government and Riksdagen (Parliament). This is wasteful and means that other important functions, including follow-up and evaluation, have to take second place. The other problem is that the system of budgeting margins has not worked properly.</p>
<p>To tackle the first problem, the Commission proposes that the budget process should be further streamlined so that the spring process deals with economic policy in the medium-to-long term and the autumn process deals with the budget for the following year. An arrangement of this kind underpins the desired nature of a top-down budget process, i.e. for the overall economic/political decisions to be taken first and to serve as an external framework in which expenditure areas and grants may later be established.</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that in its Spring Fiscal Policy Bill, the government should present Riksdagen with proposals for guidelines on economic policy in the medium-to-long term and on expenditure ceilings and expenditure targets (see below) for the budget year three years ahead. Guidelines on fiscal policy in the medium-to-long term and decisions relating to the balance target should also be included in the spring finance bill. Another recommendation is that in the spring</p>
<p>the government should present proposals for guidelines that the municipalities need for their planning and decisions, so that in spring Riksdagen can follow up and evaluate the results in the economy and activity for the preceding years. On the other hand, guidelines on allocation of government expenditure into areas of expenditure should not be included in the Spring Fiscal Policy Bill.</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that in autumn in its Budget Bill the government should present proposals for expenditure areas and grants for the next budget year. The bill should be focused totally on the next budget year. As a result, the government should not – as it does now – propose expenditure frameworks for three years, merely for one year.</p>
<p>To tackle the second problem, the budgeting margin, the Commission recommends that the expenditure ceiling should be supplemented by an expenditure target, which would be set lower than the expenditure ceiling. The level for the expenditure target should be set so that changes in the expenditure ratio, the tax ratio and the balance should fall within the targets set for economic policy in the medium-to-long term. The level of the expenditure target should govern the autumn budget proposals.</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that the concept budgeting margin should be replaced by two concepts - contingency reserve and planning reserve. The contingency reserve is the margin between expenditure ceiling and expenditure target and should be around 3 per cent of expenditure, to allow for consequences of any short-term deviations in economic fluctuations from the longer-term trend.</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that the expenditure ceiling and the expenditure target should in future continue to include all expenditure via the central government budget, excluding national debt interest, and retirement pensions outside the central government budget. Calculations of the municipalities’ expenditure and central government interest expense should also be included in the information presented to Riksdagen in order to provide a picture of the changes in total public expenditure.</p>
<p>The Commission further recommends that the extended grants should be removed. Relatively few extended grants remain, and it has not been found that sufficient reasons exist to justify retaining a special category of grant for them. In addition, a public authority shall be permitted, without first having to obtain special approval from the government, to utilize a grant saving on a framework grant, even if it exceeds three per cent of the grant.</p>
<p>The Commission finds that the quality of the statistical base and the forecasts in the budget process are capable of improvement. Forecasting within the Government Offices in connection with individual</p>
<p>grants can also be improved, for example, via better quality data, methods and models, and through improved proficiency.</p>
<p>The Commission finds that the information provided for decisions by Riksdagen can be improved. Streamlining of the budget process will enable many instances of duplication and overlapping to be eliminated. The Spring Fiscal Policy Bill should include a greater number of – and longer – retrospectives to illustrate trends in economic developments. Transparency in information for decisions can be improved. The consequences of major changes in the central government budget should also be reported in terms of the national accounts.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission notes that the difference in how business is allocated between government ministries and Riksdagen committees complicates the budget process. One difficulty in the budget process and during preparation of information in the current allocation of expenditure by expenditure areas is that responsibility for many expenditure areas is shared by several ministries.</p>
