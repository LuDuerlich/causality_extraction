<p>Remit of the Inquiry</p>
<p>The remit of the Inquiry has been, initially, to chart and analyse the extent to which asylum seekers and other aliens seeking residence permits lack documents. The Inquiry has also been instructed to investigate the legal and practical problems that a lack of documentation entails and how this is reflected in the application of the law.</p>
<p>Another task of the Inquiry has been to consider under what circumstances and in what way asylum seekers and others should be induced to cooperate in procuring necessary papers and documents and in what other ways measures can be taken to clarify the identity and itineraries of asylum seekers and other aliens, at an early stage in the asylum process.</p>
<p>In addition, the Inquiry has had the task of proposing ways to amend the Aliens Act so as to introduce the possibility of temporary residence permits for asylum seekers who are deemed to be in need of protection here or who must be granted permission to stay for some other reason and who do not cooperate in clarifying their identity.</p>
<p>Asylum seekers without documents</p>
<p>What is meant by a lack of documents is primarily that the asylum seeker does not present a passport, other types of identity papers or travel documentation. The documents that are presented may also be forgeries.</p>
<p>The number of asylum seekers who lack documentation has exploded in recent years. In 1997, 34 % of the people seeking asylum in Sweden lacked a passport or an equivalent document (certain types of identity cards and driving licences). In the first</p>
<p>quarter of 2004, 93 % of the people in this group lacked a passport or equivalent document.</p>
<p>The lack of documents is more or less equally widespread no matter where asylum seekers originally come from. Asylum seekers who are nationals of countries in North and South America, however, are considerably more likely than others to present passports or equivalent documents.</p>
<p>Legal and practical problems</p>
<p>Problems in establishing identity have broad ramifications and are associated with legal and practical problems in virtually every sector of society.</p>
<p>The lack of an adequately established identity makes integration more difficult and is a great problem for the police, above all in connection with crime prevention and legal proceedings.</p>
<p>The problem of asylum seekers and other aliens without documents is a waste of resources and a difficulty for legal certainty. If the authorities do not manage to deal with the problem, confidence in the asylum system is at risk.</p>
<p>Temporary residence permits in cases where identity and itinerary are unclear: new arrangements</p>
<p>Required cooperation</p>
<p>The identity and itinerary of asylum seekers and other aliens should be clarified to safeguard the right of asylum and because a lack of documents causes problems in the asylum process and for the individual. In addition, there are security reasons. Therefore asylum seekers and people seeking a residence permit for other reasons should be required to actively cooperate as far as possible in clarifying their identity and itinerary. Granting temporary resident status to certain people who are now granted permanent resident status could induce some of these individuals to cooperate in clarifying their identity and itinerary. However, in order to achieve any substantial reduction in the number of people lacking documentation, temporary residence permits must be backed up by other measures (see below under “Social benefits, etc.”).</p>
<p>It is very important that officials at the Swedish Migration Board act with clarity and consistency. It is also important that they make it clear to asylum seekers how they are expected to cooperate in different respects. The Swedish Migration Board should therefore introduce its new procedures for identity investigations as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Who should be granted a temporary residence permit?</p>
<p>If an alien’s identity cannot be clarified it is often difficult to approve an application for asylum. However, since the reasons why the alien needs protection must be assessed in the light of the country or countries that he or she comes from, in exceptional cases a person can be granted asylum if he or she can show with a high degree of probability from which country he or she has fled. The same applies to residence permits for people otherwise in need of protection. Against this backdrop, the Inquiry proposes that people who are granted asylum or a residence permit as a person otherwise in need of protection should continue to be normally granted permanent residence permits.</p>
<p>In addition, the Inquiry proposes that asylum seekers and other aliens who do not cooperate in clarifying their identity and itinerary should be granted temporary residence permits if they are deemed to have other adequate reasons for being allowed to stay.</p>
<p>What should “temporary” mean?</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that temporary residence permits should have a normal duration of two years. However, if there are exceptional grounds for doing so, it should be possible to grant a further two-year temporary residence permit. One example of exceptional grounds is when an asylum seeker has made some contribution to the investigation into her or his identity and itinerary and there are considered to be good prospects that her or his cooperation will lead to a permanent residence permit being granted at some future time.</p>
<p>Social benefits, etc.</p>
<p>It is quite conceivable that a temporary residence permit as such may induce certain people to cooperate in clarifying their identity and itinerary. However, in order to encourage a substantial proportion of asylum seekers and other aliens to cooperate in this process, the Inquiry considers that the temporary residence permits must be backed up by other measures.</p>
<p>The reason for granting these temporary residence permits is that there is insufficient information available to the investigation into a person’s identity and itinerary. There is still uncertainty about whether these people will receive permission to settle permanently in Sweden. The Inquiry therefore takes the view that it is unreasonable for them to enjoy all the social rights normally extended to aliens starting out on permanent residence in the country. On the other hand, they must have a reasonable living standard and a meaningful stay in Sweden even during the time they hold a temporary residence permit. In the opinion of the Inquiry, it is therefore reasonable that the people in question continue to be treated as asylum seekers in all essential respects. The Inquiry therefore proposes that a person who is granted a temporary residence permit because of inadequate cooperation in the investigation into her or his identity and itinerary should be entitled to support provided for in the Reception of Asylum Seekers and Others Act.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers further that, during the period for which they have been granted a residence permit, it is important that the people concerned are as available as possible for cooperation with the investigation into their identity and itinerary. Since it is a matter of people who have not proved – or have not even been sufficiently willing to cooperate in proving – their identity, it is important for security reasons as well to know where they are. The Inquiry therefore proposes that a person who has been granted a temporary residence permit because of inadequate cooperation in the investigation into her or his identity and itinerary should live in accommodation provided by the Swedish Migration Board and should not be entitled to a housing allowance for own accommodation.</p>
<p>Health and medical care is provided to asylum seekers and other aliens on the basis of an agreement between the Swedish state and the Swedish Federation of County Councils. This agreement goes</p>
<p>beyond the mandatory duties of the county councils. In the opinion of the Inquiry, people granted temporary residence permits because of inadequate cooperation in the investigation into their identity and itinerary should also be entitled to health and medical care under this agreement. The Inquiry therefore proposes that the agreement should be extended to cover this category of people as well.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the Inquiry, people granted temporary residence permits because of inadequate cooperation in the investigation into their identity and itinerary should not be eligible for exemption from work permit requirements, primarily for work environment and safety reasons. Moreover, they should not be able to receive a work permit.</p>
<p>Population registration</p>
<p>As described in the previous section, the Inquiry does not consider that it is reasonable for people who are granted temporary residence permits because of inadequate cooperation in the investigation into their identity and itinerary to be entitled to the same benefits as residents of Sweden. The most appropriate way to achieve this distinction, in the view of the Inquiry, is not to enter these people in the Swedish population register. The Inquiry therefore proposes that people who are granted temporary residence permits because of inadequate cooperation in the investigation into their identity and itinerary should not be registered in the Swedish population. The Inquiry further proposes that during this period, these people should not be considered residents of Sweden for the purposes of the Social Insurance Act.</p>
<p>Appeals</p>
<p>At present, an alien who has applied for a permanent residence permit but has only been granted a temporary residence permit is not entitled to appeal against the decision. Decisions on refugee status and on a reduction of the daily allowance under the Reception of Asylum Seekers and Others Act are, however, open to appeal. This means that in reality, the person concerned can appeal against the assessment made of her or his cooperation in the</p>
<p>investigation into her or his identity by appealing against one of these decisions. In light of this, the Government proposes that there should be no possibility to appeal against a decision on temporary status because of inadequate cooperation in the investigation into identity and itinerary.</p>
<p>Notification requirement</p>
<p>In the course of the Inquiry’s work, it has emerged that identity papers, in particular, that have not been presented by asylum seekers and others to the Swedish Migration Board are sometimes produced in other contexts, e.g. in connection with examination of impediments to marriage and at police traffic controls. At present this information rarely comes to the attention of the Swedish Migration Board. In the opinion of the Inquiry, increased cooperation between the Swedish Migration Board and other authorities would be desirable. It should be more broadly possible to supply information about identity and travel documents to the Swedish Migration Board. The Inquiry considers that a general requirement should be introduced to notify the Swedish Migration Board of these documents. Due to the limited time available to it, the Inquiry has not been able to present any proposal in this area and it is of the opinion that the issue should be the subject of a separate inquiry.</p>
<p>Consequences and implementation</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals are expected to lead to marginally higher costs for the state, unless the number of asylum seekers and permanent residence permits that are finally granted go down because of the proposals. If, on the other hand, the number of people seeking asylum and number of permanent residence permits finally granted does go down due to the proposals, the Inquiry is of the opinion that the result will be lower costs for the state. The proposals will entail higher costs for the Swedish Migration Board during the period the people concerned are living in accommodation provided by the Board. For the state as a whole, these increased costs will be compensated or postponed since the</p>
<p>standard allowance paid to local government for the same people will not be paid while they are waiting for a decision on their case.</p>
<p>The Inquiry believes that as a result of its proposals, a higher percentage of the people granted a residence permit in Sweden will have been identified. Establishment of their identity will make it easier for the people concerned to become integrated into Swedish society. The Inquiry’s proposals are therefore considered to improve the chances of achieving the objectives of integration policy.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the legislative amendments put forward by the Inquiry should enter into force on 1 January 2006. However, applications for residence permits that have been submitted to the Swedish Migration Board before the amendment to the Aliens Act should be reviewed in accordance with the older provisions.</p>
