<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The  Commission on the Review of Economic Statistics has been appointed to propose how economic statistics can be adapted to meet the expanding and new needs of statistics. Economic statistics have grown in importance as a basis for economic analysis and economic policy decisions. The quality requirements of statistics have been raised, while the conditions for the measurement of economic development have become more difficult.</p>
<p>As the initial part of this review, the Commission has defined changes in the needs and perspectives of users in relation to future Swedish economic statistics. In certain areas, there is a broad agreement among users regarding where improvements of the statistics are most needed. This applies, for example, to the types of statistics that are lacking and to what is considered most important to begin producing. It also applies to different kinds of quality improvements.</p>
<p>The Commission draws the conclusion that there are four main areas where there are especially urgent needs to develop new statistics. The four areas are price measurements for the business service sector, IT-statistics, new statistics for a comprehensive input-output table and measures of capital stocks.</p>
<p>Those are the areas which most frequently were brought up during interviews with the users. They are also the areas which need to be improved above all, in order to analyse productivity growth in a more accurate way and the impact of the changes in the economy which usually refer to the New Economy.</p>
<p>There are also some other areas that were mentioned during the interviews with the users, for example, regional statistics, wage statistics, government finances, health care, etc. The Commission intend, in its continuing work, to more thoroughly analyse and</p>
<p>discuss the opportunities for meeting the needs in these and other mentioned areas.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission consider it already especially imminent at this early stage of the review to speed up the timeliness of economic statistics in certain areas. The Commission conclude that the speeding up of the short-term economic statistics, which is the result of the Action Plan on the EMU Statistical Requirements , which the (Ecofin) Council agreed on in September 2000, is necessary to implement. Besides that, the Commission intend, in its further work, to assess the possibilities to produce provisional National Accounts as fast as the USA.</p>
<p>There are also other aspects of the economic statistics that need improvement, according to the users. These concern timeliness in other areas than those mentioned, accuracy, level of detail, the length of time series, comparability between different statistical products, international comparability, accessibility and presentation. The Commission intend, in its continuing work, to discuss the possibilities to meet these needs.</p>
