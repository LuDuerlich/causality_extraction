<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In this report we have briefly surveyed and to some extent extended a couple of empirical studies on Swedish banking efficiency and productivity change on the basis of frontier production function methods. The results may be summarised in the following way:</p>
<p>• In the literature, there is no general agreement on the definition of outputs and inputs in banking, and there is a lot of variation between different studies. Even within each of the two dominant approaches, the production approach (or service provision or value added approach) and the intermediation approach (or asset approach), there is substantial variation Moreover, the empirical results do not seem very robust, but rather depend upon the definition of outputs and inputs – although rather few studies have dealt with this issue.</p>
<p>• In general, banking efficiency and productivity change seem to be very sensitive to fluctuations in output variables, i.e., in capacity utilisation. This is most evident in the case of productivity change at branch offices, which shows high variation between years, strongly correlated with output variation. This is also evident in the years after the banking crisis, when technical change at the frontier turns into regress, from 1992 onwards. As a response to a banking crisis, this may seem counter intuitive. However, it turns out that the result, to a large extent, is driven by the development of output. A major reason for the banking crisis was the dramatic increase in the real rate of interest, causing large changes in household and company portfolios, with extensive repayment of loans and less demand for new loans. While deposits decreased somewhat, loans and guarantees decreased substantially, and it was obviously not possible to adjust labour use at the same rate.</p>
<p>• The efficiency analysis of Swedish banks in 1996 illustrates the sensitivity of the results with respect to choice of variables. On the one hand, the choice between labour costs and labour hours has only minor impact on the efficiency distribution. On the other hand, the results are very sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of net provisions as an output variable. While the results are robust for the commercial banks – which are all (with one exception) fully efficient, the deviation between models is striking for some savings banks.</p>
<p>• In a Scandinavian comparison, the Swedish banking sector in 1990 was much more productive than the Finnish, Norwegian, and Danish banking sectors. This conclusion also holds for the largest banks. The large gap between Swedish and Finnish average productivity is mainly due to the efficiency component, although Sweden also has a technology advantage.</p>
<p>• In a European comparison, Swedish  commercial-banking efficiency ranks second from the bottom, both in a two-input model and in a labour use model. Important caveats here are the small sample of banks included in the study, and the small number of inputs and outputs covered.</p>
<p>• In general, there is large variation in efficiency between banks both within each country analysed and across countries. In comparison with many other industries, one should also expect lower mean efficiency and a larger dispersion in efficiency scores, i.e., between best practice and worst practice in the banking industry. The main reason for this is the rather low competitive pressure in the banking industry in combination with a mixture of banks with different types of ownership and objectives, commercial banks, cooperative banks and  not-for-profit savings banks. A related reason is the different regulatory structures facing banks in different countries, which may further increase the distance between best practice and worst practice in international comparisons.</p>
<p>• Concerning the international competitiveness of Swedish banking, we thus observe a large variation between best practice and worst practice banks in all countries and across countries. In a European comparison the results suggest the average productivity of Swedish banks to be rather low, while in a Scandinavian comparison, we get the opposite conclusion.</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The purpose of this report is to analyse relative efficiency and productivity growth in the Swedish banking sector. We will survey some previous results for the Swedish banking industry, in addition to presenting some new results. One analysis focuses on productivity change at branch-office level. We are also investigating the impact on productive efficiency and productivity growth of the deregulation of the Swedish banking industry in the mid-1980s and the consequent banking crisis. The distribution of productive efficiency for Swedish banks in 1996 is analysed on the basis of a third data set. The final analysis compares the efficiency of large Swedish banks internationally.</p>
<h2>1 Introduction</h2>
<p>The purpose of this report is to analyze relative efficiency and productivity growth in the Swedish banking sector. In recent years, relative efficiency and productivity change in banking have been the focus of a lively debate, though there is still a lack of clarity as to its actual development. The banking sector has also received considerable attention in international studies. Traditionally, the areas of main interest have been analyses of economies of scale and economies of scope, though more recently a number of efficiency and productivity studies have been undertaken. In the aftermath of liberalisation, restructuring, and deregulation of financial markets around the world, there is a recent boom, in activities directed to evaluating the performance of financial institutions. In a recent paper, Berger and Humphrey (1997) survey and contrast the results of 130 financial-institution efficiency studies. In addition to the many international studies, there are also a few studies based on data for Swedish banks; see Andersson (1999), Battese et al (1997), Berg et al (1993), Heshmati (1997), Hjalmarsson et al (1991), Hoover (1998), and Kumbhakar et al (1998). In this paper we will summarise some previous results for the Swedish banking industry, in addition to presenting some new ones.</p>
<p>A major problem related to the measurement of banking sector productivity is how to define, let alone measure, the sector's output. Triplett (1992), pointed out that progress in measurement of banking has been inhibited by two major unresolved but related questions: (1) What are the outputs? (2) What are the inputs? For instance, are deposit accounts inputs or outputs in its activity? This ambiguity of inputs and outputs was also highlighted by Wykoff (1992): ”When deposits are outputs, why are they so cheap? When they are inputs, why do people provide them to banks?” Are bank services best measured by the number of accounts held and transactions executed, or should the value of transactions be used instead? Is the administration of these accounts really the most important aspect of banking? Is not the bank's role as intermediary between savers and investors the most important from the economic point of view? How would this be measured? For a thorough theoretical and conceptual discussion of these issues, see Berger and Humphrey (1992), Fixler and Zieschang (1992) and Colwell and Davis (1992).</p>
<p>Even in 'practical' work, there is an intense discussion relating to the measurement and valuation of a bank's output. Valuing bank production in national accounts has always been controversial. Given the guidelines used today, the banking and financial sector has only a weak contribution (positive or negative) to the growth of GDP. In relation to the revised international system of national accounts (SNA), a number of alternatives regarding the treatment of banking and financial activities have been suggested. In most cases, the suggestions would imply a marked increase in the sector's contribution to GDP.</p>
<p>Humphrey (1984) divided studies of banks' production into two distinct strands, depending on the nature of the analytical approach:</p>
<p>• the production approach, also called the service provision or value added approach</p>
<p>• the intermediation approach, also called the asset approach</p>
<p>In the production approach, banks provide services to customers by handling their financial transactions, keeping customers deposits, issuing loans, cashing cheques, etc. Here the number of deposit accounts, outstanding loans, foreign exchange transactions, etc., are the output variables, with labour and capital as inputs</p>
<p>In the intermediation approach, banks are performing the two major roles of mobilising and distributing resources efficiently, in order to smooth investment activities in the economy. In this approach, the inputs are labour, materials, and deposits, while outputs are loans and other income generating activities to the banks, see e.g. Mester (1997). In some studies, the monetary volume of the deposit accounts and the loans comprise the output, while the costs of operation and the interest due are the inputs in the production process. This approach has two major subgroups: (a) the profit approach , and (b) the risk management approach.</p>
<p>In the profit approach, the bank manager’s target is to optimise the use of resources to maximise the bank’s profit function. In this approach, the bank manager cares for all types of costs in the banks and the output is the net income generated after incurring certain costs in the production process.</p>
<p>In the risk management approach, banks transform assets, on the basis of evaluation of the risks attached to various forms of asset. In risk management, banks take some risks to produce acceptable returns. A bank's performance will affect its valuation in the market, its ability to acquire other banks or to be acquired at a good price, and its ability to be funded through deposits or financial markets.</p>
<p>In both the production approach and the intermediation approach, the definition of output is strictly limited to production within banking. To what extent banks actually fulfill their role as producers of financial services lies beyond the scope of this analytical framework. This limitation is acceptable if the intention, as here, is to estimate productivity growth separately for different sub-sectors of the economy. Spillover effects between sectors would then manifest themselves as higher (or lower) productivity in those sectors which are exposed to these services. Increased productivity in the communications network, for exampel could be expected to spill over into higher productivity within transport-dependent sectors, while well-performing banks could lead to higher productivity in the whole economy, etc. These external effects could be important but, nevertheless, fall outside the scope of a purely sectoral productivity analysis.</p>
<p>This report contains several pieces of empirical research related to Swedish banks. For a start, we will survey (and slightly develop) a few studies of efficiency and productivity change in Swedish banking. Then we will focus on the efficiency and productivity of Swedish banking in international comparisons.</p>
<p>In one part of this report the production approach is used to review how one of the largest Swedish commercial banks use labour and capital to produce certain well-defined services at branch offices. However, we are not in a position to make any judgements on their quality. Instead, we will study only the development of productivity in services, under the assumption that their quality remains unchanged over the sample period.</p>
<p>In other parts of this report, the intermediation approach is used. In these cases the sample is collected from banks´ annual reports. Here micro units are entire banks, with one or more offices.</p>
<p>Because this report focuses on productive efficiency and productivity change, we use various kinds of frontier models, described in Section 2. The empirical results are presented in Section 3.</p>
<h2>2 Measurement of efficiency and productivity change</h2>
<h2>2.1 Efficiency</h2>
<p>Measurement of efficiency in the sense of evaluating the performance of production units against a benchmark or yardstick, under the heading of frontier analysis, is becoming increasingly widespread. Frontier analysis provides a ranking of production units in terms of their efficiency, and it also attributes a numerical efficiency value to each production unit. This makes it possible to identify best practice  and worst practice  in a sector, and the measurement of efficiency has in fact been the main motivation for the intensive study of frontier functions.</p>
<p>Thus, for a variety of reasons, in recent years frontier analysis has become a very attractive and rather sophisticated way to benchmark the relative performance of production units. First, the notion of a frontier is consistent with the underlying economic theory of optimising behavior. Second, deviations from a frontier have a natural interpretation as a measure of the efficiency with which economic units pursue their technical or behavioral objectives. Finally, information about the structure of the frontier, and about the relative efficiency of economic units has many policy applications. One example is the setting of productivity targets in price-cap regulation of natural monopolies like electricity distribution.</p>
<p>To serve as a meaningful benchmark, the frontier should represent best-practice technology or behaviour. This benchmark may be profits, costs or production. Estimation or construction of profit frontiers , cost frontiers,  or production frontiers  can be done in various ways. But since there is not enough engineering information available on the technology of banking, and since organisation is also of great importance, the frontier itself represents observed best practice. i. e., studies of banking efficiency rely on accounting measures of outputs, inputs, costs, revenues, profits, etc. However, there are still several competing methods for determining the best-practice frontier. These methods differ primarily in the assumptions imposed on the data in terms of:</p>
<p>• Functional form of the frontier function, especially the choice between a parametric form and a  non-parametric one.</p>
<p>• Stochastic properties, especially the choice between a deterministic and a stochastic approach.</p>
<p>• Distribution assumed for the inefficiency scores (usually  half-normal, truncated normal, exponential, or gamma distribution).</p>
<p>In this report we are only concerned with production frontiers; i.e., our data consists of output and input variables. In measuring efficiency we adopt the system introduced by Forsund and Hjalmarsson (1974), a generalisation of Farrell’s measures to a variable-returns-to-scale (VRS) technology . The generalised Farrell measures are illustrated in Figure 1, where a one – input (X) and one – output (Y) production activity is assumed. The production units are denoted by A, B, C and D. In the case of constant returns to scale (CRS), the frontier is the straight line through B and only unit B is on the frontier; i.e., only unit B is a fully efficient best-practice unit, while units A, C, and D are inefficient. With the more flexible variable returns to scale technology, the frontier is supported by three units, A, B, and C; i.e., these units are fully efficient, while D is still inefficient.</p>
<p>A measure of efficiency is the distance between an inefficient unit and the frontier, which can be measured in several ways. Here we focus on input-saving (or input-oriented) efficiency. Another option is outputincreasing (or output-oriented) efficiency. In the case of CRS, these measures coincide; see Forsund and Hjalmarsson (1974 and 1979b). The input-saving measure shows what proportion of observed input would have been necessary to produce observed output, if the unit in question were on the efficient frontier. Similarly, the output-increasing measure shows the ratio between observed output and how much output could have been produced, with observed input and frontier technology. Efficient frontier units have a value of 1, inefficient ones less than 1.</p>
<p>VRS efficiency measures for any unit at D are:</p>
<p>Unit D will be both input-saving and output-increasing inefficient under VRS, since HJ/HD < 1 and ND/NL < 1.</p>
<p>There are several summary measures of the efficiency of the entire sector, so called structural efficiency measures. One such measure is the mean of efficiency scores, or a size-weighted mean of the efficiency scores. Another is based on the average unit (an arithmetic or geometric mean of the industry), for which input-saving or output-increasing efficiency measures can be calculated.</p>
<p>As regards determination of the frontier, two approaches dominate today:</p>
<p>• SFA = Stochastic frontier analysis – the dominant econometric approach</p>
<p>• DEA = Data envelopment analysis – the dominant programming approach</p>
<p>SFA uses a parametric representation of technology, along with a twopart composed error term. One part of the composed error term represents statistical noise, and is assumed to follow a normal distribution. The other part represents technical inefficiency, and is usually assumed to follow a skewed distribution such as a half normal, truncated normal, exponential, or gamma distribution. One problem with cross-sectional data in efficiency measurement is that technical inefficiency cannot be separated from firm-specific effects, which may not be related to inefficiency. This problem can be avoided if panel data is available. (By panel data, we mean data on a cross-section of firms, each observed for a number of time periods.) Then the residual may be split into four components; a firm-specific effect, a time-specific effect, an inefficiency component, and random noise. Often the time specific effect is replaced by the explicit introduction of technical change in the production function.</p>
<p>One weakness with SFA is that if the functional form is misspecified, measured efficiency may be confounded with specification errors. Another weakness of this approach is its limited usefulness in the case of multiple output – multiple input production when input price data is not available. A third weakness is its sensitivity to heteroscedasticity; i.e., the impact on the estimated efficiency scores when firms in a cross-section vary widely in size. If this is not accounted for, one would expect overestimation of the intercept of the frontier function and underestimation of the slope coefficients; see Caudill and Ford (1993).</p>
<p>The major competing frontier approach is the very popular nonparametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach. This approach imposes less structure on the frontier, which is formed as the piecewise linear combination of best-practice units, yielding a convex production possibilities set. Moreover, it is easy to apply in the case of multiple output and multiple input. It involves the construction of a technological frontier via the estimation of a piece-wise linear convex technology that envelops the data, as in Figure 1. The frontier technology encompasses the fully efficient units, while the efficiency of the rest of the units is measured as deviations from the frontier. A key drawback is that there is no random error; i.e., the approach is deterministic (although there have been attempts to introduce stochastic properties). Another weakness of this approach is its sensitivity to some factors:</p>
<p>• It is sensitive to outliers; i.e., units that are extreme in some sense (e.g. small offices run by workaholics)</p>
<p>• An increase in the number of outputs or inputs leads to an increase in efficiency scores. In small samples with many variables almost all units may be on the frontier.</p>
<p>• An increase in the number of production units yields a decrease in efficiency scores. Thus, a comparison of efficiency levels across industries requires adjustment for sample size; see Zhang and Bartels (1998).</p>
<p>It is not possible to determine which of the two major approaches dominates the other, since the true level of efficiency is unknown. Because in DEA all deviations from the frontier are interpreted as inefficiency, the SFA approach normally yields higher efficiency levels than DEA.</p>
<p>A more technical description of the two approaches is given in Appendix 1, which presents the mathematical formulation of the models applied in this report.</p>
<h2>2.2 Productivity</h2>
<p>The general definition of total factor productivity, TFP, is the ratio between an output index and an input index. This definition raises the question how outputs and inputs should be aggregated in the respective indexes. If a production function is used as an aggregator, the weights will be the marginal elasticities on both the output and the input side. This is the conventional aggregation approach.</p>
<p>Another type of aggregation is the proportional shrinking of an input vector and proportional expansion of an output vector. This is the aggregation performed in the so-called Malmquist productivity index discussed below.</p>
<p>We are often not so much interested in TFP per se, but in comparisons of TFP over time or across regions. Thus, TFP comparisons are binary comparisons between two observations in time or in space, while as we saw above, efficiency is measured against a common reference technology – the frontier.</p>
<p>For a parametric production function, the change in TFP over time is usually measured by the shift in production possibilities, which is the same as technical change. This is the time-trend approach. TFP is then the change in the output vector minus the change in the input vector; i.e., the residual factor of output growth net of changes in inputs. This is the definition used in the econometric, SFA, models discussed in this report.</p>
<p>With DEA however, which is non-parametric, productivity change can not be investigated by a time trend approach. Instead, the Malmquist total productivity (MTP) index has come to dominate productivity research based on DEA frontiers.</p>
<p>The MTP index is only based on quantity variables, but nevertheless knowledge about at least one technology is required. This index and its parts can be expressed completely in terms of Farrell efficiency measures, so the need for technology information boils down to being able to calculate these measures. Thus, MTP fits very well as a complement to DEA .</p>
<p>Thus, the Malmquist productivity index offers an alternative way to measure productivity at a sectoral level. A graphical presentation of the total Malmquist productivity index is provided in Figure 2. Here we illustrate the construction of the input-oriented or input-based index.</p>
<p>P is a production unit observed for two years, t and t+1. Between these time points the frontier function has shifted from f t  to f t+1 . In year t, technical efficiency for P t  measured against f t  is</p>
<p>E t,t  = OC/OD where the first index denotes the frontier year, and the second index denots the observation. Measured against f t+1  technical efficiency for p t  is</p>
<p>E t+1,t  = OA/OD</p>
<p>Correspondingly, technical efficiency for P t+1  relative to f t+1  is</p>
<p>E t+1,t+1 = OB/OE and measured against f t  it is</p>
<p>E t,t+1  = OF/OE</p>
<p>The Malmquist input-based productivity index with frontier technology f t  as the reference may then be written as</p>
<p>E t,t</p>
<p>The Malmquist input-based productivity index with frontier technology f t+1  as the reference may be written as</p>
<p>E t+1,t</p>
<p>M >1 means productivity improvement, while M<1 means productivity decline.</p>
<p>The Malmquist index can be decomposed into two components, MC and MF i .</p>
<p>MC is the change in efficiency relative to the frontier: i.e.,a catching up productivity index:</p>
<p>OB</p>
<p>MC = OE  = E t+1,t+1</p>
<p>OC  E t,t</p>
<p>OD</p>
<p>MF is the change in distance to the frontier; i.e., a productivity index:</p>
<p>A total productivity index, can then be defined as M i  = MC x MF i :</p>
<p>For a fully efficient observation both years, MC = 1. The index is then a pure frontier – distance measure.</p>
<p>In general, the choice of reference technology is important for the empirical result. If there is no strong reason to choose a certain base, an alternative originally suggested in Färe et al (1994), is to take the geometric mean of M t  and M t+1 ,</p>
<p>In calculating the efficiency measures in Section 3.2 on which the subsequent Malmquist index is based, we have confined ourselves to the model with constant returns to scale. With regard to comparisons over time, this is fully plausible, since differences in returns-to-scale assumptions have greater implications for efficiency measures between production units in a cross section. However, in the other cases we apply both CRS and VRS models.</p>
<h2>2.3 Interpretation of efficiency scores and productivity change</h2>
<p>There are several reasons to be careful with interpretation of the empirical results of efficiency and productivity studies. For a start, what has come to be called efficiency measures is nothing but measures of distances from production units to a frontier. Especially in DEA with variable returns to scale, the frontier envelops closely around the data set. This means that a production unit may be at the frontier not because it is a well performing unit, but just because it lacks competition in that segment of the frontier. Typically, a closer look at a small frontier unit reveals it to be a rather poorly performing unit in terms of partial productivities. But given its size, it is still a frontier unit with efficiency score of 1. One should therefore check which units are so-called selfevaluators,  in the sense that they lack competition, from other units. In this respect, constant returns to scale is more robust, and in general one should, expect rather large differences between efficiency scores generated by DEA-VRS compared to DEA-CRS for small and large units.</p>
<p>As discussed above, because of the inherent properties of the frontier techniques applied here, one should expect SFA to give higher mean efficiency, a smaller dispersion in a cross-section, and smaller variation over time than DEA. The reason for this is that, in the case of SFA, part of the variation in data is referred to random noise, while in DEA all deviations from the frontier are assumed to be inefficiency. Moreover, in the case of panel data estimation, another share of the variation in data is picked up the bank-specific effect. This component is meant to adjust for permanent differences in bank behaviour, which means that permanent inefficiency is caught by this component. Thus, the bank specific effect may also contain inefficiency, and then further reduce the explicit inefficiency scores.</p>
<p>In comparison with many other industries, one should also expect a lower degree of mean efficiency and a larger dispersion in efficiency scores; i.e., between best practice and worst practice in the banking industry. The main reason for this is the rather low competitive pressure in the banking industry in combination with a mixture of banks with different types of ownership and objectives, commercial banks, cooperative banks, and not-for-profit savings banks. A related reason is the regulatory structure facing banks in different countries, which may further increase the distance between best practice and worst practice in international comparisons.</p>
<p>The rate of productivity change may also influence the distance between best practice and worst practice. During periods of rapid technical progress at the frontier, many production units may have difficult catching up and lag behind for some time, causing a decrease in mean efficiency. On the other hand, during periods of slow technical progress at the frontier, one would expect units below the frontier to catch up, causing an increase in mean efficiency.</p>
<p>Concerning interpretation of productivity change measures, one should bear in mind that, in general, productivity measures are rather model-dependent; see Kumbhakar et al (1999). This is also the case for productivity indexes. Usually Laspeyre and Paasche indexes constitute the outer bounds, with, for example the Tornkvist index in between. This is also true for the Malmquist index: The index based on the reference technology for year t (Laspeyre) often shows higher values than the index based on the reference technology for year t+1 (Paasche).</p>
<h2>3 Empirical studies</h2>
<h2>3.1 Swedish branch office productivity change</h2>
<h2>3.1.1 The data</h2>
<p>Analyses of productivity or efficiency at the branch office level are very rare; one of the few studies is Hjalmarsson et al (1991). This study covers the period 1983 to 1989 for the branch offices of one of the biggest Swedish commercial banks. The main reson for including this somewhat old study here is to show the large variation in productivity change between years at the bank office level and the large variation in efficiency among offices within a single bank. Data was derived from a computerised statistical system for labour-input measurement. The overall activity at the bank offices is specified and divided into about 700 points of measurement, then translated into time using the MTM standard. The various measurement points can be aggregated into a smaller number of activities or outputs. The following output variables are included in the analysis:</p>
<p>• Deposits ; this refers to activities directed to the acquisition of savings and to related services.</p>
<p>• Cashing;  this refers to cash-payment activity either in the bank offices or via a teller machine.</p>
<p>• Loans ; this refers to activities related to the granting of credit.</p>
<p>• Trusteeship  (Notariat); this refers only to the administration of assets which is related to the branch offices' depots. In the big cities, there are central notary (trust) departments that administer assets for a large number of customers. These departments are not included in the study.</p>
<p>• Foreign Related;  this includes, foreign currency and traveller’s cheques as well as payments to abroad undertaken directly by the office. The bulk of foreign transactions are executed at centrally based and specialised departments using computers. These are left out of the analysis.</p>
<p>• Fund;  this refers to that portion of the securities trade that is undertaken at the offices (delivery, swaps, payments etc.). Even here there exist centrally-placed functionaries who administer transactions and operate on the market (the stock exchange). These are not included either.</p>
<p>• Lawyer ; this is a collective expenditure item used for those few offices which have their own bank lawyer.</p>
<p>• The following inputs are included:</p>
<p>• Time worked : full-time white-collar workers are assumed to put in 92400 minutes, in other words 1540 hours.</p>
<p>• Information technology,  IT: costs for administrative data processing, measured in kSEK.</p>
<p>• Office space:  measured in square meters.</p>
<p>Due to a statistical reorganisation between 1987 and 1988, these two years are not fully comparable. We thus divide the sample period into two parts: 1983-1987 and 1988-1989. The number of offices in the sample varies from 133 to 135.</p>
<p>We also note the following:</p>
<p>• 1984 and 1985 were years of low production across the board, the sharp decline having set in during 1983. This decline was reversed into an increase for  1986-87.</p>
<p>• Costs for information technology increased for all years.</p>
<p>• Office space, not unexpectedly, remained for the most part constant.</p>
<h2>3.1.2 Empirical results</h2>
<p>Average productivity growth</p>
<p>Table 1a shows productivity growth for a constructed average office (using the arithmetic mean), while mean (unweighted) productivity growth for the offices is presented in Table 1b.</p>
<p>MTP is the Malmquist total productivity index, MC the catching-up – lagging-behind component and MF the frontier shift component derived in section 2.2. (Here, the first year is the reference year.)</p>
<h2>Table 1b. Productivity changes for the office mean, per cent</h2>
<p>The MTP value of -22 from 1983 to 1984, in Table 1a, indicates that total productivity fell by 22 per cent. The catching up component, MC, shows that the average fell slightly further behind the frontier, in spite of the large negative shift of the frontier itself, MF. After a notable decline in productivity between 1983-85, it rose by 34 per cent between 1985 and 1986, levelled out between 1986/87, and rose once again, by 14 per cent, between 1988 and 1989. Thus, the first two years show a negative productivity growth, which is hardly surprising given the sharp decline in all the output variables during these years. The MC measure suggests that the distance between the frontier and the average remained, roughly, constant over the sample period. The development of the unweighted arithmetic mean for the offices is slightly different from that of the constructed average office, reflecting the effects of the size distribution. The catching-up effect varies much more substantially here. The distance between the frontier and the average fell during 1983/84, rose during 1984-86, and fell for the remaining years of the sample. The differences between Tables 1a and 1b with regard to figures for 1983/84 indicate that it was the slightly larger offices on the frontier which experienced a reduction in efficiency.</p>
<p>Though there was a reduction in labour input from 1983 to 1985, computer input increased, while office-space remained constant. The decline in labour productivity was, therefore, much less than that for the other inputs; see Table 2, which presents results from a model where labour is the only input, but where the outputs are the same as in the main model.</p>
<h2>Table 2. Labour productivity change for the office mean, per cent</h2>
<p>The pattern is the same as that for total productivity although the labour productivity decline for 1983/84 was smaller. Moreover, labour productivity rose markedly in 1986/87, while MTP was almost constant.</p>
<p>Development of the individual offices</p>
<p>We have differentiated the individual offices with respect to their rate of productivity growth. Table 3 presents the number of offices with total productivity growth exceeding 5 per cent per year, the number from 5 to 2 per cent per year, those from 0 to 2 per cent per year, and the number of offices with negative productivity change.</p>
<p>The drastic change in productivity growth between the periods 1983/85 and 1985/89 is indisputable. While only a few offices had some productivity growth during 1983/85, the reverse is true for the second sub-period, though during 1986/87 almost half of the offices showed negative productivity growth.</p>
<h2>Table 3. Number of offices in different ranges of productivity change</h2>
<p>Efficiency</p>
<p>The spread of efficiency between offices together with the average office’s efficiency; i.e., its distance from the best-practice frontier is highlighted in Table 4.</p>
<p>Structural efficiency during the period was within the interval 0.72-0.80. This implies that if all offices had been on the technology frontier observed output volumes could have been produced using between 20 and 28 per cent less inputs than was actually the case. Though this is a relatively common measure for structural efficiency in this type of analysis, the realisable productivity improvement potential is likely to be lower. The existence of a number of rigidities explains some of the differences in efficiency. Moreover, the offices are not as homogeneous as the analysis assumes.</p>
<p>The shape of the efficiency distribution shows relatively little variation. However, the number of frontier units varies considerably over the years.</p>
<h2>3.1.3 Conclusions</h2>
<p>The results are summarised as follows:</p>
<p>• Total factor productivity increased strongly during  1985-89</p>
<p>• Labour productivity grew somewhat more than total factor productivity</p>
<p>• Productivity growth was relatively uneven with a decline during  1983-1985, strong growth for 1985/86, low growth for 1986/87, and relatively strong growth for 1988/89.</p>
<p>• The distance between the frontier and the average has changed only minimally.</p>
<p>• Productivity growth varies markedly between branch offices.</p>
<p>• The structural efficiency measure suggests a productivityimprovement potential of  20-28 per cent; however, the realisable potential could be much lower.</p>
<p>• The spread of efficiency varies relatively little over the years.</p>
<h2>3.2 Swedish banking efficiency and productivity change  1984-1995</h2>
<p>In this section we report on a study, Battese et al (1997), investigating efficiency and productivity change in Swedish banks during 1984-95 using the SFA approach, with an input requirement frontier model, in which the amount of labour used is a function of the outputs and the quasi-fixed inputs, the number of branches and total inventories.</p>
<h2>3.2.1 The data</h2>
<p>The data set was obtained from the annual reports of Swedish banks. The data is not from a sample, but the entire population of Swedish banks. The data involved are for the years, 1984 to 1995. During the period some banks ceased to exist and others were established. Some of the changes were due to amalgamations of banks, or to take-overs.</p>
<p>The data is at the bank level rather than at individual branch level. Hence the large national banks with a large number of branches report only aggregate data. Other small regional banks may involve only one branch, and so the data are for that bank which is identical to a branch. Data for some small banks was deleted from the analysis because the values of one or more of the variables were missing or were clear outliers. This was particularly the case with some banks with only one or two part-time employees. A total of 1275 observations for 156 banks are used in the analyses reported below. In the first year, 1984, the number of banks in the data set was 140 and after a peak of 146 in 1985, the number declined to 65 in the last year, 1995. A total of 59 of the banks were observed in all twelve years.</p>
<p>The variables,  public loans ,  guarantees, and  deposits , are regarded as outputs. A key input variable of interest in a study of the efficiency of the banking industry is  labour , because it is a significant component in the cost structure of banks. The efficiency of the use of labour in producing the relevant outputs, given the values of the  quasi-fixed  inputs,  branches and  inventories , is the focus of this study. Data on  Other Loans and  Other Costs were considered in preliminary analyses, but these variables were subsequently deleted because it was evident that there were problems with this data, perhaps due to changes in the definitions of the variables over the period. Data on variables, originally expressed in current money values, were deflated according to the values of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Hence, all money values are expressed in terms of 1980 prices.</p>
<p>Labour use varied from about 800 to over 20 million employee hours per year. The values of public loans, guarantees, and deposits, also indicate the considerable variation in the size of the banks. The average number of years for which the banks were observed was about 10 years.</p>
<h2>3.2.2 Empirical results</h2>
<p>Efficiency</p>
<p>The individual technical inefficiencies  of labour use for the banks range from 0 % to 166 % over the period. Thus, one bank was estimated to be fully technically efficient in labour use in at least one year, whereas another bank was estimated to use 166 % more labour than for a fully efficient bank with the same level of outputs and quasi-fixed inputs. The overall mean for the 156 banks was 12 % inefficiency. This is rather low, but one should keep in mind that a stochastic frontier model with bank-specific effects absorbs part of the inefficiency (in addition to the random noise component).</p>
<p>Of the 13 banks with inefficiency more than 20 % in the last year they were observed, 10 disappeared from the data set before 1995. Of the three surviving banks, two were savings banks and the other was a recently started international bank with a non-typical output structure.</p>
<p>Mean technical inefficiencies of labour use for the banks are graphed by year in Figure 3.</p>
<p>Per cent</p>
<p>Mean technical inefficiency tended to increase from 1984 to 1991, during the period of rapid expansion when the banks were in vigorous competition for market shares. After the crisis in 1992, mean technical inefficiency decreased slowly. Overall, there was a slight increase in mean technical inefficiency of labour use over the twelve-year period.</p>
<p>The results also indicate that the efficiency by the banks tend to:</p>
<p>• be larger for Föreningsbanken, Handelsbanken and Savings banks than for Other Banks;</p>
<p>• be smaller for  SE-banken than for Other Banks;</p>
<p>• decrease as the number of branches increase;</p>
<p>• increase as the total inventories increase;</p>
<p>Because inventories are measured by book values, they reflect the modernity of these and especially for computer equipment with short depreciation periods. Thus, the efficiency-increasing effect of inventories should reflect the productivity-enhancing effect of more modern computer equipment.</p>
<p>The mean technical inefficiencies of the five types of banks, considered in the study, are given in Table 5. The difference between the two largest commercial banks is striking.</p>
<p>While Handelsbanken had an inefficiency level below 10 % for all years, SE-banken exceeded 20 % for all years, except 1984. During the banking crisis, Handelsbanken was never perceived as a crisis bank, while SE-banken was. One reason for the somewhat lower loan losses at Handelsbanken, compared with SE-banken and certain other Swedish banks, is usually attributed to the fact that Handelsbanken never abandoned its local branch networks as sources of decision-making about credit allocation. Moreover, the strong local authority at Handelsbanken branch-offices was combined with a system of profit sharing for bank staff.</p>
<p>Among the savings banks, there was substantial variation in inefficiency not reflected in the aggregated figure in Table 5. Most of these banks are local or regional banks operating as not-for-profit organisations. The same holds for the local or regional branches of Föreningsbanken. This bank specialised in credit to agriculture and small businesses before it merged with the largest savings bank in 1997.</p>
<p>Technical change and efficiency change</p>
<p>The rate of technical change (TC) in labour use is estimated to be negative for all years, but small in absolute values, see Figure 4. This indicates that there was modest technical progress  in the frontier  labour use during the years of our study. Starting at technical progress of 1.5 % in 1984, the industry continued to have technical progress, but at a decreasing rate, until 1992, when technical progress in labour use was effectively exhausted. Among the bank types, only Handelsbanken experienced technical regress  in labour use over the entire period.</p>
<p>Inefficiency (IC) change of labour use over time was positive during 1984-1992, see Figure 4. This indicates that the inefficiency of labour use increased over those years. Thus the “average” bank did not manage to “catch up” with the labour-use frontier, which was experiencing technical progress. However, when technical progress in labour use was effectively exhausted in 1992, the banks began to “catch up”, i.e., the distance between observed labour use and the best-practice labour use decreased somewhat. The dynamic interplay between changes in the frontier (technical change) and changes in inefficiency is discussed in more detail in Hjalmarsson (1973), Førsund and Hjalmarsson (1974) and Førsund, Hjalmarsson and Summa (1996).</p>
<p>One might have expected a much stronger impact of deregulation and the subsequent banking crisis on the efficiency of labour use in Swedish banks. An important reason why this did not occur might be the rapid return of Swedish banks to profitability which restored their access to capital markets. Most of the so-called “crisis banks” recovered rather rapidly; some were able to raise money from the capital market as early as 1993. Moreover, competitive pressure from abroad remained weak.</p>
<p>Per cent</p>
<p>Index 1984=100</p>
<p>A major reason for the banking crisis in 1992 was the dramatic increase in the real rate of interest causing large changes in household and company portfolios with extensive repayment of old loans and less demand for new loans. Although deposits decreased somewhat in 1992, public loans, guarantees and inventories decreased substantially, and adjustments in the labour use was not at the same rate.</p>
<h2>3.2.3 Conclusions</h2>
<p>Inefficiency of labour use varied considerably for different banks over the period; overall inefficiency was estimated to be about 12 %. This implies that banks, on average, were using about 12 % more labour than if they were fully efficient, given the levels of outputs and quasi-fixed inputs.</p>
<p>An unexpected pattern emerges concerning the impact of deregulation and the subsequent banking crisis on technical change at the frontier. There was a decrease in technical change at the frontier and an increase in mean technical efficiency. While the development of efficiency seems to be driven by the frontier change, the change in the frontier is to a large extent driven by the development of output. Dramatic increases in the real rate of interest caused large changes in household and company portfolios, with extensive repayment of old, loans and less demand for new loans. In general, the frontier banks did not manage to adjust the labour use in proportion to the decline in output.</p>
<h2>3.3 The efficiency of Swedish banking in 1996</h2>
<p>In addition to the analysis in the previous section, we have calculated DEA efficiency scores for Swedish banks in 1996. To investigate the sensitivity of the results with respect to the choice of variables, we compare the outcomes of different specifications under variable returns to scale (VRS) and constant returns to scale (CRS).</p>
<h2>3.3.1 The data</h2>
<p>The variables in this data set overlap with the previous one. We use the same basic three output variables, loans, guarantees,  and deposits,  but now we also add net provisions,  i.e., the difference between commissions and other service charges received and the costs related to these. On the input side we use the number of branch offices, inventories, other costs, credit losses, and labour costs, or alternatively, hours worked.  Thus, one important part of this section is to investigate the sensitivity of the results with respect to the choice of variables. Not including net provisions might "punish" especially the commercial banks or the larger banks. On the other hand, banks with large net provisions may also have more high-salary staff; therefore, we also use labour costs as a quality-adjusted labour input variable. See Table 6 for the differences between the models. We will also look at labour efficiency; i.e., we have calculated efficiency distributions for Models 1-4 but with only one input, labour.</p>
<h2>Table 6. The difference between the models applied</h2>
<h2>3.3.2 Empirical results</h2>
<p>All inputs</p>
<p>Empirical results are illustrated in Figures 6-11. We regard Model 1 as the base model, while Models 2-4 are used for sensitivity analysis.</p>
<p>In general, with so many variables one would expect a rather large number of fully-efficient units (efficiency score = 1) under VRS, and this is also the case: Somewhat more than half of the units are on the frontier in Model 1; see Figure 6. On the other hand, under CRS, less than one fourth of the units are on the frontier. Mean efficiency decreases from 0.90 under VRS to 0.79 under CRS. All 17 units, which are on the frontier under VRS but not under CRS, are savings banks.</p>
<p>Reduction in the number of variables also has a strong impact on the number of frontier units; see Figure 8, where the number of outputs is decreased from 4 to 3, or Figures 10 and 11, with labour as the only input. In the former case the number of frontier units decreased from 31 to 25.</p>
<p>The choice between labour costs and labour hours has only a minor impact on the efficiency distribution; see Figures 7 and 9, in which Models 1 and 2 almost coincide, as do Models 3 and 4. Under VRS, four to six units (all savings banks) which are on the frontier in Model 1 become inefficient in the other models. Under CRS, four to seven banks become inefficient when moving from Model 1 to the other models; all these are savings banks except Nordbanken which becomes inefficient in Models 2 and 4 (efficiency scores 0.94 and 0.88, respectively), i.e., when labour hours are substituted for labour costs.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is a substantial difference between Models 1 and 2 on the one hand and Models 3 and 4 on the other; i.e., the results are very sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of net provisions as an output variable. This is even more clear from Figure 8, which illustrates the difference between Model 1 and Model 3. Mean efficiency decreases from 0.89 in Model 1 to 0.73 in Model 3. All commercial banks (except Östgöta Enskilda Bank) are on the frontier in both models. For three units (Finn, Alingsås and Roslagen savings banks) there is a deviation in efficiency scores exceeding 0.50.</p>
<p>Labour use efficiency</p>
<p>When labour is used as the only input, the number of frontier units decreases from 31 to 10 in Model 1 under VRS and from 14 to 3 under CRS; see Figures 10 and 11. Variation between the models is very large.Under VRS mean efficiency decreases from 0.79 in Model 1 to 0.45 in Model 4, and under CRS from 0.67 to 0.27. While all the commercial banks (except Östgöta Enskilda Bank) are on the frontier in Model 1 under VRS, only Handelsbanken and JP Bank are on the frontier in all four models. In CRS only Handelsbanken and JP Bank (along with Alingsås sparbank in Model 1 only) are on the frontier in all models, while SE-banken and Östgöta Enskilda Bank get efficiency scores of 0.75 and 0.62, respectively, in Model 1.</p>
<h2>3.3.3 Conclusions</h2>
<p>Efficiency analysis of Swedish banks in 1996 illustrates the sensitivity of the results with respect to choice of variables. On the one hand, the choice between labour costs and labour hours has only a minor impact on the efficiency distribution, but on the other hand, the results are very sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of net provisions as an output variable. While the results are robust for the commercial banks – which are all (with one exception) fully efficient – the differences between models for some savings banks are quite striking.</p>
<h2>3.4 Banking productivity in a Scandinavian comparison</h2>
<p>Because of low cultural barriers to entry into each other’s markets, the performance of Swedish banking in comparison with its Scandinavian neighbours is of great interest. This issue was analysed in a few studies about 1990, and although there are plans to update these, this has not yet been realised; see Berg et al (1993) and Bukh et al (1995) which will be dealt with here.</p>
<h2>3.4.1 The data</h2>
<p>The data set in Berg et al (1993) consists of observations from 503 Finnish, 150 Norwegian, and 126 Swedish banks. Only a few, quite small, banks in each country have been omitted, due to data collection problems. The data were collected from official bank statistics in Norway and Finland, and from annual reports in Sweden, for the year 1990.</p>
<p>The output variables are deposits loans,  and the number of branches.</p>
<p>The input variables are  number of hours worked and the  book value of machinery and equipment.</p>
<p>To convert monetary values into a common unit, both the official exchange rate and the purchasingpower parity rate as computed by the OECD were used, but it did not matter very much which rate was used.</p>
<p>In Bukh et al (1995) the data set for 1990 was extended to include 182 Danish banks and the variables were extended to include guarantees  as an output, and non-labour  and  non-capital  operating expenses  as input.</p>
<h2>3.4.2 Empirical results</h2>
<p>Berg et al (1993) uses the Malmquist productivity index; Sweden is chosen as the technology base for productivity comparisons, due to the superior performance of its largest banks. A common technology base facilitates intercountry comparisons, but the choice of base country will influence the results. Productivity comparisons are shown in Table 7.</p>
<p>The average Norwegian bank has about 10 % higher productivity than the Finnish average bank, 12 % under VRS, 9 % under CRS. For the largest bank the scale assumption is crucial, with 18 % higher Finnish productivity under VRS, as opposed to 19 % higher Norwegian productivity under CRS.</p>
<p>The Swedish average bank is much more productive than both the Finnish and the Norwegian average bank, 63 % higher than Finnish under VRS, 52 % under CRS, and 40 % and 46 % respectively, higher than Norwegian. The Swedish largest banks are also much more productive.</p>
<p>As discussed earlier the Malmquist productivity index can be decomposed into an efficiency component and a frontier technology component, the latter measuring the distance of the frontier technologies relative to the Swedish common-reference technology.</p>
<p>The large gap between Swedish and Finnish average productivity is mainly due to the efficiency component, although Sweden also has a technology advantage. The efficiency component explains even more of the Swedish-Norwegian gap. In fact, under CRS, Norway even has a technology advantage. Since the largest banks are on the frontier under VRS, there is in that case no efficiency component; i.e., its value is zero. There is just a difference in frontier technology levels.</p>
<p>The extension of the data set to include Danish banks and inclusion of one more output and input variable does not change the previous picture very much; see Table 8.</p>
<p>The average Swedish bank still has a higher productivity than the average bank in the other Scandinavian countries, now including Denmark, both under VRS and CRS.</p>
<h2>3.4.3 Conclusions</h2>
<p>In an inter-Scandinavian comparison, the Swedish banking sector in 1990 was much more productive than the Finnish, Norwegian, and Danish banking sectors. This conclusion also holds for the largest banks, except in comparison with Denmark. The large gap between Swedish and Finnish average productivity is mainly due to the efficiency component, although Sweden also had a technology advantage, which was the source of the Swedish-Danish productivity gap. The SwedishNorwegian productivity gap is more modeldependent, and consists of both components.</p>
<h2>3.5 The efficiency of Swedish banks in a European comparison</h2>
<p>As the final step in this review of empirical studies, we draw on a study by Andersson (1999) on the relative efficiency of a set of large European banks observed in 1996.</p>
<h2>3.5.1 The data</h2>
<p>This analysis is based on a sample of 104 of the largest banks in eight countries, i.e., the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, France, Italy, Great</p>
<p>Britain, Sweden and Germany. The German, British, Italian and French banking markets constitute the largest markets in Europe, while the remaining four are representing the smaller market places; see Table 9. The complete list of banks is reported in Appendix 2.</p>
<h2>Table 9. The distribution of banks</h2>
<p>Most of the countries in the study have a few core banks, which are dominant players in their domestic markets, but their importance is largely balanced by equally important regional banking groups, particularly in Germany, France, and Italy: Table 10 shows two size indicators for the sample.</p>
<h2>Table 10. The size of the average bank in the sample, 1996</h2>
<p>The main banktypes represented are commercial banks (67), savings/co-operative banks (26), and specialised banks (investment banks, mortgage banks-, and non-credit institutions) (11).</p>
<p>The average bank in the sample had some 14 000 employees and a branch network of almost 700 branches.</p>
<h2>3.5.2 Empirical results</h2>
<p>Here we report efficiency scores under both VRS and CRS, with two different choices of input variables and with the three output variables, loans, number of branch offices,  and deposits . L-vrs and L-crs are the pure labour efficiency models i.e. hours worked as the only input under VRS and CRS respectively. X12-vrs and X12-crs include inventories  as the second input under VRS and CRS respectively.</p>
<p>Because the number of variables is small in this data set, one would expect rather low levels of efficiency and a large dispersion between best practice and average efficiency. This is in fact the case. There is a large variation in efficiency.</p>
<p>The results are shown in Figures 12-15. The differences in mean efficiency scores are quite large. In the base model, X12-vrs mean efficiency varies from 0.31 for Italy to 0.70 for the Netherlands. Sweden ranks second from bottom with a mean efficiency score of 0.35. Sweden also ranks second from the bottom in the VRS labour-use model, with a mean efficiency score of 0.20 compared with 0.61 for the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The number of frontier units in the base model X12-vrs is 23, where as it is only 13 in the labour-use model under VRS. All countries are represented at the frontier, Sweden with only one bank.</p>
<p>The distance between best practice and worst practice is unusually large, with three worst performing UK banks at the very bottom (efficiency score 0.01-0.02) in all models. The worst-performing Swedish bank has an efficiency score of 0.07 both in the base model and the labour use model with VRS.</p>
<p>The location of the Swedish banks in the base model is shown in Figure 14 and in the labour use model in Figure 15. The Swedish banks are spread along the entire efficiency distribution in the two-input model. In the labour use model none of the Swedish banks has an efficiency score exceeding 0.50.</p>
<h2>European Banks, 1996, variable returns to scale Input saving efficiency</h2>
<h2>3.5.3 Conclusions</h2>
<p>There is a large variation in efficiency between banks, both within each country analysed and across countries. In a European perspective,</p>
<p>Swedish commercial banking efficiency on average ranks second from the bottom, both in a two-input model and in a labour-use model. Important caveats here are the relatively small sample of banks from each country included, and the small number of inputs and outputs covered by the study.</p>
<p>It is difficult to know the impact on the efficiency distribution of including more variables, on the input side as well as the output side. Since we have no additional data for a sensitivity analysis, one should be cautious in interpreting the results.</p>

<h2>Appendix 1</h2>
<p>The stochastic frontier model</p>
<p>We assume that the following translog stochastic frontier model defines labour use for the 156 banks in our data where the subscripts i and t represent the i-th bank (i = 1, 2, …, 156) and the t-th year of observation (t = 1, 2, …, 12);</p>
<p>Y represents the total quantity of labour used (in hours per year);</p>
<p>D is a dummy variable for guarantees, which has value one if guarantees were zero or not observed, and, otherwise zero x is the logarithm of the total amount of public loans (in SEK1,000); x is the logarithm of the maximum  of the guarantees (in SEK1,000); x is the logarithm of deposits (in SEK1,000); x is the logarithm of the number of branches; x is the logarithm of the value of machinery and equipment; x is the year of observation, where x = 1, 2, …, 12; the V it s are random variables, associated with measurement errors in the labour variable or the effects of unspecified explanatory variables in the model, which are assumed to be independent and identically distributed with N(0, v)-distribution, independent of the U it s;</p>
<p>The U it s are non-negative random variables, associated with inefficiency of labour use, given the levels of the outputs and the quasifixed inputs, such that U it  is obtained by the truncation (at zero) of the N( µ it ,  where z is the logarithm of the number of branches (i.e., z = x ); z is the logarithm of total machinery and equipment (i.e., z = x ); z is the year of observation (i.e., z = x ); and z is the square of the year of observation (i.e., z = z ).</p>
<p>The model incorporates non-neutral technical change in the use of labour in the production of the outputs, given the quasi-fixed inputs in the banking operations.</p>
<p>The specification of the model for the inefficiency effects in equation (2) implies, in addition to accounting for the existence of inefficiency effects in the use of labour in producing outputs that the variations in the inefficiency effects are a function of other variables. In this case, we permit the level of the inefficiency effects in labour use to be different for five different types of banks (associated with the four dummy variables for types of banks), and they also depend on the number of branches in the banks and the year of observation.</p>
<p>The parameters of the stochastic frontier model, defined by equations (1) and (2), were simultaneously estimated by the method of maximum likelihood using the computer program, FRONTIER 4.1, written by Coelli (1996).</p>
<p>The technical efficiency of labour use for the i-th bank in the t-th year of observation (TE it , given the values of the outputs and quasi-fixed inputs, is defined as the ratio of stochastic frontier labour use to observed labour use. Stochastic frontier labour use  is defined by the value of labour use if the technical inefficiency effect, U it , were zero (i.e., it the bank were fully efficient in the use of labour). Given the specifications of the translog stochastic frontier labour-use function in equation (1), it can be shown that which indicates that technical efficiency is no greater than one. The reciprocal of this quantity, exp(U it ), is no less than one, and can be interpreted as a measure of the technical inefficiency of labour use.</p>
<p>Computation of efficiency scores by DEA</p>
<p>The input-saving measure under VRS is found by solving the following LP problem for each plant, k, with output y k  and input x k where E is the input-saving efficiency measure for plant k, m is the number of outputs, n is the number of inputs and N the number of plants.</p>
<p>Restriction (4a) implies that the reference plant must produce at least as much as plant k, while restriction (4b) implies that the efficiencyadjusted volume of input used by plant k must at least amount to the input volume used by the reference plant. Restriction (4c) is the condition for VRS. If this restriction is omitted, CRS is implied; E and E then coincide with each other.</p>
