<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>General</p>
<p>In accordance with its directives, the commission will consider ways in which administration of local traffic regulations by the municipalities can be simplified, modernised and made more efficient. The terms of reference also involve analysing a number of exemplified systems; however the commission has the option of considering other possible solutions as well. Further, the commission will propose statutory changes arising from its deliberations.</p>
<p>The commission has examined the options that are given in the directive and has decided on an arrangement that constitutes a variation on the available alternatives. The local authorities’ decisions on local traffic regulations are collected together and documented in a register which is operated using modern computer technology. The commission’s proposal means that regulations for local traffic control are announced electronically in a centralised, nationwide database. Information in the database will be made available on the Internet. The commission has also arrived at proposals that involve new conditions when road signs are put up. According to the commission’s proposals, road signs will have a somewhat greater significance for local traffic control than is the case at present.</p>
<p>The commission’s proposals will have effect on the municipalities’ administration of local traffic regulations etc. The handling of local traffic regulations etc. by the county administrative boards and the Swedish National Road Administration will also be affected. The commission’s proposal regarding the announcement and signing of these regulations for local traffic control also ultimately affects other authorities and the general public. The commission considers that the proposals in the long term will result in a simpler, more modern and efficient</p>
<p>handling of local traffic regulations etc. In the opinion of the commission, the proposals can be implemented whilst improving the legal rights of road users.</p>
<p>A nationwide database for traffic regulations</p>
<p>With the aim of announcing certain traffic regulations and ensuring that the public administration and individuals are informed about them, there should be a database with nationwide coverage for traffic regulations, RDT. The regulations will be entered and announced electronically in the database and the data concerning the regulations that are in the database will constitute the authentic version.</p>
<p>The nationwide database for traffic regulations will be established so that it is possible to connect to the national road database administered by the Swedish National Road Administration and the data about the road network etc. that is kept there. A nationwide database for traffic regulations such as this should be administered by the Swedish National Road Administration. The Administration has the legal and technical competence with regard to road traffic that is required to administer the database and will therefore also be responsible for training, following up and other support to the reporting authorities.</p>
<p>Security, accessibility and storage in the database</p>
<p>The Swedish National Road Administration will be responsible for the database. The Administration will also be the coordinating authority with the overall responsibility for the system that is needed to operate the databases. In this capacity, the Swedish National Road Administration will also have the overall responsibility for the security of the system. The Administration will issue regulations concerning the submission of information to the database after consultation with the Swedish Agency for Public Management. This may take place in order to, among other things, institute requirements for verification of information by means of electronic signatures.</p>
<p>The database will be easily accessible and the authentic version of the regulations will be supplied to those who are looking for information on the Internet. Guidance regarding traffic control that the public and other authorities need will be offered in the first instance by the decision-making authority. The Swedish Agency for Administrative Development’s recommendations and advice for the 24 hour websites operated by authorities should be taken into consideration. The possibility of accessing and changing information should be limited.</p>
<p>The decision-making authorities will enter into the database the traffic regulations that they have issued. They will store the records of the decision-making process and similar in paper form. The authentic version of the regulations that are entered and announced in the database will be stored by the Swedish National Road Administration. The Swedish National Road Administration will also be required to supervise the electronic archive. The National Archives will issue regulations concerning the discarding of data from the database. Information may not however be discarded from the database for five years after the regulation has ceased to apply.</p>
<p>Regulations in the database and responsibility for the information</p>
<p>Entries into the database are submitted by a state or municipal roads maintenance authority in cases of regulations according to § 41 of the Roads Act (1971:948); the municipality or the Swedish National Road Administration when it comes to speed regulations according to chapt. 3 § 17, second and fourth section respectively of the road traffic ordinance (1998:1276) and regulations on bearing capacity classes according to chapt. 4 § 11 of the road traffic ordinance; municipality, county administrative board or police authorities in cases of local traffic regulations according to chapt. 10 § 1 of the road traffic ordinance; and road or street maintenance authorities in cases of regulations according to chapt. 10 § 14, first section of the road traffic ordinance (so called road maintenance decisions). Information about regulations should be submitted by the decision-making authority in a secure manner in electronic form. The information should additionally be up to date and reliable. The decision-making authority is responsible that the</p>
<p>regulation has been adopted in a proper fashion. The authority is also responsible that the official who reports the regulation is authorised to act as decision maker.</p>
<p>The transition to the system of a nationwide database for traffic regulations</p>
<p>During the initial phase from the 1st July 2005 – the 30th June 2006 those authorities who are affected by the requirement to report regulations are allowed to submit information to the database. The requirement to report regulations that was voluntary during the first phase will be compulsory from the 1st July 2006. Regulations for local traffic control will then be announced through the nationwide database for traffic regulations. Other decision-making authorities do not need to inform the municipality about those regulations that the authority has issued. From the 1st July 2008 the current regulations for local traffic control must be entered in the nationwide database for traffic regulations.</p>
<p>The decision-making process</p>
<p>The regulations for local traffic control that are issued should contain a reference to the decision-making authority’s powers to issue the regulation. There should also be a reference to the clause which describes what the special traffic rule applies to (e.g. chapt. 10 § 1, road traffic ordinance). The regulation should likewise include a clause stating when it comes into effect. The decision should be documented in such a way as to show that the regulation has been adopted under the jurisdiction of an authorised decision maker. The decision-making authority will enter the regulation into the database and determine the date for notification. The authority will also report on the date from which the regulation will be available.</p>
<p>Communication and information</p>
<p>The municipality will ensure that the police authorities and the state road maintenance authority that are affected have the</p>
<p>opportunity to submit opinions in matters concerning local traffic regulations or speed regulations. It means that the police authorities and the state road maintenance authorities that are affected will be given the opportunity to express their opinion.</p>
<p>The decision-making authority will inform the road maintenance authorities that are affected about a regulation that has been issued. Land owners and owners of private roads that are particularly affected will also be informed. The procedure involving extracts from the register will be discontinued. The requirement for entry in statute books is abolished for those regulations issued by a county administrative board, a police authority or the Swedish National Road Administration. For government authorities, publication in the statute book is replaced by notification through the nationwide database for traffic regulations. The obligation to pronounce certain municipally adopted regulations in the county’s statute book is also removed. The Swedish National Road Administration is given the opportunity to stipulate a suitable mode of operation, so that all regulations will be available in the database.</p>
<p>Provisions for signage</p>
<p>In those cases where they relate to regulations for local traffic control, road signs will be erected where the speed restrictions, regulations or traffic controls commence or cease to apply. If it is not appropriate to erect the road sign at the location that is intended, e.g. at an intersection, the signs can instead be erected as close to the location as possible. However, the distance between the intended location and the road signs may not exceed 40 meters.</p>
<p>Liability for violations of the traffic regulations</p>
<p>Grounds for exemption from punishment for violating local traffic control regulations is extended to apply to regulations on bearing capacity classes according to chapt. 4 § 11 of the road traffic ordinance. The importance of observing the signing provisions and in general providing notification of the regulation is retained. The provisions are however to be changed in order to accommodate the condition that the obligation to enter in a register is to be replaced</p>
<p>from the 1st July 2006 by an obligation to enter and announce the provisions in the nationwide database for traffic regulations. If the local traffic control regulations have not been signed and general notification provided in accordance with applicable provisions, liability may in principle not be imposed. Liability will however be imposed if the shortcomings in the signage do not play a substantial role in understanding the traffic rules.</p>
<p>Parking tickets</p>
<p>The requirement that signage is provided for the traffic regulations and that the regulations are generally notified, are retained in principle also in the issuing of parking tickets. The provisions are to be changed in as much as the obligation to enter in a register is replaced from the 1st July 2006 by an obligation to enter and announce the regulations in the nationwide database for traffic regulations. If the parking regulations are not signed and generally notified in accordance with applicable provisions, parking tickets may in principle not be issued. The parking tickets may nevertheless be issued if the shortcomings in signage do not play a substantial role in understanding the traffic rules.</p>
<p>Coming into effect</p>
<p>With regard to the provisions for imposing liability for violation of local traffic control regulations, the commission proposes that the arrangement comes into effect on the 1st January 2005. The same applies to the provisions with regard to the conditions for issuing parking tickets. In terms of the new conditions for signage, the commission also proposes that the provisions should come into effect on the 1st January 2005.</p>
<p>The commission proposes that the nationwide database will come into effect on the 1st July 2005. The arrangement for announcing the authentic version of the regulations in the database will however come into effect on the 1st July 2006. It means that for the regulations that are entered into the database, the statute books of the municipal traffic register, the county administrative boards and the Swedish National Road Administration are taken out of use from the 1st July 2006. From the same date the register</p>
<p>extract is replaced by the arrangement in which the decisionmaking authorities inform those who are affected by their regulations. The regulations that are not entered into the database on the 1st July 2008 cease to apply on that date.</p>
