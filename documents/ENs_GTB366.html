<p>The remit of the Inquiry on Gender Equality Policy has been to conduct a review of the objectives, orientation, organisation and effectiveness of gender equality policy. Furthermore, the Inquiry was instructed to examine whether the social changes that have occurred in the last ten years have led to a need for gender equality policy to be given a new orientation. The remit has also included proposing new objectives and a new organisation in the area of gender equality policy.</p>
<p>Below is a brief summary of the Inquiry’s main proposals.</p>
<p>New objectives in gender equality policy</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a new overall objective for gender equality policy: “Women and men are to have the same power to shape society and their own lives.” A precondition for this is that the same rights, opportunities and responsibilities prevail in all areas of life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we propose four new targets dealing with:</p>
<p>• Active citizenship.</p>
<p>• Paid jobs that provide lifelong economic independence.</p>
<p>• Care without subordination. Unpaid care work is to be shared equally.</p>
<p>• Physical integrity. Men’s violence against women must stop.</p>
<p>For each objective, we propose indicators that are to form the basis for follow-up and evaluation of the effectiveness of gender equality policy.</p>
<p>Stronger control of gender equality policy</p>
<p>Gender mainstreaming as a strategy for gender equality policy remains in place.</p>
<p>We propose more active use of the national gender equality policy objectives in performance management. More stringent strategic use of the gender equality policy objectives strengthens gender mainstreaming.</p>
<p>Development work should be initiated to examine the application of process-based programme management. By increasing cooperation between gender equality policy and other policy areas, development work is to aim at strengthening the implementation of gender equality policy. The first stage of the development work focuses on men’s violence against women.</p>
<p>Local agenda for gender equality</p>
<p>The will and the ability to create a gender-equal society must be supported at local level, based on local conditions. It is at local level that citizenship on equal terms is given concrete form. Municipalities play a central role in creating a normal existence for people that is characterised by gender equality.</p>
<p>We propose that county administrative boards be given the task of translating the national gender equality objectives into regional gender equality objectives. An overall county strategy is to be formulated based on the regional objectives. Regional and local actors should be involved in the work with the strategy. The regional strategies are to function as a platform for the development of a local agenda for gender equality.</p>
<p>Delegation for Health and Full-time Employment in the Welfare Sector</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s overall analysis of gender equality in the labour market and in working life shows that the collective problems faced by women in working life have to be solved by women individually. Insecure employment, part-time work and sick leave can be seen as a result of the inequality that characterises the labour market, but also as individual solutions to structural problems.</p>
<p>We propose that a Delegation for Health and Full-time Employment in the Welfare Sector be established. The main purpose of the Delegation will be to support efforts for renewal by municipalities and county councils and to strengthen the possibilities for women to take part in working life on a sustainable basis. Women’s health and economic independence will be improved through structural changes in working life and by augmenting women’s participation in the labour force.</p>
<p>Gainful employment tax allowance for single parents</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s study of the development of economic equality during the 1990s shows a general increase of economic equality. At the same time, the study shows that the income trend has been poorer for single mothers during the 1990s compared with mothers and fathers living together.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that a gainful employment tax allowance for single parents be introduced. The aim of the tax allowance is to lower the threshold and marginal effects for lone parents with low incomes, increase the incitement to seek paid employment and fulltime employment, and strengthen a group that is financially vulnerable.</p>
<p>New agency for gender equality</p>
<p>Realising the gender equality policy objectives requires implementing measures in all sectors and at all levels of society. It is therefore necessary to establish an organisation that supports, coordinates, develops and evaluates gender equality policy measures.</p>
<p>We propose establishing an agency responsible for coordinating the implementation of gender equality policy. The agency’s tasks are to include policy intelligence, follow-up and evaluation of gender equality policy. Furthermore, the agency is to be responsible for coordination, support to other agencies and providing grants as well as knowledge development and information.</p>
