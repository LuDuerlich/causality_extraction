<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Sweden can be proud of its highly competitive space industry and strong research communities, respected for both fundamental and applied research. The use of space systems in Sweden has contributed to more efficient public services as well as to an increased number of commercial services. The close cooperation between the Swedish National Space Board (SNSB), researchers, industrialists and end users has established a solid ground for Swedish space activities. The long-term view taken by the actors involved may help explain this positive development.</p>
<p>Space activities should to a larger extent support public services that benefit citizens. The proposals presented here suggest that this should be the driving force for the next phase of space development. The document emphasises three topics important to achieving this:</p>
<p> A holistic approach considering numerous aspects of societal benefits, including closer cooperation between civil and military needs with respect to defence and security aspects.</p>
<p> Broader international cooperation to increase benefits from space activities in Sweden.</p>
<p> Closer cooperation between government agencies that support research and innovation, with the aim of realising possible synergies from governmental spending.</p>
<p>There has been a trend over the last five to ten years to review national space strategies, and a number of countries have gone through this process. This is presumably due to the fact that space activities have matured and the use of space systems has changed as regards to both political and commercial applications. Political changes in certain areas have also had an important impact on</p>
<p>foreign affairs and the management of security policies in international relations.</p>
<p>Technical developments and commercialisation have made it possible for an increased number of states to have their own space systems. The number of users is increasing which means greater dependence on space systems, with the result being greater vulnerability for the societies involved. Countries want and need to protect their space systems, which inevitably leads to the risk of conflicts. International policies and treaties have to be up to date in order to maintain accessibility to space for everyone. Sweden should review its participation in this work.</p>
<p>The Swedish Government spends about SEK 1.7 billion a year on space activities through different channels, of which the two most important are the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Union (EU). Sweden has also become more dependent on space systems. We therefore propose increased cooperation between the actors and agencies relevant to the development and use of space systems. The Swedish National Space Board (SNSB) should receive a clearer mandate as a space agency with experts on space topics supporting the Government as well as research and technology development.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s terms of reference stipulate that proposed changes should remain within the current financial framework. We therefore propose that those suggested changes that take a broader view of space activities, including the exploitation of space systems and a space agency about twice the current size, be financed through a redistribution of the existing funds. Increased cooperation is expected to lead to increased efficiency and should not be considered an expense.</p>
