<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Regulation of professional activity within the field of animal health care exists today in the form of provisions on qualifications (e.g. for veterinary surgeons and farriers), and on animal protection, communicable disease control and food safety. Our main task has been a comprehensive review of this field and, in the light of this review, to propose regulations defining future qualifications and responsibilities for occupational groups in animal health care, other than veterinary surgeons.</p>
<h2>The need for change</h2>
<p>Our review of the legislation governing veterinary surgeon qualifications shows that, in several respects, there is a need for change. This is largely because veterinary surgeons are not the only professionals involved in animal health care today. On the contrary, a growing number of occupational groups are involved in the treatment and care of animals, within established veterinary medicine, as well as complementary medicine.</p>
<p>However, the legislation governing animal health care is not well adapted to activities within this field today. For example, it provides veterinary surgeons with little scope for delegation of duties to other staff. Although it is common for members of other occupational groups independently to perform duties within animal health care, there is no regulation of their responsibilities. Nor is the exercise of their profession or occupation subject to any inspection by the authorities, and there are no provisions on disciplinary action or other sanctions in cases of malpractice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the need for a clear and comprehensive regulation of activities within animal health care has increased as a result of Swedish membership of the EU. Within the Community, legislation governing occupational groups must not be such that it presents an obstacle to people coming from one Member State and entering into professional activity in another.</p>
<p>Animals do not only receive treatment within established veterinary medicine. Animal owners, as well as those practising complementary medical methods, also perform health care and medical treatment on animals. Today, such activities are restricted in certain respects, concerning surgical operations, injections and serious communicable diseases. Despite this, incidences occur in which people without sufficient knowledge do treat animals. The most serious shortcoming that we have found is that existing regulations place responsibility on the owner of the animal, whereas the person performing the actual treatment can rarely be held responsible.</p>
<p>We have therefore found that there is a need to regulate new occupational groups, to introduce regulations on professional responsibility and the possibility of delegating duties, as well as on inspection of professionals and on sanctions in cases of malpractice. We have also found that the provisions restricting the right to treat animals need to be made more stringent.</p>
<h2>General basis for the work</h2>
<p>In order to decide how to set up regulations governing veterinary activities, it is necessary to establish the objectives of such activities. Veterinary surgeons are, however, active in a range of fields with different objectives. The major portion of veterinary work is conducted within the field of animal health care. This refers to activities that involve medical examination or treatment by performing or prescribing measures aiming to prevent, establish, alleviate or cure diseases in animals, injuries to them or other comparable conditions. This does not include the activities of veterinary surgeons within the field of laboratory animal research or slaughterhouse inspection, for example.</p>
<p>Legislation in the field of animal health care should aim at achieving good animal health status and at contributing to meeting society’s requirements concerning animal protection, communicable disease control and food safety. Future provisions governing the qualifications and responsibilities of the occupational groups dealing with animals should build on these principles.</p>
<p>Modelled on human medicine, the main proof of qualification within animal health care should be a licence. As a rule, this licence should involve protection of the professional title and, for some occupational groups, an exclusive right to the profession or occupation. When assessing whether a certain occupational group should be subject to provisions on certification, licences or other qualification regulations, the same criteria as those used at present for similar assessments within human health care should be applied. However, allowance must be made for the craftsmanship characterising certain occupations in veterinary medicine, which has no equivalent in human health care.</p>
<p>As is the case within human health care, there is also a need to introduce other levels of qualification regulation in addition to provisions on licences.</p>
<p>With regard to the occupational groups that could be subject to regulation of qualifications, our point of departure has been that any kind of regulation of a profession or other occupation constitutes a guarantee from the authorities that the licensed professional or tradesperson has the required skills. A fundamental requirement is therefore that the activities of a regulated profession are in all essentials based on scientific knowledge. Since complementary medicine per definition is not yet based on scientific knowledge, we consider that the state should not guarantee such activities in any form.</p>
<h2>New Act on Professional Activities within the Field of Animal Health Care</h2>
<p>Veterinary legislation in force contains rules regulating the qualifications required to exercise the profession, the duties of veterinary surgeons, inspections, sanctions and the procedures of the Veterinary Disciplinary Board. We consider that this is very much to the purpose, and that it should be maintained that these provisions are covered by one single piece of legislation.</p>
<p>Our proposal is that other occupational groups should be regulated. We have found it inappropriate to maintain the legislation on veterinary surgeons and to create similar legislation for other groups. Instead we hold that all professions and occupational groups in the field of animal health care should be covered by the same legislation. For this reason we propose that the Act on Veterinary Qualification is repealed and that a new Act is introduced, containing provisions on the qualifications and responsibilities of all regulated occupational groups. Its title should be Act on Professional Activities within the Field of Animal Health Care.</p>
<p>The new Act is intended only to apply to activities within the field of animal health care. This means, for example, that veterinary surgeons serving as meat inspectors are not covered by this legislation.</p>
<p>According to our proposal a comprehensive term is introduced for the professions and occupational groups covered by the legislation, namely animal health personnel. The fundamental provisions on the duties, responsibilities, sanctions and inspection covered by the legislation should be the same for all animal health personnel.</p>
<p>In addition to provisions on the activities of animal health personnel, there will also be provisions on restrictions to the right to treat animals for individuals who are not animal health personnel, but who are active within animal health care.</p>
<h2>Regulation of veterinary nurses, farriers and insemination and animal breeding technicians</h2>
<p>In order to determine whether an occupational group should be regulated, our point of departure has been the criteria used for that purpose within human health care. The criteria that we have taken into account in the assessment are mainly the content of the profession or trade, the level of education and the international situation. The content refers to the scope of the activity and its degree of autonomy, the frequency of direct contact with animals and animal owners, as well as the level of risk in cases of malpractice.</p>
<p>In addition to veterinary surgeons, we propose that the provisions on licences should cover two new groups, veterinary nurses and farriers. The basis of the licence for veterinary nurses will be a degree in veterinary nursing from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, while in the case of farriers there will be an exam that can be taken by farriers with several different kinds of training.</p>
<p>We propose that, as a rule, the groups able to obtain a licence will also be granted protection of their professional titles. As is the case today, the professional title of veterinary surgeon will be reserved for licensed individuals. In addition only licensed veterinary nurses will be allowed to use this professional title. In order not to interfere excessively with freedom of trade, we propose that the title farrier will be not be protected until after the year 2015. However, until then only those who have obtained a licence can call themselves licensed farrier.</p>
<p>We see the need to introduce some kind of regulation of qualifications complementing the provisions on licences. For occupational groups not covered by these provisions, we suggest that, as is the case in human health care, a regulation should be introduced prohibiting the use of the professional title of certain occupations. At the present time, we hold that only insemination and animal breeding technicians should be covered by this provision.</p>
<h2>A possibility for licensed medical practitioners to be approved for activities in animal health care</h2>
<p>Already today some professionals with training in human medicine are involved in animal health care. They may have a specific qualification within a certain field, e.g. physiotherapy or dental care, and in many cases they provide an essential complement to veterinary surgeons and other personnel.</p>
<p>In order to enable these professionals to be active within animal health care, we propose that provisions are introduced allowing licensed medical practitioners within the field of human health care to apply for approval to serve within the field of animal health care.</p>
<p>Under our proposal, the basic requirement should be that the professional is a licensed medical practitioner within human health care. In addition, the Government or government agency designated by the Government should issue regulations on further requirements as regards training or experience. It should be possible to attach certain conditions to the approval, such as a limitation in species or to certain measures.</p>
<p>The Swedish Board of Agriculture will examine applications and decide on approvals. Those who are approved will be regarded as animal health personnel when performing duties within animal health care, and hence be responsible for their duties and subject to inspection in the same way as those licensed for animal health care.</p>
<h2>The responsibilities and duties of animal health personnel</h2>
<p>The occupational groups belonging to animal health personnel should have a professional responsibility for their duties. This requires that they only perform duties for which they are competent and that they realise the limitations to their qualifications. Consequently, this entails a duty to refer the owner of an animal to another professional if its condition requires treatment for which the professional is not qualified.</p>
<p>Duties should be exercised according to scientific knowledge and established experience, which means that all animal health personnel must take into account both the scientific basis and the clinical experience of the method in question. However, this does not mean that the same requirements apply to all those working in animal health care; the person’s activities in individual cases must be assessed in the light of her or his training, qualifications and experience. Within this framework, however, she or he must perform her or his duties in such a manner as to meet the stipulated requirements. In order to fulfil this duty, the professional must maintain and supplement his or her competence by undertaking continuing professional training and development.</p>
<p>It will be possible to delegate duties to another member of animal health personnel who is competent to perform them. Whoever delegates a duty is responsible for his or her assessment of the receiver’s ability to perform it, while the receiver is responsible for the manner in which it is performed.</p>
<p>Into the legislation are also introduced provisions on the obligations for animal health personnel to keep medical records, on rules to be observed when issuing certificates, and on professional secrecy. According to the proposal, assistants to animal health personnel in private employ are also subject to professional secrecy 1 .</p>
<h2>Restrictions on the right to treat animals</h2>
<p>In the proposed legislation provisions are introduced concerning restrictions on the right to treat animals. These provisions apply only to professional activities within the field of animal health care not performed by animal health personnel. While engaged in such activities, it will be illegal to perform surgical operations on animals, to give injections or to perform other treatments that could cause not inconsiderable suffering. It will also be illegal to treat serious communicable diseases, and to treat animals under general anaesthesia.</p>
<p>Persons who are not members of animal health personnel and who are involved in professional activity within animal health care shall be guilty of an offence if she or he performs any of these illegal measures. Even if the treatment given is not illegal, the performer of the treatment is guilty of an offence if the animal is harmed or put at risk during the treatment, regardless of whether the harm or danger is due to unsuitable treatment or to the lack of timely and adequate care.</p>
<h2>Inspection</h2>
<p>All animal health personnel will be under the supervision of the Swedish Board of Agriculture and the County Administrative Boards. While the Board of Agriculture will be responsible for coordination, the Government will decide on further division of responsibilities.</p>
<p>In order to carry out inspection efficiently, the supervising agencies need effective tools. Provisions will be introduced on the obligation for animal health personnel to provide the documents, etc. required by agencies to carry out supervision and inspection. The supervisory agency can order animal health personnel to hand over what is required under penalty of a fine. If any member of animal health personnel violates the provisions in the legislation or regulations based on this legislation, the supervisory agency can order her or him to take corrective action under penalty of a fine.</p>
<h2>Sanctions in cases of complaints against animal health personnel</h2>
<p>We propose that any member of animal health personnel who neglects his or her duties in the exercise of a profession or occupation will be subject to disciplinary action before a disciplinary board, in a system corresponding to that applying today for veterinary surgeons. Hence disciplinary action can be taken in the form of either a caution or warning, or the revocation of a licence or other qualification.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we consider that there is good reason to introduce an intermediary step, namely the possibility to provide for a threeyear probationary period for the licence in cases where a licensed professional has been unskilful in the exercise of her or his duties, or in any other manner given proof of his or her unsuitability for the profession.</p>
<p>The provisions on the revocation of licences are to be supplemented with two additional bases, firstly revocation on request by the licensed professional him/herself, and secondly revocation in cases of further offences during a probationary period.</p>
<h2>The Disciplinary Board for Animal Health Care</h2>
<p>We propose that the mandate of the existing Veterinary Disciplinary Board is extended to cover cases concerning all animal health personnel, and that it is renamed the Disciplinary Board for Animal Health Care.</p>
<p>We suggest that the number of members is increased from five to seven. As is the case today, the chairman must be, or have been, a judge and two members must be veterinary surgeons. The other members must be appointed among persons who have experience within the field of animal health care, an insight into animal husbandry and otherwise be held to represent the public interest.</p>
<p>We consider that the supervisory agency should continue to have the right to bring cases before the disciplinary board, but that an employer of a licensed professional should no longer have that right. At present “anyone that has suffered from exercise of the profession of a veterinary surgeon” can report these cases. In order better to reflect the interpretation as to whom this provision gives the right to bring cases before the board, we propose that this wording is replaced by “the owner of, or anyone having the care of, the animal in question”.</p>
<p>A separate issue that we have been requested to evaluate is whether the right to castrate reindeer without the presence of a veterinary surgeon should be maintained. We hold that at present it is not possible to prohibit such surgery, nor to require a veterinary surgeon to be present. However, we do consider that the surgery must be performed under local anaesthesia.</p>
<p>We therefore propose that anyone other than veterinary surgeons castrating reindeer must have adequate training corresponding to that required for animal owners to whom veterinary surgeons delegate the administration of drugs to animals. Veterinary surgeons will hence be able to delegate the use of local anaesthesia before castration to anyone who has undergone this training.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposals</h2>
<p>The proposals on provisions governing animal health care personnel enable more effective and secure care of animals, which will lead to better animal health status, greater animal protection and lower risks for those engaging animal health personnel. The proposals regarding new regulations on qualifications and licences will lead to increased expenditure in the form of expanded administration for the Swedish Board of Agriculture and those on inspection, to higher costs for the supervisory activities of County Administrative Boards.</p>
