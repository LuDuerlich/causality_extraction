<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Our remit</h2>
<p>Our remit relates to questions concerning what should apply regarding medical interventions for a dying patient to make donation possible after the patient has died. Our inquiry is intended to complement the inquiry report Organ donation – a vital service [Organdonation – En livsviktig verksamhet]  (SOU 2015:84) presented by the Inquiry on donation and transplantation issues. Our terms of reference are to investigate and analyse the following issues and to present proposals on them:</p>
<p>• what medical interventions can be considered to perform on a living human being in order to make donation possible after their death, and whether there should be limitations on what interventions may be performed and how long they may continue;</p>
<p>• what should apply regarding the attitude of an individual to medical interventions that are carried out while the individual is alive and that are intended to make donation possible after they have died; and</p>
<p>• what should apply regarding the attitude of any close relative to medical interventions that are carried out on an individual who is alive and that are intended to make donation possible after they have died.</p>
<p>So our remit is limited, and we have not been tasked with reviewing the system that applies to donation and transplantation issues as a whole. Organs, tissues, cells and blood can all be donated (but blood can only be donated from a living donor). Since it is only in the case of organ donation that medical interventions must be carried out before death, the focus of our inquiry has been on organ donation.</p>
<p>Our remit covers several difficult balances in ethical issues. The central question is whether it is acceptable to perform medical interventions and physical procedures on a living human being for the sake of another human being. The particular point that makes the ethical balance complex is that it virtually always involves a person who is unconscious and a situation where health care does not initially know anything about the person's will and attitude regarding donation. Our conclusion is that it can be acceptable to do so on certain conditions, since these measures can considerably improve the health and quality of life of other human beings, and, indeed, even save their lives. Our ambition has been for the potential donor to be in focus in the shaping of our proposals on the conditions under which consideration can be given to performing medical interventions on a living human being in order to preserve their organs for donation after death.</p>
<h2>Organ-preserving treatment</h2>
<p>It is, at present, established – although not uniform – practice to perform medical interventions on dying patients to make donation possible after death. We have chosen to call these medical interventions organ-preserving treatment. Organ-preserving treatment before death is generally necessary to ensure that donations of organs are possible.</p>
<p>We have chosen to regard the position taken by health care on whether or not to continue life-sustaining treatment as the starting point for when donation issues can be raised. First after this position has been taken, health care ought to be able to move on to organpreserving treatment under certain conditions. Once this position has been taken, health care ought also to be able to start the investigation of the individual’s attitude to donation.</p>
<p>By organ-preserving treatment we mean intensive care interventions, such as respirator treatment, and pharmacological interventions to preserve organ function. It should also be possible to take certain measures that do not directly form part of customary intensive care but that are essential in order to preserve organ function or to improve the possibilities of being able to carry out a transplant. But it should only be possible to give organ-preserving treatment if it cannot be deferred until after death, does not result in pain or injury that is more than minor and does not prevent interventions for the sake of the potential donor – this refers primarily to palliative treatment to alleviate symptoms. More extensive measures should not be allowed to initiate on a living patient as a part of the organpreserving treatment. This means that intubate and starting respirator care is normally not appropriate.</p>
<p>The potential donor is generally deeply unconscious when the time may come to consider organ-preserving treatment. So it is not possible to ask, at that point, whether they consent to treatment. This is one reason why we have chosen to link the conditions for organ-preserving treatment to whether donation is possible. If it is concluded in the investigation of the attitude of the potential donor to donation that donation is possible, then organ-preserving treatment should be permitted. The circumstances under which donation after death is possible follow from Section 3 of the Act on Transplantation etc. (1995:831), the Transplantation Act. It provides that biological material intended for transplantation or some other medical purpose may be taken from a deceased human being if they consented to this or if it can be established in some other way that the measure would be in accordance with the attitude of the deceased. Biological material may also be taken in other cases, unless the deceased has opposed the intervention in writing or expressed opposition to it or there is some other reason to assume that the intervention would be contrary to their attitude.</p>
<p>Since it will, under our proposals, be permitted to start both the organ-preserving treatment and the investigation of the potential donor’s attitude to donation after a position has been taken not to start or not to continue life-sustaining treatment, the organ-preserving treatment will need to be given for a short period of time without knowledge of the attitude of the individual to donation. As a result, even people who oppose donation may receive this treatment while the investigation is under way. However, this is justified since donation saves other people’s lives and in view of the strong public interest in making organ transplantation possible.</p>
<p>If it emerges during the investigation of the individual’s attitude that they are opposed to donation, the organ-preserving treatment should be ended promptly. The organ-preserving treatment is proposed to continue for no more than 72 hours from when the position was taken not to start or not to continue life-sustaining treatment. If there are special reasons, it should be possible to extend that period slightly.</p>
<p>Before a donation procedure can be carried out, tests, examinations and other steps must be completed to investigate whether the potential donor is medically suitable as a donor and to find a matching recipient of the organ. An investigation of that kind must also be carried out before taking tissues and cells. We propose that it should be permitted to perform the investigation of the medical possibilities of donation on a potential donor who is receiving organpreserving treatment while that person is still alive but after the investigation of their attitude to donation has been concluded and resulted in donation being possible. We also propose a secrecy overriding obligation to release information that is applicable to information needed in the investigation of the medical possibilities of the donation of organs and other biological material.</p>
<h2>Decision-making incapacity and children</h2>
<p>Under our proposals a donation procedure may not be carried out if the deceased is an adult and has had such a severe disability that he or she manifestly never been able to understand the meaning of and take a decision on such a procedure. One strong reason for this is that the regulation of donation is based on establishing and following the will of the individual. In a system of that kind, it appears natural to exempt a person who has never been able to understand the implications of donation from the provisions concerned. Another reason for having an exemption is that we propose removing the close relative veto from the Transplantation Act (more is said about this below). This means the disappearance of what can be seen as a kind of protection for people who have not been able to take a decision on donation during their lives.</p>
<p>In the case of children, our assessment is that no special provisions are needed over and above the general rules already set out in the Transplantation Act and the Children and Parents Code. Unlike adults who lack decision-making capacity, children are covered by an established system regulating who is able to represent the child in health care. The child's custodians have the right and obligation to decide on matters concerning the child's personal affairs, but as the child gets older and more developed, increasing account has to be taken of the child’s views and wishes. The age at which a child is itself able to consent to donation and therefore also to organ-preserving treatment and the investigation of the medical possibilities of donation vary from child to child. An assessment must therefore be made in each specific case. If it finds that a child opposes a donation, this is a special reason against the procedure according to Section 3, third paragraph of the Transplant Act, irrespective of the age and/or maturity of the child.</p>
<h2>Close relatives and the investigation of the individual’s attitude to donation</h2>
<p>In the investigation of the potential donor’s attitude to donation, there are three main sources of information: the donation register, a donation card and close relatives of the potential donor. We do not intend change this system. Donation cards and the donation register, in particular, also continue to fill an important function and are of high probative value in the investigation of the potential donor’s attitude. Close relatives are also an important source of information and close relatives can also interpret the potential donor’s attitude when there is no explicit expression of will.</p>
<p>We propose removing the current right of close relatives to prohibit donation in cases where the potential donor’s attitude is not known, the ‘close relative veto’. The decisive point should instead be the individual’s attitude to donation. The role of close relatives will therefore be confined to being providers of information about the potential donor’s attitude to donation.</p>
<p>Since close relatives are an important source of information about the potential donor’s attitude to donation and close relatives also have a personal interest in being aware of the procedure, the obligation to inform a close relative before a procedure is performed should be retained, even though the close relative veto is removed. In cases where it has not been possible to make contact with a close relative, this should not be an impediment to the procedure, if the deceased has given consent to donation.</p>
<h2>Relationship to the Instrument of Government and the European Convention on Human Rights</h2>
<p>The proposal that organ-preserving treatment may be given before the attitude of the individual to donation has been established is a legitimate limitation in law of the protection from forced physical violation in Chapter 2, Article 6 of the Instrument of Government and is therefore not contrary to the Instrument of Government. The same applies to the proposal that organ-preserving treatment may be given and also to the proposal that the investigation of the medical possibilities of donation may be performed in cases where the attitude of the potential donor to donation results in the attitude of the individual being unknown (Section 3 second paragraph of the Transplantation Act). Our proposals are also consistent in other respects with the fundamental rights and freedoms in the Instrument of Government. Parts of our proposals also involve a restriction of the right to respect for private life in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. However, these proposals are legitimate restrictions that fulfil the requirements set out in the Convention. Our proposals are also consistent in other respects with the European Convention.</p>
<h2>Impacts and entry into force</h2>
<p>Our proposals are mainly about organ-preserving treatment and associated matters. Our ambition has been to provide a clear and predictable legislative regulation of these interventions. It has also been important to provide a regulatory framework that permits some flexibility. It should be possible to use new technology in the future provided it lives up to the requirements set out in the proposed regulations.</p>
<p>Uniform application across the country will, along with the development of medical technology, probably lead in the long term to it being possible to procure a larger number of organs from deceased persons than at present. The number of donations may also increase in the future if the Donation after Circulatory Death (DCD) method is introduced in Sweden on a permanent basis; the proposed regulatory framework provides scope for this.</p>
<p>Our assessment is that our proposals will not result in any increase in net costs for the local government sector (in this case, organisers of health care). On this point we rely on the conclusions drawn by the Inquiry on donation and transplantation issues regarding costs for health care. That inquiry commissioned a health economics study regarding kidney transplants. The conclusion was that kidney transplants result in a substantial decrease in health care costs in relation to dialysis (which is the alternative treatment method). One conclusion from this should therefore be that an increase in the number of organs procured from deceased persons results in savings rather than costs for health care.</p>
<p>Our proposals mainly concern technical matters of legal drafting, and it should be possible to implement them within current central government budget limits.</p>
<p>Our assessment is that it should be possible for these proposals to enter into force on 1 September 2020. This is a deliberately tight, while realistic, timeframe because it is important that regulations can enter into force as soon as possible. Since our proposals largely constitute a codification of what is already being done today, we judge that 1 September 2020 is a reasonable point in time for entry into force.</p>
