<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Terms of reference</h2>
<p>On November 29, 2001 the Swedish government decided to appoint a committee (dir 2001:99, see appendix 1) with the commission to contribute to the creation of prerequisites necessary for the connection of the main city of all municipalities in Sweden to a national backbone network, in accordance with the commission earlier given by the Swedish government to Affärsverket Svenska kraftnät.</p>
<p>The result of this work was presented in an interim report from the committee on May 31, 2002.</p>
<p>On May 30, 2002 the Swedish government decided on additional terms of references for the committee, (dir. 2002:72, see appendix 2) with the commission to describe the extent and the characteristics of the infrastructure owned by the state in connection with the activities carried out by Svenska kraftnät, Banverket and Vägverket but also companies completely owned by the Swedish government, and that potentially could be used to enhance the deployment of high capacity telecommunications network. In order to create a transparent set of rules, both for those administering the physical infrastructures and to those with stakes in the area of IT, the commission also has been to propose a wellbalanced policy on how the state should provide operators access to such infrastructures.</p>
<h2>Infrastructure owned by the state and its use</h2>
<p>Through its government agencies and companies, the state has control of roads, railways, electrical grid lines and masts that could be used to deploy new high capacity telecommunications networks. km  80 000 60 000</p>
<p>Total length  Total fibre</p>
<p>A compilation shows that railways are the infrastructure with the highest proportion of optical fiber installed, but the greater part of all fiber networks are located in roads. Power grid lines are the infrastructure that in total has the highest length, but it is also the infrastructure that both in total and proportionally has the lowest rate of installed fibers.</p>
<h2>Committee proposals</h2>
<p>I am proposing actions to be taken in six areas.</p>
<h2>Coherent policy for state owned infrastructures</h2>
<p>Being the owner, the government shall express a general guiding principle stating that governmental agencies and companies should work in the spirit and direction given in the IT-bill. Such a guiding principle shall state that those governmental agencies and companies that at their disposal have an infrastructure that could be used for the deployment of high capacity electronic communication network should, within their given conditions, take their part of a general societal responsibility that Riksdagens goal that households and companies should get access to such an IT infrastructure is fulfilled.</p>
<p>Regarding Banverket and Vägverket, it shall be explicitly stated in their instructions that they, besides their sectorial responsibilities, also shall work towards the fulfillment of IT political goals, in particular with respect to availability and the usage of governmental infrastructure at their disposal to achieve this goal. Banverket’s and Vägverket’s annual account reports shall contain information on how they have worked towards the fulfillment of IT political goals, in particular with respect to availability. All governmental agencies and companies should also show how they have fulfilled the general guideline that they should work in the spirit and direction given in the IT-bill.</p>
<h2>Structures for telecom trunkway</h2>
<p>Governmental actors Banverket, Vägverket, Teracom and the companies within Vattenfall that control infrastructures such as roads, railways, and masts should allow access to such infrastructures to operators who wants to deploy public networks in accordance to Swedish law on electronic communication.</p>
<p>This should be clarified in instructions and policies to those actors. ─ A fee should be charged for the access to infrastructures. The fee should be determined strictly on commercial basis. It is however important to make clear that the reason for allowing access is not the profit. ─ Requests from operators should be denied only if no additional space is available in the infrastructure in question or if the presence of a wire line could have negative impact on the core business of the governmental actor, in particular with respect to functional aspects, security or quality reasons. ─ Banverket and Vägverket shall annually to the Ministry of Industry, Employment and Communications present a report on requests that they have received from operators to use their infrastructure to deploy networks or erect radio antennas.</p>
<p>The company act of Vattenfall AB should be changed to reflect a modernised terminology in the area of electronic communications. In the company acts of the local companies within Vattenfall and Teracom it should be noted in paricular that the companies may allow operators to use their infrastructure when building electronic communications networks.</p>
<p>Not without permission should a transmission line for electronic communication network be installed or should work be performed on an already installed line within a railway installation, if the line is owned by someone without permission to run a railway installation, railway traffic or special railway traffic management operation. Such permission shall not be required if rights of way has been given in accordance with the law on rights of way (1973:1144) and the work has been notified to the owner of railway. The Swedish railway inspectorate (Järnvägsinspektionen) should decide on such permission. If work is performed without due permissions or otherwise not in line with other required conditions, the Swedish enforcement officer (Kronofogden) can decide on assistance in accordance with law (1990:746) on injunction to pay and assistance.</p>
<p>In order to modernise the terminology to be more in line with what is used within the area of electronic communication, the article of association of Vattenfall AB should be changed. In the articles of the local companies of Vattenfall and Teracom it should be stated that the companies should be allowed to make their respective infrastructure available to operators that want to build electronic communication networks.</p>
<h2>Networks owned by the government</h2>
<p>─ The optical fiber network of Affärsverket svenska kraftnät and the radio network of Teracom is proposed to form a common IT infrastructure. This should be achieved by having Teracom acquiring the full right to use the optical fiber network of Svenska kraftnät, with the exception of such network resources that are needed internally for controlling and surveillance the electrical transmission network. The optical fiber network should however still be owned by Svenska kraftnät. Teracom should own all active equipment. ─ Teracom should have the right to use surplus capacity in the optical fiber network during a time that corresponds to the technical and economical lifetime of the fiber. The value of this right to use could be a shareholder contribution to Teracom, in which case the valuation of the grant of enjoyment should be in accordance with the Companies Act. An alternative is that a compensation should be paid. If so, it should be determined on commercial basis. Teracom shall take the responsibility for already signed agreements on grants. ─ Svenska kraftnät shall continue to own the optical lines and have responsibility for maintenance and also have free access to capacity needed internally for the power transmission. Teracom shall have an option to install new optical fibers in Svenska kraftnäts power lines. Teracom should finance such installation. ─ Svenska kraftnäts current commission, in accordance with decision by the Swedish government on August 17, 2000, dnr N1999/11617/SÄ, changed by decision on February 20, 2003, dnr N2002/8360/SÄ, should be cancelled. This commission should be replaced by the proposals given in this report, together with state aid to IT backbone networks decided by the government (regulation (2003:63) on aid to municipalities concerning support for connection to an open national telecommunication network) ─ The telecom branch of Banverket should not be included in the merger.</p>
<h2>Juridical form of activity</h2>
<p>─ The activities carried out by Banverket within its unit Banverket Telenät handling electronic communication shall be carried out in a separate company. ─ A commission shall be given to investigate whether it is possible and desirable with a separation between service and infrastructure parts of Teracom.</p>
<h2>Rights of way concerning lines within rights of way concerning roads</h2>
<p>It should be possible to allow rights of way concerning lines within rights of way concerning roads. The 2002 years committee on rights of way (Ju2002:03) is studying this question. Therefore, we do not make any more concrete proposals.</p>
<h2>Investigation of structures for telecom trunkways</h2>
<p>We propose that the National Post and Telecom Agency’s commission to investigate the status of the deployment of IT infrastructure is furthered to also encompass a survey on to what degree available infrastructure for telecom trunkways has actually been used for the deployment of high capacity networks.</p>
