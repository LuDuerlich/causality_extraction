<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The terms of reference</h2>
<p>The assignment can be divided into three parts.</p>
<p>Firstly, the investigator shall clarify the history of the deliberations underlying the formulation of the 1934 and 1941 Sterilization Acts. This part involves elucidating how the Acts were implemented and presenting and analysing the debate which may have been conducted in Riksdagen (the parliament), within the political parties, by the research community or otherwise during the years in which the Acts were in force and until they were finally repealed. Another prime concern has been to shed comprehensive light on the standpoints and responsibilities of the political decision-makers, public authorities, the research community and the medical profession. This also includes placing how the Acts came into existence, their implementation and the reasons for their ultimate repeal in their historical context and illuminating conditions in Sweden in an international perspective.</p>
<p>Secondly, the investigator is to show how many persons were sterilised under the Acts and with reference to the various indications, which those persons were and how their lives were affected. This includes giving an account of the number of sterilizations which were performed following application by a third party. The investigator is also to indicate any changes occurring in the implementation of the Acts while they were in force and the underlying causes of such changes.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the investigator is to put forward proposals concerning compensation for those persons who were sterilised against their own will or at the initiative of a third party, with regard to the principles to apply to such compensation and concerning the manner in which handling procedure and decisions in compensation questions are to be organised. The investigator shall cost the proposals put forward. The remit does not include the making of decisions in individual cases.</p>
<p>The investigator shall present a final report not later than July 1st, 1999. The proposals regarding compensation for the persons affected and concerning related questions shall, in keeping with the terms of reference, have priority of presentation. That present report deals with this part. "ACKGROUND AND PURPOSE OF THE TERMS OF REFERENCE IN THE MATTER OF COMPENSATION</p>
<p>The terms of reference for the investigation set out the Government’s basic reasons for the remit. They state partly as follows. ”Up until 1976, a large number of people were sterilized in Sweden under the authority of the sterilizations laws in force at the time. The formulation of those laws and the manner of their practical application were partly characterised by a racial hygiene perspective and a belief in eugenics which were prevalent among many policy-makers, researchers and physicians during the first half of the 20th century in Sweden, as in other countries. Many of the people who were sterilised fell victim to this belief, since long firmly rejected by the Swedish society. (-----)It is of great importance that the persons who at that time were sterilised against their own will or on the initiative of a third party should receive compensation, even though the State is under no formal obligation to pay compensation. Proposals should be put forward with regard to compensation for the persons affected and the principles to apply to such compensation and the way in which handling procedures and decision-making in matters of compensation are to be organised.”</p>
<p>It is the view of the investigator that the financial compensation or remedy is intended as an attempt by the State to make good the measures and decisions which have affected individual persons in the past and which today, to paraphrase the terms of reference, are firmly rejected.</p>
<p>Based on the terms of reference the investigator has not seen it as a part of the mandate to include any closer consideration of possible reasons for or against introducing compensation of the kind now contemplated, or of the justifiability of special treatment in this respect for sterilised persons rather than other groups of injured parties, such as lobotomy patients.</p>
<p>The task of presenting a survey and a historical account can above all be said to have the purposes of providing supportive documentation for a discussion concerning the values of the Society and State actions during the years when the Sterilization Acts were in force including a discussion about our values today. The charge of proposing compensation for sterilised persons presents a more concrete task, namely that of indicating the manner and amount of compensation to be paid by the State for injuries and suffering caused in the past to sterilised persons as a result of decisions and measures which we today consider wrong. The investigator’s proposals, taken as a whole, can perhaps also furnish some basis for a debate concerning other subjects closely related to the sterilization issue, above all in the perspective of moral philosophy. From that perspective it would have been more appropriate if the various parts of the report could have been completed and published simultaneously.</p>
<p>At the same time, the investigator fully appreciates the Government’s wish for priority to be given to the compensation question. With few exceptions, the persons who may be eligible for compensation are now of advanced age, which makes it essential that any financial compensation should be extended to them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This report, consequently, framed in relatively juridical and technical terms. It does not address the political, ethical and historical aspects which the investigator has also been asked to consider. The historical sections of this report are based exclusively on previously published research, except where otherwise indicated. Many readers may perhaps find it remarkable that analyses of the kind mentioned above, as well as conclusions and value judgements concerning the implementation of the Sterilization Acts in a broader perspective, are to a great extent lacking in the present report.</p>
<p>The investigator is well aware of this and want to stress that the final report will contain research findings and analyses, both on the Swedish and the international situation, which, it is hoped, will shed deeper light on Swedish sterilization policy, so that, on the basis of that material, the past will be made to yield up experience of value for the future.</p>
<h2>The Sterilization Acts and their implementation</h2>
<p>4HE 3TERILIZATION !CT</p>
<p>In this report the investigator describes, very briefly, the background to the passing of the 1934 and 1941 Sterilization Acts. Concerning the legal, political and scientific discussion underlying the legislation, and also the general public debate on the matter, the investigator refers to the official government reports preceding the legislation, to earlier research on these subjects and to the investigator’s forthcoming final report.</p>
<p>The 1934 Sterilization Act ( THE !CT OF -AY TH  ON STERILIZATION OF CERTAIN MENTALLY ILL MENTALLY RETARDED OR OTHERWISE MENTALLY INCAPACITATED PERSONS ) had, as the title implies, a limited range of application. It only applied solely to certain - “legally incompetent” - persons who were incapable of giving consent to sterilization. In other words, the Act made it possible to sterilise persons who were considered to have no insight into or understanding of the meaning of sterilization. In order to avoid misunderstandings the investigator uses the terms and concepts appearing in the contemporary text, e.g. ”sinnesslö” (mentally retarded och feebleminded) which today has no scientific meaning and has a strong negative value.</p>
<p>Thus nobody sterilised under the 1934 Act had personally applied for or consented to sterilization.</p>
<p>The Act did NOT  deal with sterilization at the request of or with the consent of the individual concerned, either as with regard to sterilization of healthy individuals or mentally retarded or other persons who understood the implications of the operation. The standpoint adopted by the legislature at this time was that sterilization of such individuals at their own request or by their own consent was permissible without specific legal authority. This applies, initially, to sterilization on medicotherapeutic grounds, which was considered permissible to the same extent as other medical treatment. Otherwise sterilization was considered permissible if performed with the consent of the individual concerned and if justified by what at the time were described as good causes of a eugenic, social, humanitarian or penal nature. On the other hand, legislation was considered necessary in order for sterilization to be permissible in the case of a person who was incapable of giving such consent. This was ONE  reason for the legislation. Sterilization using physical coercion was not permitted at all.</p>
<p>An inquiry into the conditions on which voluntary sterilization of legally competent persons could be performed was already requested at the passing of the 1934 Act. The remit was entrusted to the previously appointed Population Commission, whose recommendations, presented in 1936, formed the principal basis of the 1941 Act. 4HE 3TERILIZATION !CT</p>
<p>The 3TERILIZATION !CT  governed, in principle, all sterilization procedure not having a purely medico-therapeutic purpose, i.e. including sterilization at the request of the person concerned. The basic principle adopted was that sterilization could not be performed without permission from the National Board of Health. The principal rule of the Act was that sterilization could only take place after the individual concerned had applied for it or, if the application was made by somebody else, had consented to it in writing. Thus, according to the ”preparatory works”, the Act was based on the principle of voluntary consent.</p>
<p>Sterilization was possible on several grounds - “indications”, viz. eugenic, social or medical. The eugenic “indication” (also race-hygiene) implied that sterilization could take place “if there is reason to assume that a person will transfer hereditary characteristic such as mental illness or mental retardation, other severe illnesses or severe defects to their children”. The social “indication” meant that sterilization could take place if a person “by reason of mental illness, mental retardation or other mental impairment or because of an antisocial way of life” was “clearly unsuitable to have custody of children in the future.” The medical “indication” meant that a woman suffering from “illness, physical defect or weakness” could be sterilised in order to “prevent a pregnancy that would seriously endanger her life or her health.” The eugenic and social ”indication” was applicable to both men and women, while the medical “indication”, as has already been made clear, only applied to women.</p>
<p>Under Section 2, a person who, “by reason of mental disorder”, was incapable of giving valid consent could nevertheless be sterilised if the conditions laid down in Section 1 were satisfied. As stated in the 1934 Act, the preparatory works of the 1941 Act excluded the use of physical coercion. On the other hand there was no declared restriction of verbal persuasion or pressure. Influence of this kind, especially from the institutional staff, was on the contrary encouraged in the directions issued by the National Board of Health. 6OLUNTARY STERILIZATIONS</p>
<p>About 63 000 persons were sterilised in Sweden while the 1934 and 1941 Sterilization Acts were in force, i.e. between 1935 and 1975.</p>
<p>To the best of the investigator’s understanding, many of these sterilizations were genuinely voluntary. This is shown in important “postexaminations” and follow up studies performed at the end of the 1950s and the beginning of the 1960s. According to those studies performed 5-10 years after the operation, nearly 80 per cent of the patients were perfectly satisfied with their sterilization and did not regret it. The negative reactions mainly occurred among women who in connection with the operation had been subjected to coercion or very strong persuasion or among women who had no children. On the whole, the material indicates that particularly in the 1960´s and 1970´s most of the sterilizations based on consent seem to have been genuinely voluntary; however, no certain statements on this matter can be made at this stage of the investigation.</p>
<p>The fact that many persons underwent perfectly voluntary sterilization under the 1941 Sterilization Act, at least during the last 10 or 15 years when it was in force, is, in the investigator’s view, supported by the fact that many people opted for sterilization when the present legislation began to be applied. Between the mid-1950s and 1975, for example, an average of between 1,500 and 1,800 persons were sterilised annually, nearly all of them women and for medical reasons. During the first ten years of the present Sterilization Act, nearly 8,000 persons, 25 % of them men, were sterilised annually. Between 1976 and 1996, a total of 166,000 persons were sterilised in Sweden, 40,000 of them men. This can be compared with the 63,000 or so sterilizations performed under the earlier legislation between 1935 and 1975, more than 90 per cent of them on women.</p>
<p>The present legislation, which came into force in 1976, is based entirely on voluntary consent and does not as a rule require the sanction of any public authority. The one prerequisite for sterilization is that the person concerned must be over 25 years old and that the individual must have been carefully informed of the implications and consequences of the operation and, where relevant, of other possibilities of avoid pregnancy. Sterilization of persons between the ages of 18 and 25, on the other hand, is subject to permission being granted by the National Board of Health and Welfare. .ON VOLUNTARY STERILIZATIONS</p>
<p>Although the 1941 Act in principle was based on voluntary consent, the investigator has been able to establish that many sterilizations in reality were performed against the will of the individual. Here follows are examples of sterilizations which were performed after the individual concerned having signed the application or consented to it, but where it can be questioned if they were in fact voluntary. (1) In several cases, sterilization was made a strict condition for discharge from penal and other institutions, but also for the award of benefits during institutional residence. That procedure was strongly criticised in the annual report of the Parliamentary Commission for the Judiciary and the Civil Administration (Riksdagens ombudsman) as early as 1947. (2) The legislation also applied to minors and to legally incompetent persons. The majority age was 21 until 1969. Between 1969 and 1973 it was 20. Since 1974 it has been 18. The ”preparatory work” of the 1941 Act stated that it was not necessary to define a minimum age limit for sterilization. Instead the Minister took it for granted “that, even without such a provision, an examining authority should take the necessary consideration with regard to the age of the person in question”. The Minister also recognized a guarantee against abusers in the fact “that a minor as a rule could not be sterilised unless the person having custody of him had been given the opportunity of a hearing.” Sterilization, however, was not made subject to a custodian’s consent. Moreover, according to the directions issued by the National Board of Health, the person whom a request for sterilization was applicable to was always authorized to sign it personally, regardless of age and legal capacity.</p>
<p>Moreover, many of the persons who were sterilised while in penal or other institutions were minors or legal incapacitated. Research findings have shown that several sterilizations were performed against custodians’ wishes. (3) One relatively common ground for sterilization, at least until the 1950s, was a person being classed by a physician as mentally retarded. In that case, sterilization could be performed on both eugenic and social grounds, subject to other prerequisites being satisfied. Mental retardation, at the same time, was a diffuse term, which also was applied to other problems of a social character and often appears to have been used in a routine manner and on the basis of very limited and dubious documentation. (4) Through a special provision of the 1938 Abortion Act, the latter was interlinked with the Sterilization Act. The provision laid down that a pregnancy could not be terminated on eugenic grounds without the woman being sterilised at the same time. In practice, there where cases of sterilization being made a precondition for abortion in other situations as well. (5) Under provisions of the 1920 Marriage Code, persons who suffered from epilepsy and mental illness or who were mentally retarded were disqualified from marrying. Exemptions could be granted in certain cases. Sterilization could be a prerequisite for permission to marry. The provisions concerning disqualification from marriage were repealed for epileptics in 1969 and for the mentally retarded and mentally ill in 1973. (6) Sometimes sterilization was also made a condition for the receipt of certain national benefits. Thus during the 1940s at least, maternity assistance, a  needs-tested allowance preceding child allowance, was in certain cases granted only if the woman would agree to sterilization.</p>
<h2>The investigator’s conclusions and proposals</h2>
<p>)NTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The investigator has been instructed to propose compensation for those who were sterilised against their will or at the initiative of a third party. As previous sections of this report have shown, the 1941 Sterilization Act was, formally speaking, based on voluntary consent and on the individual concerned applying for or consenting in writing to sterilization. So far the investigator’s inquiry shows that over 90 % of applications for sterilization were actually signed by the individual concerned. The great majority of the persons who have hitherto requested compensation have also stated that, one way or another, they signed an application for sterilization. Thus one cannot automatically infer, from the signature on the sterilization application, whether an individual person was sterilised against his or her will. 0ERSONS STERILISED UNDER THE !CT ETC</p>
<p>In the case of persons sterilised under the 1934 Act, a different situation applies. The reason why they were sterilised under that Act was that they where considered to have no insight into the implications of consent or of the implications of sterilization and, accordingly, were incapable of consenting to sterilization. The same applies to those who were sterilised under the corresponding provision (Section 2) of the 1941 Act. All those sterilizations were performed, by definition, without consent, after application had been made by a third party, i.e. almost exclusively persons in position of authority at various institutions. In the investigator’s opinion it is impossible to speak of any form of voluntary consent in these cases.</p>
<p>All persons sterilised under the 1934 Act or under Section 2 of the 1941 Act ought therefore to be entitled to compensation from the State. /THER COMPENSATION CASES</p>
<p>In most of the cases studied by the investigator, however, the individual personally applied for or consented to the measure being taken. As has already been indicated, it is the investigator’s opinion that these applications included many persons who were nonetheless sterilised against their own will.</p>
<p>In the investigator’s opinion, there are on the whole certain difficulties involved in retrieving from archive material particulars supporting the individual person’s claim that he or she was sterilised against his/her will. The investigator therefore has discussed the possibility of defining a number of typical situations or criteria where it must be deemed highly probable that sterilization took place against the will of the individual or when the individual was in no position to influence a decision concerning sterilization, in spite of having personally applied for or consented to the procedure - typical situations, the existence of which, more often than not, was apparent from the documentation. Examples of such situations have already been quoted.</p>
<p>The investigator proposes that ALL  persons sterilised under the 1941 Act and under the four headings given below should also be entitled to compensation.</p>
<p>The investigator is aware that in some cases there may have been strong medical reasons for sterilization under one of these headings and that the measure can thus have been justifiable. Even so, the investigator has chosen not to make any exception for such a situation in these cases, so as to facilitate handling procedure and opportunities for sterilised persons to obtain compensation.</p>
<p>Minors and legally incompetent persons</p>
<p>In the investigator’s opinion, persons who were sterilised before reaching majority or while they were legally incompetent for some reason other than that of being under age had limited possibilities to understand the full consequences of sterilization. At all events, they had less opportunity of influencing their situation than a person who was of age and under no legally competent.</p>
<p>Inmates of penal and other institutions sterilised during their residence there or in connection with discharge</p>
<p>As has already been noted, during the 1940s and the early 1950s the authorities to a great extent made sterilization a prerequisite both for discharge from institutions and for the receipt of various benefits during institutional residence. The institutions concerned mainly comprise national, county council, municipal and private “institutions for mentally retarded” (occupational homes, nursing homes, educational homes, special schools for the mentally retarded, day schools, special hospitals etc.), but also institutions for juveniles, residential treatment centres for alcoholics, institutions for epileptics, mental hospitals and prisons.</p>
<p>It seems safe to assume that voluntary applications for or consent to sterilization during residence in institutions of these kinds were highly exceptional. Most of the applications of this kind indicate that they were induced by hopes or promises of such benefits as furlough, probation, work outside the institution, discharge, or by threats of discharge being postponed; in other words, the individual person’s application was made or consent given in a quasi-coercive situation.</p>
<p>Sterilization of persons characterized as mentally ill, mentally retarded or epileptic without being admitted to an institution</p>
<p>One relatively common ground for sterilization at least until the 1950s, was, as mentioned previously, for a person to be classified by a physician as mentally retarded. Sterilization could then be performed on both eugenic and social grounds, subject to the other prerequisites being satisfied. The same applied to persons diagnosed as mentally ill or as an epileptic.</p>
<p>In the investigator’s opinion, many of these persons had limited possibilities of fully understand the consequences of sterilization. Data indicates that sterilization in many cases was presented as an alternative to various forms of custodial care, such as the risk of admission to an institution or the placing of children in public care. The individual person’s possibilities of influencing the sterilization decision were, as a general rule, very significant.</p>
<p>Sterilization as an express condition for other official decisions</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, the investigator has been able to establish that sterilization was made a strict precondition for official decisions of various kinds, such as permission to marry, permission to obtain an abortion or the award of certain national financial benefits.</p>
<p>In the investigator’s view, an express stipulation of this kind amounts to a quasi-coercive situation, which should entitle the person concerned to receive compensation.</p>
<p>In the cases hitherto described by the investigator, it should be possible for the individual to show that he or she was sterilised in the situations referred to. /THER UNDUE INFLUENCE OR OMISSION BY A PUBLIC AUTHORITY</p>
<p>Even though a very large proportion of the persons sterilised against their will or on the initiative of a third party will be able to obtain compensation with reference to the case categories already presented, compensation is also justified in several other cases where the individual was induced by public authorities to apply for sterilization in a way which, with the present way of looking upon things, must be considered improper.</p>
<p>This applies, firstly, to situations when a person was sterilised on grounds of antisocial living. In many such cases it can be assumed that sterilization took place after pressure in various ways had been exerted by public authorities, e.g. through the threat of taking charge of the persons children as an alternative to sterilization. The investigator also has in mind situations where women underwent sterilization after persuasion in connection with an abortion, and without any eugenic “indications”.</p>
<p>Persuasion of this kind may also have occurred in close conjunction with childbirth.</p>
<p>It is true, that these acts of persuasion may have differed in character. Sometimes the question of sterilization was made the subject of a general discussion between social workers, physicians and the individual as an option for solving what was primarily a social problem. Even if it is not automatically true that discussions of this kind, with public officials suggesting and recommending sterilization, should be automatically regarded as undue persuasion or influence, discussion in these terms often seems alien to our present way of thinking.</p>
<p>The investigator considers it vitally important that women who, in connection with abortion or childbirth, were subjected to coercion or strong persuasion and then consented to be sterilised should also have the possibility of receiving compensation. At the same time, the investigator does not consider it possible for compensation to be paid to all persons who, for example, were sterilised in connection with an abortion, because there is no doubt that there were also many voluntary sterilizations in these connections. Between 1944 and 1964, according to figures from the National Board of Health, some 4,000 women were sterilised under the conditional clause of the Abortion Act.</p>
<p>Instead, the individual person must, with reference to the situations which may be involved, such as sterilization on account of antisocial living or in connection with abortion or childbirth, add some circumstance suggesting that he or she was subjected to influence by public authority to consent to sterilization or, in legal terms, MAKE PROBABLE  that he or she consented to sterilization while under undue influence or as a result of omission in the part of a public authority. Legally speaking, this is a very slight evidential requirement. Official influence should have implied some form of undue influence, such as pressure/persuasion or misleading information. The public authority can also have been guilty of negligence, e.g. by neglecting to investigate whether undue influence had been exerted by some other party, such as an individual physician or next-of-kin, and by neglecting to provide the individual person with necessary support in a difficult situation. If the individual can make probable, he or she shall be entitled to compensation.</p>
<p>Along the same line the investigator wishes to emphasize that an assessment today must to a very great extent be based on the individual person’s own statements and experiences, e.g. of treatment at the hands of persons in authority. It will probably often be difficult to obtain clear evidence of unjustified pressure from official records. Considerable priority must be given to the way the sterilised individual has interpreted the conduct of the authorities. Accordingly, in doubtful cases where the supportive documentation is sparse and/or difficult to interpret, the authority, which is to handle the matter of compensation, ought rather to award compensation than refuse a request.</p>
<p>In several cases, sterilization was performed in conjunction with abortion and without permission being obtained from the National Board of Health. Section 5 of the 1941 Sterilization Act made room for sterilization without such permission if, in connection with abortion, the physician established, on medical grounds, that illness or physical defects would seriously endanger the woman’s life and health in the event of a new pregnancy. Sterilization of this kind could also have been performed by authority of a certificate issued by two physicians, and provided in Section 3(2) of the same Act. That provision made it possible for a woman to be sterilised by her own consent if a medical “indication” for sterilization existed by reason of physical illness or defect, and if two physicians, one of them being the physician who performed the operation, certified that the requisites were met. Also in these situations too, the individual may have been subjected to such pressure that the sterilization was not voluntary, and so the question of compensation may of course arise on the grounds, which the investigator has already indicated. #OMPENSATION CLAIMS PREVIOUSLY HANDLED BY THE 'OVERNMENT</p>
<p>Between 1983 and 1996, the Government has awarded compensation previously, on compassionate grounds, to 17 sterilised persons. In most of these cases the compensation award amounted to SEK 50,000 in currentprice terms.</p>
<p>In these cases the Government had established that there had been errors in the handling procedure. The compensation then awarded was lower than the investigator is now proposing. In the investigator’s opinion, the persons who previously received compensation should not be excluded from the amount of compensation now proposed. A deduction should be made, however, for any previous payment. In this way, injured parties who have previously been less active in claiming compensation will not be disfavoured.</p>
<p>The Government has rejected 21 compensation claims. In the investigator’s opinion it is self-evident that the authority which the investigator proposes should handle compensation claims should reconsider these cases. 3TERILIZATION NOT PERFORMED UNDER THE !CT OR PERFORMED BEFORE</p>
<p>The investigator has found that, both before 1935 and between 1935 and 1941, sterilizations were performed without legal authority. The legality of these operations was discussed during the 1920s and 1930s, but no legal action was taken against physicians who sterilised individual persons by their request or with their consent. There were also instances before 1935 of mental patients admitted to institutions being sterilised; these cases have been documented both in previous investigations and research reports and in articles published in the journal Läkartidningen.</p>
<p>Although, formerly speaking, the present remit concerns implementation of the 1934 and 1941 Sterilization Acts and the issue of compensation applied to persons sterilised under those Acts, it is unreasonable in the investigators opinion that persons sterilised against their will or on the initiative of a third party before 1935 or outside the scope of the 1934 Act should be refused compensation on these formal grounds. The very fact that such sterilizations could be considered unpermissible or dubious, and that statutory provisions were discussed and introduced, argues for the award of compensation also in these cases.</p>
<p>Thus the investigator considers that the proposals concerning compensation - on the conditions which the investigator has already indicated - must also apply to persons sterilised before 1935 or sterilised between 1935 and 1941 without reference to the 1934 Act.</p>
<h2>Standard or individual compensation?</h2>
<p>It is difficult to penetrate and assess the suffering of individual persons and to grade that suffering with regard to the circumstances of the individual case. Any such assessment is bound to be highly subjective. It is true that assessments of this kind are made from time to time by courts of law and public authorities in various compensation cases, but here, the concern events, which may have occurred perhaps more than 50 years ago. This makes the assessment highly dependent on the ability of the individual today to express his or her feelings and experiences and on what facts are recorded in application papers and medical records. Consequently there is a great risk that the persons who were sterilised feel that they have been unfairly treated if a public authority today is to carry out an individual assessment of their suffering. Nor can one disregard the fact that a proposal in favour of standard compensation would greatly facilitate the handling of compensation issues, thereby making it possible for compensation to be paid more rapidly. This, in the investigator’s view, is a strong argument against individualised compensation and in favour of standard compensation. The investigator has not found any other reasons for differentiating compensation, e.g. according to age or sex.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the investigator is of the opinion that the amount to be paid should be a standard rate, the same for everybody.</p>
<h2>The amount of compensation</h2>
<p>The very fact of the State acknowledging that the wording of the 1934 and 1941 Sterilization Acts and their practical implementation were characterised by a view which we today reject is of course calculated to vindicate the persons who are affected by the legislation. This, however, can only partly alleviate the suffering to which many people were exposed, therefore it is natural that those who were sterilised against their will or on the initiative of a third party should also receive economic recompense, even though this can never entirely offset the individual person’s suffering. Compensation, therefore, will above all serve a symbolic purpose.</p>
<p>At the same time, the investigator has found it natural to link up such compensation to the compensatory systems applied in Sweden today with regard to insurance compensation and damages. Compensation based on these principles and paid on this scale is also in keeping with the practice existing in other Nordic countries.</p>
<p>The payment of compensation on the scale occurring in North American action of damages is, on the other hand, alien to the Scandinavian legal tradition. Those amounts of damages are based on other legal principles and on quite different economic premises.</p>
<p>The investigator concludes that the compensation which coercively sterilised persons ought to receive shall at all events correspond to what a person today suffering sterility as a result of a crime or accident receives in the form of disability compensation within the scope of civil law damages for disfigurement and disability. This compensation today amounts to approximately SEK 110.000.</p>
<p>The investigator has found that the authorities have in several instances been exceeded their powers when applying the law. As has already been shown, the procedure whereby sterilization was made a condition for discharge from penal and other institutions was already criticised by the Parliamentary Ombudsman in 1947. On that occasion the Ombudsman noted that the practice had no support in the statutory text and did not appear even to have been supported in the ”preparatory works”</p>
<p>Although it is impossible to tell exactly how many sterilizations were performed in conflict with the legislation, the investigator can at any rate observe that implementation was in several cases at variance with both the statutory text and the ”preparatory works” Public authorities and individual persons in authority induced the individual - also, for example, through pressure, persuasion and other forms of indirect coercion - to sign an application for or a form of consent to sterilization. In such cases the procedure, even if it was not at variance with the legislation and appears to have had some support from directions by the National Board of Health, seems at any rate to have lacked the consideration and caution by which it should have been characterised, as the Parliamentary Ombudsman expressed the matter at the time.</p>
<p>Even if the handling of sterilization cases was not directly in conflict with the legislation, many of the sterilization decisions were made on grounds clearly contrary to the present-day legal view concerning the rights of the individual. In this connection it can be mentioned that the Government already stated, in the terms of reference for the Commission appointed in 1972 to review the 1941 Sterilization Act, that the Act then in force was based on different values and social conditions from those prevailing in 1972. On that occasion the Government also indicated that the practice had changed, in such a way for example that the eugenic and social “indication” had steadily declined and that their practical significance must now, in 1972, be considered fairly marginal. The Government added that this development had no doubt been very much due to a growth of awareness concerning the value of sustaining and strengthening respect and safeguards for the privacy of the individual and with a correspondingly growing reluctance on the part of public authorities and individual persons to initiate or otherwise be a party to decisions of measures greatly affecting the person and family circumstances of the individual.</p>
<p>The investigator thinks that what has now been said constitutes sufficient reason for the State paying, over and above disability compensation, an amount corresponding to compensation for the suffering or humiliation to which the individual person was subjected. The amount of that payment should at any rate be comparable to “normal” compensation in criminal proceedings for the violation entailed by rape, i.e. SEK 50.000, but it ought to be set somewhat higher. In this connection, however, the investigator wishes to emphasize that there are today no legal foundations to impose on any individual person or on the State any legal liability that would confer entitlement to such compensation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the investigator proposes that a compensatory payment of SEK 175.000 should be made to each individual who was sterilised against his or her will or on the initiative of a third party. In this connection it should also be mentioned that, in keeping with general principles, the compensatory payment is tax-free.</p>
<p>As has already been mentioned, those persons who have previously obtained compensation from the Government or whose requests for compensation have been refused should have their cases reconsidered. In cases where compensation has been awarded previously, it has been lower than the amount, which the investigator now proposes. To avoid a situation where injured parties who have been less active previously in claiming compensation are disfavoured, the investigator proposes that compensation awarded previously be deducted from the amount which is now proposed. On the other hand, the payments made previously should not be written up to the present-day level of prices.</p>
<p>Many of the persons who have written to the Government or the investigator on account of the debate on sterilization have not expressly indicated any compensatory amount in their letters. Those who have done so have for the most part requested amounts of between SEK 50,000 and 200,000. One or two persons have requested more, in the occasional instance up to about MSEK 2.</p>
<p>The investigator realises that not even compensation on the scale now proposed will be universally regarded as reasonable recompense for the humiliation and suffering to which many people have been subjected. The investigator hopes and believes, however, that in striking a balance between individual suffering and the principles of compensation applied, for example, in tort cases or in legal claims for damages both in Sweden and in other Nordic countries, the amount of compensation proposed will, on the whole, be found acceptable.</p>
<p>At the same time it is important to mention that many of the people writing to the investigator have above all expressed a desire for vindication and for an apology from the State. The amount now proposed is, in the investigators opinion, high enough to manifest the intention of indemnifying the victims. 2EMARKS CONCERNING THE #ASTRATION !CT</p>
<p>Since the Castration Act, which is still in force, began to be applied in 1944, some 400 persons have been castrated, most of them between 1944 and 1970. For about 20 years now the Act has been applied exclusively to persons wishing to change their sex.</p>
<p>In this connection the investigator wishes to endorse views expressed previously, to the effect that the Castration Act no longer serves any purpose and should be repealed.</p>
<p>The investigator also wishes to draw the Government’s attention to the fact that research material studied by the investigator suggests that castration have sometimes been performed as an alternative to sterilization, almost exclusively on men coercively admitted to certain institutions. Castration has been made a condition of their discharge from the institution.</p>
<p>The Castration Act of 1944, still in force, shows in other words similarities to the Sterilization Act of 1941, abolished in 1975. Pressure and coercion seems to have occurred similar to the application to the Sterilization Act in some cases. This motivates deliberations if persons castrated could be eligible for some form of financial compensation corresponding to that which the investigator now propose for sterilised persons.</p>
<h2>Organisational questions</h2>
<p>(ANDLING ORGANISATION</p>
<p>The investigator’s task is to put forward a proposal concerning the way in which handling and decision of compensation cases will be organized. To the best of the investigator’s knowledge at present, 200 applications for compensation will at any rate come to be considered. It is very hard to estimate how many more persons will request compensation. Some indication of the number of additional persons who will be requesting compensation will be obtained after this report has been presented. The compensation question will at any rate require an organisation capable of handling the matters for at least one or two years.</p>
<p>The handling of cases must be both rapid and efficient as well as legally correct. This calls for an organisation with experience and knowledge of both legal and medical matters. Persons who are competent to deal with these questions must staff the organisation. The staff must have had previous experience of making medical assessments from earlier, often hand-written records. It should also have knowledge of compensatory questions. The organisation must also include expertise concerning legal safeguards and matters of administrative law, as well as confidentiality aspects.</p>
<p>In the investigator’s opinion, there is no point in building up a new, specialised organisation with its own secretariat for the limited period during which the matter of compensation is to be handled and - as far as known today - with regard to the relatively limited number of assessments involved. Organisational matters ought instead to be provided for within the framework of an existing activity.</p>
<p>In view of the number of cases and the requirements of legal process which are bound to be entailed by the legislation which the investigator proposes, use cannot be made of the bodies normally dealing with compensation claims against the State, namely the Office of the Chancellor of Justice and the Government Offices. One alternative is an organisation closely affiliated to the National Board of Health and Welfare. One important, perhaps decisive, objection to let the National Board of Health and Welfare deal with compensation issues is that this authority, in principle, is the one which originally decided on the sterilizations which are now a subject of investigation and compensation. Many of the persons writing to the Government and the investigator have expressed great distrust of the authorities and persons in authority who once decided matters of sterilization. These persons could find it repugnant if the “same” authority today were to decide matters of compensation and in certain cases - albeit to a limited extent - assess the fairness and credibility of their allegations concerning sterilization.</p>
<p>In view of these circumstances, the investigator feels that the most suitable solution is a more autonomous, experienced organisation to take charge of the practical handling of the matter of compensation.</p>
<p>The investigator proposes that the organisation which handles patient injury cases in public medical care and in a great deal of private medical care as well should be entrusted with the practical handling of applications for compensation with reference to sterilization. That organisation - Patientskadereglering AB (PSR) - was set up when compensation for patients’ injuries came under statutory regulation through the Patient Injuries Act. The organisation handles about 7,000 cases annually. It also handles special compensatory payments by the State and the Federation of County Councils to the next-of-kin of persons infected by HIV during 1997 (224 awards of compensation). $ECISION MAKING BOARD</p>
<p>The statutory provision will make compensation for sterilised persons a civil right under the rules of the European Convention. This necessitates adjudication by a court of law. For this reason, all compensation decisions should be made by a special board constructed in such a way as to meet the requirements of due legal process.</p>
<p>The investigator proposes that the chairman and vice-chairman of the board be qualified lawyers with judicial experience. A parliamentarian should represent the public interest on the board, so as to confer public insight. In addition, the board should include medical and sociopsychiatric expertise. The PSR officers handling and reporting on cases before the board should also be appointed as members of the board. 0UBLICITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY</p>
<p>The majority of the cases to be dealt with by the board are of a sensitive, personal nature. They concern the personal circumstances of individual persons as shown in medical records and other, similar documents, often compiled while the persons concerned were inmates of penal or other institutions and describing their mental, sexual and social situation in a revealing, often degrading manner.</p>
<p>Many of those who have been in touch with both the Government Offices and the investigator have clearly stated that they will only write and apply for compensation if neither their names nor what they have been subjected to comes to the knowledge of any outside party. In other words, they do not want it to be made known that they have been sterilised.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the investigator proposes that comprehensive secrecy be applied to matters of compensation.</p>
<p>The investigator proposes the addition of a new clause to the Secrecy Act, resembling the articles already applying to health services and medical care and to social services. Secrecy is to be the main rule, i.e. with a reversed damage requirement, and for not more then 70 years. If the board’s decisions were to be public, the names of individual persons would be revealed and, in the event of applications being granted, it would become known that the persons in question had been sterilised and against their own will. The board’s decisions, therefore, should also be confidential. Similarly, just as in the case of health services, medical care and social services, the so-called liberty information should not include particulars concerning the health status or personal circumstances of individual persons in these compensation cases.</p>
<p>The investigator proposes that applications for compensation be personal. In other words, it must be perfectly clear that the individual really wants the question of an application for compensation for sterilization against his or her will to be considered. It should of course be possible to request compensation through an authorised agent or, in the case of persons who are very ill, other representative.</p>
<p>Cases, which the Government has decided previously over the years, should be re-opened without individual persons needing to take any new initiatives to this end.</p>
<p>The investigator will transfer to the board all the compensation applications which have been received by the investigator or which have been forwarded by the Government.</p>
<p>In order for the administrative overheads to be surveyable, the proposed legislation will only be applied to applications received within two years of the new legislation entering into force. In the event of there being a large number of incoming cases at the end of this period, the validity of the law can be extended. Alternatively, even after the proposed Act has been repealed, it will be possible for the Government to make EX GRATIA awards of compensation in response to later applications, on the basis of the criteria indicated by the investigator in the draft legislation.</p>
<p>A special application form should be compiled in which all essential particulars are to be entered, so as to simplify the retrieval of earlier medical records etc. This also includes particulars of surnames at the time of sterilization was applied for, when and where the measure was taken and other particulars which relate to the personal circumstances of the individual at the time and which can provide a basis for compensation.</p>
<p>The person requesting compensation may directly request earlier material in the archives. Assistance should also be rendered by the handling organisation. The board should in all respects have an extensive duty of service and investigation for the purpose of helping individual applicants.</p>
<p>The compensation, which the investigator proposes, is intended as a PERSONAL  vindication for the individual. This means that next-of-kin shall not be able to apply for compensation for a person who is no longer alive. Nor, in view of its personal nature, shall compensation be payable in the event of a person dying before his or her case has been decided by the board.</p>
<h2>Calculation of costs</h2>
<p>The investigator proposes that persons entitled to compensation by the criteria, which the investigator has defined in the draft legislation, receive a compensatory payment of SEK 175.000.</p>
<p>The investigator has at present some 200 cases, which are certain to be examined. Of these the investigator estimates that the greater part will be awarded compensation after additions have been made to the supportive documentation. This implies compensatory payments totalling approximately MSEK 35</p>
<p>It is very difficult at present to estimate the number of other persons who will request compensation, but it will be possible already in the spring of 1999, after the investigator’s report have been made public and the Government and Riksdag have discussed the matter, at which time a more reliable estimate can be made of the total number of persons who will be requesting compensation. The investigator therefore proposes the allocation, in the supplementary budget for the spring of 1999, of sufficient moneys to cover, with a good margin, compensatory payments to persons who have already applied. Developments during the spring and summer can then be awaited before further moneys are allocated.</p>
<p>The cost of the administrative processing of the question of compensation, i.e. PSR’s handling costs and expenses of the board, ought not to exceed approximately MSEK 1,5.</p>
<h2>When can the legislation come into force?</h2>
<p>It is of course highly essential that persons who were sterilised against their own will or at the initiative of a third party should receive compensation as quickly as possible. In view of the investigator proposing a special enactment on compensation, the time needed for the decisionmaking processes of the Government Offices and Riksdagen means that the new legislation cannot come into force before July 1st 1999. The board proposed by the investigator for deciding compensation claims cannot therefore begin working before that date. On the other hand it should be possible for PSR already in the spring of 1999 to begin processing cases which have already been received by the investigator. The investigator will during this time do everything possible to assist with these preparations, so that the question of compensation can be resolved quickly after Riksdagen has taken a decision.</p>
<h2>General terms of reference</h2>
<p>The investigator’s remit includes taking a stand on certain terms of reference applying to all Government Commissions with regard to the assessment of public commitments, implications for regional policy, implications for equality of opportunity and effects on crime prevention.</p>
<p>The Directive on assessment of public commitments requires the investigator to examine, without prior assumptions, whether the public commitment which the investigator is appointed to investigate should be a public concern and, if that is the case and the proposals entail additional expenditure, to propose means of financing them.</p>
<p>If the investigator were to comply with the Directive on public commitments, concrete proposals concerning efficiency improvements, revisions of priority or measures of economy in the same policy field should be made so as to offset the expenditure entailed by compensatory payments to the sterilised persons, i.e. within the domain of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and above all in the context of health care, medical services and medico-ethics.</p>
<p>In the investigator’s view it is not reasonable for the investigator at this time or for the Government and Riksdag later on, when the final decision is taken, to propose measures of economy, e.g. in health services and medical care, to finance compensation to the persons who were sterilised against their own will. A juxtaposition of sterilised persons with other disadvantaged groups or activities in this way would be repugnant. The investigator therefore refrains from proposing any concrete funding expedient and instead proposes that the expenditure be covered out of a general funding source. Failing a funding source of this kind, measures of economy will have to be applied to the budget generally.</p>
<p>The investigator does not perceive any direct regional consequences of the investigator’s proposals, nor in general terms do those proposals have any implications for the work of crime prevention.</p>
<p>It is clear that the sterilization question as such is very much a genderrelated issue. More than 90 % of the persons sterilised were women. With regard to implications for equality of opportunity, the investigator’s proposals in the matter of compensation mean everyone, regardless of sex, shall receive the same amount. In the historical analysis the investigator will among other things be considering the gender-related aspects of sterilization policy. The final report is expected to be ready in mid-1999. That report will also include the investigator’s survey of the whole situation of sterilizations performed in Sweden between 1934 and 1975.</p>
