<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Proposals in brief</h2>
<p>The main tasks of the Inquiry on Copyright in this interim report have been to undertake a comprehensive review of the provisions on the transfer of copyright in Chapter 3 of the Copyright Act and to look over certain issues concerning extended collective licences and related matters. The proposals presented in the report are briefly as follows.</p>
<p>Several new general provisions on contracts will be introduced in Chapter 3. At the same time, the special provisions on publishing contracts will be removed. A provision will be introduced on interpretation of contracts that will codify and clearly define the ‘principle of specification’. In addition, a reference will be introduced to Section 36 of the Contracts Act (1915:218) and a general provision will be introduced on the obligation to use rights acquired exclusively.</p>
<p>Further, provisions will be introduced that will clarify the rights of the author in the event of transfer by assignment or licence of works protected by copyright. Thus a provision will be introduced entailing a presumption that the author is entitled to reasonable remuneration when he or she by assignment or licence transfers the right to exploit the work to someone who intends to use this right in the framework of commercial activities. Moreover, a provision will be introduced giving the author the right in the event of a royalty agreement to receive a settlement once a year and to inspect the information on which the remuneration is based. Further, a provision will be introduced concerning the right of the employer to works created in the framework of employment relationships, as a result of which the ‘rule of thumb’, as developed in case-law and doctrine, will be codified and clearly defined. Subject to certain conditions, this provision will give the employer a limited but exclusive right to use works created in the framework of employment relationships.</p>
<p>The proposals on extended collective licences in Chapter 3 a of the Act on Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works (‘the Copyright Act’) concern, firstly, changes in the general provision in Article 42 a of the Copyright Act and, secondly, changes and extensions in some of the specific provisions on extended collective licences. Among other consequences, the proposals in Article 42 a will make it clear that only one organisation in each area shall be authorised to enter into agreements under which collective licences have extended effect. Corresponding amendments are also made in the provisions concerning collection of remuneration under Article 26 m of the Copyright Act, the provisions on collection of resale right remuneration under Article 26 p of the Copyright Act and the provisions on collection of remuneration under Article 47, third paragraph of the Copyright Act. The provision on extended collective licences in Article 42 b concerning the making of copies at places of work is broadened to include digital copies. Further, the provision on extended collective licences in Article 42 d of the Copyright Act is broadened to make it easier for libraries and archives to digitise works in their collections and make them accessible. A broadening of the provision concerning sound radio and television broadcasts in Article 42 e of the Copyright Act is proposed, so as to make it cover all communication to the public and such making of copies as is necessary to enable the communication to take place. This means that the provision covers cases in which material is made available at the request of individuals. Moreover, a completely new provision on extended collective licences is proposed, allowing the parties to enter into agreements under which collective licences have extended effect in areas other than those specified in the Act. This will be known as a special extended collective licence.</p>
<p>The new general provisions aim to promote clarity and certainty in copyright contracts, which should be to the advantage of all parties. In addition, they are intended to prevent lock-in effects arising. The provisions are also intended to clarify the rights of the author and to uphold the principles of copyright in an increasingly complex and many-branched market for protected works and performances. The amended and new provisions on extended collective licences aim to facilitate rights clearance in connection with various forms of mass use of works and performances protected by copyright so as to make the great repertoire available in organised form and on terms that are acceptable to the users, authors and other rightholders.</p>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>As indicated above the main tasks of the Inquiry on Copyright have been to undertake a comprehensive review of the provisions on the transfer of copyright in Chapter 3 of the Copyright Act, but also to look over certain issues concerning extended collective licences and related matters. Within the framework of the first area the specific task must be noted of investigating and taking a stand on whether the position of the author as a contracting party should be strengthened. The task of undertaking a comprehensive review has also, in particular, included investigating and taking a position on whether a kind of ‘work-for-hire rule’ should be introduced. A ‘work-for-hire rule’ is defined by the Inquiry’s terms of reference as a provision entailing that the financial element of the copyright to material produced in the framework of an employment relationship will pass to the employer unless otherwise agreed.</p>
<p>The task of looking over certain issues concerning extended collective licences has included the general question of the criteria that should apply in deciding which organisation or organisations should be authorised to enter into agreements with the effect of extended collective licences, instead of the criterion, now valid, that the organisation should represent a substantial number of Swedish  authors. The general issues have also included investigating and taking a position on whether it should only be one organisation that can have the authority to enter into agreements with the effect of extended collective licences or whether several organisations should have this authority. With regard to the specific provisions on extended collective licences, the remit has included the issue of whether the provision on the making of copies within public authorities, enterprises and organisations, etc., should be broadened so as to also cover the making of digital copies, and the question of whether a new extended collective licence should be introduced for making available, on request, works forming a part of radio and television programmes. The supplementary terms of reference issued to the Inquiry in June 2009 added the questions of whether the Copyright Act should be amended to make it easier for libraries and archives to digitise works protected by copyright and make them available, whether a general extended collective licence should be introduced, and whether the Copyright Act should be amended to ensure that the remuneration paid to an organisation on the basis of extended collective licences reaches the rightholders, particularly those who are not represented by the organisation.</p>
<h2>A comprehensive review of Chapter 3 of the Copyright Act</h2>
<h2>New general provisions on contracts, etc.</h2>
<p>The provisions in Chapter 3 of the Copyright Act have remained virtually unchanged since the Act came into existence. Meanwhile, society and the copyright market have undergone sweeping changes. Technical developments are constantly giving rise to new forms of use of works protected by copyright. In light of this, the Inquiry’s terms of reference emphasise the need to modernise Chapter 3 of the Copyright Act.</p>
<p>The task of the Inquiry has therefore been to undertake a comprehensive review of the provisions in Chapter 3 of the Copyright Act. The terms of reference emphasise, as a general point of departure, that the Inquiry is to strive for durable and flexible solutions that reflect the copyright market and give authors a reasonable opportunity to maintain their rights while also accommodating other justified interests. The Inquiry has also been instructed, as set out above, to consider the question of whether the position of the author as a contracting party should be strengthened, and if so, how.</p>
<p>In Chapter 3 of the Copyright Act as it stands today, the provisions on publishing contracts dominate, while there are relatively few general provisions on contracts. In many respects, the rules on publishing contracts have lost their relevance. The report proposes removing the special regulations on publishing contracts, but certain fundamental principles that occur in them will be given general application. This is in line with the introduction of a number of general provisions on contracts. The intention is for the provisions to promote clear and well-defined contracts. This should be to the advantage of all parties. Freedom of contract should apply as the basic assumption, so that the parties can make contractual arrangements as best suits their particular needs.</p>
<p>The report proposes that the new Chapter 3 of the Copyright Act should contain special provisions on the following subjects.</p>
<p>Interpretation</p>
<p>It is proposed that a provision on interpretation of copyright contracts be brought into the Copyright Act. The provision involves a codification and clearer definition of the principle of specification and means that the party that has a contractual right to exploit a work shall not be considered to have more extensive rights than stated in the contract or than may be considered to follow from the contract or its purpose.</p>
<p>Modification</p>
<p>It is proposed that a reference to Section 36 of the Contracts Act (1915:218) be brought into the Copyright Act. Further, a special provision is proposed to enable modification of unreasonable contract terms relating to non-material rights.</p>
<p>Use</p>
<p>It is proposed that a general provision on the obligation to use rights acquired exclusively be brought into the Act. The provision is optional and means that a party that by a contract other than an employment contract has acquired from the author an exclusive right to make a work available to the public is obliged to use this right. If the party that has acquired this right has not made the work available to the public within reasonable time or at the latest within five years of the date on which the author fulfilled her or his part of the contract, the author may cancel the contract.</p>
<p>Remuneration, settlement and control</p>
<p>A new, general contractual provision concerning remuneration is proposed. This provision gives the author the right to reasonable remuneration when the right to exploit a work is transferred by assignment or licence to someone who intends to use the right in the framework of commercial activities. This provision is optional. New provisions are also proposed giving the author the right in the event of a royalty agreement to receive a settlement once a year together with the information on which this is based, and the opportunity to inspect this settlement. These provisions will be mandatory and it will therefore not be possible to waive them by contract.</p>
<p>Contracts concerning communication to the public, etc.</p>
<p>It is proposed to retain in the Act the provision on contracts relating to public performance, etc. This will be taken up in a separate Article. The heading will be amended to Contracts concerning communication to the public, etc . Under this provision, a contract concerning communication to the public or public performance of a work will apply for a three-year period and will not confer exclusivity, unless otherwise agreed. This is particularly important in the event of use in the digital environment, such as on the Internet.</p>
<p>Film contracts</p>
<p>It is proposed that the presumption rule concerning film contracts be clarified. Under this proposal, a contract conferring the right to use a work when recording a film means that an author contributing a work for a film cannot oppose copies being made of the film, the film being made available to the public, provided with subtitles or being translated into another language. It is proposed that musical works continue to be exempted from the scope of this provision. Under the proposal, however, the provision will also include the rights that performing artists enjoy over their performance in a film.</p>
<p>Copyright to computer programs created in employment relationships</p>
<p>It is proposed that the provisions of the Act concerning computer programs created in employment relationships be modified so that the rights transferred to the employer under the conditions of the provision do not include non-material rights. A presumption is also introduced that employers are entitled to transfer their right to the computer program to others.</p>
<h2>A work-for-hire rule?</h2>
<p>The point of departure of Swedish law is that, initially, the copyright to a work always vests in the natural person who has created the work. In the event of employment relationships, copyright is transferred to the employer only to the extent that this is deemed to be explicitly or implicitly prescribed by the employment contract or by a special agreement. Interpretation of a contract would probably generally allow works produced as part of an employee’s tasks to be used by the employer in his or her normal activities and to the extent that could be foreseen with reasonable certainty when the work was created (see Govt. Bill 1988/89:85, p. 21 and Labour Court 2002, no. 87). The Inquiry’s terms of reference state that copyright legislation should be designed to be functional in its practical application. At the same time, they state that introduction of a work-for-hire rule would be a major deviation from the fundamental principle that copyright belongs to the author creating the work. The need that may exist for a work-for-hire rule must therefore be carefully weighed against the interests of individual authors in being allowed, as far as possible, to decide over their work, and other interests of relevance to the issue.</p>
<p>There is currently no special provision in the legislation concerning copyright in employment relationships. However, both in case-law and doctrine a ‘rule of thumb’ has been developed according to which, within their area of activities and for the purposes of their normal activities, employers may use works created by the employee as a result of employment duties towards the employer. The employer’s rights refer to use for the purposes foreseen when the work is created. Further, a change in the work is permitted to the extent required to achieve the purposes for which it was created during the employment relationship.</p>
<p>The report concludes that a general and essentially broadly framed presumption rule entailing the transfer to the employer of the financial element of the copyright of a work produced in an employment relationship does not offer a flexible and durable solution. The balance between conflicting interests in the area of copyright would be weakened by such a provision and would constitute a serious deviation from the fundamental principles of copyright. Instead a provision corresponding to the ‘rule of thumb’ is proposed.</p>
<p>The report’s proposal means that an employer, within his or her area of activities and for the purposes of his or her normal activities, may hold exclusive rights to works created by an employee as a part of his or her tasks or following instructions by the employer. The right of the employer covers use for the purposes foreseeable when the work is created. Where a work must be changed to achieve the purpose for which it was created during an employment relationship, this change is permitted, although only to the extent allowed by Article 3 of the Copyright Act. There are special provisions on computer programs in Article 34 of the proposal (the current Article 40 a). The provision is also to apply with respect to rights belonging to performing artists under Article 45 of the Copyright Act and to photographers under Article 49 a of the Copyright Act.</p>
<h2>Extended collective licences Which organisations are to be authorised to enter into agreements under the rules on extended collective licences?</h2>
<p>Chapter 3 a (Articles 42 a–42 f) of the Copyright Act contains provisions on extended collective licences. Under these provisions, agreements on the exploitation of works may be entered into with an organisation that represents a substantial number of Swedish authors in the field concerned. By entering into such an agreement, a user can also acquire the right to exploit works by authors not represented by the organisation. The intention is to make it easier for a user, through his or her agreement with the representative organisation, to acquire all the rights that he or she needs for his or her activities, while enabling the authors concerned to receive reasonable remuneration. The interests of the authors not represented by the organisation are safeguarded by certain protective rules, e.g. provisions on the right to remuneration and the possibility of prohibiting exploitation.</p>
<p>Article 42 a contains certain common provisions on extended collective licences. A collective licence only has extended effect in the case of agreements with organisations that represent a substantial number of Swedish authors in the field concerned. Corresponding requirements exist concerning the collection of a ‘private copying levy’ (Articles 26 k–26 m) and resale right remuneration (Article 26 j). This requirement is also found in the mandatory licence provision in Article 47 of the Copyright Act (see the third paragraph). In connection with the implementation of the EC Directive on Copyright in the Information Society (OJ L 167, 22.6.2001 p. 10, Celex 32001L0029), it was noted that there is cause to review whether it is a suitable delimitation for organisations to represent a substantial number of Swedish authors (Govt. Bill 2004/05:110 pp. 144 and 247).</p>
<p>Denmark amended its equivalent provisions after the European Commission found that they were in violation of the prohibition of discrimination contained in the EC Treaty. The other Nordic countries have subsequently made similar amendments. It is stated in the Inquiry’s terms of reference that there is cause also in Sweden to remove the limitation of a substantial number of Swedish authors and examine what other criteria are needed for the systems to work in a way that is transparent, effective and competition-neutral from both a rightholder’s perspective and a user’s perspective. According to the terms of reference, the review should also examine equivalent requirements in the provisions on the private copying levy (Article 26 m), resale right remuneration (Article 26 p) and the right to remuneration for performing artists and producers of sound recordings (Article 47).</p>
<p>Closely linked to the issue of which criteria should apply instead of the requirement that an organisation represent a substantial number of Swedish authors is whether one or several organisations should be authorised to conclude agreements in the same area of copyright. The extended collective licence provisions state only that an agreement must have been concluded with an organisation representing a substantial number of Swedish authors in the field (Article 42 a). Similar formulations appear in the above-mentioned provisions on the private copying levy (Article 26 m), resale right remuneration (Article 26 p) and the right to remuneration for performing artists and producers of sound recordings under Article 47, third paragraph. Concerning the issue of resale right remuneration, the Supreme Court has ruled in a judgment (NJA 2000 p. 178) that the provision means that more than one organisation may be entitled to claim remuneration, but that certain requirements must apply with regard to the organisation’s structure and stability. In connection with the implementation of the EC Directive on Copyright in the Information Society, the Council on Legislation raised the problems that could arise as a consequence of several organisations being authorised to claim a private copying levy or sign agreements on extended collective licences (Govt. Bill 2004/05:110, p. 563). In light of this, and other matters, it is stressed in the Inquiry’s terms of reference that there is cause to examine more closely whether several organisations within the same field should be allowed to operate in the extended collective licence area, or whether only one organisation should be authorised to conclude agreements in the area. A similar review should be carried out regarding the private copying levy, resale right remuneration and the right to remuneration for performing artists and producers of sound recordings.</p>
<p>The report proposes that the general extended collective licence provision in Article 42 a of the Copyright Act be amended so that the organisation that is most representative and best represents the authors of the works in the area exploited in Sweden shall be authorised to enter into agreements in which collective licences have extended effect. It is proposed that equivalent requirements be introduced in the provisions on collecting remuneration under Articles 26 m, 26 p and 47 of the Copyright Act. This will clarify in the general provision on collective licences and in Articles 26 m, 26 p and 47, third paragraph of the Copyright Act that only one organisation is authorised in a given field to enter into agreements in which collective licences have extended effect or to collect the remuneration concerned.</p>
<h2>Distribution of remuneration under extended collective licences</h2>
<p>The report makes the assessment that the distribution systems for extended collective licences currently used by the organisations that collect and distribute remuneration function well, and that the provisions contained in the Copyright Act are sufficient to ensure that the remuneration paid to rightholder organisations on the basis of the extended collective licence provisions reaches the rightholders, including those not represented by the organisations. Nothing has come to light to suggest that there are irregularities concerning payments. Therefore, no new provisions have been proposed in the Act to ensure that remuneration reaches the rightholders.</p>
<h2>Making of copies at government authorities and enterprises</h2>
<p>The report proposes simplified and extended arrangements for rights clearance concerning copying carried out at places of work for internal information purposes. It is therefore proposed that the extended collective licence provision in Article 42 b of the Copyright Act be broadened to also include the production of digital copies. In addition, it is proposed to remove the restriction to the effect that the only works of art covered by the extended collective licence provision are those that are reproduced in connection with the text in a literary work. It is also proposed that the provision’s requirement that the works in question must have been published be amended to state that the works must have been made public .</p>
<h2>Should the Copyright Act be amended to make it possible for archives and libraries to digitise works and make them available?</h2>
<p>The report proposes that the extended collective licence provision in Article 42 d of the Copyright Act be broadened to make it easier for libraries and archives to digitise works in their collections and make them accessible, for example, by communicating them via the Internet. It is therefore proposed that Article 42 d of the Copyright Act cover all production of copies and making available of works to the public that cannot be undertaken pursuant to the restrictions in Articles 16 and 21 of the Copyright Act. Moreover, it is proposed that an amendment be made to Article 21 to improve opportunities for archives and libraries to make works contained in their collections available on their own premises.</p>
<h2>Works and performances that appear in radio and TV programmes</h2>
<p>The report proposes simpler rights clearance for radio and TV companies for programmes made available at the request of individuals, for example via the Internet after the regular transmission time. It is therefore proposed to broaden the extended collective licence provision in Article 42 e of the Copyright Act concerning sound radio and television broadcasts. Under the proposal, the extended collective licence provision will cover all communication to the public and not just broadcasts. In addition, it is proposed that the provision cover such making of copies as is necessary to enable the communication to take place. It is also proposed that the provision cover performing artists’ performances of certain literary works under Article 45 of the Copyright Act, as well as certain sound recordings under Article 46 of the Copyright Act.</p>
<h2>A general extended collective licence?</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the general provision on extended collective licences be supplemented with the possibility of entering into agreements in which collective licences have extended effect in areas other than those specified in the Act, to be known as special extended collective licences  or general extended collective licences . The proposal requires the following conditions to be met: the agreement must apply to a limited and well-defined area; an agreement under which a collective licence has extended effect must be a precondition for exploitation; and the agreement must be in writing and contain information to the effect that the parties’ intention is for the collective licence to have extended effect. Special protective provisions will be introduced, under which, among other things, the author will always have the right to file a prohibition against exploitation.</p>
<h2>Entry into force, etc.</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the new provisions enter into force on 1 July 2011. The new provisions are to apply also to works and performances that originated before the entry into force of the new provisions. Existing provisions will continue to apply with regard to measures taken or rights acquired before entry into force. This means, among other things, that the new provisions will not affect agreements already entered into.</p>
