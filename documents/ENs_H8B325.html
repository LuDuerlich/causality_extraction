<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The inquiry was tasked with submitting proposals for how the need for a national ticketing system covering all public transport in Sweden can be met. The January Agreement on government policy entered into between the parties in government (the Social Democratic Party and the Green Party), the Centre Party and the Liberals, states that a national ticketing system for all public transport across Sweden is to be introduced on 1 January 2022. The background analysis shows that the issue is not a new one and indeed this has been a longstanding ambition. While the public transport sector has taken an important step with the introduction of the National Ticket and Payment Standards (BoB), it has not managed to voluntarily create a national ticketing system on its own initiative. Today there are several collaborative ticketing partnerships between public transport companies but the partnerships that exist do not cover all providers and are rarely nationwide. Therefore, we are now proposing how a national ticketing system can be built up, regulated, financed and administered. The proposals derive from the terms of reference of the inquiry and dialogue with industry stakeholders.</p>
<p>A system for the future – for passengers and the climate.</p>
<p>Assumptions underlying the proposals are that they are to make public transport tickets more accessible, encourage innovation, and be in line with the future investments faced by the industry.</p>
<p>Our proposals are divided into three main areas: infrastructure, innovation and consumer access.</p>
<p>In addition, we make several recommendations to the regional public transport authorities. We see these issues as being important to development but have chosen merely to make them recommendations, as they partly lie outside the inquiry’s remit.</p>
<p>The digital infrastructure that we propose is only part of the infrastructure that the digital mobility society of the future will demand. Therefore, we propose that the government appoint a separate inquiry to analyse the need to commission a government organisation to put in place national digital infrastructure in the field of mobility.</p>
<h2>Digital infrastructure for a national ticketing system</h2>
<p>It must be as easy to travel on public transport in Sweden as it is to use a mobile phone around the world.</p>
<p>In working on the inquiry, we have drawn inspiration from the world of mobile telephony, our goal being to propose a ticketing system that makes it as easy to travel on public transport in Sweden as it is to use a mobile phone around the world. As a passenger, you must be able to be a customer of your regional public transport authority and use that entitlement across Sweden, without having to register as a local customer in other parts of the country. The system must ensure that the right party receives the right payment for your journey.</p>
<p>To make this possible, the state must regulate standards, determine which public transport companies are to be included, and ensure that central functions are in place. We consider that the Swedish Transport Administration is the agency best placed to shoulder this responsibility, considering its other public transport duties. If there should be a new government agency in the future better placed for this task the responsibility may be moved.</p>
<p>The regional public transport authorities will also be tasked with specifying in their transport provision programmes the digital measures they are carrying out to facilitate journey planning and the sale of both procured and commercial traffic.</p>
<p>As always where infrastructure is concerned, it is up to the users to make use of it. The proposal offers great potential for public transport companies to gradually replace partnerships that currently work with varying degrees of technological success with the national infrastructure. We also consider that a common digital infrastructure will play a part in efforts to harmonise rules on tickets and services in public transport.</p>
<p>It is proposed that regional public transport authorities will be able to apply for government compensation for the additional costs of the investments they will need to make to connect to the digital infrastructure of the national ticketing system. The party that becomes responsible for building the central functions will also be able to apply for funding to do so. In both cases, the inquiry proposes that 50 percent co-financing be required, which may also consist of man hours put in within the organisation in question. In total, the costs of building the digital infrastructure are estimated to be approximately SEK 200 million. The inquiry proposes that the state contribute SEK 100 million of this. Operation of the system will be financed by the companies that use the system in the same way as operation is funded in the Resplus combined ticketing system.</p>
<h2>Technology for ticketing service provision</h2>
<p>The national ticketing system will be based on the ticketing systems of the regional public transport authorities themselves, which are based on the industry-wide National Ticket and Payment Standards (BoB). There is an agreement within the industry on using the BoB standards for ticketing systems. The state is to ensure that there is what is known as a ticket exchange with an associated application programming interface (API). Sales services call the ticket exchange’s API with enquiries for ticket products. The ticket exchange then calls the 21 regional public transport authorities’ ticketing systems to provide the right products.</p>
<p>The Swedish Transport Agency should produce regulations defining the data format standards to be applied. The Swedish Transport Administration should be responsible for providing the function but may delegate it to another organisation.</p>
<h2>Passenger identification standard</h2>
<p>Most industries are undergoing some form of fundamental process of adapting to the opportunities brought about by digitalisation. One strength of digitalisation is the opportunity to meet individual needs with mass-produced services. Public transport is a mass-produced service for millions of people. To make it easier to meet every person’s need for mobility services, we propose a system in which the passenger creates an account with their public transport company and receives a ticket in the form of an identifier (IDF). The system also enables anonymous purchasing of tickets over the counter in shops. The identifier is an electronic chip that may be in a card, on a mobile phone, in a watch or under the skin. The identifier must not be confused with a personal ID document.</p>
<p>The identifiers will be issued by public transport companies and third-party sellers in the same way as they currently sell tickets. The difference is that for account-based services, they have to follow a national IDF standard and be allocated the right to issue IDFs from a central function.</p>
<p>We consider that the Swedish Transport Administration should be responsible for ensuring that there is a national structure for how these identifiers are to be handled. We propose that this be based on an international card standard, i.e. EMV (Europay, Mastercard, Visa). Using an internationally established standard will make it easier for more public transport companies to become part of the national ticketing system.</p>
<h2>Settlement between parties</h2>
<p>When tickets are administered via the ticket exchange and where passengers travel with their identifier, transactions will arise between the different parties that provide traffic services. To manage these transactions smoothly and cost-effectively, we propose that a national settlement function be established. We consider that the Swedish Transport Administration is the agency that should be tasked with ensuring that such a function is provided in Sweden.</p>
<h2>National access point for mobility services and third-party sales of public transport tickets</h2>
<p>New technology and open data will result in Sweden becoming a role model for innovation with new mobility services.</p>
<p>The pace of innovation in the public transport sector has historically been low. Therefore, the state needs to regulate access to public transport tickets and make it easier to develop third-party sales. Globally there is great interest in developing innovative services and investing in new mobility solutions. Creating access to public transport tickets removes an obstacle to innovation. Therefore, we propose that all regional public transport authorities make their tickets accessible in an open sales API through a national access point. Other public transport companies will have the opportunity to make their tickets available through this access point.</p>
<p>The proposal creates benefit for the whole sector, both for established public transport companies and the mobility companies of the future, because easy access to public transport tickets will make it easier to develop new services and sales channels. New services are needed to develop public transport in rural areas. Making an open sales API available in a consistent way will also create efficiency benefits, as the regional public transport authorities will not need to carry out separate and often costly technical integration for every new initiative.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Swedish Transport Administration be tasked with expanding access to open data in the national access point such that it also includes information on tickets and prices. The agency should also provide standard agreements for third-party developers for the sale of tickets available via the national access point. The inquiry judges that the EU will imminently require Member States to complete development equivalent to our proposals.</p>
<p>Because the proposal is an extension of a mandate that the Swedish Transport Administration already must provide a national access point, we propose that financing take place within the remit of the undertakings already funded in the national plan for transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>We propose the Swedish Consumer Agency to implement a branch agreement with the Swedish Public Transport Association on rules for third-party sales of public transport tickets securing the travellers interests.</p>
<h2>National competition-neutral sales channel for all public transport</h2>
<p>Public transport companies will be encouraged to set up in Sweden, because tickets from all companies, large and small, will be sold on equal terms in the competition-neutral sales channel.</p>
<p>The government has identified a need for a competition-neutral sales channel for public transport tickets. The Swedish Competition Authority has drawn the government’s attention to distorted competition in the sale of rail tickets, arising due to the existence of a dominant sales channel in Sweden, sj.se, the website of the stateowned rail network operator, which does not sell tickets from some competing companies.</p>
<p>In dialogue with user groups, we have also found that there is a need for a national sales channel with a high level of accessibility, because accessibility in terms of booking and purchasing public transport tickets is currently lacking.</p>
<p>We therefore propose that the government ensure that there is a neutral, non-discriminatory sales channel with good accessibility for all public transport in Sweden. The service will also enable the purchase of public transport tickets for journeys in Europe. We propose that all public transport companies be obliged to clearly refer to this channel. We want the sales channel to follow the principle of universal design, which means particularly good accessibility for passengers irrespective of disability.</p>
<p>When investigating the issue of who is to run the sales channel, in addition to the findings of the Swedish Competition Authority in its investigation, we have identified some circumstances that a) justify the channel and b) reduce its commercial potential. This concerns tax questions where different VAT rates apply to sales depending on who makes the sale; volumes and the challenges of creating brand awareness; cross-subsidies and optimisation which today operate in favour of the selling rail operator; and, last but not least, access to valuable consumer behaviour data.</p>
<p>Therefore, we find that the government can choose to commission an agency to carry out the task or assign it to a state-run company, either by creating an entirely new entity or developing an existing one. In order to make that choice, the government needs to particularly investigate SJ AB’s future role in bookings and the sale of public transport tickets.</p>
<p>The cost of the proposal partly depends on the implementation option chosen by the government and partly on ambitions regarding the level of awareness of the service among passengers that the government seeks to attain.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>Our proposals involve several changes and a new chapter (3a) in the Public Transport Act (2010:1065). We propose that the application of the provisions be supervised by the Swedish Transport Agency in the same way as other provisions in the Public Transport Act. It is estimated that the proposed legislation could enter into force on 1 July 2021.</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that an implementation committee be set up in autumn 2020 with responsibility for preparing the introduction of the digital infrastructure for the ticketing system. The government can also ask the committee to support building the central functions included in the digital infrastructure for the ticketing system during the initial years. Following preparation or introduction, the committee can pass on further responsibility for provision of the digital infrastructure to the Swedish Transport Administration or the agency decided by the government. The committee’s responsibility should be transferred to another agency on 1 January 2023. The proposal that an implementation committee be set up is made in the light of the fact that the agencies that are to be responsible for the system currently lack the relevant expertise and need time to build such expertise, which the implementation timetable does not allow for.</p>
<p>To stimulate the sector to rapidly adapt technologically as required, we propose that the government earmark SEK 100 million in government compensation for which regional public transport authorities and the organisation that is to establish the central functions of the ticketing system digital infrastructure must be able to apply. We propose that applications for funding be opened in 2021, following the necessary legislation entering into force, and close on 31 December 2022, or once the funding has run out. Measures eligible for funding must be in place by 31 December 2023.</p>
<p>The digital infrastructure for the ticketing system will be open for public transport companies to sign up to in the first half of 2022. On 31 December 2023, all regional public transport authorities are to be fully linked to the national ticketing system in line with our proposal. The access point, with open sales API for third-party sales and data on products and prices, must be in place in 2022.</p>
<p>We propose that the operating costs of the central units in the national ticketing system be met by transaction fees that the implementation committee will agree on together with the sector. It is proposed that the cost of creating the national access point for third-party sales be drawn from the funding awarded to the Swedish Transport Administration to set up a national access point.</p>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s terms of reference prohibit us from submitting proposals that may conflict with municipal self-government. During the course of the inquiry, however, it has become clear that there are measures that regional public transport authorities could put in place together to make it easier for passengers to buy tickets. The most important of these are presented as recommendations below.</p>
<h2>Sweden Card</h2>
<p>In practice, there is already a Sweden Card covering all public transport across the country. This is Resplus årskortstillägg,  a product developed as an add-on to SJ’s annual travelcard. Today this product can only be packaged with an annual season ticket from a commercial public transport company. Now, the product only exists in combination with SJ’s annual travelcard.</p>
<p>We therefore recommend that the regional public transport authorities introduce a monthly subscription for all public transport run by the regional public transport authorities throughout Sweden. The distribution of income will be decided by the regional public transport authorities themselves, but it is proposed that the income go to the regional authority where the holder is registered.</p>
<p>The cost of implementing this would be marginal, as the product already exists and is administered by Samtrafiken.</p>
<h2>Tap-and-go</h2>
<p>To lower the thresholds for new public transport passengers, such as motorists, it ought to be possible to pay easily with a valid credit card anywhere in the public transport system. A passenger who spontaneously wants to buy a ticket should not be forced to first register as a customer with a public transport authority or to work out where and how to buy a ticket.</p>
<p>We therefore recommend that all towns with an urban transport system introduce what is known as tap-and-go, where the passenger taps their ordinary bank card on a card reader and has thus bought a ticket. Tap-and-go   requires EMV-certified readers, with synergies thus arising with the inquiry’s proposed digital infrastructure.</p>
<h2>Harmonise business rules</h2>
<p>The infrastructure that we propose for a national ticketing system is solely a tool for enabling large-scale and small-scale collaboration. Business rules and fare rules, both of which fall within municipal selfgovernance, demand harmonisation if passengers are to be offered clearer ticket products. In our view, the public transport sector could attract new passengers by simplifying and harmonising its products.</p>
<p>We therefore recommend that the industry work together in the Swedish Public Transport Association and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions to seriously harmonise these rules. Pricing and subsidy levels must naturally continue to be a matter to be decided in regional policy. On the other hand, questions about how a family should be defined, the definition of a pensioner, the procedure when switching between different modes of transport, etc. cannot be considered to differ that much depending on which side of a county boundary the passenger happens to be.</p>
<h2>Prepaid cards</h2>
<p>In mobile telephony, prepaid cards are available for those who are not able to or do not wish to enter into a contract. Similarly, in the public transport system there will be a need for people who do not have a smartphone, for example, to buy tickets. The digital infrastructure that we propose will make these kinds of prepaid products possible, as the identifier can be a card that the passenger buys at a kiosk or shop. The product can either be sold as a product from a public transport company or as a product produced by a third-party seller, e.g. the company that runs the shop.</p>
<p>We therefore recommend that all regional public transport authorities either provide this type of product through physical representatives or inform prospective sales partners that they could offer passengers this product through third-party development opportunities.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In the past forty years, public transport has undergone wide-ranging structural changes, with deregulation of the railways and expanded regional responsibility for public transport. When the Public Transport Act (2010:1065) was introduced, the government had high hopes that the public transport sector would coordinate itself on its own and introduce ticketing systems that would work nationwide.</p>
<p>Because there is no national ticketing solution so far, the government now wants to create one in line with our terms of reference.</p>
<h2>Digitalisation</h2>
<p>The inquiry describes the developments in ticketing systems that have taken place, from paper tickets to plastic cards and more recently to mobile phone apps. The next technical stage in digitalisation is for all tickets to be managed in the cloud, i.e. in underlying connected systems. In designing our proposals, we have drawn on the opportunities made available by new technology.</p>
<h2>An international outlook</h2>
<p>Sweden is not the only country to recognise the advantages of introducing a national ticketing system. National ticketing systems are in place or are being planned in many countries in Europe. Conditions are different in different countries and this also affects the way the systems are designed.</p>
<p>Possibly the best way forward would be a national ticketing system with a payment solution from London, its high status from Switzerland, harmonisation from Denmark, transparency from Finland, innovation from California and organisation from Norway, with a dash of the existing Resplus system in Sweden.</p>
<p>Our proposals will see Sweden lead the way on digital infrastructure for public transport ticketing, which in turn enables innovation. Sweden has the ambition of being a permanent world exhibition for digital development. The proposed public transport ticketing system makes Sweden well placed to both create simple ticketing solutions for passengers and attract innovative actors to test their new mobility services in Sweden.</p>
<p>Sweden will not be a pioneer in every area, but through an IDFbased ticketing system based on an established international standard and open to many different companies, and, through investments in open data and sales APIs, Sweden will have the potential to be a role model in the field of public transport. If the regions also adopt the recommendations, accessibility of public transport will increase further, encouraging the shift to more energy-efficient mobility and a lower climate impact.</p>
<h2>Impact analysis</h2>
<p>It is hard to evaluate the climate benefit offered by a national ticketing system, as this depends how much of a shift from private car use to public transport the ticketing system can achieve. As stated, the ticketing system is an infrastructure that public transport companies can use. The benefit the system produces depends on the extent to which it is used.</p>
<p>The starting point of the inquiry is to propose a ticketing system that is in line with the planned investments for as high a proportion of regional public transport as possible. The system uses an established international standard to make it easier for as many companies as possible to become part of it.</p>
<p>The impact analysis we have carried out shows that a national ticketing system will have limited significance on its own or in the short term in terms of creating a greater shift of passenger transport to public transport. The ticketing system needs to be contextualised with other measures carried out in parallel that together can contribute towards a marked shift. In the short term, the ticketing system will be an opportunity to remove an obstacle to using public transport rather than as a measure that drives behavioural change.</p>
<p>The effect may become more significant in the longer term. In the long term, the promotional measures encouraging the development of new mobility services will have the greatest potential to increase use of public transport. By making the products of regional public</p>
<p>transport authorities accessible for third party sale, expanding passenger information, creating uniform data formats and offering a national ticketing system open to all types of company looking to sell public transport tickets through new package solutions, the inquiry considers that the proposals have the potential to make a difference in the long term. In this respect, Sweden can become a role model and an inspiration for other countries.</p>
<p>In terms of cost, the investment in digital infrastructure is estimated to come in at a total of SEK 200 million, where it is proposed that the state will finance SEK 100 million of investment. It is proposed that the cost of operation will be borne by the participating companies by user fees. In the long run, use of the ticketing system will be based on commercial considerations made by public transport companies. The inquiry considers that there are efficiency gains to be obtained by participating in a national ticketing system, but the degree of take-up remains to be seen.</p>
<p>It is difficult, if not impossible, to judge the consequences of the proposal for a national competition-neutral sales channel, as they depend on the choice of organisation to implement it. The inquiry believes that this proposal will have a more limited impact on use of public transport than the two other proposals. In the short term, a competition-neutral sales channel is likely to have a very limited impact, as there is already a dominant sales channel through which largely all public transport is available. The difference here will concern load on the routes where competing public transport companies operate and their potential to develop their operations in the Swedish rail market. In the long term, the competitive distortion of sales opportunities in Sweden risks preventing public transport companies from seeking to set up operations in the Swedish market, which may have a major impact on use of public transport. The fact that data on passenger travel is now largely only gained by one public transport company can also be said to create restrictions for other public transport companies and lead to the public transport system not being used as efficiently as it could be, which is where a national competition-neutral sales channel could effect change.</p>
