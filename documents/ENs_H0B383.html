<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>My overall assignment has been to review Statistics Sweden and the official statistics system.</p>
<p>The Swedish official statistics system has been decentralised since the statistics reform was implemented on 1 July 1994. Statistics Sweden is responsible for cross-sectoral statistics, while 26 sectorspecific agencies are responsible for official statistics in each of their areas.</p>
<p>Official statistics are regulated in the Official Statistics Act (2001:99) and the Official Statistics Ordinance (2001:100). This regulatory framework specifies the areas for which official statistics are to be available and which government agencies are responsible for producing the statistics. The Official Statistics Act also states that official statistics shall be available for the purposes of public information, investigative activities and research, and be objective and publicly available.</p>
<p>Legal developments in the EU play an increasing role for the Swedish statistics system. EU regulations may concern statistics within a specific area or involve general requirements that apply to all EU-regulated statistics. The latter are mainly contained in the EU’s statistics regulation, which is currently undergoing considerable revision. The forthcoming changes to the EU’s statistics system are pivotal to my considerations. The European Statistics Code of Practice is also important in this context. The Code of Practice is an instrument for self-regulation containing principles of independence, integrity and responsibility and covers the statistical authorities of the Member States as well as the EU’s statistical authority Eurostat.</p>
<p>In 2011, official statistics amounted to a total of 356 ‘statistical products’. Statistics Sweden was responsible for just over one third of these, while none of the other statistical agencies produced more than 30 official statistical products, and many of them just one or a few.</p>
<p>Apart from its responsibility for statistics, Statistics Sweden provides contracted statistical services and is also responsible for coordinating the state statistics system. An important tool in this coordination is the Council for Official Statistics, an advisory body at Statistics Sweden. The Council comprises Statistics Sweden’s Director-General, as the Chair, and the directors-general of six other statistical agencies. The latter are appointed for three years. The agencies represented in the Council are appointed by Statistics Sweden according to a rotating schedule.</p>
<p>Statistical agencies can choose to produce official statistics themselves, order them directly from Statistics Sweden or procure them on the open market. Statistics Sweden may also participate in these procurement procedures. Almost half of the agencies produce their official statistics entirely on their own. Among the remaining agencies, it is most common to entirely or partially engage the services of Statistics Sweden. Statistics Sweden produces a total of about 65 per cent of official statistics, measured by the number of statistical products. Just over half are statistics the agency is responsible for itself, and slightly less than half are assignments for other agencies. Less than five per cent of the total production of official statistics takes place via procurement from organisations other than Statistics Sweden.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has obtained viewpoints from a large number of stakeholders, such as all of the statistical agencies, other users and producers of statistics and also some foreign agencies, including Eurostat. Acting on instructions from the Inquiry, Professor Bo Sundgren has analysed issues concerning the documentation of statistics, the National Financial Management Authority has analysed issues concerning the pricing of statistics and Statistics Sweden has conducted a web-based survey of members of the statistical agencies’ user councils for statistics.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of my considerations and proposals concerning the issues raised in the Inquiry terms of reference.</p>
<h2>Overall assessment of the function of the statistics system</h2>
<p>Statistics on various areas of society are a very important source of information in a democracy. Official statistics give a general, overall picture of society and increase transparency for citizens. Statistics are also used as the basis for political decisions, public debate, research, evaluation, etc. There is great consensus on the importance of producing statistics that highlight different aspects of society and can be used for the above-mentioned purposes. Statistics must be reliable, i.e. objective and factual and otherwise of good quality.</p>
<p>My overall assessment is that, on the whole, the official statistics system works well today. I have not found any fundamental system errors that would require an overhaul of the system, and therefore believe that the decentralised system can and should be retained.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the current statistics system does not present certain challenges, or that some aspects of it cannot be improved. But in my assessment, any changes that may be necessary can be handled within the current basic model.</p>
<h2>Direction and scope of official statistics</h2>
<p>In my opinion, Sweden should continue to apply a clear and somewhat narrow definition of the term ‘official statistics’, based on the particular importance of such statistics for describing society. However, in normal cases, EU-regulated statistics should always be official statistics. Focusing on these and other conditions, the Government should make certain general statements on what should characterise official statistics, with the aim of providing guidance for assessments by statistical agencies.</p>
<p>The direction of official statistics is currently specified through gradual concretisation whereby the Government decides on the overall subject and statistical areas, and which agencies are to be responsible for statistics, while the content and scope of statistics in a given statistical area are determined by the statistical agency in that area. In my opinion, the current system for deciding the direction of official statistics focus should be retained. If additional agencies wish to become statistical agencies, they should propose this to the Government, which will then decide on the issue.</p>
<h2>Quality of official statistics</h2>
<p>The experience gained by the Inquiry – for example, through contact with users and foreign agencies – suggests that, on the whole, current official statistics are of good quality. This does not mean that there are no problems at all, or that quality cannot be improved in certain respects. But the measures that may be required to improve quality essentially involve making a basically well-functioning system even better.</p>
<p>In my view, the most important quality requirements for official statistics should be stated in the Official Statistics Act. I propose that the wording of the quality requirements in the Act be modelled on the quality criteria contained in the EU’s statistics regulation.</p>
<p>Much of the content of the European Statistics Code of Practice is already met in Swedish law. However, an additional few of the principles contained in the Code of Practice may need to be regulated by law. I propose that the principle of a non-excessive burden on respondents is introduced in the Official Statistics Ordinance. However, in my view, most of the principles would be more suited as regulations from Statistics Sweden or, as is the case today, general guidelines.</p>
<p>In my assessment, the statistical agencies are working on quality issues in a professional manner, both individually and in joint forums, including within the framework of the Council for Official Statistics. Since good quality is crucial for the reliability and credibility of official statistics, it is essential that the agencies continue to conduct active quality efforts.</p>
<p>The Council for Official Statistics has established certain guidelines and criteria to promote sufficient quality in official statistics. Based on these, statistical agencies can take an ‘official statistics pledge’, which means that they promise to operate in accordance with the criteria. So far, just two agencies, the National Board of Health and Welfare and the Swedish Board of Agriculture, have taken the pledge. It would send an important signal to the users of statistics and others if more of the statistical agencies, and particularly Statistics Sweden, were to take the pledge. This may require some modification of the criteria concerning sufficient quality so that they can become applicable for more agencies. Examining this should reasonably be a task for the Council for Official Statistics.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, errors occasionally arise in the statistics, but these do not seem to be due to fundamental system errors. They more likely arise because, in practice, it is impossible to completely avoid errors in such a complex system as the statistics system. When errors do arise, it is important that the statistical agencies have procedures and routines to identify, correct, analyse and learn from them. It is also important that the agencies openly report the errors that arise, so that commissioning organisations, users and others are made aware of the circumstances.</p>
<p>Both in Sweden and abroad, response rates for statistical surveys are tending to decline. This development is a real problem. The statistical agencies seem to be taking this problem seriously and are trying to find different methods of dealing with it. However, it is probably impossible to completely eliminate the problem of declining response rates, since fundamentally the trend has structural causes; for example, it is now more difficult to reach people using traditional methods than it was in the past. Statistics producers may need to develop better methods of managing the continuing decline and also find other ways of accessing the information. If response rates continue to decline sharply, there may eventually be reason to consider the introduction of an obligation on private individuals to provide information for some surveys, as is the case in many other countries. However, at present I do not see such a need.</p>
<p>According to some estimates, more than 95 per cent of official statistics are based on administrative data collected for purposes other than statistics. Problems can therefore arise if a statistical agency is dependent on administrative data from another agency and the latter for some reason chooses to change or terminate the collection of the data in question.</p>
<p>In this context, there are important reasons Statistics Sweden should be consulted on the initial design of and in the event of changes to the administrative registers of other agencies. This could be achieved if the agencies responsible for registers were required to consult with Statistics Sweden in such situations. Statistics Sweden, in its role of coordinating the statistics system, should then also be given the task of safeguarding the interests of other statistical agencies. The Council for Official Statistics could probably be responsible for coordinating this. A consultation obligation should be designed so that the relevant agencies are obliged to consult with Statistics Sweden, but following the consultation are free to make independent decisions and obliged to inform Statistics Sweden about these. Furthermore, the consultation obligation should only concern registers whose data is reasonably likely to be used for the production of statistics. However, the consultation obligation should not be introduced before final design of the EU’s statistics regulation has been established.</p>
<h2>Assessment of users’ access to statistics</h2>
<p>Access to statistics varies depending on the users and the usage area. The needs appear to be well met for users who mainly use statistics for informative purposes and/or for analysis based on the aggregated statistical information which is presented on agencies’ websites and requiring less extensive processing of the statistical material. It should be noted that this aggregated information constitutes the official statistics. Users, such as researchers, who need to process the underlying microdata themselves for further use and analysis, face the greatest access problems.</p>
<p>My overall assessment is that, on the whole, current availability of official statistics is good. Availability has also been gradually improved since the 1994 reform. There is reason to expect that this development will continue concurrently with the possibilities created by information technology developments.</p>
<p>According to some researchers, statistical agencies have in recent years adopted more restrictive policies regarding access to microdata for research purposes. The agencies deny this. The Government has announced, however, that a special Inquiry will probably be set up to analyse these matters.</p>
<h2>Documentation of statistics</h2>
<p>Documentation of the statistics that are available, how they are produced and what they contain is a prerequisite if the statistics are to be useful. The only formal requirement that currently exists regarding documentation of official statistics is that statistical agencies are obliged to produce up-to-date descriptions of statistics, in a format specified by Statistics Sweden. On the whole, the agencies meet this requirement. They often also produce additional, more in-depth documentation.</p>
<p>The documentation appears to have improved over time. However, a persistent shortcoming is that the documentation often seems to be created retrospectively. It is important that the agencies seek to integrate work on documentation into the production process and conduct it continuously.</p>
<p>Current documentation seems to largely fulfil the needs of users who mainly use statistics for informative purposes and/or for analysis requiring less extensive processing of the statistical material. The greatest problem with regard to documentation is likely to involve users – often researchers – who have a greater need of processing the statistics and the underlying data themselves for further use and analysis. The proposals presented in the Inquiry’s interim report, Register data for research  (SOU 2012:36), should improve the situation for these more advanced users.</p>
<p>As far as possible, documentation should aim to give relevant stakeholders the answers they need. This would commonly require more extensive and thorough documentation than that prescribed by the current statutory requirements. At the same time, it would be overly optimistic to believe in the possibility of regulating for fully comprehensive documentation. In particularly complex cases, it is probably inevitable that the documentation must be supplemented with individual advice or information from the statistical agency.</p>
<p>I do not propose any legislative amendments regarding documentation. However, the issue of documentation requires further discussion, appropriately within the framework of the Council for Official Statistics. Furthermore, Statistics Sweden should be instructed to closely examine the potential of increasing the general distribution of methods and tools developed with public funds.</p>
<h2>Pricing statistics</h2>
<p>Statistics Sweden provides considerable contracted statistical services. The income from this represents almost half of the agency’s overall turnover. Other statistical agencies do not provide contracted statistical services, but may charge a fee for providing specially processed official statistics. Since producing statistics is a core activity of Statistics Sweden, and a significant portion of this is contracted services, the grounds for charging fees differ from other agencies, where producing statistics is a secondary activity.</p>
<p>In my view, full cost coverage should continue to apply as a financial goal of contracted services by Statistics Sweden, mainly on grounds of competitive neutrality. If the Government wants to use pricing to stimulate the access of certain user groups, such as researchers, to the data contained in Statistics Sweden’s register, this would be best achieved via grants to the purchaser of the data rather than to the supplier.</p>
<p>In cases when other statistical agencies wish to charge fees for providing special processing of their official statistics, pricing should be based on the cost of producing and distributing the statistics. An hourly rate, including a just and correct share of the agency’s common costs, could normally apply. This also appears to be the principle that most statistical agencies currently apply.</p>
<p>During the course of the Inquiry, users have criticised pricing by Statistics Sweden for its lack of transparency. In this respect there is room for improvement by Statistics Sweden. Much could be gained by Statistics Sweden developing more active customer dialogue, including information on how prices are set.</p>
<p>At present, statistics pricing is not entirely uniform between the various statistical agencies. However, the variation does not generally appear to be due to incorrect pricing, but is mainly a consequence of the different administrative regulations and other circumstances that apply to the activities of the various agencies. The agencies should not only become better at explaining this variation to the outside world, they should also jointly discuss how pricing should be set and, where possible, seek to achieve greater consistency. It would be appropriate to hold such discussions within the framework of the Council for Official Statistics.</p>
<h2>Statistical secrecy</h2>
<p>Statistical secrecy is regulated in Chapter 24, Section 8 of the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400), which states that secrecy applies to the particular activities of an agency that relate to the production of statistical data relating to an individual’s personal or financial circumstances and which is attributable to the individual. Furthermore, it is stated that statistical secrecy also applies to other comparable investigations that are conducted by the Swedish National Audit Office or the Riksdag Administration or by government agencies provided that the Government has prescribed it. The purpose of statistical secrecy is to provide strong protection for data providers, which in turn increases the chances of the statistical agencies producing statistics that are important to society and are of high quality.</p>
<p>In my view, the object, degree and period of statistical secrecy should remain unchanged. However, I propose that the section is made clearer by dividing it into paragraphs and placing the secrecyoverride part in a separate provision.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I propose that government committees and Statskontoret (the Swedish Agency for Public Management) be given the legal right to process data in other comparable investigations covered by statistical secrecy. Thus they would no longer need to apply to the Government to conduct investigations that require statistical secrecy.</p>
<p>In my view, the secrecy-override exemption should be the same as under current legislation. However, the term ‘research’ should be defined. This could be done by referring to the definition of research in the Act concerning the Ethical Review of Research involving Humans (2003:460).</p>
<h2>Obligation to provide information</h2>
<p>The Official Statistics Act regulates which actors are required to provide information for official statistics and what information this requirement concerns.</p>
<p>I propose certain changes to the Act. The Official Statistics Act should continue to state who is required to provide information for official statistics and that the requirement to provide information applies in relation to the statistical agencies. However, the Government, or an agency if the Government so decides, should be given authorisation to decide which information is to be covered by the obligation to provide information. The information I propose to be covered by the obligation should be largely the same as under current legislation. However, I propose some broadening of the information that should be provided by municipalities and county councils. The details regarding the enforcement of the obligation to provide information should be delegated to the statistical agencies. However, for registered religious communities that do not conduct business activities, the obligation to provide information, including the question of which information is covered by the obligation, should be regulated by law as previously.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I propose that the Government be authorised to issue regulations stating that those with an obligation to provide information for official statistics are also required to provide the information necessary for the production of such European statistics that an agency must provide to the European Commission (Eurostat) under a Council regulation.</p>
<p>I also propose that the Official Statistics Ordinance should state that the statistical agencies should endeavour to limit the burden on those with an obligation to provide information and prioritise the use of administrative data if it is available.</p>
<h2>Agency sales activities and the three roles of Statistics Sweden</h2>
<p>The Government has stated that, as a rule, agencies should not sell goods and services on the market. As mentioned above, Statistics Sweden is the only statistical agency to offer contracted statistical services. It is my assessment that the contracted services of Statistics Sweden are compatible with the Government’s statement. Therefore, the statement does not affect the design of the official statistics system. It is also my assessment that, on the whole, Statistics Sweden and the other statistical agencies fulfil the requirements of the Act on the re-use of public administration documents (2010:566).</p>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction, Statistics Sweden has three different roles in the official statistics system: responsibility, production and coordination. These three roles may potentially conflict with each other, but, in my assessment, this is a minor problem in practice. At the same time, there are great benefits in combining these roles in one and the same organisation.</p>
<p>As a result of the forthcoming changes at EU level, the national statistical institutes (Statistics Sweden in Sweden) will be given an enhanced role in, for example, coordination. Thus it would be difficult for Statistics Sweden not to have the roles of being responsible for cross-sectoral statistics and being responsible for coordination of the statistics system. Since the contracted services of Statistics Sweden currently play a very important role in the official statistics system, strong arguments also exist for not hiving them off from the agency.</p>
<p>In light of this, I propose that Statistics Sweden continues to jointly exercise its current three roles. It should be possible to reduce the problems of the conflicting roles of Statistics Sweden through various measures, such as better transparency in the agency’s pricing.</p>
<h2>Coordination of the official statistics system</h2>
<p>The coordination of the statistics system has largely contained the same type of measures since the 1994 reform, although the establishment of the Council for Official Statistics in 2002 involved some strengthening. Since the reform, it has been a matter of a rather soft form of coordination. Statistics Sweden has exercised its right to issue regulations only to a limited extent.</p>
<p>Since, by and large, the statistics system works well today, there is little reason to believe that the current soft form of coordination would have significant shortcomings. However, to safeguard the quality of statistics, there is reason – within the framework of the conditions provided by the decentralised system – to raise the ambition level somewhat with regard to coordination, follow-up, etc.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the forthcoming changes to the EU’s statistics regulation are expected to lead to the national statistical institutes receiving a stronger role with regard to coordination. The fact that Statistics Sweden is Sweden’s national statistical institute should be clear from the Ordinance containing instructions for Statistics Sweden, which should state that Statistics Sweden is responsible for performing the tasks that the national statistical institute is required to perform under an EU legal act. Furthermore, the right of Statistics Sweden to issue regulations with regard to official statistics, which currently only covers questions of user access, should be widened to cover quality matters in general. As previously, it should be stated in the Official Statistics Ordinance that Statistics Sweden may issue such regulations following consultation with all the statistical agencies.</p>
<p>One expected consequence of the change in the EU’s statistics regulation is that Member States will be obliged to take all necessary measures to implement the European Statistics Code of Practice in order to maintain confidence in their statistics. To this effect, each Member State, represented by its government, shall sign and implement a ‘Commitment on Confidence in Statistics’ whereby specific policy commitments are made to implement the Code and to establish a national quality assurance framework, including self-assessments and improvement actions. The Commitment shall be countersigned by the Commission. These commitments will regularly be monitored by the Commission on the basis of annual reports submitted by Member States. In the report, I suggest how Sweden may carry out this commitment.</p>
<p>Regarding the self-assessments that are to form the basis of the annual reports, Statistics Sweden should be instructed to take main responsibility for, and coordinate the work. This should be expressed in the agency’s instructions. Other agencies that produce European statistics should also be obliged to contribute to the self-assessments. In addition, a right should be introduced in the statistics system allowing the Council for Official Statistics to conduct regular overall reviews of statistical quality and availability, for example, by spot checks or thematically. This should also be expressed in Statistics Sweden’s instructions. In my opinion, the introduction of these new evaluation instruments will generate important information on how the Swedish statistics system works, and create ideas of suitable improvement actions.</p>
<p>The proposal that the Council for Official Statistics should conduct regular overall reviews involves a new role for the Council. It should not be difficult to fit the other proposed new tasks into the Council’s current working methods.</p>
<p>I propose that the Council for Official Statistics be broadened to enable permanent representation of influential agencies in the statistical arena. The Council should comprise the Statistics Sweden Director-General as Chair, and a maximum of twelve other members, in the form of directors-general of the other statistical agencies. Of the twelve other members, one should come from each of the following agencies: the Swedish Social Insurance Agency, the Swedish Forest Agency, the National Board of Health and Welfare, the Swedish Energy Agency, the Swedish Board of Agriculture and the National Agency for Education; the remaining six should represent other statistical agencies. This Council constellation should be stated in Statistics Sweden’s instructions. The current rotation principle should continue to apply with regard to the remaining six places. The Council should continue to act as an advisory body to Statistics Sweden, but also be able to make certain decisions within the framework of a budget set by Statistics Sweden.</p>
<p>My proposals for increased follow-up and improved coordination of the statistics system would probably require the allocation of additional resources for the proposed tasks, estimated to total approximately SEK 5 million per year. Several financing options are conceivable.</p>
<h2>Review of Statistics Sweden</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, I believe that Statistics Sweden should continue to exercise its three roles in the statistics system, so all parts of its current operations should in principle continue. Thus the current goals structure including goals for the three roles, and individual goals, continues to be relevant.</p>
<p>The Government’s governance of Statistics Sweden’s contracted services should be clarified and tightened. To this end, I propose that the Ordinance containing instructions for Statistics Sweden states that assignments concerning official statistics are to be prioritised, that contracted services are kept financially separate from the agency’s other activities and that the agency may take on assignments from commissioners other than agencies so long as this does not distort competition in the market. The instructions should also state that Statistics Sweden may use the income from fees and issue regulations on the size of fees.</p>
<p>It is important that the Government keeps itself up-to-date on trends in competition in the statistics area and that Statistics Sweden in an appropriate manner adapts its offering in response to these trends in order not to distort competition. I propose that Statistics Sweden be tasked with regularly highlighting changes in competition in the areas where the agency conducts contracted services.</p>
<p>In real terms, Statistics Sweden’s income has been stable – just over SEK 1 billion annually – over the past 7–8 years. However, the composition of this income has changed. Previously, appropriations and fees accounted for more or less equal shares of Statistics Sweden’s financing, but now the share financed by appropriations is clearly larger (53 per cent in 2011, compared with 43 per cent for fees). Of Statistics Sweden’s total appropriated income in 2011 (SEK 552.1 million) the greater part (SEK 520.6 million) came from the agency’s appropriation frame and the remaining SEK 31.5 million from special initiatives by various ministries, given in the form of appropriations. In recent years, Statistics Sweden has also to a greater extent received annual grants from the Government Offices for the financing of individual assignments. A clear trend is also that both grants of this type and appropriations beside the appropriation frame are increasing over time. In 1999, these sources of financing accounted for less than one per cent of Statistics Sweden’s total income, compared with almost 5 per cent in 2011.</p>
<p>This development has some drawbacks, mainly that – to an increasing extent – not all statistics that are financed by appropriations to Statistics Sweden are decided within a single framework. However, since different ministries have different needs, at the moment it would not be feasible to change the financing model for Statistics Sweden. If the shares of grants and appropriations beside the appropriation frame continue to increase, there may eventually be reason for the Government to return to a somewhat purer financing model for Statistics Sweden whereby statistical production mainly takes place via appropriation frames or fees.</p>
<p>In its governance of Statistics Sweden, and other statistical agencies, the Government should be attentive to any financing problems that emerge during intermittent examinations, i.e. those that are recurring but have an unspecified interval or are at least held less regularly than annually.</p>
<p>Statistics Sweden’s task with regard to official statistics for other agencies has been in deficit every year since 2005. This has not been a major problem in terms of the agency’s results, since overall contracted services have shown a surplus. However, the goal should be that official statistics assignments provide full cost coverage over time. The Government should be clear about this ambition in its governance of Statistics Sweden.</p>
<p>At Statistics Sweden, the Consumer Price Index Board and the Construction Index Board have the right to decide on matters of a principle nature concerning the application of the grounds that apply for index calculations. Since this decision-making right may be viewed as incompatible with the European Statistics Code of Practice, I propose that these boards no longer have a decisionmaking role, only an advisory role.</p>
<p>In the Ordinance containing instructions for Statistics Sweden it should be stated that the agency is responsible for supplying data to researchers. If the agency is expected to continue working with micro simulation models there may be reason to mention that as well in the instructions.</p>
<h2>Other matters</h2>
<p>Other considerations are also presented in the report. Among other things, I discuss certain issues concerning technology for the dis- tribution of statistics. Development work is currently under way, both within central government administration in general and at Statistics Sweden specifically, in the area of statistics. This is expected to lead to greater opportunities for users to automatically down- load information published on agency websites. I view this as a positive development. The Inquiry has not indicated that the Govern- ment would need to take any specific action at the present time, for example in the form of regulatory changes, to stimulate the develop- ment of new distribution technology in the statistics area. I there- fore have not made any proposals in this direction. It should be possible to handle the need for greater consensus and coordination, which may exist in the area of statistics concerning new distri- bution technology, within the framework of the Council for Official Statistics.</p>
<p>I also discuss the possibility of evaluation agencies obtaining access to microdata. Generally speaking, I believe it is important to give agencies the conditions they need to fulfil their mandates. This may mean that evaluation agencies, and other authorities when per- forming similar tasks, need to have access to microdata. However, the secrecy issues that need to be resolved in these cases do not concern statistical secrecy. The issue of the access to microdata by evaluation agencies should therefore be dealt with in another con- text.</p>
<p>In accordance with the terms of reference, I have also analysed the proposal for an integrated system for automated data capture of information on which to base municipal statistics, presented by the 2008 review of local statistics in the report Coordinated munici- pality statistics for management and monitoring  (SOU 2009:25). In theory, it seems sensible to develop an integrated system for automated data capture of information on which to base municipal statistics. However, there appear to be significant uncertainties concerning the practical implementation of the system as well as its costs and other consequences. Taking action today to actually build such a system therefore seems less appropriate. On the other hand, there may be reason for the Government to appoint a special In- quiry to analyse in detail the prospects of introducing such a system.</p>
<p>Finally, I discuss the possibility of broadening the definition of the term official statistics, in some ways that are specified in the Inquiry terms of reference. According to the Official Statistics Act, official statistics shall be publicly available. Therefore, final obser- vation registers, which contain microdata – i.e. information about individuals that can be of a sensitive nature – should in my view not be regarded as official statistics. However, statistical information on lower aggregate levels, than what is commonly used in official statistics, could certainly be part of the official statistics, provided that sufficient secrecy can be upheld. Still, I do not propose any legislative amendments in this respect, since statistical agencies already have adequate means of identifying and, if feasible, accommodating what needs users might have of statistical information on lower aggregate levels.</p>
