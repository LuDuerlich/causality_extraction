<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>This report is an account of the assignment we were given to carry out a general review of the Official Secrets Act, cooperation between and within public authorities, cooperation to counter juvenile crime, supplying information when serious crimes are suspected, and professional secrecy that contravenes the right of communication. The conclusion of the report is that we propose a new official secrets act.</p>
<p>We shall deal with the remaining parts of the assignment, namely publicity and secrecy in the context of international cooperation as well as various issues concerning the transparency of state and municipal enterprises, in our final report.</p>
<p>The right to be given access to public documents is regulated in chapter 2 of the freedom of the press act. This right may only be restricted if it is required with respect to one or more of the grounds for secrecy that are mentioned there. Such restrictions must be carefully indicated in the regulations in a particular statute, or, if it is more appropriate in another statute which is referred to by the special statute.</p>
<p>The particular statute to which the freedom of the press act refers is the official secrets act (1980:100). The official secrets act came into force on 1 January 1981. Since that time there has been a continual process of development and change in the work of public bodies. This can be seen in the official secrets act by the large number of changes that have been made over the years.</p>
<h2>Is secrecy increasing?</h2>
<p>Both the Swedish Union of Journalists and ourselves have studied what effects the many changes in the official secrets act have had on the extent of secrecy. These studies reveal that the official secrets act is continually being changed. Apart from the purely editorial changes, new enterprises that require new secrecy regulations are arising all the time. The law itself is thus becoming more extensive. As new enterprises arise, there is an increase in the areas where the official secrets act is applicable. In that sense it can be said that there is an increase in secrecy. However, this is not the same thing as saying that we are moving towards a more closed society. When new enterprises arise, there is also an increase in the public sphere. After all, secrecy in a particular area of endeavour is rarely applicable in general, but only concerns certain information or the circumstances of that enterprise. Any information apart from this is available to the public.</p>
<p>However, our investigation did reveal changes that we considered to be a clear extension of the official secrets act. By “an extension of secrecy” we mean that existing transparency has been limited in some way, either by applying secrecy to an enterprise that was previously entirely public, or by tightening up the secrecy already applied to a particular enterprise. Those changes that we deem to be a tightening up of secrecy have been implemented after problems have arisen in these enterprises due to information being in the public domain.</p>
<p>At the same time that secrecy is increased in certain areas, new enterprises continually arise to which the principle of public access to official records is applicable. Apart from a few relaxations of secrecy that benefit all citizens, relaxations of secrecy have occurred in some cases for parties, or their equivalent, to entitle them to access to information that is necessary for them to be able to exercise their rights.</p>
<p>The official secrets act is very much a living statute that is continually being changed. It is not always so easy to see what a change will entail for openness and transparency. The link between the constitution and the official secrets act is designed to function so that the legislator carefully weighs the interests of transparency against the interests of secrecy in every situation.</p>
<p>In our opinion this legislative model is the one that is the most effective in order to prevent us from departing too far from the principle of public access to official records. At the same time it is naturally important that developments in this area are closely monitored.</p>
<h2>Which route is it possible to take? A more user-friendly law</h2>
<p>We do not think that the secrecy regulations should be simplified by substituting an exemption to transparency that is more generally applicable. The linking of the official secrets act to the freedom of the press act is an argument against such a solution. When it comes to the general review of the official secrets act, in practice we consider our task to be one of considering what are the best means of revoking the stipulations of the freedom of the press act. It is our opinion that more general regulations would result in more secrecy. The current structure of the legislation concerning the right of public access and secrecy should therefore remain in place.</p>
<p>However, the official secrets act can be made more user-friendly by means of linguistic and editorial changes. The language can be modernised. By means of divisions, more chapters and shorter ones, sub-headings, cross-references and abbreviation of paragraphs, the law will become easier to apply. Moreover the official secrets act can be made clearer by incorporating definitions of basic concepts into the preamble of the act, as well as regulations of fundamental importance for the structure of the official secrets act.</p>
<h2>Efforts that should be made in order to retain the balance between openness and secrecy</h2>
<p>We consider that efforts should be made in order that the overall consequences for openness of the various legislative changes can be surveyed. In this way the balance between publicity and secrecy can be ensured.</p>
<p>Various efforts can, jointly or severally, give a better overview of the changes in the official secrets act and the consequences for openness. One kind of effort would be to establish a commission or standing committee with the task of following developments in the sphere of secrecy legislation. Another input could be an annual written communication to parliament in which the government reports on the changes in the secrecy act that have been implemented, together with other work on issues concerning openness and secrecy. Another possibility would be to appoint one or more organs as compulsory referral agencies with respect to issues concerning openness and secrecy.</p>
<p>We have not taken any standpoint with respect to which of these methods are preferable. Insight into issues concerning secrecy legislation and an overview of the overall effects of changes in the official secrets act and legislation concerning personal data protection are the main guarantees for the maintenance of the balance between publicity and secrecy. It is therefore important that measures are taken to make this knowledge and such an overview accessible in a coherent fashion.</p>
<h2>Establishing the requirement of damage and the evaluation of possible harm (chapter 4)</h2>
<p>We consider it to be in the public interest that there should be an investigation of possible harm. In our opinion the current principal guidelines, in which there is a presumption that secrecy would be advantageous, or a presumption that this would be disadvantageous, should be retained. Moreover we consider that there is no reason to make any changes in the evaluations of injury and harm caused. Certain regulations for the protection of the personal or financial circumstances of individuals should however be changed in order that the expressions damage and harm acquire the significance they have been given in the legislative history.</p>
<h2>Release of confidential information after weighing up the interests involved (chapter 5)</h2>
<h2>The general clause should not be changed</h2>
<p>According to the general clause, chapter 14 section 3 of the official secrets act (1980:100), it is possible for those authorities that have not been exempted from the applicability of the regulations to their sphere, to release information to another authority when it is clear that the interests for releasing the information outweigh the interests of those that the secrecy is intended to protect. As a rule the general clause is considered to be difficult to apply.</p>
<p>We have asked ourselves if the wording in the regulation results in it being unnecessarily restrictive. It is our impression that this is not the case. Changing the regulation to deal with the problem of it possibly being applied somewhat too restrictively in some situations could have undesirable consequences. Instead of it being applied in a more sophisticated manner, the result of easing the restrictions might be a far too widespread exchange of information between authorities.</p>
<p>Our impression is thus that the general clause should not be changed in order to increase its sphere of application. Where there is a general need for less secrecy, special regulations about disseminating information should be put in place instead.</p>
<h2>A new regulation should be introduced that makes it possible for individuals to be given information when the general interest that there should be transparency clearly outweighs the interest that the secrecy is intended to protect</h2>
<p>We propose that a possibility of weighing the pros and cons should be introduced. The purport of this would be that information classified as secret could be given to an individual, if the authority giving out the information finds it obvious that transparency in the public interest should take precedence over the interest that the secrecy is intended to protect. The regulation is not to be applicable in issues concerning such secret matters of the kind that are exempt from the application of the general clause. Neither is the regulation to be applicable in those cases where an obligation of professional confidentiality contravenes the right of communication.</p>
<p>Even at the present time there is a weighing of interests in the official secrets act. The question is whether, in addition to this, there is a need for a general possibility for the authorities to grant exceptions from secrecy on the grounds of transparency in the public interest.</p>
<p>The main purpose for introducing a general possibility for authorities to grant exceptions from secrecy on the grounds of transparency in the public interest, is to ensure that the principle of public access can be achieved by ordinary means as far as possible. The regulation could be used in situations where the need for information is great: for example in a supervisory body; or in an enterprise where secrecy is applicable in order to protect financial interests; or where a preliminary investigation has been abandoned. Circumstances that may be considered as being in the public interest are, for example those concerning the health and the environment of people, or a seriously unsatisfactory state of affairs in the administration and the judicial system.</p>
<p>We are not proposing that it should be possible to freely grant dispensations at one’s own discretion, even if the scrutiny procedure in question gives a great deal of freedom to the authority applying the legislation. Rather it would be a scrutiny in which the interests of two different parties are weighed up, with the intention of permitting the greatest possible public access. We are of the opinion that such a proposal does not conflict with the freedom of the press act.</p>
<h2>Secrecy for sensitive information about individuals (chapter 6)</h2>
<h2>Secrecy should apply throughout the entire public administration for certain particularly sensitive information that is explicitly defined</h2>
<p>We propose that secrecy should apply throughout the public administration for information about individuals concerning their health or their sexual activities when it is clear that the individual in question, or somebody close to them, would suffer significant harm if such information were to be disclosed. If another regulation concerning secrecy that is in existence for the purpose of protecting the same interest is applicable to an authority, the regulation now proposed is not to be applicable.</p>
<p>Information about an individual’s state of health or other personal circumstances is granted considerable protection in legislation concerning secrecy. Nonetheless it does happen that such information ends up in enterprises where it is not subject to any secrecy. This can result in considerable harm being done to the person that the information concerns. It is naturally desirable to prevent tragic consequences for individuals as a result of sensitive information being divulged. At the same time, the principle of public access must be taken into consideration. It is not possible to ignore the fact that an extension of secrecy entails limiting the principle of public access. A balance must therefore be struck between these two conflicting interests. By this we mean that some information is so sensitive, that out of respect for the individual concerned it should be protected by secrecy in whatever enterprise it is found to be.</p>
<p>In order that the protection of secrecy intended here should be as limited as possible, only information concerning health or sexual activity should be covered by the regulation. A description of the object of secrecy does not constitute a sufficient delineation of the area of secrecy, however. A further tightening should be achieved with the help of the degree of damage that may be presumed. Examples of information that can be affected by the proposal are information about changes of sex, people who are transsexuals, depictions of children in pornographic images and information about serious mental illness.</p>
<p>The proposal is intended for enterprises where the protection of secrecy for sensitive information does not exist at the present time. We are not seeking to achieve a protection of secrecy that is completely comprehensive in its coverage; it is more a matter of a makeshift solution for those cases where extremely sensitive information about individuals would otherwise not be protected by secrecy at all. The presumption of the right of public access should therefore be strong.</p>
<h2>Personal information that is protected (chapter 7)</h2>
<h2>An enhanced degree of secrecy protection concerning sensitive personal information</h2>
<p>We propose that secrecy should prevail wherever the official secrets act is applicable concerning information about the address, telephone number or similar information about an individual, if there is a particular reason to presume that the individual in question or someone close to that person might be subjected to threats, violence or anything else of a serious nature if the information is divulged.</p>
<p>The committee on personal security (SOU 2002:71) has submitted proposals to the effect that the protection for sensitive personal information should be enhanced within the Swedish national registration system. Among other things the proposal means that the secrecy applied to a matter concerning confidential information in the Swedish national registration system would be transferred to an authority to which the information is submitted.</p>
<p>However, the proposal does not entail protection for the information if it is passed on to a third authority. Neither does it give any protection in those cases where the individual in question submits their own confidential personal information to an authority.</p>
<p>The desire to be able to offer protection to persons who are being threatened is something that carries considerable weight. The work that is done by the tax authorities to grant protection to a person who is being persecuted or threatened can be in vain due to shortcomings in the legislation concerning secrecy. If protected personal information is given out, the consequences can be devastating for the person who is being threatened or persecuted. Our proposal is intended to prevent this.</p>
<h2>An enhanced degree of secrecy protection concerning information about the link between real and fictitious identities</h2>
<p>We propose that secrecy shall apply to information about the link between an individual’s real identity and fictitious identity that refers to a matter concerning fictitious personal details, irrespective of the authority where the information is to be found, if it not clear that the individual will not suffer harm if the information is revealed.</p>
<p>Very few authorities need to be given information that makes it possible to link the real identity to the fictitious one. Usually the cooperation of the Swedish national police board is enough for certain information to be transferred from a real identity to a fictitious one. However, situations do arise in which it can be necessary for an authority to know all about the person who is concealed by a fictitious identity in order for that person to be able to exercise his or her rights. Moreover, it is not impossible that in some cases the person in question will submit information about both identities to an authority without that information being subject to any regulations concerning secrecy at the authority in question.</p>
<p>In order to really prevent information about the link between an individual’s real and fictitious identities from ending up in an enterprise where they are not protected by secrecy, comprehensive regulation that applies to all public enterprises is necessary. Only those authorities that for some reason have information concerning both identities are to apply the regulation. Since it is a matter of extremely sensitive information, the presumption should be that any breach of confidentiality would be harmful.</p>
<h2>Insight for a party (chapter 8)</h2>
<p>We propose a minor addition to the regulation in the official secrets act concerning insight for a party. From the addition it is clear that the regulation as such does not grant any entitlement to insight, it merely regulates the conflict that can arise between the official secrets act and the right granted by other regulations or on other legal grounds for a party to be entitled to insight into a matter.</p>
<h2>Indicating secrecy (chapter 9)</h2>
<p>An authority is entitled to make a note on a public document that secrecy applies to information in the document. We propose that henceforth such a note should be called a secrecy mark and that this term should be apparent from the wording of the legislation. In addition we propose that the regulation should be changed so that it better reflects the fact that a note about possible secrecy can be made on all documents, whatever the medium in question. This can be achieved by removing the requirement that the note is to contain the word “secret”.</p>
<h2>Some issues concerning secrecy at archival authorities (chapter 10)</h2>
<h2>National registration material at state archival authorities</h2>
<p>In recent years there has been an increase in the demand from genealogists for large amounts of information from the parish registration records. The material in the parish registration records is subject to the secrecy that applies to national registration material. The vast majority of the information in the parish registration records is available to the public, but the material can contain information that is subject to secrecy.</p>
<p>In our judgement the release of public documents from the parish registration records or information from such documents is no different from the situation for which the scrutiny of secrecy and, as a part of that, the matter of reservation according to chapter 14, section 9 paragraph one of the official secrets act (1980:100) was framed. The fact that it could be a matter of releasing large amounts of information is not sufficient reason to create a special form of release or reservation.</p>
<h2>The transfer of secrecy to the archival authorities</h2>
<p>We propose that the regulation concerning the transfer of secrecy to the archival authorities should be changed so that, as a rule, the secrecy does not prevent the material being lent to the authority that supplied it. However, the regulations concerning secrecy should be applied if the authority is obliged to supply the material to the record-keeping authority because of a regulation that has been issued on the basis of legislation concerning personal data protection.</p>
<p>It is in the interest of both the archival authorities and other authorities that relatively new material should be supplied to the archival authorities. Such supplies can be to the advantage of the long-term preservation of public documents. However, early delivery would be obstructed if the authority supplying it risks not being able to borrow it back again due to the secrecy that applies between archival authorities and the first authority. At the same time, handing over archive material could be an alternative to destroying documents that are subject to regulations concerning the removal of information for the protection of personal integrity.</p>
<h2>Secrecy between and within authorities (chapter 11)</h2>
<h2>Secrecy should continue to prevail between and within authorities in the future</h2>
<p>We consider that security limitations should still prevail both between and within authorities.</p>
<p>The demand that the integrity of the individual should be well protected presumes that secrecy prevails, not merely with respect to other individuals, but also between various authorities. Without secrecy between authorities, information could be disseminated to a far too great extent beyond the context where it is originally to be found. Even within authorities there should be regulations preventing information that has been submitted for one purpose from being used by the authority in another context; and information concerning sensitive personal circumstances from becoming known to an unnecessarily large number of people. Secrecy between and within authorities is also something that is relatively ingrained in people who are to apply the official secrets act.</p>
<h2>The link between the official secrets act and the personal data act should be clarified with respect to the transfer of information between and within authorities</h2>
<p>We propose that it should be clear from the personal data act that the regulations in the act do not prevent an authority from giving personal information to another authority or to another area of confidentiality within the same authority if the transfer is done in accordance with the official secrets act.</p>
<p>It is part of our task to review, in certain areas, the opportunities for the authorities to exchange confidential information to a greater extent than is presently the case. Since our directives were written, the personal data act has come into force. The consequence of this is that it is no longer just the regulations of the official secrets act that may be applicable when it comes to the exchange of confidential information between authorities, but also the regulations of the personal information act, possibly together with special laws concerning how to deal with personal details.</p>
<p>According to the directive concerning data protection, which forms the background to the personal data act, personal details may only be released if such a release is not incompatible with the aims for which the information has been collected (the finality principle). The same regulation is to be found in the personal data act. Our regulation of secrecy achieves the same purpose as the finality principle: i.e. authorities are prevented from releasing to other authorities information that is sensitive with respect to the integrity of a person for purposes that the legislator deems to be incompatible with the purpose for which the information has been collected. When the regulations concerning breaches of security were implemented, the legislator weighed up the interest that the information be released against the interest that the integrity of a particular individual should be protected. In this respect it is less important if the information has been released by the authority of its own accord or in response to a request.</p>
<p>In our judgement, the regulations of the official secrets act do not diverge from those of the personal data act. The release of personal particulars to another authority in agreement with the official secrets act should rather be seen as an action that is permitted according to the personal data act. This should be immediately evident from the personal data act.</p>
<p>When it comes to the treatment of the information by the authority receiving it, the personal data act applies. The receiving authority may thus not gather information for a purpose that is not specifically stated and authorized. Subsequently the information may not be dealt with for any purpose that is incompatible with that for which the information was collected.</p>
<h2>Security dividing-lines within and between authorities (chapter 12)</h2>
<h2>New security dividing-lines within the boards in municipalities and county councils</h2>
<p>We propose that the security dividing-lines within the boards in municipalities and county councils should be changed. Instead of secrecy in the relationship between independent branches of enterprises, secrecy within the boards should apply to the relationship between enterprises of various kinds. By “enterprises of various kinds” is meant enterprises that are concerned with various circumstances or have various aims. A definition to that effect should be incorporated into the law. In certain areas the security dividing-lines should be directly apparent from the official secrets act. On the same footing as boards in municipalities and county councils are the boards of associations or other organs in a municipal association, together with companies, associations and foundations that according to the official secrets act are to be deemed the equivalent of authorities.</p>
<p>For authorities other than those named above, the current system of secrecy with respect to the relationship between various independent branches of enterprises is to remain.</p>
<p>According to the current regulations, secrecy arises in the relationship between various branches of enterprises when these are deemed to be independent with respect to each other. This system is open to criticism, among other things because it should not be possible to avoid secrecy within an authority by neglecting organisational measures. In addition it is far too difficult for an outsider to decide if any security dividing-lines exist within the authority.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the free municipal board organisation, it has become doubtful whether the current regulations concerning secrecy within authorities can be applied in their entirety to the municipal boards. Uncertainty has arisen as to what is required in order for a security dividing-line between various activities in the same board to be put in place. Given the great opportunities that exist to permit one and the same board to deal with enterprises that differ widely from each other, it is with respect to the boards that it becomes particularly important that security dividing-lines should be precise.</p>
<p>Our starting-point when it comes to finding a new solution for security dividing-lines within authorities is that the security dividing-lines, as far as possible, should depend on the actual activities of the enterprises and not the organisation of the authority as such. An advantage of this is that secrecy becomes more predictable. Such a solution entails finding a balance between protecting the integrity of the individual and enabling the authority to work as efficiently as possible.</p>
<h2>The security dividing-lines in the spheres of health care, the medical services, the social services and the educational services should be immediately apparent from the official secrets act</h2>
<p>We propose that the security dividing-lines in the spheres of health care, the medical services, the social services and the educational services should be immediately apparent from the official secrets act.</p>
<p>We have found that it is primarily in the area of health care, the medical services, the social services and the educational services that uncertainty concerning security dividing-lines is to be found. In this report we are therefore going to itemise which of these enterprises within these areas we consider should be of the same types or of different types. In certain cases this is not obvious. In those cases where a decision would require a major work of investigation, which it has not been possible for us to undertake, we will regulate security dividing-lines in the light of what we consider to be the legislation that is applicable.</p>
<h2>It shall be apparent from the law when there is no security dividing-line between various enterprises that are conducted in an integrated manner or that have boards in common</h2>
<p>We propose that it shall be apparent from the law when there is not to be a security dividing-line between various types of enterprises that are conducted in an integrated manner or that have boards in common.</p>
<p>Our proposal that secrecy should apply within a board between enterprises of various kinds means that a security dividing-line would arise between the municipal health care services, medical services and the social services, which cooperate as a result of the reforms instituted in 1992 (“Ädelreformen”). When the reform was implemented, it was presumed that no security dividing-line would exist between these enterprises. The security dividing-line should therefore be removed from the official secrets act. As a result, no scrutiny of the need for secrecy would be required before information that is subject to secrecy regulations is exchanged between the enterprises.</p>
<p>To the extent that there are other integrated enterprises, or when such enterprises arise, the secrecy issue should be solved in an equivalent manner, i.e. by removing statutory security dividinglines.</p>
<h2>New security dividing-lines between the boards in a municipality or a county board</h2>
<p>We propose that there should not be any security dividing-line between the boards within a municipality or a county board to the extent that the enterprises are similar in nature.</p>
<p>We have seen above that secrecy within the boards in municipalities and county boards should not be dependent upon the organisation in the boards, but should be determined by whether the enterprises are considered to be similar in nature. The same understanding can be made applicable when it comes to secrecy between various boards. Even if each board is an authority, we consider that secrecy should not apply within a municipality concerning the relationship between those enterprises that are of the same type. The security dividing-lines thereby remain the same irrespective of organisational decisions. The divisions into local municipal boards, joint boards or district boards do not therefore affect the security dividing-lines. This means, among other things, that secrecy no longer applies within, for example, the municipal social services, even if the enterprise is divided up between various local municipal boards. However, secrecy still applies between the boards in enterprises that are of different types.</p>
<h2>No new security dividing-lines are proposed for the state authorities</h2>
<p>We propose no new security dividing-lines for any other authorities than the boards within municipalities and county councils. However, the various independent branch enterprises of the state authorities should be clarified in the instructions to authorities to a greater extent than is currently the case. When the tasks of an authority are described, it should be stated which enterprise the task belongs to. This will result in greater predictability and create clearer security dividing-lines within the state authorities as well.</p>
<h2>Regulation of internal secrecy</h2>
<p>We propose the insertion of a regulation into the official secrets act stating that if it can be assumed that information subject to a secrecy order may not be released from one area of secrecy, the information may not be divulged within the area of secrecy if it is clearly not necessary for the enterprise.</p>
<p>In the enterprise that an item of information is concerned with, there is no regulation in the official secrets act that prevents the information from being divulged within the enterprise. This applies even when the release of this information is not necessary for the enterprise.</p>
<p>The need to regulate internal secrecy has not previously been a subject for consideration. The question of what information may be divulged within an enterprise is primarily an ethical issue. However, common legislation that applies to all enterprises that apply the official secrets act would promote greater clarity in the matter. Such legislation would not prevent colleagues from exchanging information and experiences. Such an exchange can take place without the identity of an individual being revealed, however.</p>
<p>Given the regulation of internal secrecy by law, the issue of criminal liability arises. Both intentional crimes and crimes of negligence are punishable by law. In trivial cases there is no penal liability however.</p>
<p>A regulation of internal secrecy makes it more important for colleagues not to exchange sensitive information among themselves when it is not necessary. Any and all such exchanges of such information as a result of gossip, curiosity or other irrelevant purposes would become illegal.</p>
<h2>Exchange of information between the spheres of nursing and caring (chapter 13)</h2>
<p>We propose that secrecy within the spheres of health care, the medical services and the social services should not prevent information about an individual that is needed in order for him or her to receive the necessary nursing, care, treatment or other support that is provided by an authority in the fields of health care, the medical services and the social services from being divulged to another such authority or to a private caregiver or other separate private enterprise within the sphere of the social services. The proposal entails a widening of chapter 14, paragraph 2, section 6 of the current official secrets act.</p>
<p>In the fields of health care, the medical services and the social services, information is classified as secret with the presumption that it would be damaging to reveal information. These areas are exempted from applying the general clause. For these enterprises, when there is no exemption from secrecy in any legislation or regulations, the transfer of information from one authority to another within this area would in principle be dependent upon the consent of the individual. In the vast majority of cases this is not a problem. The problems arise when it is not appropriate or possible to ask if a certain piece of information may be divulged, or when the individual refuses to agree to it being divulged even though the authority that is to be given the information requires it in order to give the treatment or care that is necessary.</p>
<p>The primary aim, even in the future, should be to procure consent. Exemptions to this rule should only be granted with discretion and caution.</p>
<h2>The release of information from the health care services, the medical services and the social services to the police in the event of a serious crime (chapter 14)</h2>
<h2>A rider concerning secrecy and women who are subject to violence</h2>
<p>Our judgement is that information from the health care services, the medical services and the social services should, as is the case at the present time, only be given to the authorities investigating a crime without the consent of a woman who is subject to violence, when it is a matter of the very worst crimes. The fact that there are children in the home is no reason to take any other position.</p>
<p>It has been said that an exception to the rule of secrecy when it comes to violence directed against women is an important indication by society that such violence will not be tolerated. The question is whether greater opportunities for the staff in the health care services, the medical services and the social services to report suspected crimes, when the woman herself does not wish to do so, would be beneficial. It has been said that a report to the police by somebody other than the woman herself could be supportive for her in such a situation. Such cases may exist. However, one must not ignore the fact that the effect of a complaint to the police could have a diametrically opposite effect. The curtailment of a woman’s right of self-determination in this manner could be perceived as being extremely offensive. If a woman’s testimony is then questioned or doubted during legal proceedings, this can be an additional burden for her. Moreover, the health care services and the medical services can be the only place to which a woman who is subjected to violence can turn to, without fearing that the information she gives will be passed on to others.</p>
<p>Given this background, it is our understanding that is it only in clearly exceptional cases that those people upon whose professional help the woman depends may pass on information about suspected crimes to the police. At the present time this is only possible for the staff of the health care services, the medical services and the social services to do so where the very worst crimes are concerned.</p>
<p>Even children and young people who are not subjected to violence themselves, but who grow up in families where such violence occurs may fare badly. It is therefore important that attention be paid to the children’s situation when women are assaulted. However, it is the social welfare board, not the police, which is responsible for the child getting the protection or support it is in need of. We do not therefore consider there is any reason to make it easier for the social services, the health care services and the medical services to divulge information about the physical abuse of women to the police in order to improve the situation of the children.</p>
<h2>It shall be possible to divulge information about attempted crimes for which the minimum sentence is two years imprisonment to the criminal investigation authorities</h2>
<p>We propose that it should be possible for those working in the health care services, the medical services and the social services to divulge information to the police, the office of the public prosecutor or any other authority whose task is to take measures against crime, not only with respect to suspicions concerning a crime for which the minimum sentence is two years imprisonment, but also with respect to suspicions that attempts have been made to commit such crimes.</p>
<p>Even for those authorities where the need for secrecy has been deemed to be particularly great, such as the health care services and the medical services, the need for secrecy has had to take second place to the need to combat crime effectively where very serious crimes are concerned. The health care services, the medical services and the social services may divulge information to the police when a crime is suspected for which the minimum sentence is two years imprisonment.</p>
<p>It is our understanding that a general reduction to one year in prison as the minimum sentence for those crimes for which divulging confidential information should be considered, would constitute a fairly considerable relaxation of the official secrets act. Certainly it is a matter of violating secrecy where serious crimes are concerned, but this would no longer be restricted to the most serious crimes of all. It is our opinion that only where the most serious crimes are concerned does the fact that information can be divulged to the police and the office of the public prosecutor outweigh the individual’s interest in maintaining integrity and confidentiality. We therefore do not propose any reduction in the minimum punishment that is required for the health care services, the medical services and the social services to be entitled to divulge information about suspected crimes to the criminal investigation authorities. However, our impression is that even a punishable attempted crime that merits at least two years in prison on the scale of punishment should be included among the most serious crimes.</p>
<h2>Suspicions that a minor has been circumcised may be divulged to the police and the office of the public prosecutor</h2>
<p>We propose that an addition should be made to the official secrets act, so that confidentiality does not prevent suspicions that a minor has been circumcised from being reported to the police and the office of the public prosecutor.</p>
<p>As for crimes that are perpetrated against a minor, secrecy does not prevent the matter being reported to the police if it concerns a crime under chapters 3, 4 and 6 of the Swedish penal code. With respect to circumcision to the normal extent that is perpetrated on minors, there is no explicit means of submitting information. It is important that suspected cases of circumcision perpetrated on minors should be brought to the attention of the police and the office of the public prosecutor and that the matter should be tried by the courts. Any obstacles in the form of secrecy that might prevent information being reported to the police should therefore be removed.</p>
<h2>Basis</h2>
<p>Those problems that arise with respect to the crime-prevention activities of the authorities concerning juveniles occur in the daily cooperation between, primarily, the police and the social services. It would appear that some of the difficulties are due to the official secrets act.</p>
<h2>The social services shall be allowed to divulge information about juveniles to the police when crime prevention is the purpose</h2>
<p>We propose that confidentiality shall not prevent information about an individual younger than 18 years of age from being given to the police by an authority within the social services if there is a palpable risk that the youth is going to commit crimes and if it can be assumed that the information will contribute towards preventing this. If the information is asked for by the police, it is necessary that the social services, taking the other circumstances into account, find it appropriate to divulge the information.</p>
<p>It is our understanding that there should be some possibility for the social services, for the purposes of crime prevention, to divulge information to the police about minors who are at risk of turning to a life of crime. However, it must not be a question of putting the social services under any obligation to inform the police in situations where the social services do not consider this appropriate. Such a breach of confidentiality should be as limited as possible, and there must be scope for taking the integrity of the individual into account when divulging information is considered. The scope for divulging information from the social services as a result of the proposal will be fairly restricted.</p>
<p>The information that the police mainly require is, for example, where the juvenile is staying. With the help of such information, the police are to be able to contact the juvenile and keep him or her under observation. As for information about the juvenile’s family and circle of acquaintances, however, it should not be possible to divulge anything other than harmless information.</p>
<h2>The social services shall be able to give information to the police about juveniles when immediate police intervention is deemed necessary.</h2>
<p>We propose that secrecy shall not prevent the staff of the social services from divulging information to the police that is required for immediate police intervention if someone who can be presumed to be younger than 18 years of age is encountered by the staff of the social services:</p>
<p>• under circumstances that clearly entail an immediate risk for his or her health or development or</p>
<p>• while perpetrating a crime</p>
<p>At the present time uncertainty prevails as to whether the staff of the social services are entitled to divulge information to the police to ensure immediate police intervention without thus finding themselves guilty of a violation of confidentiality. This is unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>The powers of the police are greater than those of the social services when it comes to immediately taking a young person into custody. In the course of the work of the social services with young people, situations can arise when a brief period of time in custody is needed to ensure that the young person is brought under the supervision of an adult, but where the social services lack the powers to use compulsion when intervening. In such cases there are reasons for the confidentiality of the social services to be breached so that it is clear that the social services can divulge information to the police in order to enable them to take the juvenile into custody. The purpose behind such a breach of confidentiality is to make it more possible to quickly give young people found in unsuitable situations the protection and supervision they need.</p>
<p>Given the requirement that minors should be encountered in circumstances that clearly entail immediate and severe risk to their health or development, there can be no question of calling in the police unless the case is a serious one. The age of the young person naturally affects the evaluation of the seriousness of the situation.</p>
<p>In a situation where a minor is found perpetrating a crime, we do not consider that any particular demands should be made as to the type of crime in question or its punitive value. What is decisive in such a case is not achieving an intervention under criminal law, but enabling a social preventive measure to be taken. Even less serious crimes should therefore also result in the social services calling the police and divulging information to the police that would enable them to intervene.</p>
<h2>The social services should be able to divulge information to the police about juveniles being supplied with narcotics or alcoholic beverages</h2>
<p>We propose that secrecy within the social services shall not prevent information being conveyed to the office of the public prosecutor or the police authority concerning suspicions that narcotics, as defined by the narcotics act (1968:64) are being supplied to a person below the age of 18 years. The same shall apply to suspicions of illegally selling and procuring alcoholic beverages as defined by the alcohol act (1994:1738) to a person below the age of 18 years, when the case is not a trivial one.</p>
<p>In the case of children and young people, the social welfare board has a duty, among other things, to work actively to prevent and counteract the misuse of alcoholic beverages and other intoxicating substances or addictive substances as well as doping substances.</p>
<p>It is our understanding that the secrecy regulations should not result in a prohibition against divulging suspicions about crimes or the supply of narcotics to persons younger than 18 years of age. This applies irrespective of how the information has come to the attention of the social services. Such a standpoint is in general agreement with the priorities of the narcotics policies that have been drawn up in the national plan of action for narcotics.</p>
<p>In addition, it is important to take decisive action against the selling of alcoholic drinks to, and acquiring them on behalf of, people younger than 18 years of age. Even the suspicion of such criminality should therefore, according to our understanding, bring about an exception from confidentiality so that it is possible to reveal when it is suspected that alcoholic beverages are being sold or supplied to persons younger than 18 years of age. In order that this violation of confidentiality does not take place when actions do not incur criminal penalties, it must be required that it is not a question of trivial cases.</p>
<h2>Obligations of professional secrecy that contravene the right of communication (chapters 16 and 17)</h2>
<h2>The criteria for deciding whether or not an obligation of professional secrecy contravenes the right of communication</h2>
<p>It is our assessment that the reasons for the judgement that has been previously made as to whether an obligation of professional secrecy contravenes the right of communication are still valid. The right of communication is the principal rule and the granting of any exemptions from that rule should be done restrictively. We wish to emphasise that the need to grant information protection must always be weighed against the need for transparency when judging if the right of communication is to be infringed. Any possible exceptions to the right of communication must be easy to interpret.</p>
<p>The purpose behind the reform of the right of communication during the 1970’s was to make it easier for the mass media to have as accurate a basis as possible for their scrutiny of the authorities. The regulations concerning the right of communication are designed to counteract the effects of regulations concerning secrecy.</p>
<p>Factors that argue for the right of communication having priority over an obligation of professional secrecy are: that it concerns the exercise of authority against an individual; that the right of communication previously applied and that the prohibition against subsequent enquiries and the protection of anonymity should be as comprehensive as possible. Among the factors that argue for a limitation of the right of communication are: that it concerns a voluntary contract with an authority; that it is a situation in which confidence has been entrusted to someone; or that transparency can be satisfied in some other manner.</p>
<p>Our review of the factors that argue for and against the right of communication should naturally not be perceived as a checklist. The decisive factor is the result of weighing the need of transparency against the need to protect information. A particular piece of information might match most of the criteria of the factors against the right of communication, but nonetheless not be suitable as an exception from the right of communication because the need for transparency is particularly strong, for example.</p>
<h2>The current regulations concerning obligations of professional secrecy that contravene the right of communication should not be changed</h2>
<p>In our judgement no reasons have been produced to justify a general review for the purpose of extending or limiting the right of communication. We do not propose any changes concerning which obligations of professional secrecy are entitled to contravene the right of communication. However, we do propose linguistic and editorial changes in the regulations of the official secrets act concerning which obligations of professional secrecy contravene the right of communication. The purpose is to make it easier to put into practice.</p>
<p>During the course of our work we have discussed the extent of the right of communication in several specific cases. These were: secrecy in matters concerning industrial welfare and safety; secrecy as part of a preliminary investigation and secrecy in matters where procurements were being made. In addition we have considered whether the obligation of professional secrecy that applies according to the law on general monitoring with cameras (1998:150) and corresponding regulations in the official secrets act should be able to contravene obligations of professional secrecy. We have also discussed the right of communication for employees in private social services.</p>
<h2>Costs etc (chapter 18)</h2>
<p>Our proposal for a new official secrets act does not, in principal, entail any new obligations for the authorities. In our judgement the proposal simplifies the rules in a manner that in due course should facilitate the work of the authorities with respect to secrecy and the public domain. Consequently the proposal does not entail any increase in costs. During a transitional period however, the authorities will need to train their staff. There should be scope for the cost of this to be met by the authorities as from within their current appropriations.</p>
