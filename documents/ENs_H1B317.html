<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Our mandate</h2>
<p>Our overarching mandate was to consider measures to establish judicial procedure for criminal cases at both district courts and courts of appeal that is better suited to purpose, where it is possible to make further improvements to the quality and efficiency of prosecutions. Our task included considering:</p>
<p>• whether it is possible to improve and clarify the division of responsibility between prosecutor and court and also their roles and functions;</p>
<p>• whether it is possible to increase the parties’ influence over the procedure in criminal cases together with their responsibility for the case being moved towards a ruling;</p>
<p>• how it may be possible to improve the preparatory work in criminal cases, among other things with a view to producing more efficient means of handling proceedings and ensuring that the court has a complete information base for its adjudication;</p>
<p>• how, at both district courts and courts of appeal, it may be possible to better adapt the way in which criminal cases are dealt with in respect of the individual case, considering what is required to adjudicate on the substantive issue, e.g. by producing more flexible rules and alternative forms for adjudicating on cases before the court;</p>
<p>• how it may be possible to reduce the risk of hearings being cancelled;</p>
<p>• what the proper composition of the court ought to be in various situations;</p>
<p>• matters relating to support for the aggrieved party.</p>
<p>It is emphasised in our mandate that we should focus on how our proposed changes may have an impact in practice and also consider how to improve the effect of changes already made.</p>
<h2>General considerations</h2>
<p>The fundamental object of procedure in criminal cases is that accusations of crime are adjudicated within a reasonable timeframe applying a high level of quality. Our overarching objective was to propose changes whereby the procedure would be better for the individuals involved. We believe that a basic precondition for achieving this is to reinforce the influence of the parties by them expressing the positions they have adopted more clearly and also by attributing these positions greater importance in terms of how the case is dealt with. The procedure can then be adapted to the requirements of the case, so that the procedure becomes better suited to purpose. Considering this overarching objective, we have based our proposals on the following points of departure:</p>
<p>• Clearer roles in procedure.  The provisions of the Code of Judicial Procedure governing the roles assumed by the various parties and actors in the procedure are to some extent unclear. The judge’s role in leading the proceedings and the standing of the prosecutor and the accused as parties in the criminal case should be made clearer. The aggrieved party should have good opportunities as a party to have their claim for damages considered in conjunction with the prosecution.</p>
<p>• Handling cases according to need.  There ought to be different ways and forms for handling and adjudicating cases, adapted to the requirements of the case. The positions of the parties and the gravity of the act to which the prosecution relates should be paramount at the district court. Reviews at the court of appeal should be arranged so that the court examines all of the rulings appealed against based on the positions adopted by the parties. However, not all of the cases that are reviewed on appeal call for an adjudication involving a comprehensive review of the entire case.</p>
<p>• Predictable proceedings with early intervention.  The subject of the criminal case should be clear. The matters to be adjudicated by the court ought to be set out in clear and precise applications when the case is instituted. The information base required to specify or adopt a position on these applications (e.g. personal case studies and information about private claims) should to a greater extent be produced earlier. The accused ought to be urged to state the position that he or she is adopting on all allegations when the proceedings are started. This request should be formulated in a way that makes it easy for the individual to understand what he or she needs to adopt a position on.</p>
<p>• Greater responsibility for the parties.  Society should be able to require a person, who is the subject of a crime investigation and who has been informed that he or she is suspected of having committed an offence, to participate in the procedure applied, e.g. by attending questionings, personal case studies with the probation service and appearing at main hearings. He or she then needs to be informed about how the matter will be dealt with. If a party chooses to appeal to the court of appeal, a requirement may be imposed on them to clearly state what the court of appeal is to consider on appeal.</p>
<p>• A holistic approach to the legal chain.  The way in which matters are dealt with – from reporting the crime to the police to a court adjudicating on the issue of the liability for an offence – ought to be perceived as comprising one cohesive process. The authorities within the legal system and the courts have a shared responsibility to work to ensure that cases can be adjudicated within a reasonable timeframe. This includes a shared responsibility to keep individuals informed about the procedure and how individuals are expected to participate in the procedure applied.</p>
<p>• Consistent implementation that has been well thought out.  The way in which the provisions on procedure in criminal cases are formulated is only one of several key factors for improving the legal process. The manner in which the provisions are applied is also crucial. This requires changes to be well prepared and for there to be practical tools (e.g. in the form of operational support) to facilitate their  day-to-day  application.</p>
<h2>The division of roles between parties and actors in the procedure The accused</h2>
<p>There ought to be an improvement in the information communicated to the accused about the procedure in criminal cases. The accused ought to receive continuous information from the police, the Swedish Prosecution Authority, the Prison and Probation Service and the court about what is going to happen in the course of the proceedings and what is expected of him or her. It ought to then also be possible to impose more stringent requirements on the accused to participate in the procedure applied.</p>
<p>The accused ought to have better opportunities to assess his or her situation and prepare the defence by being provided with information – no later than when the prosecution is instituted – about the ensuing consequences of the criminal charge in the event of being found to have committed the offence. There ought to be better opportunities for legal assistance in conjunction with the prosecution being instituted.</p>
<p>A person prosecuted for a crime, for which the prosecutor requests a sanction that is more stringent than a fine, should as a step in his or her defence be entitled to free counselling with an advocate (Sw. advokat ) for a maximum of two hours. The suspect ought to have been notified in the course of the preliminary investigation of the opportunity to receive legal advice, but written information should also be provided when the prosecution papers are served. This proposal does not affect the provisions on public defence counsel. If defence counsel is appointed, they should provide such advice as a matter of course within the framework of their defence assignment.</p>
<p>The person being prosecuted should be able to personally choose the advocate to whom he or she wishes to refer for advice. The person who provided advice may request compensation at the court where the case is pending for work done and any interpretation and translation costs.</p>
<h2>The judge</h2>
<p>The judge has a responsibility for leading the procedure applied and for the case being adjudicated in a way that is both legally secure and suited to purpose.</p>
<p>The judge should actively work to ensure that nothing is unnecessarily drawn into the case and should try to clearly establish the positions adopted by the parties in order to rectify any ambiguities and omissions in the investigation presented. One measure towards achieving this includes making the role of the judge in respect of the preparatory work clear.</p>
<p>The judge should not act on their own volition to ensure the completion of the investigation into the issue of liability. A requirement should be introduced for an application to be first made by a party before the court may order the prosecutor to complete the preliminary investigation. The court should not be able to gather evidence on its own volition regarding the issue of liability. On the other hand the court should retain the ultimate responsibility for there being sufficient material to adjudicate the issue of sanction.</p>
<h2>The prosecutor</h2>
<p>The prosecutor should assume full responsibility for representing the State in actions relating to criminal liability.</p>
<p>The prosecutor should present an application concerning sanction in all cases. The court should not be able to impose a more stringent penalty or a more restrictive sanction on the accused than requested by the prosecutor. Nor should the court be able to order forfeiture of the grant of conditional release that is more restrictive for the accused than requested by the prosecutor.</p>
<p>The application concerning sanction must always be stated in the prosecution papers. If the prosecutor considers that the application concerning sanction might be amended for a particular reason (e.g. because the investigation into the accused's personal circumstances ought to be supplemented), the prosecutor may state this. Where there is reason to do so, it should be possible to amend the application while the case is being processed at the district court. It should be noted that it is the prosecutor’s final application that the court should not be able to go beyond.</p>
<p>As a main rule, at the court of appeal and the Supreme Court, the prosecutor should not be able to adopt a more severe stance when amending their application concerning sanction.</p>
<p>The court should not be able to make a decision on the special legal effect of a crime without there being an application. However, an exception is made in respect of those charges that should be imposed under Section 1 of the Crime Victim Fund Act (1994:419). Nor should it be possible for the court to go beyond what has been requested in such a matter, e.g. cannot order deportation for a longer period than as requested by the prosecutor. The prosecution papers should specify any applications for special legal effect that are presented. It should be possible to amend the applications in the same way as the application concerning sanction.</p>
<h2>The aggrieved party</h2>
<p>It should be possible for the aggrieved party to bring proceedings relating to criminal liability if the prosecutor does not institute a prosecution, discontinues a prosecution or chooses not to appeal when a prosecution is rejected. However, when the prosecutor brings an action concerning criminal liability, the prosecutor should be solely responsible for this action. The provision entitling the aggrieved party to assist with the prosecutor’s prosecution should be revoked. The aggrieved party should have good opportunities to have their claim for damages considered in conjunction with the criminal case. Furthermore, there ought to be improved opportunities for transparency in the procedure for the aggrieved party. We consequently present the following proposals:</p>
<p>• Following ‘final service' of the papers on the suspect and his or her defence counsel under Chapter 23, Section 18 of the Code of Judicial Procedure, an aggrieved party should be entitled upon request to be informed about such details from the preliminary investigation that are relevant to the aggrieved party's action for a private claim. It should be possible in certain cases to limit the right to receive information subject to  ‘preliminary-investigation secrecy’.</p>
<p>• As a main rule, the aggrieved party should be entitled to attend the main hearing before they are heard even if the aggrieved party does not bring an action in the case. The same should apply if the main hearing is held behind closed doors ( in camera ).</p>
<p>We will introduce provisions clarifying that an aggrieved party, who is bringing an action for a private claim, may ask all of the questions that are relevant to enable the aggrieved party to protect their rights.</p>
<h2>Procedure at the district court Procedure in criminal cases that is adapted to need</h2>
<p>We propose that it should be possible to hear cases at the district court in different ways depending on the severity of the sanction requested by the prosecutor and the position adopted by the accused in relation to the prosecution. We therefore propose that different rules should apply to: 1. Cases in which the prosecutor requests that the sanction should be set as a fine. As a main rule, the prosecutor should issue a summary penalty order in these cases, regardless of the position adopted by the suspect regarding the criminal charge. The preparation of the case is to be simplified, e.g. a prosecution is instituted by submitting a summary penalty order to the court that has not been approved (see further below under  Cases involving fines ). 2. Cases in which the prosecutor requests a sanction corresponding to no more than six months imprisonment. Further delimitations are proposed if the prosecutor requests a sanction other than imprisonment. It should be possible to adjudicate these cases by applying a special procedure without a main hearing provided the accused admits to the acts to which the prosecution relates, approves of all applications being presented in conjunction with the prosecution and consents to the case being ruled on in this way. The court should check that the preconditions for the procedure have been satisfied and that there are no special reasons that call for a main hearing (see also below under  Special procedure in cases where the commission of the offence has been admitted ). 3. Cases in which the prosecutor requests imprisonment for more than six months, certain other sanctions and cases where the accused is under the age of 18. The ruling in these cases should always be made following a main hearing. Rulings in other cases should also, if requested, be made following a main hearing. We propose measures for these cases that are aimed at producing a procedure that is better suited to purpose combined with better preparation (see below under  Cases involving main hearings ).</p>
<h2>More efficient institution of proceedings New provisions on how to institute public prosecutions</h2>
<p>Prosecutions are to be instituted by submitting the prosecution papers to the court in all cases where the prosecutor has not issued a summary penalty order. The prosecutor should simultaneously send or present the prosecution papers to the accused and order him or her to respond to the prosecution and the consequent applications presented. The accused should be urged to respond to the court no later than by a certain date. This means that a criminal case where the prosecutor institutes a prosecution should no longer be initiated by the court issuing a summons.</p>
<p>The accused should receive further information depending on how the case is to be adjudicated. If the prosecutor considers that the case could be adjudicated by applying the special procedure, the accused should be urged to state whether he or she consents to such procedure being applied.</p>
<p>It is important that the written material sent to the accused is worded so that it is easy to understand and that the accused can easily provide the information requested.</p>
<p>The purpose of ordering the accused to respond to the prosecution and the applications presented is to have early clarification of the positions adopted by him or her on the issues in question and to investigate whether there are opportunities to deal with the case in a simplified way. The accused, who is entitled to be passive, is not adversely affected by any sanction if he or she does not respond.</p>
<h2>Personal case studies</h2>
<p>When a statement is required under Section 1 of the Criminal Proceedings (Special Personal Case Study) Act (1991:2041) to provide the prosecutor with an information base for their sanction application, the prosecutor should get this from the Prison and Probation Service before the prosecution is instituted.</p>
<p>The personal case studies should be further adapted to the requirements of the individual case. The Prison and Probation Service should submit a statement to the prosecutor within a shorter period than currently applies, following a less extensive investigation. This statement should state whether the Prison and Probation Service considers that a more extensive investigation is required. In that case the court may decide to supplement the investigation following institution of the prosecution.</p>
<h2>Service</h2>
<p>It should be permissible to use simplified service for serving the prosecution and other documents on the accused, as far as practicable. Authorities within the legal system have a shared responsebility to ensure that this can be done. This implies that the person suspected of the crime ought to be kept continuously informed and reminded about the matter when he or she has contact with the police, the Swedish Prosecution Authority or the Prison and Probation Service.</p>
<p>It should be possible for the prosecutor or court to utilise this means of service if the accused has been informed at a personal meeting that simplified service may be used by the prosecutor or district court and where it would not be inappropriate considering the circumstances of the case. No statutory time limit will be set concerning the length of time that may elapse after the accused was informed that simplified service might be used.</p>
<h2>A special procedure in cases where the commission of the offence has been admitted</h2>
<p>Under certain conditions it ought to be possible for a simplified procedure without a main hearing to be used at court to adjudicate cases concerning a public prosecution in respect of acts that have been admitted by the accused to the court. The court should convene a main hearing if the case cannot be adjudicated in this way.</p>
<p>It should only be possible to apply the special procedure if the accused has attained the age of 18 and neither the prosecutor nor the accused has requested a main hearing. The scope of application is otherwise determined by the prosecutor’s application concerning sanction.</p>
<p>It should not  be possible to adjudicate the case by applying the special procedure if the prosecutor has requested that the sanction should be set as:</p>
<p>• imprisonment for more than six months,</p>
<p>• a conditional sentence or probation if an ‘alternative penalty’ that exceeds six months imprisonment is to be provided in the final judgment,</p>
<p>• probation combined with imprisonment,</p>
<p>• institutional care of young persons, or</p>
<p>• forensic psychiatric care.</p>
<p>Restrictions are also imposed on the extent to which a grant of conditional release from a prison sentence may be forfeited. The implication of this is that the aggregate length of the penalty may not exceed six months imprisonment for it to be possible for the case to be adjudicated by applying the special procedure.</p>
<p>The prosecution should specify whether the prosecutor considers that the case could be adjudicated by applying the special procedure. The accused should receive information about his or her opportunities to receive the advice of an advocate and should be urged by the prosecutor to respond to the prosecution at the court and also state whether he or she consents to the case being adjudicated by applying the special procedure without a main hearing.</p>
<p>If the accused submits a response to the court, the court may adjudicate the case by applying the special procedure if the accused:</p>
<p>• has been informed about his or her right to receive the advice of an advocate,</p>
<p>• admits the act or acts to the court,</p>
<p>• accepts the sanction requested by the prosecutor and the other applications presented in conjunction with the prosecution (e.g. private claims), and</p>
<p>• consents to the case being adjudicated in this way.</p>
<p>The court should check that the preconditions for the procedure have been satisfied and that there are no special reasons requiring a main hearing to be held. Examples of such situations include when the accused’s admission is ambiguous or the court considers that a further investigation is required concerning the accused’s personal situation or health status. Other examples are when the court considers that, in the light of judicial practice, the application concerning sanction is manifestly too stringent or the title of the offence is incorrect.</p>
<p>Cases applying the special procedure should be adjudicated by a legally qualified judge, and a simplified form of judgment may be issued. An appeal may be made against the judgment in accordance with the normal rules.</p>
<p>The provision enabling the prosecutor to issue a summary penalty order relating to a conditional sentence should be revoked as a result of the introduction of a special procedure for cases where the commission of the offence has been admitted.</p>
<h2>Cases involving fines</h2>
<p>A prosecutor should issue a summary penalty order in respect of a fine irrespective of the position adopted by the suspect. As a main rule, the prosecution should be instituted by submission of the summary penalty order to the court in the event that the summary penalty order is not approved. The summary penalty order should consequently contain the information that needs to be included for the prosecution.</p>
<p>In conjunction with a summary penalty order being issued for approval within a fixed period, the suspect should be afforded an opportunity to, in the event that the order is not approved, respond in writing to the prosecution, state the evidence to be adduced, conclude the action and express his or her views on the issue of whether the case may be adjudicated by the court without a main hearing. The response from the suspect should be sent to the prosecutor. The prosecutor should submit any response to the court simultaneously with the prosecution being instituted.</p>
<p>Cases concerning offences involving fines for which the commission of the offence has been admitted to the court may be dealt with in accordance with the special procedure for cases where the commission of the offence has been admitted. It should be possible at the district court to adjudicate other cases, with or without a main hearing, in the same way as today.</p>
<p>By way of clarification, a provision will be introduced clarifying what constitutes material included within the proceedings when a criminal case is adjudicated without main hearing. This should state that records or notes from the preliminary investigation may only form the basis of the adjudication to the extent that the information has been adduced by either of the parties.</p>
<h2>Cases involving main hearings Joint processing of prosecutions and part-judgments, etc.</h2>
<p>The court should assume clearer responsibility for assessing whether several prosecutions or charges are to be processed within the same trial and adjudicated at the same time. It is important to reduce the number and scope of major cases and to avoid any unnecessary delays in the adjudication of a prosecution because another case cannot be adjudicated at the same time.</p>
<p>These provisions are formulated so that the assessment of the court is based on what is appropriate and advantageous for the procedure. When making this assessment, the court should take particular account of whether there is a risk of joint processing leading to the trial becoming more extensive than necessary.</p>
<p>If a need arises when a case is being dealt with, it ought to be possible to separate prosecutions that are being processed jointly so that they can be processed separately. It ought to be possible to do this either by dealing with the prosecution as different cases or by issuing a part-judgment. The solution to be chosen is purely a practical issue. This therefore amends the current provision concerning when part-judgments may be issued in the case of several prosecutions against an accused. In such cases a part-judgment may be issued if this is advantageous for the processing of the case or there are otherwise special reasons to do so.</p>
<p>The possibility is introduced for the district court to refer a question of precedential interest in a criminal case to the Supreme Court, subject to the consent of the parties.</p>
<h2>Preparatory work</h2>
<p>In all cases, the requirement for applications presented being specified at the time the prosecution is instituted and the accused being ordered to respond to these applications improves the prospects of the positions adopted by the parties being established at an early stage. The requirement for the prosecutor to obtain a statement of views from the Prison and Probation Service where this is required increases the prospects of there being a sufficient information base regarding the accused’s personal circumstances at the time of adjudication. These measures ought to be sufficient for most cases. However, further preparatory work under the guidance of the court may be required in extensive and complicated cases. We present several proposals, the aim of which is to improve preparatory work for such cases:</p>
<p>• The responsibility of the court to make efforts to ensure that criminal cases are prepared so that they can be adjudicated in a way better suited to purpose and to actively provide material guidance regarding procedure in the course of the preparatory work should be expressly governed by statute.</p>
<p>• A rule should be introduced prescribing that preparatory meetings are to be held in cases that are, or are expected to become, extensive.</p>
<p>• An opportunity should be introduced for the court to hold preparatory meetings during the period between final serving of the preliminary investigation and institution of the prosecution.</p>
<p>• Provisions should be introduced clarifying that preparatory work may, when necessary, also be conducted through an exchange of correspondence or in some other way.</p>
<p>• The final deadline for when a main hearing is to start in a case where the accused is being detained or is under the age of 18 should be extended if a preparatory meeting needs to be held. An express provision will also be introduced stating that the main hearing may be initiated later – subject to the consent of the accused – if the investigation into his or her personal circumstances has not been completed.</p>
<h2>Simplified handling of prosecutions where the commission of the offence has been admitted</h2>
<p>It should be possible for individual charges to be dealt with in a simplified way when making a ruling following a main hearing, subject to the consent of the parties, provided the accused admits to the act after the prosecutor has presented their applications. The parties do not need to amplify on their actions and present evidence in the relevant respects if this is manifestly unnecessary considering the substance of the act and other circumstances. It should be a prerequisite here that the matter relates to an act that could have been adjudicated by applying the special procedure if the prosecution had just been related to that act.</p>
<h2>Adjudicating cases in the absence of the accused</h2>
<p>The opportunities to adjudicate a case when the accused has not attended the main hearing, despite having been served with a summons to attend, are to be extended. The provisions should also be made clearer. It is also a precondition according to the current provision that it is possible to conduct a satisfactory examination of the matter, irrespective of the prospective sanction. This will be amended so that the case is adjudicated unless there are special reasons not to do so.</p>
<p>The upper limit for the length of the prison sentence that may be imposed at hearings where the accused fails to appear is increased from three to six months. As regards sanctions other than imprisonment, we will introduce restrictions largely corresponding to those for the special procedure.</p>
<p>A ruling in a case may not be made in the absence of the accused if this involves setting the sanction as:</p>
<p>• imprisonment for more than six months</p>
<p>• a conditional sentence or probation in the event that an ‘alternative penalty’ that exceeds six months imprisonment is to be provided in the final judgment,</p>
<p>• probation combined with imprisonment, or</p>
<p>• institutional care of young persons.</p>
<p>If the matter involves forfeiting a grant of conditional release, the case cannot be adjudicated in the absence of the accused if there is any question of forfeiture for more than six months or if the time to be forfeited and the new prison sentence to be imposed jointly exceed six months. In situations where accused fails to appear, the request for sanction made by the prosecutor should also be decisive to the assessment.</p>
<h2>Cancelled hearings</h2>
<p>Cancelled hearings have negative consequences for both individuals and the legal system. Our proposal to amend the rules on service and increase the opportunities to adjudicate cases in the absence of the accused ought to result in a reduction in the number of main hearings that need to be cancelled. The same applies to our proposal to amend the part-judgment rules and clarify the provisions on when several prosecutions should be processed jointly. In addition to this, we propose clearer provisions on the sanctions and coercive measures that should be used by courts to ensure that main hearings are actually held.</p>
<p>Provided there is no lawful excuse for non-attendance, the court should judicially confirm the default fine set and, provided there are no special reasons not to do so, decide to collect the person who failed to appear if the case cannot be adjudicated without his or her presence. If the accused has not appeared and it is unlikely that it would be possible to collect him or her, the court should order that the accused be detained instead, provided the necessary conditions are met. The court should otherwise decide to summon the person who failed to appear to reattend on pain of a default fine.</p>
<p>It is important that active and ongoing work is conducted at courts to ensure that hearings do not need to be cancelled. This involves, among other things, using modern technology for reminders, addressing issues linked to action that can be taken to avoid main hearings being cancelled and working on reception and security issues.</p>
<h2>Main hearings held jointly with detention hearings</h2>
<p>A possibility will be introduced for holding a main hearing jointly with a detention hearing provided a prosecution is instituted no later than at the meeting and subject to the parties’ consent. In such cases, the suspect should be summoned to the main hearing in conjunction with the request for his or her appearance. We deal with this proposal in Section 9.5.3.</p>
<h2>Procedure at the court of appeal</h2>
<p>The main function of the court of appeal is to examine and review rulings made by district courts and correct any mistakes in such rulings. The parties control what the court of appeal should consider by appealing against and indicating in their appeals the issues in question in the district court ruling. Reviews at the court of appeal ought to be arranged so that cases appealed against are considered to the extent and in the forms required for the individual case. We make several proposals, the aim of which is to make the procedure at the court of appeal better suited to purpose, based on these points of departure:</p>
<p>• In addition to the current provisions, an appeal should also include information about which parts of the district court ruling are not at issue as well as a statement of views by the appellant concerning the processing of the case. While the case is being prepared, the court of appeal ought to ensure that the positions adopted by the parties are clarified.</p>
<p>• The system of leave to appeal should be extended to encompass all criminal cases. In this way, clear and unambiguous cases can be sifted out, i.e. where there are no doubts regarding the soundness of the district court ruling following the preliminary consideration of leave to appeal. Other cases should be adjudicated following a comprehensive review.</p>
<p>• The ‘credibility rule’ is further relaxed so that the court of appeal can base its evaluation in more cases on the evidence taken up at the district court.</p>
<p>• There are limited opportunities for prosecutors to amend the prosecution at the court of appeal and Supreme Court. The same applies to an aggrieved party bringing an action in respect of criminal liability at a superior court.</p>
<p>• The possibility for a court of appeal to adjudicate a case without a main hearing will be extended. The basic prerequisites for cases that can be adjudicated on the basis of documents at the court of appeal correspond with when it would, according to our proposal, be possible to adjudicate a case in the event that the accused has failed to appear at the district court.</p>
<p>• An explicit rule should be introduced stating that the court of appeal must always consider whether it is appropriate for verbal evidence given at the district court to be adduced by reference to audio and video recordings of the questioning at the district court.</p>
<p>• A further exemption is made from the prohibition against  reformatio in pejus . This exemption means that the court of appeal may impose a more severe or more restrictive sanction than the sanction imposed by the district court if there is reason to set aside a conditional sentence or probation owing to the misconduct of the person sentenced.</p>
<h2>Composition of the court</h2>
<p>When deliberating on how the court ought to be composed, we have proceeded on the basis of what would lead to an adjudication that is best suited to purpose. This depends on the gravity of the offence in the case, the scope and nature of the case and also the instance at which the case is being adjudicated. In light of this we make the following proposals:</p>
<p>• As today, the district court should always be able to adjudicate a case with at least one legally qualified judge and three lay judges.</p>
<p>• It should be possible for one legally qualified judge to adjudicate on more kinds of cases at a main hearing at the district court. The limit for which cases can be adjudicated by one legally qualified judge corresponds to when the case could, according to our proposal, be adjudicated in the absence of the accused. This means, among other things, that this may occur in cases where the accused would not be sentenced to more than six months imprisonment in the event of a conviction. We also propose that it should be possible for one legally qualified judged to adjudicate certain special kinds of case or matter (such as, for example, matters relating to a prohibition on contact).</p>
<p>• It should be possible for three legally qualified judges to adjudicate a case at the district court if there are reasons to do so considering the scope or nature of the case, e.g. because the case involves difficult legal issues or is very extensive. Lay judges should not participate in such cases.</p>
<p>• Three legally qualified judges should adjudicate criminal cases at the court of appeal. The lay judge system should thus not be applied when adjudicating criminal cases at the court of appeal. If three legally qualified judges have adjudicated the case at the district court, four legally qualified judges should participate when the case is adjudicated at the court of appeal.</p>
<h2>Support for aggrieved parties and private claim handling that is better suited to purpose Private claims – improved support and handling that is better suited to purpose</h2>
<p>One of the key issues for people subjected to crime is to have their claim for damages or other private claim considered in a simple way at the criminal trial. There are currently inadequacies in the support received by aggrieved parties on matters relating to private claims and the way in which these claims are dealt with within the current procedure. Not all aggrieved parties receive the support that police and prosecutors should provide according to the applicable provisions. Actions are frequently instituted at a late stage and are not always sufficiently prepared. This impedes handling suited to purpose. In light of this we make the following proposals:</p>
<p>• We should clarify the responsibility of the police authorities to assist prosecutors in the preparation of private claims.</p>
<p>• The National Police Board should issue regulations on how individual claims are to be documented during the preliminary investigation in order to ensure homogenous handling.</p>
<p>• The Government ought to assign the National Police Board to take measures to improve the handling of private claims by the police and to monitor the work of the Swedish Prosecution Authority regarding these issues.</p>
<p>• By way of clarification, an express provision should be introduced stating that a prosecutor who does not undertake to bring an action in spite of a request from the aggrieved party should notify the aggrieved party of this by means of a decision supported by reasons.</p>
<p>• The division of responsibility between prosecutor and the aggrieved party counsel appointed should be clarified so that it is prescribed by statute that such counsel should always bring the aggrieved party’s actions for private claims if such a claim has been presented by the aggrieved party.</p>
<p>• It should be possible to institute an action for a private claim that is not brought by the prosecutor at the same time as the prosecution. In such a case, the action should be instituted by way of the prosecutor submitting, together with the prosecution, information concerning a claim that the aggrieved party presented in the course of the preliminary investigation or to the prosecutor. Provisions should in view of this also be introduced concerning how information required for the claim should be notified on time.</p>
<p>• A special provision relating to private claims instituted following the prosecution should be introduced to improve the prospects of being able to apply a means of handling suited to purpose. Such an action should only be dealt with jointly with the prosecution if it becomes apparent that this can be done without inconvenience or where there are otherwise special reasons to do so. If this is not the case, such claim should be split up and dealt with as a contentious civil case.</p>
<p>It has emerged that there may be practical problems in conjunction with the handling of one special kind of claim, namely claims for damages directed at the custodian of a young accused. We make the following proposals in respect of such claims for damages:</p>
<p>• It should be possible to institute an action against the custodian in the same way as an action against the accused. The provisions that we have proposed should apply to service of the prosecution, and orders to respond to it should also apply to the custodian. This means, among other things, that the custodian may be served by means of simplified service if he or she had been informed about this means of service beforehand.</p>
<p>• A provision should be introduced clarifying that a defendant other than the accused (e.g. a custodian when an action is brought against him or her) should also be summoned to attend the main hearing in a criminal case and reminded that an action for a private claim may be adjudicated in his or her absence.</p>
<h2>Support persons and aggrieved party counsel</h2>
<p>It is important that it is possible for aggrieved parties to (where necessary) receive the support that a support person and aggrieved party counsel can provide.</p>
<p>We propose that in some cases a support person who accompanies an aggrieved party to a trial should be able to receive compensation from public funds for the costs incurred.</p>
<p>We also make proposals that aim to ensure that individual aggrieved parties are provided with information about the possibility of having a support person with them and that staff within the legal system have sufficient knowledge about the function that a support person can fulfil under the Code of Judicial Procedure.</p>
<p>It is important that the resources of the legal system are directed at such cases and situations where the aggrieved party has a real need for aggrieved party counsel. It is particularly important to ensure that all aggrieved parties who need aggrieved party counsel should be able to get one. The trial modernisation reform (EMR Reform) has had a general effect on the support needs of aggrieved parties during trials at the court of appeal.</p>
<p>We propose that the appointment of aggrieved party counsel should cease following expiry of the period for appeals against a district court judgment. The appointment of aggrieved party counsel at a superior court should be re-examined if the aggrieved party so requests or there are otherwise special reasons to do so.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>Several of our proposals affect working arrangements within the legal system and require organisations to adapt to new or changed duties. It is consequently important that good preparations are made for the implementation of our proposed reform. The implementation work requires leadership and control as well as commitment on the part of managers at the authorities and courts within the legal system.</p>
<p>We propose that the Government appoints an Implementation Inquiry where the commissioner in charge of the Inquiry is assigned to draw up a plan for how the proposed reform can best be implemented. This assignment ought to also include coordinating and directing the implementation work of the authorities. The National Police Board, the Swedish Prosecution Authority, the Swedish National Economic Crimes Bureau, the Prison and Probation Service and the National Courts Administration ought to be directed to participate in the preparatory work. This ought to include determining the various preparatory stages – in the form of technical adaptation of operational support, discussions about the allocation of resources and staff, training and information activities, and also the production of documentation on administrative routines – that may be required and their deadline for implementation.</p>
<p>In addition, attention during the implementation work ought to be directed at practical issues relating to how it can best be ensured that the person being prosecuted can easily contact an advocate for advice. The Swedish Bar Association ought to be involved in this work, as well as the National Courts Administration.</p>
<p>The statutory amendments should enter into force on a date to be determined by the Government. As regards the requirement for leave to appeal, the older provisions will apply to appeals against judgments and decisions that have been issued before the new provisions enter into force.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>The primary consequence of our proposals is an improvement in the quality of the procedure. In general, the implementation of the proposals we make will not entail any increase in costs for the state. However, it is difficult to assess the financial consequences, which are based on estimates.</p>
<p>Our proposals will result in reduced costs for Swedish Courts and increased costs for the prosecutor service. Resources will need to be redistributed from the Swedish Courts to the prosecutor service as a consequence of duties being transferred from the courts to the prosecutors.</p>
<p>Aggrieved party counsel costs at the court of appeal will reduce within the legal aid appropriation while there will be additional costs to fund the remuneration of advocates providing advice for the accused. Fewer main hearings will also help to reduce legal assistance costs.</p>
<p>Costs in respect of cancelled hearings will reduce.</p>
<p>There will be training and readjustment costs for authorities applying the new rules. It may also be assumed that costs will arise for the Swedish Courts, the prosecutor service and the Prison and Probation Service to adapt their organisations to our proposals.</p>
