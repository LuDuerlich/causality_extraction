<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In 2012, vulnerable EU citizens began coming to Sweden in larger numbers than previously. Some came to beg and others came to pick berries or to look for work. Numbers rose sharply over the following three years. In spring 2014, the estimated number was 2 100 individuals. In April 2015, it was 5 000. The rise subsequently came to a halt and a slight drop has been recorded. In No- vember 2015, the number was estimated at around 4 700. Of these, the number of children is estimated at between 70 and 100.</p>
<p>In this report, ‘vulnerable EU citizens’ refers to individuals who are citizens of another EU country and who do not have a right of residence in Sweden. An individual who does not have a right of residence has far less chance of gaining access to welfare here. Put simply, to obtain the right of residence an individual must have a job or good prospects of finding a job. Determining who has a right of residence is often a complicated matter. The right of residence is explained in greater detail in section 2.1.</p>
<p>Over the last 100 years, Sweden has gone from being Europe’s poorest country to being one of its richest, and with one of the highest levels of welfare provision. When vulnerable EU citizens began begging on the streets and sleeping rough, Swedish society was unprepared. Municipalities and authorities alike sought guidance on how the issue of vulnerable EU citizens should be managed. The municipalities’ efforts for the group varied.</p>
<p>According to the Government’s terms of reference, the coordinator is responsible for promoting the exchange of experience and collaboration between relevant actors in Sweden, promoting contact between actors in Sweden and those in the vulnerable EU citizens’ home countries, and spreading knowledge about the rights of</p>
<p>EU citizens staying in Sweden without a right of residence.</p>
<p>Children – protective legislation and schooling</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the number of children of vulnerable EU citizens staying in Sweden is around one hundred. How Swedish society should deal with the issue of children has been the most difficult part of the coordinator’s task. This is because it concerns children belonging to an already vulnerable group. The coordinator’s starting point is that Swedish society should not act in a way that encourages children to be taken to Sweden unless their housing situation can be resolved in an acceptable manner.</p>
<p>Children of vulnerable EU citizens are regularly found in at least seven of Sweden’s municipalities. At times, a municipality’s actions have probably indirectly resulted in the presence of children of vulnerable EU citizens in that municipality. Municipalities and other stakeholders should have a carefully considered approach to dealing with the presence of children in the group.</p>
<p>Social protection legislation makes no distinction between children of vulnerable EU citizens and children of Swedish citizens. If a report of concern is received, the social services are always obliged to assess the child’s need for immediate protection. If intervention under the Care of Young Persons Act becomes necessary, international conventions must be taken into account; see more in section 2.2.1</p>
<p>Outreach work and emergency assistance</p>
<p>Outreach work in relation to vulnerable EU citizens is necessary to avert acute emergency situations for children or adults. This work should also include providing information about applicable regulations, including regulations about settlements. Outreach activities do not need to be carried out by the municipality itself; they could</p>
<p>take the form of effective collaboration, for example, with churches or associations that have the closest contact with the vulnerable EU citizens in the municipality in question. A person without a right of residence in Sweden may apply for social assistance to receive emergency help. Emergency assistance generally consists of food, travel home or emergency housing. An individual examination and assistance assessment must always be conducted before a decision is made to approve or reject an application for emergency assistance.</p>
<p>Section 2.2.2 contains more information about outreach activities and emergency assistance.</p>
<p>Health care</p>
<p>Most of the vulnerable EU citizens coming to Sweden and supporting themselves in street environments do not have a European Health Insurance Card. The basic assumption then is that they have to pay for their own health care costs. In April 2015, the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare published information on its website explaining that vulnerable EU citizens could also be covered by the Health and Medical Care Act without the necessary permits. However, a majority of county councils that the coordinator contacted report that they are restrictive and very rarely provide EU citizens with health care in accordance with that act. Section 2.3 contains more information about health care.</p>
<p>Evictions etc.</p>
<p>Sweden’s message should be clear. EU citizens are welcome here, but Swedish legislation will apply. Living in parks, other public spaces or on private land is prohibited. The same applies to littering and to relieving oneself in public. Section 2.4 outlines applicable laws that are relevant in these contexts. Since November 2015, the police has been applying the relevant laws more consistently throughout the country.</p>
<p>Civil society</p>
<p>The gap between what municipal social services have the right to offer and the needs of the group of vulnerable EU citizens has engendered significant volunteer involvement. Section 2.6 contains thoughts on how the public sector can support and encourage this involvement. Discussions have been held with the working group on the National Agreement in the social sphere. The National Agreement Office will be able to work to share experiences of nonprofit and public sector collaboration for vulnerable EU citizens.</p>
<p>Contact with the home countries</p>
<p>Giving money to a person who begs is likely to cement the role of the beggar and not lead to any long-term change for the group.</p>
<p>Children’s education is likely to suffer and the role of the beggar is likely to be passed down to the next generation.</p>
<p>By supporting the Swedish organisations conducting wellconsidered and long-term programmes in Romania and Bulgaria, Swedes can contribute to breaking the cycle of poverty and exclusion. Cooperation can be developed at national, regional and local level. Poverty eradication efforts should focus on education, livelihood and health issues, and on structural change.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 describes the work Swedish organisations are doing in the countries of origin.</p>
<p>Continued collaboration</p>
<p>The coordinator’s remit ends when this report is presented. However, the need for coordination remains. It is essential that forms of cooperation between the public sector and civil society are developed.</p>
<p>The future handling of this issue should be incorporated into existing social structures. Regional cooperation will continue to be very important. The county administrative boards should therefore be tasked with coordinating efforts for vulnerable EU citizens. In each region, the county administrative board should build and maintain a general picture of the situation, encourage effective co-</p>
<p>operation between stakeholders and be responsible for the dissemination of knowledge and best practice.</p>
<p>The Stockholm County Administrative Board should be given a more general responsibility for putting the regional pictures together into a national picture of the situation. This task should include:</p>
<p> continuous sharing of information with the other county administrative boards for further sharing in each region/county;</p>
<p> establishing an advisory function to support municipalities in their efforts for vulnerable EU citizens and especially for children;</p>
<p> promoting and facilitating collaboration between various actors, including the police, the enforcement authority and the country’s municipalities;</p>
<p> following the legal situation regarding the right of residence, case processing and assessment of children of vulnerable EU citizens, emergency assistance, and rules and procedures for evictions etc.; and spreading this knowledge to other county administrative boards and others. Section 2.9 contains more information about this.</p>
