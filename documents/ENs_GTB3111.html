<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Terms of reference</h2>
<p>According to its terms of reference, the Committee on Parental Responsibility and Protection of Children in International Situations was to present proposals for Swedish ratification of the Convention concluded on 19 October 1996 on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation in Respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures for the Protection of Children (the 1996 Hague Convention).</p>
<p>The terms of reference of the Committee includes taking a position on how the Convention should be implemented with Swedish law and on whether Sweden should make any reservation. The Committee is to propose statutory amendments. The Committee is also to illustrate similarities and differences between the 1996 Hague Convention and Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000 (the Brussels II Regulation).</p>
<p>The terms of reference also includes presenting proposals for what authority should be appointed as the central authority in relation to the 1996 Hague Convention and the Brussels II Regulation and what tasks should be handled by the central authority or by other authorities or bodies.</p>
<p>In addition, one particular question for the Committee is to consider whether it is appropriate for certain provisions of the 1996 Hague Convention to also be set out in generally applicable laws. This applies, for instance, to the rules for guardianship and the special jurisdiction rule that applies to wrongful removal or retention of children. If, during the course of its work, the Committee should conclude that some related matter of international family law ought to be taken up, the Committee is free to do so.</p>
<h2>Implementation of the 1996 Hague Convention</h2>
<p>As some of the questions covered by the 1996 Hague Convention are regulated in the Brussels II Regulation, European Union (EU) Member States are currently unable to accede to the Convention on their own. However, the EU intends to take a decision that will authorise Member States to ratify the Convention and also expects Member States to do so. The Committee proposes that Sweden ratifies the 1996 Hague Convention as soon as the EU authorises Member States to do so. The Committee also proposes that the Convention should be implemented with Swedish law through incorporation, which means that the provisions of the Convention will have the force of law in Sweden. This proposal does not, however, include the Convention’s final clauses – the Committee’s assessment is that these clauses need not be implemented with Swedish law. In addition, the Committee proposes some supplementary provisions to the Convention to enable Swedish authorities to apply the Convention.</p>
<h2>The 1996 Hague Convention and proposed supplementary provisions</h2>
<p>Scope</p>
<p>One of the purposes of the 1996 Hague Convention is to improve the protection of children in international situations. To achieve this purpose the Convention contains provisions that regulate which state’s authorities have jurisdiction  to take measures and provisions on which state’s law  is applicable in different situations. The question of recognition  of decisions taken by competent authorities of the Contracting States is regulated, as are the conditions for the enforcement  of a decision taken in another state. The Convention also contains provisions on cooperation  between authorities in different states.</p>
<p>The 1996 Hague Convention is applicable to questions of parental responsibility and measures for the protection of children up to 18 years of age. Parental responsibility  refers to parental authority or any analogous relationship determining the rights, powers and responsibilities of parents, guardians or other legal representatives in relation to the person or the property of the child. The Convention refers to both civil and public measures for the protection of children. These measures can thus concern rights of custody, rights of access, guardianship and curatorship as well as questions concerning the placing of the child in a foster family or in institutional care, supervision by a public authority of the care of a child and the administration of the child’s property. It does not, however, cover questions like paternity, adoption, the name of the child or maintenance obligations.</p>
<p>Relationship to other international instruments and to autonomous law</p>
<p>In several respects, the questions covered by the 1996 Hague Convention are already regulated in other international instruments. One of these is the above-mentioned Brussels II Regulation, which is applicable to civil matters of parental responsibility. The Brussels II Regulation takes precedence over the 1996 Hague Convention in cases where the child is habitually resident in a state that applies the Brussels II Regulation (i.e. in EU Member States except Denmark) or concerning the enforcement of a decision taken by a competent authority of an EU Member State. As regards other international agreements, the general rule is that their application is not affected by the 1996 Hague Convention and the Convention itself states specifically that it does not affect the application of the Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (the 1980 Hague Convention).</p>
<p>However, in the event of Swedish ratification of the 1996 Hague Convention, its provisions should take precedence to autonomous Swedish law (i.e. the generally applicable laws that are in force when no EU legislation or other convention-based legislation is applicable). This is reflected in the legislation proposed by the Committee.</p>
<p>Jurisdiction under the 1996 Hague Convention</p>
<p>The 1996 Hague Convention regulates the international jurisdiction of authorities in matters of parental responsibility.</p>
<p>Except as otherwise provided by the Brussels II Regulation, the provisions of the Convention give Swedish authorities international jurisdiction when a child is habitually resident in Sweden  and in relation to children in Sweden whose habitual residence cannot be established or children who are refugees or internationally displaced.  In addition, the Convention gives Swedish authorities jurisdiction in relation to children who are present in Sweden (or in relation to the property of children in Sweden) in urgent cases  or in respect of territorial measures  that only have effect in Sweden. Measures in urgent cases and territorial measures can subsequently be replaced by measures taken by the authorities that normally have jurisdiction. The Committee proposes the introduction of a legal provision on a reserve forum for the social welfare committee in cases where there is Swedish jurisdiction under the 1996 Hague Convention but no social welfare committee has jurisdiction under Swedish rules on local jurisdiction. Apart from this, the Committee considers that no supplementary legal provisions or amendments are required to make it possible to follow the mentioned jurisdiction rules.</p>
<p>The 1996 Hague Convention also contains a provision concerning jurisdiction in cases of wrongful removal or retention of a child . The authorities of a state in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention keep their jurisdiction until the child has acquired habitual residence in another state. Until then the authorities of the ”refuge state” only have jurisdiction in urgent cases. This provision can be seen as a complement to the rules of the 1980 Hague Convention, which deal specifically with wrongfully removed or retained children, and does not require any supplementary provision for its application.</p>
<p>There is in-built flexibility in the 1996 Hague Convention to enable international jurisdiction to be assessed on the basis of the best interests of the individual child. According to the Convention, in a specific case it is possible for the authorities of two Contracting States to agree which state’s authorities shall exercise jurisdiction  having regard to the best interests of the child. A competent authority can also invite the parties to introduce a request on jurisdiction before the authorities of another State.</p>
<p>However, the possibility of ”transferring” jurisdiction is only to be used exceptionally and will only be considered if the authorities of both countries agree that it is in the best interests of the child. The child must also have some connection with the state whose authorities did not originally have jurisdiction. Certain supplementary provisions are needed to enable Swedish authorities to handle these provisions of the Convention. The Committee therefore proposes that as a general rule the competent Swedish authority must communicate its intention to request or admit the transferring of jurisdiction. The Committee also proposes that, as a general rule, a written procedure must be followed but that an oral procedure may be considered in certain cases, such as if it would benefit the individual case. In addition, the Committee proposes that a matter concerning a request of transferring jurisdiction may be decided in the county administrative court by one judge without a board of lay judges (this is also proposed in relation to the corresponding provision of the Brussels II Regulation on the transfer of jurisdiction). The Committee also proposes that a decision in a matter concerning a request shall be final and nonappealable. With respect to the question of appeals, Finland and Denmark are considering introducing some form of right of appeal, while other countries such as the Netherlands, Hungary and Slovakia have not chosen to allow appeals against such a decision. Considering, in particular, that this provision is only to be used exceptionally and that the Swedish and foreign competent authority must agree on the matter, the Committee takes the view that the disadvantages of permitting appeals weigh more heavily than any advantages. The disadvantages that are particularly pronounced are the delay that an appeal option inevitably leads to and the fact that an appeal option in this question provides further scope for parents to have disputes about their child, which, in the view of the Committee, cannot be regarded as being either to the benefit of the child or in the best interests of the child.</p>
<p>It is common for questions of parental responsibility to come up in matrimonial matters  and the Convention’s provisions on jurisdiction also open up a possibility of determining these questions in connection with such a case. The competent authorities of a Contracting State that exercise jurisdiction in a matrimonial matter may determine a question of parental responsibility if, for instance, one of the parents has his or her habitual residence in the state in which the matrimonial matter is being determined and it is in the best interests of the child to determine the question in that connection. This provision does not require any supplementary legal provisions.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be mentioned that the Convention contains a “lis pendens” provision  which means that Swedish authorities – even if they would have jurisdiction according to the Convention – shall refrain from exercising their jurisdiction if corresponding measures have been requested and are still being considered in another Contracting State, which had jurisdiction at the point in time when the request was made. The competent authority that has been “called in” first can, however, abstain from exercising its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>As has been indicated above, the provisions of the 1996 Hague Convention, as well as some of the provisions of the Brussels II Regulation, are applicable in certain respects to all children and thus even if a child is a citizen of a state that has not acceded to the 1996 Hague Convention. However, the relationship to the Brussels II Regulation is such that the Brussels II Regulation shall take precedence over the 1996 Hague Convention within the scope of the Regulation (i.e. in principle in civil matters when the child is habitually resident in the EU except for Denmark). In the great majority of cases this does not give rise to any problems as the grounds for jurisdiction in the Brussels II Regulation and the 1996 Hague Convention are largely in agreement.</p>
<p>Applicable law under the 1996 Hague Convention</p>
<p>Unlike the Brussels II Regulation, the 1996 Hague Convention contains provisions on which country’s law is to be applied in deciding matters of parental responsibility.</p>
<p>Under the general rule in the 1996 Hague Convention, Swedish authorities shall in the first place apply Swedish law in exercising their jurisdiction  under the provisions of the Convention. However, the law of another state may, exceptionally, be taken into account or applied.</p>
<p>With respect to  parental responsibility by operation of the law (“ex lege”) or in similar cases, the Convention provides that the law of the state in which the child is habitually resident shall be applied. If the child is habitually resident in Sweden this means that both parents are custodians of the child if the parents are married to one another. If the child changes its habitual residence the previous parental responsibility subsists at the same time as parental responsibility can be attributed to a new person if this follows from the law of the new state of habitual residence. This is of particular importance for a married couple with children when only the father has parental responsibility by operation of the law in the child’s previous state of habitual residence. When the child acquires a new habitual residence in Sweden the mother also acquires custody of the children, as this follows from Swedish law. The Committee proposes that the Convention’s regulation of “ex lege” situations shall also be applicable in relation to children who acquired habitual residence in Sweden before the Convention entered into force in Sweden.</p>
<p>Under the 1996 Hague Convention, the actual exercise  of parental responsibility, i.e. what a custodian of a child shall and may do, is governed by the law of the child’s state of habitual residence. This is of importance concerning children that are in Sweden temporarily, for example.</p>
<p>The Convention also contains provisions on the validity of a transaction  between a child’s representative and a third party. This gives some protection to a third party acting in good faith in cases where the child’s representative is competent under the law of the state in which the transaction was concluded but is not competent under the law designated as primary according to the provisions of the chapter on applicable law.</p>
<p>If the application of the law designated by the 1996 Hague Convention would be manifestly contrary to the Swedish legal order, i.e. would be contrary to public policy  having regard to the best interests of the child, application of the law referred to by the Convention can be refused.</p>
<p>The provisions on the applicable law of the Convention do not require any supplementary provisions in Swedish law, but the provision on the attribution and extinction of parental responsibility should necessitate extensive dissemination of information.</p>
<p>Recognition and enforcement under the 1996 Hague Convention</p>
<p>A measure that has been taken in a Member State of the EU (with the exception of Denmark) shall be recognised and declared enforceable in Sweden under the Brussels II Regulation. If instead the measure has been taken in a Contracting State outside the EU, the 1996 Hague Convention shall be applied in assessing whether the measure shall be recognised and can be enforced in Sweden.</p>
<p>As a general rule, measures taken in a Contracting State pursuant to the provisions of the 1996 Hague Convention shall be recognised  in the other Contracting States. There are, however, circumstances that mean that a decision need not be recognised. One such ground for refusal is if the measure was taken, in conflict with Swedish procedural rules, in the context of a proceeding without the child having been provided the opportunity of being heard (does not apply to cases of urgency). Another ground for refusing recognition is if the measure is incompatible with a later measure taken in a non-Contracting State in which the child is habitually resident, if this measure fulfils the requirements for recognition in Sweden. The parties affected by a decision can request the competent Swedish authority to determine  in a separate proceeding whether or not the decision is recognised  in Sweden.</p>
<p>If a measure has been taken in a Contracting State and is in fact enforceable in that state, when enforcement is sought in Sweden, the measure shall be declared enforceable  in Sweden on request. The same grounds for refusal that apply for recognition are, however, applicable to the determination of a decision’s enforceability and can thus lead to the rejection of an application.</p>
<p>In cases where the measure is declared enforceable in Sweden the measure shall be enforced  as if it had been taken in Sweden according to Swedish law.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes certain supplementary provisions that shall apply in relation both to an application for a measure to be recognised or not recognised and to an application that a measure shall be declared enforceable in Sweden. One of these proposals is for the Svea Court of Appeal (Stockholm)  to be the competent authority in all cases, irrespective of whether the measure is regarded as public or civil under Swedish rules. The Committee also proposes certain provisions concerning the procedure itself, such as what documents are to be lodged with the Svea Court of Appeal, that, as a general rule, the documents must be translated into Swedish and that an application must be communicated to parties before the Court decides to approve it. As a decision can contain both findings that are covered by the scope of the Convention and those that are not, the Committee proposes that the Svea Court of Appeal should be able to declare that a decision is only recognised or enforceable in part. In the assessment of the Committee no statutory amendments or supplementary provisions are required concerning the enforcement procedure itself.</p>
<p>Cooperation, exchange of information and central authority under the 1996 Hague Convention</p>
<p>A very important condition for the optimal functioning of the 1996 Hague Convention is good cooperation between the authorities of the Contracting States and an exchange of information between them. The Convention therefore contains several provisions on this subject.</p>
<p>The Brussels II Regulation also contains provisions on cooperation, but when the 1996 Hague Convention is applicable the Convention’s rules shall be used.</p>
<p>The Convention stipulates that the Contracting States shall designate a central authority. The central authority has certain tasks that can be carried out either by the central authority itself or through other authorities or bodies. The provision of information on Swedish legislation, the facilitation of agreed solutions by mediation, conciliation or similar means and assistance in discovering the whereabouts of a child in Sweden are examples of such tasks.</p>
<p>The Committee has considered what authority in Sweden should be designated as the central authority and has come to the conclusion that responsibility for discharging this task should reside with the Government Offices. The Committee considers that the tasks of the central authority do not require any supplementary provisions. With respect to the question of conciliation, the Committee finds that, pending other international work on conciliation services (the directive being drafted in the EU on certain aspects of conciliation in civil matters), the existing possibilities are sufficient to meet the requirements of the Convention.</p>
<p>The Convention also contains provisions about the communication of data and information between central authorities or other authorities in the Contracting States. This can apply to a request by a Contracting State for a report on the situation of a child with habitual residence in Sweden or a request to take measures for the protection of the child. The Committee proposes that the social welfare committee also be competent to handle such a request. In addition, an authority in a Contracting State that is considering measures has a possibility of requesting that an authority in another Contracting State shall communicate relevant information. When it is a Swedish authority that is considering measures, the view of the Committee is that it is the authority that is considering measures that should also ask the question. When the question comes from a foreign authority it is the Swedish authority that has the relevant information that is competent to handle such a request. If a child is exposed to serious danger, the relevant Swedish authorities shall inform the authorities in another Contracting State where the child is present about the danger and the measures taken or under consideration.</p>
<p>A parent who is resident in Sweden and who is seeking to obtain or maintain access with his/her child who is habitually resident in another Contracting State may request that Swedish authorities gather information or evidence about the parent. The authority may also make a finding on the parent’s suitability to exercise access and on the conditions under which access could be exercised. The Committee proposes that the social welfare committee also be competent to process such a request. Thus a Swedish authority that is determining an issue of access may also receive corresponding information concerning a parent and a corresponding finding from the authorities of another Contracting State. The Swedish authority is then obliged to consider this information in deciding the issue of access.</p>
<p>It is generally the case that transmission of information to a foreign authority can be prevented by current Swedish secrecy provisions. Information subject to secrecy may not be communicated to a foreign authority unless the information is communicated in accordance with a special provision in an act or ordinance or if the information in a corresponding case would be communicated to a Swedish authority and the authority communicating the information deems that it is clearly compatible with Swedish interests for the information to be communicated to the foreign authority. The Committee does not consider that there is reason to expand the possibilities of communicating information subject to secrecy compared with what is already possible under current Swedish legislation.</p>
<p>Under  the Personal Data Act (1998:204) transferring personal data to a country that is not a member of the EU or part of the European Economic Area (EEA) is prohibited as a general rule if the country does not have an adequate level of protection of personal data. This could result in problems in the application of the cooperation provisions of the 1996 Hague Convention. As the protection of individual personal integrity is well catered for through current secrecy provisions the Committee proposes a provision permitting the transfer of personal data to a third country notwithstanding the provisions of  the Personal Data Act .</p>
<p>General provisions and final clauses of the 1996 Hague Convention</p>
<p>The 1996 Hague Convention also contains provisions of a more administrative nature and provisions directed more at states than at the individual person or competent authority applying the Convention.</p>
<p>For instance, there is a provision under which the authorities in the child’s state of habitual residence may issue certificates . Such a certificate can indicate in what capacity a person has parental responsibility for a child and what powers the person has. The Committee proposes that the Government be able to issue regulations concerning such certificates.</p>
<p>The Convention also contains provisions on the treatment of personal data  and on confidentiality . The treatment of personal data is in line with the Personal Data Act . Under the provision on confidentiality, Swedish authorities shall ensure the confidentiality of information they receive in accordance with Swedish law. The Committee proposes that a provision be introduced in the Secrecy Act (1980:100)  enabling a court to order secrecy in cases under the Convention for information about the personal and economic circumstances of private individuals if a party requests this and it can be assumed that the individual or someone close to him will suffer loss or be otherwise harmed if the information is disclosed. If the information comes from a foreign authority it is proposed that no request has to be made by a party. This proposal should also apply to delivery of information in cases under the Brussels II Regulation.</p>
<p>The Committee also proposes that the Government be authorised to issue regulations on the translation  of documents to be sent to foreign authorities. For instance, in certain cases it can be justified to have a party meet the costs of the translation.</p>
<p>The Convention contains two possibilities of making reservations . One applies to language  and allows Sweden to make a reservation against the use of French or English, but not both, in communications to Swedish authorities. The Committee proposes that the possibility of reserving against the use of French language be used. Such a reservation is also being considered by Finland and Denmark. The Convention is of broad scope and in many respects it encourages direct contact between authorities. In many cases matters can require speedy decisions. Most authorities in Sweden are able to communicate in English while documents in French can be more difficult to take part of and normally require translation.</p>
<p>The other possible reservation gives Sweden the option of reserving the jurisdiction of Swedish authorities concerning measures for the protection of a child’s property in Sweden , and that the Swedish authorities do not have to recognise parental responsibility or a measure if it is incompatible with a measure taken by Swedish authorities in relation to that property. In Finland and Denmark there is no proposal that such a reservation be made. The Committee also considers that there are not sufficiently strong reasons to propose reservation in this respect. The provisions that allow provisional decisions and measures with effect only in Sweden may be regarded as sufficient.</p>
<h2>Autonomous law</h2>
<p>Points of departure</p>
<p>There is some scope for generally applicable autonomous Swedish law alongside the Brussels II Regulation, the 1996 Hague Convention and other convention-based legislation. As mentioned initially, the Committee’s terms of reference state that the Committee shall consider whether it is appropriate for certain provisions in the 1996 Hague Convention to be made generally applicable, and the Committee is free to take up related matters of international family law.</p>
<p>A new Act on international matters concerning parental responsibility</p>
<p>The Committee proposes the introduction of a new Act on international matters concerning parental responsibility . The new Act will be applicable in those cases where neither the Brussels II Regulation, the 1996 Hague Convention nor other conventionbased legislation is applicable. The Act is thus to be seen as a supplement to community law and convention-based legislation in the area. It is proposed that the concept parental responsibility  have the same meaning as under the 1996 Hague Convention. This will make the Act applicable to both civil and public measures for the protection of children.</p>
<p>The principle of habitual residence  is applicable as the general rule in both the Brussels II Regulation and the 1996 Hague Convention. This principle means that the child’s habitual residence is the fact of connection that primarily determines matters of international jurisdiction and applicable law. The Committee considers that the principle of habitual residence shall also be the general rule in autonomous Swedish law. As the Brussels II Regulation and the 1996 Hague Convention will be applicable in relation to all children with habitual residence in Sweden , no regulation is needed in autonomous Swedish law to the effect that Swedish authorities have jurisdiction if the child is habitually resident in Sweden. An application of the principle of habitual residence in autonomous law will instead have the indirect result that the jurisdiction of foreign authorities is to be accepted  as the general rule when the child is habitually resident in another country  (that does not apply the Brussels II Regulation and the 1996 Hague Convention). However, the proposed Act means that Swedish authorities shall in certain cases nevertheless have jurisdiction to take measures for the protection of a child who is a Swedish citizen even when the child is not habitually resident in Sweden. This applies when the authorities of the child’s country of habitual residence (or in exceptional cases the child’s country of residence, if the child’s habitual residence cannot be determined) do not consider that they have jurisdiction or in other cases where there are special reasons. This introduces a “safety valve” to ensure that necessary measures can be taken for the protection of a child. The Committee proposes that the definition of habitual residence set out in the Act (1904:26 p 1) concerning Certain International Legal Relationships relating to Marriage, Adoption and Guardianship (the 1904 Act)  is inserted in the new Act. The definition shall, however, explicitly state that it has the habitual residence of the child  in view.</p>
<p>The Committee also proposes that the new Act regulate what country’s law  the competent authorities in Sweden shall use in the matter of parental responsibility with an international connection. The provisions of the 1996 Hague Convention are used as a model here, so the general rule is that Swedish authorities shall apply Swedish law in exercising their jurisdiction. If there are reasons to do so, it shall be possible to take account of or apply the law of another state in exceptional cases. A provision of the law of another state may not, however, be applied if it would be manifestly contrary to the Swedish legal order to apply the provision in view of the best interests of the child (public policy).</p>
<p>It is also proposed that measures taken by foreign authorities concerning parental responsibility that have become legally final shall, as a general rule, be recognised  in Sweden. It should also be possible to obtain a ruling on whether a foreign decision is recognised or not . The Committee proposes that the Svea Court of Appeal make this determination. Recognition of foreign decisions may be refused under certain conditions. In the main, the provisions of the 1996 Hague Convention have been used as the model for specifying these circumstances. It should thus be possible to refuse recognition if, for example, a person claims that the decision prevents him or her from exercising his or her parental responsibility, if the decision has been issued without the person being given the opportunity to state an opinion (if it is not an urgent case). Recognition can also be refused if the decision is incompatible with a subsequent decision that meets the requirements for recognition in Sweden. The foreign decision is not applicable in Sweden either if it would be manifestly contrary to Swedish legal order having regard to the best interests of the child (public policy). If enforcement is sought in Sweden of a foreign decision that is recognised in Sweden, the decision may be enforced following the approval of an application for enforcement .</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the Svea Court of Appeal decide such applications in a special exequatur procedure .</p>
<p>The Committee also proposes that the Svea Court of Appeal shall be bound by the factual circumstances on which the foreign authority based its jurisdiction and that the foreign decision may not be reviewed as to its substance. Moreover it should be possible for the recognition or declaration of enforceability of a decision to be partial.</p>
<p>It follows from the above that the Committee has proposed that the fundamental ideas and some of the specific provisions of the 1996 Hague Convention (compare the principle of habitual residence, applicable law in matters of parental responsibility and the recognition of foreign decisions as the general rule) should provide the model for autonomous Swedish law. However, many of the provisions of the Convention are concerned with – and presuppose – ongoing cooperation between the Contracting States. Such provisions should not be made generally applicable as there can be no expectation of well-structured cooperation with another state when autonomous Swedish law is applicable. For this reason, the Committee has chosen not to propose, for example, that the provision on jurisdiction in the event of wrongful removal provide the model for a generally applicable provision.</p>
<p>Other statutory amendments and deliberations</p>
<p>Under both the Brussels II Regulation and the 1996 Hague Convention Swedish authorities have jurisdiction in cases of urgency. In addition, the 1996 Hague Convention confers jurisdiction to take provisional measures that only have effect in the state where the measures are taken. In both these cases the child or the property of the child has to be in Sweden. However, the substantive conditions for issuing such a decision must exist in Swedish law, i.e. primarily under the Children and Parents Code . In current Swedish law, the 1904 Act  confers certain jurisdiction to issue provisional decisions in matters of guardianship and custody. The Committee proposes that these provisions of the 1904 Act  be abolished and that a more explicit regulation is introduced instead, both in the Act with Supplementary Provisions to the Brussels II Regulation and in the proposed Act with supplementary provisions to the 1996 Hague Convention. There is no need of additional supplementary legislation.</p>
<p>Today it is possible under  Chapter 6, section 4, second paragraph of the Children and Parents Code to  register joint custody direct to the Swedish Tax Agency (in charge of the population register in Sweden), if the child and its parents are Swedish citizens, the child is registered as resident in Sweden and there is no prior order concerning custody. Parents can also obtain joint custody through registration to the Swedish Tax Agency after notification to the social welfare committee in connection with the committee’s approval of a paternity acknowledgement or an acknowledgement of parenthood. In the latter situation , the child has to be registered in the population register in Sweden, but Swedish citizenship is not required. The criteria for registration in the population register and for habitual residence do not match. Situations can occur , in particular after the entry into force of the Brussels II Regulation, where the Swedish Tax Agency does not have international jurisdiction to register the parents’ notification of joint custody in accordance with the said provision . In addition, according to Article 16.2 of the 1996 Hague Convention, a child must be habitually resident in Sweden for the registration of joint custody by the Swedish Tax Agency to be valid ex lege in states that have acceded to the 1996 Hague Convention. The Committee therefore proposes that the requirement that the child is registered in the population register in Sweden be replaced by a requirement that the child is habitually resident in Sweden. Since the Committee is proposing that autonomous Swedish law be based on the principle of habitual residence and as the Committee does not consider than there is reason to allow the citizenship requirement to be decisive, the Committee also proposes that the provision be amended so that the requirement that the child and its parents must be Swedish citizens is removed.</p>
<p>The Act on custodianship for unaccompanied children (2005:429) has been enacted in order to strengthen protection for children who are foreign citizens or stateless and who arrive in Sweden on their own or who are left alone during their stay here. In accordance with the influence of the principle of habitual residence above, there is reason to expand the scope of the Act slightly. The Committee therefore proposes that the Act be applicable in relation to all children, i.e. even in relation to children with Swedish citizenship under the conditions set out in the Act. As there is no question of giving a Swedish citizen a residence permit, it is proposed that the point of time when the child receives a residence permit in Sweden be replaced with the point of time when the child acquires habitual residence  in Sweden. This will not make any difference in practice compared to the current situation, as it must be assumed that a child who is a foreign citizen or stateless will acquire habitual residence here in connection with the grant of a residence permit.</p>
<p>The provisions of the proposed Act on international matters concerning parental responsibility will also make several provisions of the 1904 Act  ineffective or unnecessary. The Committee proposes that these provisions be repealed.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions</h2>
<p>As Swedish ratification of the 1996 Hague Convention is dependent on prior authorisation by the EU of Member States to ratify the Convention, the Committee proposes that it be left to the Government to decide when the Act that incorporates the Convention together with the supplementary provisions should enter into force. In the view of the Committee, the same should apply to all the other legislative proposals that are linked to the Convention to a greater or lesser extent.</p>
<p>The 1996 Hague Convention contains transitional provisions. It is proposed that these are also given the force of law, and this means that the provisions of the Convention are applicable to measures taken after the Convention has entered into force in Sweden. With respect to recognition and enforcement, the provisions of the Convention shall be applicable concerning measures that have been taken after the entry into force of the Convention between the two states involved (i.e. the state where the decision on the measure has been taken and the state – in our case Sweden – where recognition and enforcement of the measure are involved). However, the Convention does not give an answer to the question of what is applicable in “ex lege” situations for children who have acquired habitual residence in Sweden before  the entry into force of the Convention. The Committee proposes a transitional provision to the effect that the rules of the Convention shall be applicable in relation to these children. This means that the situation that applied concerning parental responsibility for the</p>
<p>child by the direct operation of the law in the child’s former state of habitual residence shall be recognised in Sweden and  that Swedish rules shall apply to the extent that these rules attribute parental responsibility to a person who did not previously have it.</p>
<p>Transitional provisions are also required for the proposed Act on international matters concerning parental responsibility . The Committee proposes that the application of the new Act begin with cases lodged after the Act’s entry into force and, as regards recognition and enforcement, with decisions issued after the Act’s entry into force. Cases lodged and decisions issued before this point in time will be dealt with under older regulations.</p>
