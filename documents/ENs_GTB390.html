<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The task of the Committee, specified in the terms of reference, was to investigate if non-resident women should be permitted to undergo an abortion in Sweden. The Swedish Abortion Law of 1974 states that abortions are only permitted for Swedish citizens or residents of Sweden. A non-resident woman must apply to the National Board of Health and Social Services for permission.</p>
<p>The Committee suggests that the abortion law should be changed. Foreign women should be permitted, as are Swedish citizens or residents of Sweden, to undergo an abortion on request until the end of the 18th week of pregnancy. The National Board of Health and Social Services must approve an abortion at a later stage. The woman should also be offered counselling before and after an abortion.</p>
<p>As a Member State of the European Union (EU), Sweden must equalize national legislation with the legislation of the Community and that legislation supersedes the national legislation. The Treaty on European Union Member States implies that women from Member States of EU already have the right to an abortion in Sweden even though the Swedish Abortion Law denies the right for non-residents. There is no acceptable reason to deny the right to an abortion in Sweden to women from countries outside EU. The reproductive health of women in developing countries is a high priority in Sweden and an amendment of the Swedish abortion law will have a high symbolic value.</p>
<p>Financing and payment for abortions should follow the general rules for foreigners getting health services in Sweden. The rules differ between patients from Member States of EU and for patients from countries outside EU.</p>
<p>A woman from a Member State who stays in Sweden, even if she is not a resident, should pay the same fee as a Swedish patient if she can show her European health insurance card. In that case the</p>
<p>social security institution in her homeland pays the cost for the abortion to the Swedish Social Insurance Agency.</p>
<p>All non-resident women from countries outside EU must pay the full cost of an abortion. Women from Member States who travel to Sweden for an abortion must also pay the full cost, unless they have a certificate (E112) confirming that the social security institution in their homeland is liable for the cost. An abortion will be relatively expensive, at a comparable level to the cost in Great Britain.</p>
<p>The Netherlands and Great Britain have permitted abortions for non-residents for a long time. Experiences show that there is a small and diminishing demand from European women to undergo an abortion in another European country. Poland is the only neighbouring country from which there might be a demand for abortion in Sweden. However, it is cheaper and easier for a Polish woman to have an illegal abortion in Poland than to go abroad for an abortion. A Polish woman who has undergone an illegal abortion is not punished in Poland. The Danish Abortion Law changed in 2004 and there has not been any increase of the number of abortions for non-residents in Denmark since the change.</p>
<p>The view of the Committee is that there will probably not be any great demand for an abortion in Sweden from non-resident women. There might be some increased demand from foreign women who have connections to Sweden through relatives or friends.</p>
