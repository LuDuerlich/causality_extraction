<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>The Swedish parliament last made a more comprehensive decision on the controls on foodstuffs in 1989. The strengthening of central supervision and of the National Food Administration’s governing role which were then decided upon were prompted by the need to improve controls over the centralised systems of operation which had grown up within the industry and trade. Other development tendencies significant to controls on foodstuffs were the application of new raw materials, additives and preservation and packing methods to increase their shelf life in ever longer distribution chains. It was further considered that additional controls on the composition of foodstuffs and on declarations of contents and marking should be set up. The need for more stringent controls over foodstuffs implemented in a consistent manner across the whole country was an important motive for the charging system introduced in 1990.</p>
<p>During the 1990s the centralising tendencies within the food sector have continued but at a slower pace. In industry - even the food industry - Sweden compared to other countries has only a few small firms, but even the big Swedish food manufacturers are by international standards relatively small. The wholesale and retail trades have been concentrated and the number of small shops has diminished greatly. The number of catering establishments has increased somewhat but relatively less than the number of meals served which is almost 5 million/day.</p>
<p>Existing information on outbreaks of illness resulting from bad foodstuffs or defective food treatment does not indicate any pressing defects in the law or in supervision. Against this background, the committee has not seen fit consider any more sweeping changes in the Food Act or in the direction of supervision. The committee has therefore concentrated on those matters to which especial attention is to be paid under the government’s terms of reference:</p>
<p>- division of responsibility between national and local authorities</p>
<p>- the role of the regional tier</p>
<p>- prerequisites for  co-operation between local authorities</p>
<p>- the system of compulsory  self-monitoring</p>
<p>- the payment system</p>
<p>- responsibility for certain matters on EC market provisions.</p>
<p>The division between national and local responsibilities has for a long time been characterised by efforts to devolve duties to local authorities. This is an important part of the idea of performance related management which has been put into effect in the public sector during the 1990s. It means that Parliament and the Government have gone away from detailed control of resources in favour of setting a goal and monitoring the result. A consequence of this trend is that the local authorities have acquired increased freedom in choosing their organisation and working methods, most recently exemplified by the opportunity which local government law now offers of co-operation across local authority boundaries through joint boards. Alongside these general opportunities for co-operation, conditions have been established in four areas of the law - among them environmental protection and health care - whereby one local authority may contract to use resources which exist within another authority. The Committee recommends that an equivalent amendment be made to the Food Act, to make it possible to turn to another authority for certain tasks or to commission an employee of another authority to make decisions in matters involving Food Act.</p>
<p>The 1989 decision on controls on foodstuffs served to increase activity at the centre. This decision is one of the very few exceptions to the tendency towards decentralisation which has characterised developments within the public sector since the beginning of the 1980s. The National Food Administration is now responsible for direct supervision of about 430 abattoirs and large production establishments which require specialised skills of the supervisory authorities. Supervision of almost 200 establishments - which are not small scale - has been transferred to the local authority: in Stockholm all establishments are now under local authority supervision, in Gothenburg most of them.</p>
<p>In the matter of the division between national and local responsibility, one line of development would be total devolution to the local authorities in line with the efforts to decentralise. The converse would be to transfer all supervision of foodstuffs to a central government organisation (with regional divisions) as is now being done in Denmark.</p>
<p>In the majority on the country’s 288 local authorities there was in 1996 at most one whole time equivalent for food supervision. This is not a good basis for developing activities and staff. The Committee</p>
<p>starts from the premise that there are now legal conditions for developing activity in larger units and that there will be incentives for the staff to do this. The Committee considers that the reasons for the division of responsibility for testing and supervision between national and local authorities remain. Continued devolution to local authorities should take place gradually when conditions for maintaining the required skills, continuity and accessibility to the work exist. Responsibility for supervision should also be able to transferred, as hitherto, in the opposite direction when there is a special reason. If the National Food Administration and a local authority have different views on where supervisory responsibility should lie, the government should decide the matter. The government should also be able to decree that the National Food Administration should take over if serious defects in a local authority’s supervision are discovered.</p>
<p>The National Food Administration’s duties now consist in part of direct supervision, in part of the establishment of standards, monitoring and evaluation of the system of supervision. There are points of principle in favour of isolating the National Food Administration’s duties. The Committee recommends that the administration’s organisation be reviewed with a view to a clearer separation of the duties of the central authority from operational supervision. For the organisation of direct supervision which should not be transferred to the local authorities, four alternatives can be distinguished:</p>
<p>- a ‘profit centre’ within the administration</p>
<p>- a totally independent central authority</p>
<p>- an independent sector based organisation with regional divisions and</p>
<p>- for the county councils to take over the duties and the staff.</p>
<p>The Committee has not taken a definite stance on the appropriations questions. They should be dealt with during the organisational review. The latter should also cover such activity as does not fall within the committee’s mandate.</p>
<p>Under the Food Act, the county councils exercise ‘immediate supervision within the county’ and decide upon matters of appeal.</p>
<p>Our terms of reference say that the Committee should take into account what is put forward in the Law Commission’s report 1994/95:LU20. The commission referred there to what the parliamentary auditors put forward in a review of the county councils’ responsibility and work in the area of foodstuffs. The auditors thought that the county councils had ‘an indirect and imprecise responsibility for the supervision of foodstuffs in the county’.</p>
<p>The Committee considers that the county councils’ duty of supervision in accordance with the Food Act s.24 should be abolished. This does not effect the county councils’ general duty to take the initiative where necessary to ensure the success of established national goals. The need to use the county councils’ specialised knowledge of foodstuffs supervision remains and can, as hitherto, be expressed in the government’s approval document.</p>
<p>The government has previously rejected the notion of giving the county councils direct supervisory responsibility under the Food Act. The conditions for the county councils’ contribution to the supervision of foodstuffs have not in the committee’s estimation changed in any crucial respect during the 1990s. The question of how the current central operational supervision can be organised should, however, be dealt with in the review of the National Food Administration’s organisation which the committee consider should be undertaken.</p>
<p>Border controls in respect of non-EU countries are a local authority duty. They are governed to a high degree by regulations (and general advice) from the National Food Administration which also appoints veterinary surgeons and other border control functionaries. Local authorities receive payment in accordance with the local government tariff.</p>
<p>The Committee considers that border controls should be viewed as a national undertaking. This also has the practical point in its favour that EU membership requires that border control matters be handled in a uniform manner.</p>
<p>According to the government, there is a need for further discussion of responsibility for quality control under certain EC market provisions. The Committee considers that the principle which applies to the division of responsibilities under the foodstuffs regulations (i.e. type of establishment) should apply equally to controls based on the EC’s agricultural regulations. As far as controls under the often detailed rules based on the agricultural regulations are concerned, the committee considers that the official commitment should in the first instance be confined to the exercise of authority, guidance and information. The task of developing the bases of the authority’s judgement on whether the regulations have been conformed to should, so far as possible, be left to so-called independent agencies.</p>
<p>The system of finance is an incomprehensible patchwork of tax and charges with different principles for charging, vague accounting of the underlying costs and varying charges. The costing information which the local authorities return to the National Food Administration is so uncertain as to be practically unusable. The charging system provides</p>
<p>an inadequate basis for adapting the local authorities’ supervision to differing requirements.</p>
<p>More and more official tasks - even the exercise of authority - have over the years become financed out of charges on the principle that whoever occasions the supervision, special safety checks or the like should also bear their cost. The Committee recommends that the duty of fixing charges for testing and supervision under the Food Act should be devolved to the local authorities. The premise should be that the local authorities should levy charges which broadly speaking cover all costs so that the activity acquires the scope and direction which the risks of food treatment and good practice demand. Another object should be to create an incentive for better adherence to the rules. There is, in fact, a more uniform system within the Environmental Health Protection Committee spheres of activity against a background of the principles laid down by the government for work under the environmental code.</p>
<p>The National Food Administration should acquire equivalent powers in respect of the administration’s direct supervision.</p>
<p>Certain supervisory activities will still need to be financed out of taxes in the future. The Committee has specified what costs should be accounted for in the local authority supervision of foodstuffs and what activities should be tax or charge financed. In the current state of affairs, certain central authority duties are paid for by the local authorities transferring 15% of their supervisory receipts to the National Food Administration. These tasks should in the committee’s opinion be paid for from a central appropriation. Similarly the Committee considers that, among other things, certain additional costs for so-called normative inspections and for controls on residual substances should be centrally funded.</p>
<p>With the help of cost information obtained from the Swedish Association of Local Authorities, the Committee estimates that the local authorities’ fee income can grow by something in the order of 100-140 million kronor if the local authorities’ total foodstuffs supervision is assumed to take 400,000 hours. Precise information on fee income can only be obtained retrospectively.</p>
<p>Within the foodstuffs industry there has long been a systematic effort to introduce quality assurance so that companies can satisfy the responsibilities one has for ones products. During the 1990s, considerable efforts have been made among the many smaller companies which are the subject of local authority foodstuff supervision to increase their level of ambition in the matter of self- monitoring. Implementation of compulsory self-supervision has to a significant extent served to make companies aware of the need for self-</p>
<p>monitoring. In this effort the authorities have had solid support from the regulation that the authorities should lay down a self-monitoring programme.</p>
<p>The efforts which have been made to increase consciousness of the need for a functioning system of self-monitoring were justified at one time when it was a matter of raising the level of ambition. But as a matter of principle it is the companies’ responsibility to have such self- monitoring as is needed and the authorities’ duty to check on it. The Committee considers that the supervisory authorities should not determine the self-monitoring programme. This risks locking the company in to the authority’s decision and creating ambiguity about who has the responsibility for self-monitoring.</p>
<p>Under other matters the Committee recommends that the scope of the body of rules in the foodstuffs area should be restricted by removing general advice from the statute book, producing guidance on supervisory work as well as a method of conveying current information into the field and that the possibility of simplifying the rules should be evaluated.</p>
<p>Accounting in foodstuff supervision needs to be improved. Increased charge financing and new forms of control of official activity place increased demands on the measurement of both performance and costs. The Committee recommends that the government should give the National Food Administration, in co-operation with the Swedish Association of Local Authorities, the job of drawing up recommendations for on-going monitoring and evaluation of foodstuffs supervision.</p>
<p>When put into effect, the committee’s recommendation on increased charge financing might be expected to lead to the people who are paying placing more obvious demands on the authority’s performance. Companies may have occasion to formulate their needs for information from the authorities more clearly as a basis for the work of improving self-monitoring and increasing the quality of food treatment. On the authorities side, this means partly that the organisation and forms of co-operation need to be developed, in part that skills need increasing. For the present observance of the law and general legal aspects are among the highest priority areas for in service training.</p>
<p>The Committee recommends that 25 million kronor be made available in order to improve the level of knowledge in the supervisory authorities, companies within the foodstuffs sector, and consumers. It is a matter of measures of greater breadth than are usually contained in the National Food Administration’s program of education and information. Implementation will contribute to mapping out what requirements there are for education and information, for discussions to</p>
<p>develop working methods and for practical trials of new forms of work and co-operation. It is a matter of investing in knowledge which can in principle be compared with the programme in support of investments in ecologically sustainable social development which is on the point of being implemented.</p>
<p>The economic consequences are in the first instance that the local authorities’ fee income will grow by something in the order of 100-140 million kronor. This means a reduced economic burden on the local authorities. On the budget-capping principle, corresponding reductions can be made in the central government contribution, i.e. the increase in income is subtracted from the central government contribution.</p>
