<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Minerals Act (1991:45) regulates the exploration and extraction of minerals (‘concession minerals’) that are difficult to find and where exploration, extraction and restoration are long-term, costly and high-risk activities. There is a strong public interest in exploiting Sweden’s mineral resources, and this interest has historically been so strong that the provisions of the Mineral Act allowing the state to grant permission to explore and extract mineral deposits on private land have been considered consistent with the constitutional conditions governing invasion of landowner rights. However, on 1 May 2005, certain amendments were made to the Minerals Act aimed at achieving a better balance between the exploitation interest and the requirements of interested parties. The Inquiry has had the task of surveying and analysing how the regulations on work plans in the Minerals Act have functioned since their introduction in 2005 and, if necessary, proposing the provisions required to render the work plans more effective. The task has also included surveying and analysing the communication between companies, land owners and interested parties, as well as municipalities in connection with exploration permits, and, if necessary, proposing changes to the regulatory framework so that it supports good dialogue between these parties. Furthermore, the Inquiry has been instructed to consider whether an obligation should be introduced on exploration permit applicants to inform the general public about the planned work during the application process. The task has also included analysing the need and suitability of, in certain cases, granting exemption from or reducing the fees associated with the extension of an exploration permit. Finally, the Inquiry has had the task of proposing any other drafting or legal amendments that arise during its work, and taking up other issues that strengthen the aim of streamlining information about exploration permits and exploration work.</p>
<p>According to the Inquiry’s terms of reference, the main aim of the review has been to improve the regulatory framework so that land owners, interested parties and municipalities more clearly and efficiently receive information about what is meant by ‘exploration’ under the Minerals Act.</p>
<h2>Proposals concerning the exploration permit system</h2>
<p>Exploration operations are currently regulated in the Minerals Act by two processes: application and granting of exploration permits and the work plan process. An exploration permit gives the holder access to the permit area for exploration work, the sole right to exploration in the exploration area in relation to other prospectors and property owners, and preferential rights in any application for a concession. However, exploratory work may not begin until a work plan has become applicable between the permit holder and property owners concerned or holders of special rights. A work plan is considered applicable if it has not been contested by property owners or holders of special rights or if it has been approved by the chief mining inspector. In an examination of whether or not to grant an exploration permit, there is no examination of conflicting interests. What the chief mining inspector must determine is whether there is reason to assume that exploration in the area can lead to the discovery of concession minerals and determine the applicant’s suitability to conduct such explorations.</p>
<p>To gain a basic understanding of how the exploration permit application process currently works, the Inquiry began with an overall review of exploration permit applications received by the Office of the Mining Inspectors between January 2008 and August 2009, and the decisions issued by the chief mining inspector in these matters. With the conclusions drawn from this review, and taking into account what had otherwise been submitted to the Inquiry during the investigation period, I have been able to establish that there is a need to clarify the purpose of exploration permits and the function of work plans. It has emerged that the role of exploration permits is unclear to many property owners and holders of special rights, and that there is uncertainty regarding which rights and responsibilities an exploration permit entails. The processing of exploration permits has been seen as inadequate since the matter may be determined without the property owners concerned and holders of special rights being given the opportunity to state an opinion. Some concern has been expressed that public interests have not been adequately protected in the procedure. Furthermore, municipal representatives have stated that they should have the opportunity to state an opinion on all applications for exploration permits.</p>
<p>Historically, the Minerals Act has been very pro-exploitation. This has led to feelings of distrust and powerlessness among individuals affected by exploration permits and work plans. The proposals that have been presented are aimed at creating trust in the system and providing conditions for well-supported decisions, without disregarding the minerals industry’s need for fast and simple processes. In my view, a legally secure system eliminates grounds for mistrust and, in the long run, will also benefit the mining industry. The aim has been to clarify the exploration permit process and work plan procedure and create a balance between the interests of private individuals, the general public and the minerals industry. In this light, I present the following proposals.</p>
<p>There has been uncertainty as to who is to be considered an interested party under the provisions of the Minerals Act and the Minerals Ordinance (1992:285). I propose that the wording ‘interested party’ be removed from the provisions of the Minerals Act and Minerals Ordinance concerning exploration permits and work plans and be replaced with the wording ‘holder of special rights’.</p>
<p>The group that may appeal against decisions of the Office of the Mining Inspectors on exploration permits and object to work plans should not be widened.</p>
<p>The provisions on what an application for an exploration permit shall include should be changed so that it only contains information that is relevant to the chief mining inspector’s examination of whether or not the permit is to be granted, i.e. the issue of mineral deposits and the applicant’s ability or intention to carry out an appropriate exploration.</p>
<p>I propose the removal of the provisions stipulating that applications and decisions, as well as applications for extensions and decisions concerning alum shale, oil, gaseous hydrocarbons and diamonds only need be published. Rather, these applications, as with the applications concerning other concession minerals, should in the first instance be sent to those who are affected, and the property owners concerned and known holders of special rights should be informed of decisions on exploration permits. This is to ensure that all the parties concerned receive information about applications and decisions. This means that the prospector, in all applications and regardless of which mineral is concerned, must state which properties are affected by the application and provide the names and addresses of property owners and known holders of special rights.</p>
<p>The Minerals Act contains an exemption from the communication principle with regard to decisions on exploration permits. Such decisions can be made without any other interested party than the applicant having had an opportunity to state an opinion. I propose that this exemption be removed and that property owners and known holders of special rights who are affected by an application for an exploration permit be given the opportunity to state an opinion on the application.</p>
<p>The information that property owners and holders of special rights receive in connection with being given the opportunity to state an opinion on an application for an exploration permit and a decision approving an exploration permit must contain a clear explanation of what an exploration permit entails and what a work plan is.</p>
<p>I propose that municipalities be given the opportunity to state an opinion on all applications for exploration permits. The municipalities would thus be able to highlight any land-use conflicts.</p>
<p>In my view, the permit holder’s right, following authorisation by the chief mining inspector, to requisition land or other space to build necessary roads to and within the exploration area is too extensive. The proposal implies that the permit holder should no longer have this right.</p>
<h2>Proposals concerning the work plans system</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has carried out a telephone survey of property owners and holders of special rights who received work plans in 2010 and 2011. In addition, the Inquiry has interviewed a number of representatives of various municipalities about their experiences of exploration permits and work plans as well as representatives of prospecting companies about work plans. It emerged from the surveys that there are certain shortcomings in the information contained in the work plans and that many property owners and holders of special rights feel that they have no influence over how exploratory work is to be conducted. In light of what has emerged from the surveys, and considering other information received by the Inquiry, the Inquiry has presented the following proposals and made the following assessments concerning work plans.</p>
<p>I propose that it be stated in the Minerals Act that work plans must be written in Swedish or, if any property owner concerned or holder of special rights requests it, in any of the national minority languages. It should also be stated that prospectors must adapt the content of the work plan to the ongoing land use within the area in which the exploratory work is to be conducted.</p>
<p>I propose that the content of work plans be improved and made more detailed. In addition to what has previously applied, work plans should also contain the permit holder’s contact details. The work plan should contain a description of a work plan, information explaining that the recipient is able to influence the content of the work plan by raising objections to it, information concerning the deadline for submitting any objections and the consequences if no objections are submitted. The work plan should state what permits the permit holder has or intends to apply for and/or what notifications under other legislation the permit holder has made or intends to make on account of the exploratory work. Furthermore, the work plan should contain a detailed timetable and information about the settlement of claims. There should also be a map indicating property boundaries and property designations and that also shows the area in which exploratory work is to be conducted and the areas the permit holder plans to use for transport.</p>
<p>The obligation to state in the work plan the extent to which the exploration work can be expected to affect public interests should be removed.</p>
<p>A draft work plan should also be sent to holders of special rights who are not registered in the property register.</p>
<p>The provision that the chief mining inspector must set the conditions necessary to protect public interests in decisions on the approval of work plans should be abolished.</p>
<p>The permit holder should inform the property owners concerned and holders of special rights when the exploration work has been completed.</p>
<p>In my assessment, the task of providing property owners and holders of special rights with information about the work plans should not be transferred from the permit holders to the Office of the Mining Inspectors. Nor should provisions stipulating that all work plans must be approved by the chief mining inspector be introduced.</p>
<p>I propose that it be clearly stated that the work plan should only be sent to the Office of the Mining Inspectors after it has become applicable between the parties.</p>
<p>The permit holder should send a copy of the applicable work plan to the county administrative board and the relevant municipality.</p>
<p>I consider that supervision under the Minerals Act should continue to be exercised by the chief mining inspector. The chief mining inspector’s supervision of exploration operations should be developed and become more active. It is proposed that the Office should carry out more systematic checking of compliance with the Minerals Act, for example that the work plan is served to the right individuals and that the work is performed in accordance with the applicable work plan.</p>
<h2>Other considerations and proposals</h2>
<p>Conflicting interests should not be examined in connection with the granting of exploration permits.</p>
<p>The matter of how land-use disputes should be resolved in cases in which the minerals and reindeer industries cannot co-exist cannot be solved within the framework of the granting of exploration permits, but should instead be escalated to a higher level of authority for an overall assessment.</p>
<p>In my assessment, there is no reason to grant exemption from payment or to reduce the fees for the extension of exploration permits in certain cases.</p>
<p>Prior to sending out the work plan, a person or a company that has been granted an exploration permit based on an application concerning oil, gaseous hydrocarbons or uranium should be required to inform the general public assumed to be affected by the planned work. In other cases, the chief mining inspector, in cases where it appears suitable and appropriate, should attach conditions to the decision on an exploration permit to the effect that, prior to sending out the work plan, the permit holder must inform the general public assumed to be affected by the planned work.</p>
<p>The chief mining inspector should inform the county administrative board and the municipalities about the provisions concerning exploration permits and work plans, as well as any issues that may be relevant for county administrative boards and municipalities to consider in connection with exploration work in accordance with the Minerals Act, in order to achieve more uniform application throughout Sweden.</p>
<p>I propose that alum shale be removed from the definition of concession minerals contained in Chapter 1, Section 2 of the Minerals Act.</p>
