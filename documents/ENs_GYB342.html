<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The remit of the Commission of Inquiry</h2>
<p>The remit of the Commission of Inquiry can be divided into three parts. The Inquiry’s principal task is to propose a new Fishery Act focusing not on fishing rights but on fishery conservation. This includes in particular paying attention to regulatory simplification. In addition, I have been asked to review control activity and make the prosecution of fishery offences more effective. Finally I was asked to review the legislation on fishery conservation areas etc. I have presented my thoughts on this part of my remit in the interim report Fishery Conservation in Private Waters – a Review of the Fishery Conservation Areas Act, SOU 2009:53. On the basis of this interim report, in the spring of 2010 the Government formulated a proposal for new legislation referred to the Council on Legislation.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The current Fishery Act is complicated and unclear. The rules contained in the Act are particularly burdensome for commercial fishing. It is difficult for all users to gain an idea of what applies by simply reading the Act. One reason for this complexity is EU law, with which national law is intertwined. It is therefore necessary to have an insight into obscure EU law in order to understand the Fishery Act. There has been a lack of material to clarify the boundary between national law and EU law. While this dividing line remains unclear, there will continue to be uncertainty over the legal situation. I have therefore conducted my own analysis of the scope for national action. The conclusions have been examined and approved by Ulf Bernitz, Professor of European Law at Stockholm University. It should be noted, however, that the interpretation merely represents a snapshot, as EU law is constantly changing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, EU law does not bear sole responsibility for fishery legislation being complicated and intricate. The Act is unclear in itself.</p>
<p>I propose changes to the Act in five important areas in order to bring about better and clearer legislation focusing on fishery conservation.</p>
<p>• An introductory section containing principles of environmental law</p>
<p>• Clearer allocation of resources</p>
<p>• Simpler permit requirements for commercial fishing</p>
<p>• Permits and freedom of trade</p>
<p>• Regional influence</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit with regard to control issues is to consider how the effectiveness of prosecution for fishery offences can be further improved, as the European Commission has repeatedly criticised Sweden for having inadequate fishery control. However, a great deal has already been done. The Inquiry has also been asked to identify any non-permitted blanket penal provisions in the Fishery Act and to consider statutory amendments in this context. I have also aimed for simpler and clearer regulation with regard to control and enforcement. My proposals in this section can be summarised in the following bullet points:</p>
<p>• The penal provisions in the Fishery Conservation Act – blanket penal provisions and remove imprisonment from the scale of penalties</p>
<p>• Offences committed in business activity should be penalised by imposition of standardised fines</p>
<p>• Obstruction of enforcement and control should be made a criminal offence</p>
<p>• Confiscation and forfeiture should be expanded</p>
<p>• The most serious contraventions should be returned to the criminal system</p>
<p>• It should be possible for fishing licences to revoked for offences committed in the activity to which the licence relates</p>
<p>• The Control Regulation and the Fishery Conservation Act</p>
<h2>An introductory section containing principles of environmental law Conflicting aims</h2>
<p>Like many other policy areas, fisheries policy has inherently conflicting aims, particularly in the short-term perspective. Fishing has to be carried on sustainably, but account has to be taken of the fishing industry and recreational fishing, and regional policy considerations have to be weighed up. The current Fishery Act does not address this at all. Instead it has been left to the Swedish Board of Fisheries to balance different considerations on a case-by-case basis. In my view this has contributed to fisheries policy being regarded as unnecessarily conflict-ridden.</p>
<h2>An introductory section, the precautionary principle, knowledge requirements and impact assessment</h2>
<p>There are no conflicts of aims between sustainable fishing and commercial fishing or recreational fishing in the long term. Fishing must be carried on sustainably and be based on the ecosystems approach if there is to continue to be a fishing industry with vibrant coastal communities in the future. The conflict instead is between sustainable fishing and short-term overexploitation of fish resources. I therefore propose an introductory section modelled on forest conservation legislation, where equal weight is given to environmental and business interests. This implies that fishery conservation in the future will weigh more heavily than has been the case to date.</p>
<p>My remit is to propose new fishery legislation, in which a balance is struck between environmental and business interests. It should also be noted that in September 2009 the Government decided that a new marine environment authority should be created to strengthen and improve the effectiveness of work concerned with the seas and water. It is primarily parts of the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, the Swedish Board of Fisheries and the five water authorities that are to be merged to form a government agency which will be responsible for issues relating to the management of the marine and aquatic environment. The Government’s starting point is that the Swedish Board of Fisheries should cease to exist. Those activities of the Swedish Board of Fisheries that cannot be transferred to the new government agency are to be assigned to the most appropriate authority.</p>
<p>The introductory section  represents a programme declaration. This is then given content by the introduction of environmental principles into my proposal. In order to clarify what principles are necessary to achieve sustainable fishing, I have asked Anna-Lena Rosengardten, environmental advisor for the Environmental Court of Appeal, to conduct an analysis, The Environmental Code - A Presentation from a Fishing Rights Perspective. I propose that the precautionary principle , a knowledge requirement  and an impact assessment  for the environment be introduced into my proposal for a Fishery conservation Act.</p>
<p>The precautionary principle  means that everyone who fishes will in future be obliged to take precautions to avoid risks of harm. This principle will cover both commercial and recreational fishermen. A knowledge requirement  is also introduced for commercial fishermen. The significance of this will be that anyone who carries on commercial fishing with vessels must have undergone training on the aquatic ecosystem. I also integrate a requirement for an impact assessment  for the environment into the existing, but simplified, permit system for commercial fishermen. This will be reminiscent of the requirement for an environmental impact assessment in the Environmental Code, but will be less extensive. I wish as far as possible to avoid additionally burdening the fishing industry with more rules and requirements.</p>
<h2>A clearer allocation of resources</h2>
<p>The present-day allocation of resources between different categories of fishing is concealed in the Fishery Act. I intend this to be clearly apparent from the new legislation. My proposed allocation of resources is based on that which applies at present, with some necessary adaptations.</p>
<p>I initially introduce several legal definitions to facilitate understanding. I define commercial fishing and recreational fishing and what constitutes fixed or mobile gear and hand-held gear.</p>
<h2>Commercial fishing</h2>
<p>Commercial fishing , as previously, should have access to fish in public waters and be able to use fixed gear. Access is restricted by regulations on fishery conservation from both the EU and the responsible national authority.</p>
<h2>Recreational fishing in public waters</h2>
<p>In the current Fishery Act only Swedish citizens are entitled to carry on recreational fishing in public waters. However, the Common Fisheries Policy covers all fishing. Although significant national power to regulate recreational fishing remains, these rules have to be nationally neutral. I therefore propose that EU citizens other than Swedes also be allowed to engage in recreational fishing in public waters.</p>
<h2>Limitation of fishing gear</h2>
<p>The principal rule of a maximum if six items of fishing gear applies, as previously, to recreational fishermen in public waters . This right can be restricted by the national authority if there are fishery conservation reasons for doing so. There is at present an exception to the limitation on gear to six items for lobster traps, with each person now being permitted to use 14 traps. Reports have, however, shown that this generous exception has led to a situation where around 80% of lobster fishing is done by recreational fisherman. This is unfortunate for small-scale commercial fishing on the west coast. It should also be borne in mind that in future under the EU Control Regulation there will be a ban on the sale of fish and shellfish caught by recreational fishermen. This means, in my view, that recreational fishing for lobster is likely to decrease, as it will only be permissible to fish for one’s own use. Six lobster traps per person should, in my view, meet the need for recreational fishing for lobster for one's own use. I therefore propose that the exception for lobster which now applies should be removed.</p>
<h2>Freshwater crayfish</h2>
<p>It has also been drawn to my attention that there is a problem with fishing for crayfish in public waters under the existing Fishery Act. The Committee on Agriculture argued in Report 1992/93:JOU23 Fishery Act etc. that fishing for crayfish in public waters in Lakes Vänern, Vättern, Hjälmaren and Storsjön in Jämtland ought to be reserved for commercial fishing. However, no such provision was introduced into the Fishery Act. On the other hand, it follows from Chapter 2 Section 8 of the Fishery Ordinance that the Swedish Board of Fisheries may, if necessary, specify that fishing for crayfish in public waters in Lakes Vänern, Vättern, Hjälmaren and Storsjön in Jämtland may only be carried on with permission from the Board. Permits are primarily to be issued to those who engage in commercial fishing. However, the situation regarding fishing for crayfish has changed since the earlier Fishery Act came into existence. Availability of crayfish is now good. There is therefore, in my view, no reason to reserve this type of fishing for commercial fishermen. I therefore propose that the possibility of the Swedish Board of Fisheries making fishing for crayfish in these waters subject to a permit be removed. In so doing I bring about uniform regulation of recreational fishing which in future will also cover lobster and crayfish.</p>
<h2>Fishing tourism</h2>
<p>Those who carry on fishing tourism  will continue to be included in the category of recreational fishermen. However, I consider it wrong that recreation-based restrictions on gear should apply to this category. Tourist activity promotes enterprise, growth and employment and can contribute to keeping coastal communities alive. I therefore propose that fishing tourism should have access to the necessary quantity of fishing gear. I am also of the opinion that the EU ban on sales does not pose an obstacle to carrying on fishing tourism.</p>
<h2>Private fishing rights</h2>
<p>Private waters , as previously, should be at the disposal of property owners or owners of fishing rights. The latter should in future continue to be able to engage in recreational fishing in their waters without restrictions on gear. Owners of fishing rights have previously been able to carry on commercial fishing in their waters without being required to hold a licence. I must, however, propose that permits be required in future for commercial fishing with vessels at sea, as this has long been a mandatory EU requirement. Other commercial fishing can, however, be freely carried on by the property owner/owner of fishing rights.</p>
<p>I retain the extensive  public right to fish in private waters principally unchanged. To clarify what is already considered to apply, I add that restrictions on gear apply to recreational fishing and that commercial fishing is conditional on a fishing licence. The giant Pacific oyster, however, will no longer be reserved for the property owner/owner of fishing rights. For the same reason as for recreational fishermen in public waters, I extend the public right to fish not just to Swedish citizens but to other EU citizens as well.</p>
<h2>Hand-held gear</h2>
<p>The provisions on hand-held  gear  are particularly unclear in the Fishery Act, as fishing with hand-held gear in private waters has been part of the public right to fish. To clarify what applies, I have therefore regulated fishing with manual gear separately in my proposal. Everyone, as previously, has the right fish with hand-held gear in public waters and in private waters along the coasts and in Lakes Vänern, Vättern, Mälaren, Hjälmaren and Storsjön in Jämtland. On the southern part of the east coast and in the lakes, fishing with handheld gear is a source of conflicts. To reduce these conflicts, I propose that fishing with hand-held gear there should not comprise more than two items of fishing gear. As previously, the fishing method as such employed there must not require the use of a boat or consist of fishing with the winter fishing rig known as an 'angeldon'.</p>
<h2>Simpler permit requirements for commercial fishing Current situation</h2>
<p>There are several different permit requirements today to carry on commercial fishing. Firstly a commercial fishing licence  is required to carry on commercial fishing. These permits are granted by the Swedish Board of Fisheries and can only be issued to physical persons. The purpose of the commercial fishing licence is to preserve the fish resource for a limited number of commercial fishermen, guarantee attachment to Sweden and take account of regional aspects. Restriction of the number of commercial fishermen is now achieved through a requirement that the fishing has to be of essential significance to supply. This requirement has been set at a net amount of SEK 20 000 per year. In addition, the requirement for a commercial fishing licence contains requirements on rejuvenation of the fishing profession and gender equality aspects.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a requirement for vessel permits . This is an EU requirement. This too is granted by the Swedish Board of Fisheries. The significance of the requirement is that the vessels with a maximum length of five metres or more may only be used for commercial fishing at sea with a permit from the Swedish Board of Fisheries. The requirement for vessel permits is also intended to guarantee that the resource is reserved for a limited number of commercial fishermen and ensure attachment to Sweden and consideration of regional policy aspects. In addition, the requirement is intended to comply with EU legislation on entry to/exit from the fishing fleet. The Member States are obliged to adapt the fishing capacity of their fleets so that a stable and sustainable balance is achieved between this fishing capacity and their fishing opportunities.</p>
<h2>Physical persons and legal entities</h2>
<p>The problem with this dual legislation is that although the requirements are partially identical they are formulated differently. To simplify, I propose that there should only be one fundamental permit requirement. Having two different permit requirements which overlap is too complicated. I combine the two permit requirements into one and give this the name fishing licence . The holder of the permit may be a physical person or a legal entity. The permit must not contain more requirements than necessary. The requirements on rejuvenation of the fishing profession and gender equality aspects, for example, are omitted.</p>
<h2>Corporation tax certificates</h2>
<p>The most important issue, however, is who is to be allowed to carry on commercial fishing. Access to the fishing resource follows from definition as a commercial fisherman. In return, legislation in future will lay down requirements relating for example to knowledge. It is important that a clear dividing line is retained between commercial and recreational fishing.</p>
<p>A decisive difference that already exists in the regulatory system, but in legislation other than the Fishery Act, is in tax law. Business activity is defined in Chapter 13 Section 1 of the Income Tax Act (1999:1229) as gainful employment carried on professionally and independently. This means that there is already a functioning system that distinguishes commercial fishing from the hobby activity. There is also already an authority (the Swedish Tax Agency) which does this appraisal and in addition provides those who carry on the professional activity with a certificate if the outcome of the appraisal is positive, namely the corporation tax certificate (F-skattesedel). My basic position is that the same ought to apply to commercial fishing as to other professional activity. I propose that anyone wishing to carry on commercial fishing should have to hold a corporation tax certificate. This would replace the previous income requirement.</p>
<h2>Permits and freedom of trade Special fishing permits</h2>
<p>As well as a commercial fishing licence and vessel permit, commercial fishermen today need a third permit, the special permit . The requirements for these special permits today are not contained in the Fishery Act or Fishery Ordinance but in Swedish Board of Fisheries regulations. Special permits are used in two typical cases: to allocate EU quotas and also to allocate unregulated fishing.</p>
<p>Many fish species are subject to EU quotas. These quotas are allocated through the special permits. The criteria for quota allocation are based on historical fishing. This means that someone who has previously fished most receives the largest allocation. In addition, special permits are required for other commercial fishing, that is to say fishing not subject to EU quotas. The reason for this relates to both resource allocation and fishery conservation considerations. A commercial fisherman wishing to fish in a particular area must have a special permit to do so. In that way the Swedish Board of Fisheries is able to ensure that too many fishermen do not fish within an area. If everyone who wanted to carry on commercial fishing in the area were to do so, fishing would become unprofitable for everyone, which would in turn lead to harder fishing. Commercial fishermen wishing to fish every year must instead apply for a special permit. If, for example, 50 fishermen wanted to fish and applied to be allowed to fish, permits would only be granted to such a number that fishing is estimated to be profitable for them and justifiable from the point of view of fishery conservation. Those who are principally granted permits are those who are able to show that they have carried on the same fishing in the previous year.</p>
<p>I have fundamental doubts over whether the fishing fleet should continue to be so strictly regulated. I consider the individual commercial fishermen in fact to be better suited to assessing whether his fishing can be sustainably profitable than a government agency. At the same time I am well aware that a change-over from a strictly regulated industry to a more market-adapted one may have severe consequences, which might have a serious impact on fishery conservation. Another problem is that free market forces have been weakened by various subsidies. My conclusion is, therefore, that as fishing represents a limited resource it is necessary for fishing capacity to be limited.</p>
<p>However, the situation outlined above does not only have political dimensions but also formal aspects. Under the Instrument of Government freedom of trade applies in Sweden. I have analysed what this may signify for fisheries. The conclusion I have reached is that fishery conservation factors and regional considerations may limit freedom of trade. On the other hand, it is incompatible with the Constitution to limit the right to fish in order to guarantee that profitability for certain commercial fishermen will be acceptable. The principle of equality is an element of freedom of trade, and signifies that no one may be financially favoured at the expense of anyone else. It is not permissible to introduce rules which mean new business set-ups in a particular industry or a particular profession are prevented as this represents protection for those whose businesses are already established.</p>
<p>On this basis I propose that the competent authority should take account of fishery conservation and regional policy aspects in particular in allocating fisheries. The authority must obviously analyse in depth what effects far-reaching fishery conservation measures have for commercial fishing. As follows from the introductory section of the law, a balance must be struck so that the competitiveness of commercial fishing is not adversely affected.</p>
<p>The competent authority therefore has to have far-reaching powers which make good fishery conservation possible. It must also be able to issue all the regulations required by the EU.</p>
<h2>Regional influence</h2>
<p>Fishing in Sweden by tradition is highly varied in geographical terms. However, I consider there to be a need for a nationally coherent law which is possible to understand. At the same time, it is crucial, in my view, to have expanded consultation between users, stakeholders and authorities.</p>
<p>Fish management today is a conflict-ridden area, and there are commonly different views on the situation regarding fish stocks. A common view is required on those problems that need to be resolved. Expanded consultation can contribute to the emergence of such a common view. Such consultation would need to have a regional consensus. I propose that regional councils should be attached to the competent authority containing representatives of affected authorities and stakeholder organisations. The task of the councils would be to assist the authority in addressing regional issues.</p>
<h2>Right to fish with hand-held gear</h2>
<p>An important task would be find voluntary solutions for fishery conservation in those areas where the right to fish with hand-held gear is exercised. I do not see any prospect of solving the economic problem with recreational fishing with hand-held gear and fishery conservation. There is already a significant basis for the Government to propose a general fishery conservation charge, for example. I therefore propose voluntary solutions. I know that there is interest in fishery conservation and charges among all the parties concerned, for example the Swedish Association for Recreational Anglers and the Federation of Fishing Rights Owners. My view is that the regional councils could, to a great extent, represent a platform for voluntary, regional agreements without the support of legislation. Experience of such successful measures could, in the longer term, form the basis for legislation. It has been stated by the Swedish Board of Fisheries that five regional councils could reflect the different regions of Sweden.</p>
<h2>The penal provisions in the Fishery Conservation Act</h2>
<h2>Blanket penal provisions</h2>
<p>I have identified blanket penal provisions in the Fishery Act. A blanket penal provision is a penal provision which does not, on its own, contain all the information needed to decide what is a criminal offence but is supplemented by reference to other rules. Under a Supreme Court judgment, NJA 2005, p. 33, the Instrument of Government does not always permit blanket penal provisions with imprisonment  in the scale of penalties to be supplemented by regulations issued by government agencies. What is not permitted is for the act which is punished to be fully or substantially described in authority regulations. Such a blanket penal provision is not permitted. The background to the Supreme Court judgment is the fundamental idea that the individual citizen has to be protected against being deprived of his or her liberty. It is therefore important that the individual can easily assess what behaviour can lead to a custodial sentence.</p>
<p>The penal provisions in the Fishery Act which impose penalties under EU Regulations are also worded as blanket penal provisions. EU Regulations are directly applicable in Sweden. This means that they are not to be recast or incorporated into the text of a Swedish statutory instrument. On the other hand, EU Regulations do not contain any penal provisions and assume that certain forms of behaviour will be punished under national law. To enable EU Regulations to be subject to penalties under Swedish law, the penal provisions must be worded as blanket penal provisions.</p>
<p>The penal sanctions relating to EU provisions in the Fishery Conservation Act will therefore have to be worded as a blanket penal provision. To increase clarity, I propose that a new provision be introduced into the Fishery Conservation Act which states that the Government or the authority designated by the Government in regulations must list which EU Regulations are referred to.</p>
<p>Most of the national detailed regulations on fisheries are issued by the Swedish Board of Fisheries and are collated in the Board's</p>
<p>Code of Statutes. This is an arrangement which is reported to work well and which I wish to retain. Nor is anything different possible in practice with regard to fishing regulations. This necessitates wording the penal provisions as blanket penal provisions. Such penal provisions, in order to be compatible with the Constitution, must not contain imprisonment in the scale of penalties. The scale of penalties must therefore be amended for this to be possible.</p>
<h2>Remove imprisonment from the scale of penalties</h2>
<p>Non-permitted blanket penal provisions are thus a problem in the Fishery Act. Another problem with the penal provisions in the Fishery Act is that they are obscure and variable. The same penal provisions may, for example, have different scales of penalties depending on where the contravention occurred.</p>
<p>To resolve the problems I have identified, I propose that the scale of penalties for fishing offences should no long contain imprisonment and should solely consist of fines. The amended scale of penalties should apply both to contraventions of national provisions and contraventions of EU Regulations as well as obstruction of international fisheries control. This would contribute to simplification and uniformity and facilitate the work of those charged with implementing the law. As far as I have been able to ascertain, imprisonment has, in addition, never been handed down as a sanction for a fishing offence.</p>
<p>Under my proposal for the removal of imprisonment from the scale of penalties it would become possible in accordance with the rules contained in the Instrument of Government on standard setting for the Swedish Board of Fisheries to supplement the blanket penal provision with its regulations to the same extent as happens now. This proposal thus solves the problem of the non-permitted blanket penal provisions.</p>
<p>The proposal for removal of imprisonment from the scale of penalties also solves the problem of different scales of penalties. Sweden is bound by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, according to which the scale of penalties for offences committed in Sweden’s exclusive economic zone is not allowed to include imprisonment. There are therefore exceptions to the principal rule for such offences in the Fishery Act. I do not consider such a difference to be reasonable. The removal of imprisonment from the scale of penalties creates a regulation which is clear and uniform, as the scale of penalties will be the same whether the offence is committed in the Swedish exclusive economic zone or in other waters.</p>
<p>My proposal for the removal of imprisonment is justified solely by the endeavour to create clearer and more uniform regulation and by the need for the penal provisions to be constitutional. The intention behind my proposal is not to lower the penalty value of offences. On the contrary, it is to be possible in practice to impose stiffer penal sanctions than happens today. I therefore propose that the scope for standardised fines be broadened and that the basis for calculation of these fines be tightened up. The proposal in my opinion entails improved opportunities to fulfil EU requirements for tougher sanctions for serious infringements of common fisheries policy. My intention is a general tightening of penalties for fishing offences.</p>
<p>To improve fishery control, it should be possible for negligence which is not gross also to lead to criminal liability in the case of EU regulations on the Common Fisheries Policy. This would also contribute to uniformity, as it already applies to contraventions of national provisions. I have also added a number of types of behaviour to the penal provision on EU rules. This has been done primarily on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (the IUU Regulation), but also on the basis of the new Control Regulation (see below under the heading of Control Regulation).</p>
<h2>Offences committed in business activity should be penalised by imposition of standardised fines</h2>
<p>I propose that a special provision be introduced for certain offences committed in business activity. The provision on gross contraventions is placed here. Gross offences will therefore only be offences committed in commercial fishing. The sanction for offences committed in commercial fishing if the offence relates to activity which involves use of fishing vessels with engines must be standardised fines, and this applies to both simple and gross offences. Standardised fines mean fines which are determined solely according to a special basis of calculation indicated for the offence; in the Fishery Conservation Act this is related to the number of kilowatts of engines on the vessel. The level of the fine is therefore higher in the case of large engines than small ones. My proposal in this area means that the scope for standardised fines is expanded in relation to the Fishery Act and that the basis of calculation for such fines is tightened. The rules are clarified by specific statement of what is applicable to the calculation of penalties for a gross offence. The broadening of the standardised fines means that penalties can be given the desired strictness in those situations where this is most needed and can contribute towards Sweden fulfilling the EU requirement to adopt a more stringent approach to fishery offences.</p>
<h2>Obstruction of enforcement and control to be made a criminal offence</h2>
<p>I propose that a new penal provision be introduced which specifies penalties for obstruction of enforcement and control. Introduction of the provision signifies some expansion of the area of criminal liability. In this way Sweden shows that it takes a serious view of contraventions and that it is very important that those who exercise control and enforcement are given an opportunity to carry out their work as well as possible.</p>
<p>A new provision should be introduced into the new Fishery Conservation Act which makes searches of premises possible even if the sanction for the act committed can only consist of fines. The provision on searches of premises in the Code of Judicial Procedure is only applicable if the scale of penalties contains imprisonment.</p>
<h2>Expansion of confiscation and forfeiture</h2>
<p>The provision on confiscation in the Fishery Conservation Act principally corresponds to that in the Fishery Act. However, I reintroduce the possibility of confiscating fishing gear which has been deployed in water and used to commit offences contrary to the Act.</p>
<p>My proposal also means that the provisions on forfeiture are amended so that it is clearly apparent that forfeiture of fish can take place not only in the event of offences consisting of illegal fishing but also in the case of other offences contrary to fishery regulations. This contributes to heightening the response to a committed offence.</p>
<h2>The most serious contraventions should be returned to the criminal system</h2>
<p>The system of sanction charges is relatively new and is said in the main to work well. It has therefore in principle been transferred to the Fishery Conservation Act unchanged with one important difference. It has emerged in application of the provisions that some offences which are to be regarded as serious have come under the system of sanction charges. The consequence of this has been that certain serious offences can only be penalised by payment of a charge. This is not acceptable. To deal with this, I propose a solution whereby the serious contraventions of common fisheries policy which today are subject to payment of a sanction charge be returned to the criminal system.</p>
<h2>It should be possible for fishing licences to be revoked for offences committed in the activity to which the licence relates</h2>
<p>My proposal for a Fishery Conservation Act, just like the Fishery Act, contains a provision enabling a fishing licence to be revoked, both permanently and for a particular period of time. This has, however, been formulated somewhat differently in the Fishery Conservation Act, due to the differing terminology and systematic classification in the Fishery Conservation Act.</p>
<p>As a fishing licence under the Fishery Conservation Act may be attached to both a physical person and legal entity, I propose that the possibility of revoking a licence be attached to whether an offence has been committed in the activity to which the licence relates. This means that a fishing licence can be revoked on the basis of a fishing offence committed for example by an employee if the offence has taken place in the activity to which the licence relates.</p>
<p>I also propose that the Government or the authority designated by the Government should be able to withdraw or limit the number of days of fishing if the fishing licence for the activity for which the days have been allocated has been revoked or limited. This adds further stringency to the revoking of a licence, which is consistent with the notion that a stricter approach to fishery offences should be adopted.</p>
<h2>The Control Regulation and the Fishery Conservation Act</h2>
<p>The EU’s new Control Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 came into force on 1 January 2010. The Control Regulation is directly applicable and neither has to be, nor may it be, implemented through national law. On the other hand, I have closely examined the Regulation and analysed the need for statutory amendments which it may signify. My proposal for a Fishery Conservation Act has to be compatible with the Control Regulation and certain parts of it have been directly influenced by the Regulation.</p>
<h2>Other issues</h2>
<p>As well as the items stated above, I have investigated a number of other issues of a more legal nature. These include the issue of attachment to Sweden for commercial fishing and the demarcation between the Environmental Code and the Fishery Conservation Act. I have also considered whether the legislation on transferable fishing rights should be developed. It came as recently as August 2009. The purpose was to promote the vessel structure in pelagic commercial fishing. The legislation can be expected to have a positive impact on the vessel structure. However, it leads to great changes for individual commercial fishermen. My conclusion is therefore that it is appropriate for the reform of pelagic fishing to be evaluated before it can be appropriate to propose equivalent legislation for other fishing.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>I propose that the Fishery Conservation Act should come into effect on 1 January 2012.</p>
