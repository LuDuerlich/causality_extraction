<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Background</p>
<p>From 1 January 2005, a scheme for trading in emission allowances (‘emissions trading’) is to be introduced in the EU. This trading scheme will be based on a directive (the ‘trading directive’) that was formally adopted in October 2003. The scheme will be an instrument of climate policy, aimed at reducing emissions of GHGs in the Union in a cost-effective and economically efficient way.</p>
<p>The Community trading scheme will comprise various periods. During the first (2005−2007), the scheme will include emissions of CO only. Moreover, during this initial period the scheme will cover only installations in energy-intensive industry (production and processing of ferrous metals, minerals, and paper, paperboard and pulp) and combustion units in heat and power production with capacity exceeding certain levels. In Sweden, some 500 units will be included.</p>
<p>In May 2003, in its interim report Trading for a Better Climate (SOU 2003:60), the Commission on a system and regulatory framework for the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol (FlexMex2 Commission) reported on the principles on which Sweden’s allocation of emission allowances should be based. In the light of this report and the comments of the official bodies consulted, in December 2003 the Swedish Government issued its bill on the principles of implementation of the Community trading directive (Government Bill 2003/04:31, report 2003/04:MJU11, Govt. Comm. 2003/04:150).</p>
<p>On 22 April 2004 the Government submitted Sweden’s national allocation plan to the European Commission. Under the trading</p>
<p>directive, a country’s allocation of emission allowances must be determined by means of a plan of this kind.</p>
<p>In its second interim report Trading for a Better Climate – permits, allocation, etc (SOU 2003:120) in November 2003, the FlexMex2 Commission put forward proposals for statutes relating mainly to issues connected with permits and allocation. These statutes were intended to enter into force on 1 July 2004. Matters relating to sanctions, supervision and appeals in connection with permits and allocation were also dealt with in this interim report. The trading directive’s provisions in relation to the rules of environmental law, and the question of whether the installations included in the Community trading scheme should be exempted from CO tax, were also discussed.</p>
<p>Taking the second interim report and the official consultative bodies’ viewpoints into consideration, the Government presented its Bill Trading in Emission Allowances I (Government Bill 2003/04:132) on 15 April 2004. The Bill introduced a new Act on emissions of carbon dioxide, containing certain regulations on permits for CO emissions and allocation of emission allowances. Amendments to the Swedish Environmental Code were also proposed to rule out, for the installations included in the trading scheme, stipulations requiring reductions in CO emissions or indirectly — by regulating the quantity of fossil fuel used — aimed at reducing these emissions.</p>
<p>Purpose of the interim report and some preconditions</p>
<p>The foremost purpose of the present interim report is to put forward a proposal for a comprehensive statute to introduce the EU emission-allowance trading scheme. The draft statute has, where appropriate, been adapted to the proposals in Government Bill 2003/04:132. The proposals made in this report include a complete draft statute on trading in emission allowances. The complete ‘Emission Allowance Trading Act’ can then come into force on 1 January 2005.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Swedish installations already in existence that will take part in the trading scheme in the normal course of events will apply for permits pursuant to the law proposed in Government Bill 2003/04:132. This law, which aims primarily at regulating the 2005–2007 period, refers only to permits for CO 2</p>
<p>emissions. The law on trading in emission allowances that is proposed in the present interim report, and which is conceived as applying with minimal changes needing to be made from 2008, refers instead to permits for emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), as does the EU trading directive as well. A provision on entry of the law into force, however, makes it clear that the references to GHGs apply only to CO for the 2005–2007 period. However, since the FlexMex2 Commission often refers in the present report to the conditions that Bill 2003/04:132 is intended to regulate, here and there we use the term ‘permits for CO emissions’, although the law we propose refers, as mentioned above, to ‘permits for GHG emissions’.</p>
<p>By way of introduction, it should also be pointed out that introducing the trading directive into Swedish law requires certain other Community regulations to be issued, and where relevant made statutory in Sweden. This applies, in particular, to the European Commission regulation concerning the registries in which emission allowances are to be recorded, and to the Commission’s guidelines concerning GHG monitoring and reporting. Work on the Registries Regulation in the EU is, however, greatly delayed and no definitive version of this regulation will exist until July 2004 at the earliest.</p>
<p>Below, the proposals put forward in the interim report are summarised.</p>
<p>Proposed rules on monitoring, reporting and verification of CO emissions</p>
<p>To permit the quantity of CO emissions to be reconciled, after a financial year, with the number of allowances granted, it is essential for the emissions to be reported correctly. The trading directive therefore contains certain requirements that operators should monitor their emissions and, after the end of every calendar year, report to the public agency concerned on the emissions from the installation during the calendar year concerned. In Sweden, the agency responsible for these matters will be the National Environmental Protection Agency. To ensure that the emission figures are correct, a verifier who is independent in relation to the operator must also check the emissions to verify the report in accordance</p>
<p>with certain criteria. The FlexMex2 Commission’s proposals on this matter are summarised below.</p>
<p>Monitoring and reporting</p>
<p>• Operators are obliged to monitor and report on their own emissions of GHGs. Reporting must be by means of written annual reports. Operators are responsible for ensuring that the report is examined by a verifier, who must meet the requirements listed under the heading ‘Verification’ below. The report must be handed in to the supervisory authority (the Environmental Protection Agency) not later than 31 March in the year following the calendar year to which the report refers. Monitoring of the emissions must be done by means of calculation or measurement.</p>
<p>• For every installation, reports must contain a description of the measuring or calculation methods used, including information about aggregate emissions and the reliability of the measurement or estimate, and also particulars of quality assurance and control.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Government or the agency appointed by the same is authorised to issue regulations concerning monitoring and reporting.</p>
<p>• It is important to simplify, as far as possible, the requisite procedures for the operators and agencies concerned. In the FlexMex2 Commission’s view, enabling reporting of emissions to take place electronically is therefore imperative.</p>
<p>Verification</p>
<p>• Verification of the annual report on GHG emissions should be carried out by a verifier who is accredited for the task under the Technical Inspection Act (1992:1119).</p>
<p>• Equated with a verifier in this context is a verifier in another Member State in the European Economic Area who has been appointed to perform verification pursuant to the trading directive. The operator must demonstrate that this person has the status of verifier of such activities in another Member State.</p>
<p>• The supervisory authority (the Environmental Protection Agency) may issue regulations on requirements to which the verifier is subject, and the tasks that the verifier is to carry out.</p>
<p>• The FlexMex2 Commission considers that reciprocal recognition of Member States' verifiers should be a feature of work throughout the EU, and that Sweden should endeavour to promote this harmonisation. No decision on the matter of reciprocity has yet, however, been taken at EU level.</p>
<p>• Individual operators must defray the costs they incur as a result of introducing the system for monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions.</p>
<p>Proposals regarding registry issues</p>
<p>The FlexMex2 Commission wishes to point out that the EC Registries Regulation has not yet been finalised. The draft regulation that forms the basis of this interim report is currently the subject of negotiations among the Member States. Amendments or additions to the existing draft Registries Regulation may come to modify the basis for the views and proposals put forward in this report.</p>
<p>For Sweden’s part, the registries system will comprise three parts: a register of the installations concerned, a national emissionallowance registry and a central, EU-wide registry. The Swedish Energy Agency will be responsible for the national emission-allow- ance registry. The European Commission will be in charge of the overall EU registry.</p>
<p>The purpose is for the registry to ‘keep the system in order’, so that no errors arise in connection with the issue, transfer or cancellation of emission allowances. This is crucial if people are to have confidence in the trading scheme. It is in the registry that trading companies obtain access to the allowances allocated to them. However, it is important to note that the national registry has nothing to do with the actual marketplace for emission allowances.</p>
<p>Given the EC Registries Regulation and the supplementary provisions on registry issues proposed in Chapter 4 of the draft statute</p>
<p>concerning such issues as the legal consequences of pledging, distraint and bankruptcy, the FlexMex2 Commission considers that a complete set of regulations governing registry issues exists.</p>
<p>General</p>
<p>Banking will not be permitted between the trial period (2005–2007) and the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2008–2012).</p>
<p>Registration of pledging</p>
<p>The option of pledging or mortgaging emission allowances has a bearing on the economic value of the allowances, like other financial instruments. The FlexMex2 Commission proposes a system for mortgages on emission allowances that bears a marked resemblance to the system applying to mortgages on the Swedish greenelectricity certificates. The principal features of the system are as follows:</p>
<p>• If a mortgage on an emission allowance has been granted, following an application from the pledger, a mortgage should be registered in the pledger’s account where the emission allowance is registered. If the pledgee has applied for this registration, final registration of the mortgage may take place only after the pledger has been given the opportunity to submit a statement.</p>
<p>• When a mortgage on an emission allowance has ceased, in a manner corresponding to that of registration when a mortgage has been granted, the registration should be removed from the pledger’s account where the emission allowance is registered.</p>
<p>• An emission allowance subject to a mortgage may not be annulled except in the event that the emission allowance is no longer valid because the period for which it was issued has expired. If, in such a case, the emission allowance is annulled, the pledgee should nonetheless be entitled to demand payment for a claim even if its payment has not fallen due.</p>
<p>Registration of bankruptcy, distraint, attachment and sequestration</p>
<p>To ensure protection of real right for the possessors of rights and for third parties, the FlexMex2 Commission proposes registration of bankruptcy, distraint, attachment and sequestration, as well as pledging. The Commission’s proposal is as follows:</p>
<p>• When the Swedish Energy Agency has been informed that an account holder in the registry has become insolvent or an emission allowance has been distrained, attached or sequestered, the Agency shall ensure that these circumstances are recorded in the registry. The Agency shall remove this registration when it no longer applies.</p>
<p>• An emission allowance that has been distrained, attached or sequestered may not be annulled except in the event that the allowance is no longer valid because the period for which it was issued has expired.</p>
<p>Legal consequences of registration</p>
<p>When it comes to securities or other personal property, the fact of the property being transferred (handed over) to the purchaser was formerly crucial to protection of real right, i.e. protection vis-à-vis third parties. For securities currently regarded as financial instruments, the registration principle expressed in Chapter 6 of the Act (1998:1479) on Registration of Financial Instruments applies. One implication of this principle is that the person registered as the owner of financial instruments in an account should, with the restrictions associated with the account, be regarded as entitled to control the financial instruments registered in the account (see Chapter 5, Section 1).</p>
<p>• The FlexMex2 Commission proposes that the registration principle should apply to emission allowances, with the difference that the principle cannot be upheld for acquisition of emission allowances in good faith as in, for example, double transfer.</p>
<p>Secrecy for data in the emission-allowance registry</p>
<p>Public access to environmental information may be restricted according to the provisions of Articles 3.3 and 4 of Council Directive 2003/4/EC of 28 January 2003 on public access to environmental information and annulment of Council Directive 90/313/EC (the environmental information directive).</p>
<p>The fact that data are collected and kept by a public agency means that the documents concerned are public ones. Restriction on access to public documents is prescribed in the Secrecy Act.</p>
<p>The FlexMex2 Commission proposes the following:</p>
<p>• Secrecy should apply to the Swedish Energy Agency’s activities relating to keeping the registry, with respect to particulars that provide or contribute to information about the status of a holder’s account, unless it is clear that the information can be disclosed without the account holder incurring a loss.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Energy Agency must provide the supervisory authority, i.e. the Environmental Protection Agency, with information in the  emission-allowance registry regarding the status of an account in the registry.</p>
<p>Proposals concerning penalties, other sanctions and damages</p>
<p>Penalties</p>
<p>The trading directive contains provisions laying down that penalties applicable to infringements of the national regulations adopted pursuant to the directive should be ‘effective, proportionate and dissuasive’.</p>
<p>• Given this background, the FlexMex2 Commission proposes that criminal liability be introduced – over and above what will apply under the forthcoming Act (2004:000) on emissions of carbon dioxide – for those who wilfully submit incorrect or misleading information concerning their monitoring or in their reports on CO emissions.</p>
<p>Other sanctions</p>
<p>Other forms of sanction are prescribed in the trading directive. The FlexMex2 Commission proposes incorporating these into Swedish law as follows:</p>
<p>• The name(s) of any operator(s) failing to surrender, not later than 30 April, a sufficient number of emission allowances in relation to GHG emissions in the previous year should be published.</p>
<p>• The operator(s) concerned should pay, for failing to surrender a sufficient number of emission allowances, a charge to the state based on the difference between the emission allowances sur-</p>
<p>rendered and the actual emissions, counted in tonnes of CO equivalents. This charge should be set at an amount corre-</p>
<p>sponding to €40 for every tonne of CO equivalents for the 2005−2007 period, and €100 for the subsequent commitment periods, starting in 2008.</p>
<p>• Payment of the charge does not release the operator, when the operator surrenders emission allowances for the subsequent calendar year, from the obligation to surrender the number of emission allowances corresponding to the excess emissions.</p>
<p>• The Environmental Protection Agency should publish the names of operators who have not surrendered sufficient emission allowances, and set the penalty charge for an operator’s failure to surrender a sufficient number. The Government should be authorised to issue regulations on the manner and place for publication of these names.</p>
<p>Damages</p>
<p>Other legislation prescribes strict liability for damages for keeping a registry in which technical errors arise that inflict loss on an individual. There is no such provision in the trading directive.</p>
<p>• The FlexMex2 Commission proposes that persons incurring losses owing to technical errors in the  emission-allowance registry or an associated registry should be entitled to compensation from the state. This compensation should be reduced or eliminated entirely if the person incurring the loss has contributed to the loss.</p>
<p>When it comes to other cases of the state’s obligation to pay compensation, the following should apply.</p>
<p>• Compensation due to administrative errors in management of the  emission-allowance registry and compensation for purely financial losses due to incorrect information or advice must be assessed on the basis of the state's obligation to pay damages under Chapter 3 of the Tort Liability Act.</p>
<p>Proposals concerning supervision, appeal and revocation of permits in certain cases</p>
<p>Supervision</p>
<p>The Government has previously decided that the supervision is to be carried out by the Swedish National Environmental Protection Agency. The FlexMex2 Commission’s proposals are as follows:</p>
<p>• The Environmental Protection Agency’s supervision should not include the Swedish Energy Agency’s activities.</p>
<p>• The Environmental Protection Agency should be entitled, on penalty of fine, to request the information and study the documents required for its supervision. The Agency should also be able, on penalty of fine, to issue the requisite injunctions and prohibitions to ensure compliance with the regulations included in its supervision.</p>
<p>• The Environmental Protection Agency should be able to apply to the Enforcement Authority for execution. The provisions in the Swedish Enforcement Code should apply to this execution.</p>
<p>• For its supervision, the Environmental Protection Agency should have access to the installations covered by the trading scheme, and also premises and areas belonging to such installations, to the extent that these are required for supervision. However, this should not apply to residential premises. The police authority must provide the assistance required for supervision.</p>
<p>Appeal</p>
<p>Decisions that should be appealable are those applying to individuals’ status in relation to the state. The FlexMex2 Commission proposes the following regulations concerning appeal:</p>
<p>• Appeals against the supervisory authority’s decisions regarding</p>
<p>permits for CO emissions may be lodged with the Environmental Court. The rules in the Environmental Code should apply to appeal to this court and the Environmental Court of Appeal .</p>
<p>• Decisions by the Environmental Protection Agency concerning allocation of emission allowances, imposition of fines and prohibitions, publication of the names of operators who have not fulfilled their obligation to surrender a sufficient number of emission allowances, and the charge for failing to fulfil this obligation should be appealable at a general administrative court.</p>
<p>• It should, in the FlexMex2 Commission’s view, be possible to publish a decision to announce the name of an operator who has not surrendered sufficient emission allowances although the decision has not entered into force. This publication may not take place until the appeal period has expired.</p>
<p>Revocation of permits in certain cases</p>
<p>Issue of emission allowances may take place until the end of the period in question, even if an operator chooses to discontinue activities at an installation during the period. Since it is important to maintain the connection that the FlexMex2 Commission has previously chosen to make between permits for CO emissions and the requisite permits under the Environmental Code or older environmental legislation, continued issue of emission allowances after the activity has ceased cannot take place if the environmental permit has been revoked.</p>
<p>Other permit issues</p>
<p>Revocation of a permit shall not be possible if an operator has failed to report a sufficient number of emission allowances. If an operator with a permit to emit CO does not fulfil the require-</p>
<p>ments that may come to be imposed with respect to other GHGs, the permit may be revoked or conditions in the permit amended or cancelled.</p>
<p>Proposals regarding financing of the trading scheme</p>
<p>The FlexMex2 Commission has estimated the extent of public expenditure that will arise as a result of the introduction of trading in emission allowances. Establishing the scheme is expected to entail non-recurring costs, especially during the years 2003–04, of some SEK 23–28 million, including roughly SEK 8m connected with the registry. In addition, costs of current activities, i.e. primarily costs from the year 2005, will arise. These are estimated at some SEK 12–13 m a year, including roughly SEK 5m connected with the registry. The FlexMex2 Commission assumes that non-recurring costs of establishing the scheme are already financed. When it comes to the costs of current activities, the FlexMex2 Commission’s view is that it should be possible to cover financing requirements by means of charges, as follows:</p>
<p>• In accordance with the Registries Regulation, the Swedish Energy Agency should be entitled to impose charges for setting up and keeping accounts in the  emission-allowance registry, pursuant to the detailed regulations issued by the Government. However, this charge may not be of such a nature as to be based on the costs of current transactions.</p>
<p>• The Government should instruct the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate whether there are other possible means of using charges to finance the public expenditure arising in connection with the  day-to-day work involved in trading in emission allowances. This assignment should be carried out in consultation with the Swedish Energy Agency.</p>
<p>• If further investigation work shows that current activities need to be fully or partially financed by means of grants, the FlexMex2 Commission assumes that redistribution of expenditure can take place within existing spending limits.</p>
<p>Proposals concerning tax and accounting implications</p>
<p>• Emission allowances are intended for trading in the securities market. With reference to the Riksdag (Swedish Parliament) resolution concerning  green-electricity certificates, emission allowances should be regarded as financial instruments since there are no relevant differences between emission allowances and green-electricity certificates.</p>
<p>• The accounting obligation and reporting on emission allowances must comply with general regulations in the Accounting Act, laws relating to annual reports, and supplementary norms. Taxation of emission allowances may take place with the application of current provisions.</p>
<p>• Assessment of the fiscal treatment of income in the category of income from commercial activities must be postponed until a report has been issued on an assignment given to the National Tax Board by the Government. This assignment entails an overview of whether it is possible to introduce joint tax regulations for  green-electricity certificates, emission allowances and what is known as decoupled income support for individual farms.</p>
<p>Proposals regarding administration of CO tax</p>
<p>• Installations covered by the ‘Emission Allowance Trading Act’</p>
<p>should be exempt from CO tax, with the exception of installations in heat production . ‘Double taxation’ in the heat-produc- tion sector should, however, be avoided. Companies in this sector should therefore be entitled to compensation for the costs of the portion of emissions covered by emission allowances they have purchased. This kind of compensation should take such a form that the aggregate tax levy and the cost of pur-</p>
<p>chasing emission allowances do not exceed the CO tax rate before compensation.</p>
<p>• The  tax-revenue shortfall should be financed through a special</p>
<p>property tax on hydropower stations and/or raised CO tax on fuels.</p>
<p>Proposals regarding the trading directive and the</p>
<p>Environmental Code</p>
<p>• No requirements concerning energy efficiency should be</p>
<p>imposed on combustion units or other units that emit CO on the site, and for which there are permits for CO emissions under the ‘Emission Allowance Trading Act'.</p>
<p>• No requirements to give preference to renewable energy sources should be imposed on activities covered by the ‘Emission Allowance Trading Act'.</p>
<p>• Should there, on 1 January 2005, be installations covered by the ‘Emission Allowance Trading Act' for which conditions concerning energy efficiency and use of renewable energy sources have been imposed, these conditions should cease to apply.</p>
<p>• The regulations in Chapter 3, Section 2 of the Environmental Code on best possible technology should not apply to emis-</p>
<p>sions of CO for activities covered by the ‘Emission Allowance Trading Act'.</p>
<p>Proposals regarding the need for further regulation</p>
<p>Opt-out provision in the trading directive</p>
<p>Government Bill 2003/04:132 contains draft provisions permitting opt-out under the provision in Article 27 of the trading directive. According to the FlexMex2 Commission, this option of exclusion for individual installations should be investigated further to fulfil all the requirements imposed in Article 27.</p>
<p>Allocation</p>
<p>During 2006, the Member States are to draw up their own national allocation plans for the 2008–2012 commitment period. In contrast to the situation prevailing before allocation plans were drawn up for the 2005–2007 period, there is now scope for statutory regulation of various matters connected with the plan. The FlexMex2 Commission therefore proposes that:</p>
<p>• The Government should draw up a national allocation plan for each commitment period, and also publish the plan and submit</p>
<p>it to the European Commission, not later than 18 months before the beginning of the period concerned</p>
<p>• The Government should also determine the total number of emission allowances for the commitment period not later than 12 months before the beginning of the period concerned.</p>
<p>• Operators should submit to the Government information on which the national allocation plan is to be based.</p>
<p>• The FlexMex2 Commission also considers that statutory regulation of the allocation should, in general, be further clarified before the  2008–2012 commitment period.</p>
<p>Auction</p>
<p>In the FlexMex2 Commission’s view, it is imperative to analyse the requirements and implications of using an auction procedure for allocation of emission allowances for the 2008–2012 commitment period. One essential starting-point for this analysis, however, is that under the trading directive at least 90 per cent of emission allowances should be allocated free of charge during this period.</p>
<p>Where should the trading scheme be regulated?</p>
<p>The FlexMex2 Commission proposes that the trading scheme should continue to be regulated in special legislation, as it has been to date.</p>
<p>Implications of the proposals</p>
<p>In assessing the implications of the FlexMex2 Commission’s proposals, one should bear in mind that, as a member of the EU, Sweden is obliged to adhere to and introduce into Swedish legislation the rules for the trading scheme that are laid down in the trading directive. The option of choosing not to introduce such regulation is thus not possible.</p>
<p>For Sweden’s part, in its first interim report the FlexMex2 Commission cited estimates suggesting that the costs of attaining the national emissions objective for the period 2008−2010 with the trading scheme in place may be some SEK 1−3 billion lower annually than if only trading in Sweden were permitted. The first</p>
<p>interim report also contains other types of economic analyses, such as the implications of abolishing CO tax and the effects on various sectors of trading in emission allowances (see also SOU 2003:60, Chapter 10).</p>
<p>Introducing the trading scheme will inevitably entail certain new administrative requirements applying to the companies concerned. The administrative costs incurred by companies as a result of trading in emission allowances being introduced are likely to be relatively more burdensome for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) than for large ones.</p>
<p>The FlexMex2 Commission’s assessment is that the proposals put forward in this interim report are compatible with the regulations governing state aid.</p>
