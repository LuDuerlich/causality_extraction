<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>One of the goals of the major tax reform carried out in Sweden in 1990 and 1991 was to strengthen the role of the value added tax as a source of financing for government commitments. The introduction of a flat-rate tax that was the same for all taxable goods and services was among the means used to achieve this goal. Subsequently, however, targeted reductions in the value added tax have gradually been introduced in various policy areas. Consequently three different rates are currently being applied: 25, 12 and 6 per cent. This differentiation of the rates has brought with it various problems. The remit of the Value Added Tax Rate Inquiry includes identifying the demarcation problems that differentiation has led to. Also the judicial, administrative, economic, distribution policy, and budgetary aspects of the differentiation are to be analysed and the implications of the value added tax for competition domestically and internationally are to be assessed. The Inquiry is to consider various alternatives to the existing rate structure, including the alternative of returning to a single flat-rate tax.</p>
<h2>Recommendation for a Flat-Rate Tax</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s identification of demarcation problems and its analytical work were reported in its interim report, Flat-Rate or Differentiated Value Added Tax? (SOU 2005:57) in June 2005. The Inquiry concluded that the current tax differentiation leads to significant demarcation problems in most areas of consumption having a lower value added tax. The best solution to these problems is the introduction of regulations for a flat rate. A flat-rate tax would also have several other advantages, among them improving competitive neutrality, simplifying the work involved for companies and for the authorities, and contributing to the financing of a lower general value added tax. From a budgetary perspective, it would also help stabilise the tax base. Hence the Inquiry in its interim report recommended changing to a flat-rate tax and using the abolition of the lower rates to finance a reduction in the general level (the standard rate) from the current 25 per cent to 21.7 per cent.</p>
<p>The interim report has been circulated for comment and more than one hundred consultation bodies have commented. In summary, the majority of the consultation bodies apparently agree with the assessment that there are shortcomings in the existing system. However, opinions are divided on the flat-rate tax. Various bodies have said that they would like to see extended impact assessments and consideration of compensatory measures. The Inquiry’s terms of reference called for the final report now being presented to be based on the analyses in the interim report, while taking into account the views of the consultation bodies.</p>
<h2>Abolition of the Reduced Rates</h2>
<p>After considering the views expressed in the comments that the Inquiry received, it still thinks that the introduction of a flat-rate tax is clearly the best alternative for coming to grips with the problems it was asked to address. It is thus the opinion of the Inquiry that the proposal made in the recommendation in the interim report should be implemented. However, the comments received indicate the need for more work in some areas. This refers to the reduced rates introduced as policy instruments in certain policy areas, such as culture and tourism, in order to influence consumption and production. The consultation bodies have stressed the importance of these subsidies in order to achieve various social objectives. The argument has also been made that alternative forms of support would need to be considered if the support linked to the value added tax were to be discontinued. However, in this final report the Inquiry has not considered the need for support measures and their design outside the value added tax system since such matters are not part of its terms of reference. It would be better to address these issues separately. The Inquiry is also of the opinion that it would be best to coordinate the final implementation of the flat-rate tax with the implementation of earlier VAT proposals presented in the report SOU 2002:74. These earlier proposals will be the subject of additional work.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the Inquiry has chosen in its final report to focus on certain areas in which legislative measures can now be taken without awaiting any further inquiries. The proposals concern the VAT on foodstuffs and a number of demarcation and other corrections within the framework of the existing differentiated tax rates. These proposals also make possible recommendations to reduce the standard rate.</p>
<h2>The VAT on Foodstuffs</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has observed that the reduced rate on foodstuffs, 12 per cent, leads to demarcation and competition problems. The difference in the food dispensing services of various kinds (restaurants, etc.) is especially problematic since the standard rate of 25 per cent applies to service. These types of goods and services are handled by a large number of taxable persons. If the same rate is to be applied to the entire area, however, the VAT on foodstuffs will have to be raised, owing to EC legal provisions and other factors.</p>
<p>One reason for considering the abolition of the reduced rate on foodstuffs is that the reduction is costly from a budgetary perspective. About SEK 17.7 billion of the total 29.1 billion cost of the reduced rates can be attributed to foodstuffs (2005). This also means that abolishing the VAT on foodstuffs is estimated to make room for a reduction in the standard rate from the current 25 per cent to 22.9 per cent. This, in turn, means that the price of almost all other goods and services can be reduced.</p>
<p>The reduced VAT on foodstuffs was introduced as a general aid to households, especially for resource-poor households. The reason for the VAT on foodstuffs is thus income redistribution. However, the intent is not to influence food consumption or to support the food industry. No additional inquiry on sectoral subsidies may thus be needed in this area. However, it has been important to conduct a thorough analysis of the extent to which the reduced rate on foodstuffs can now be considered a satisfactory instrument for income redistribution.</p>
<p>In this analysis, the Inquiry has first examined the extent to which the reduced rate on foodstuffs can be assumed to have affected food prices. The conclusion is that no clear-cut impact on prices can be determined theoretically. Instead, it depends on the nature of demand and of the markets. However, increased competition in an area strengthens the conditions for a complete price pass-through in the long term, something that the Inquiry has chosen to assume in its estimates of the effects on income redistribution.</p>
<p>For a reduced rate on foodstuffs to have any function as an instrument of income redistribution, households with low income have to use a higher percentage of their income for food purchases than do better-off households. The figures produced by the Inquiry show that household spending on foodstuffs as a percentage of total spending has been falling for several years. These figures also show that differences between households whose finances differ are narrowing. Even if it is still true that food consumption by some groups such as families with children and some groups of pensioners is somewhat higher relative to other groups, the differences now are relatively small. This also means that the subsidy implied by the reduced rate is relatively evenly distributed among different types of households and among households with differing economic standards. Calculated in absolute numbers, the subsidy even increases with increasing household income. Thus the reduced rate gives households with the lowest income a subsidy equivalent to about SEK 2000 a year for each household member, whereas households with the highest income receive a subsidy of SEK 4000 a year for each household member. Single parents with children receive a total of about 4 per cent of the total subsidy (estimated to amount to SEK 18.4 billion in 2006) and single retired persons almost 10 per cent, while high income households (decile group 10) receive over 15 per cent.</p>
<h2>A Reduced Standard Rate and Abolition of the Reduced</h2>
<h2>Rate on Foodstuffs</h2>
<p>If the reduced rate on foodstuffs were discontinued, the tax rate on those goods and services now set at 25 per cent could be lowered to 22.9 per cent. For households as a whole, raising the VAT on foodstuffs to 22.9 per cent would be entirely offset by the reduction on other goods and services. The Inquiry’s estimates also show that a change of this kind would have very little impact from an income redistribution perspective. The groups that in some measure stand out as losers are single parents and pensioners. These groups would lose about SEK 400 a year for each member of the household.</p>
<p>The Inquiry notes that compensatory measures such as a minor increase in the housing allowance and pensioners’ housing supplements could neutralise these remaining income redistribution effects. The estimated budgetary cost of this way of neutralising the income redistribution effects of abolishing the reduced rate on foodstuffs is less than SEK 1 billion a year. Given these findings, the Inquiry has concluded that the reduced rate on foodstuffs is no longer an effective measure for the support of resource-poor households. There is no reason to maintain the reduced rate. Therefore the Inquiry is proposing that the standard rate be reduced in exchange for the abolition of the reduced rate on foodstuffs.</p>
<h2>Performers and the Sale of Works of Art, etc.</h2>
<p>The tax rate applied to large parts of the culture sector is currently 6 per cent. Pending an eventual implementation of a single flat-rate tax, the Inquiry proposes that performers’ presentations of literary and artistic works no longer be tax exempt. Instead it should be subject to a tax of 6 per cent. This would simplify the regulations and make them more uniform since various demarcation problems would disappear.</p>
<p>To simplify matters, it is proposed that the tax rate on the sale of works of art and on the import of works of art, collectors’ items and antiques, currently 12 per cent, be lowered to the level applied to most of the rest of the culture sector, that is, 6 per cent.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry's final report, it has analysed a number of proposals for extending the application of the lower tax rate in the culture sector, but it finds that implementing these proposals would not be advantageous from the perspectives that the Inquiry has to take into account. The areas analysed include archives, museums, science centres, botanical gardens, social dancing, amusement parks and pay-TV.</p>
<h2>Ski Lifts</h2>
<p>The Inquiry recommends that the decision currently specifying a special tax rate of 12 per cent for transport in ski lifts be rescinded. Services for sporting activities and for transport are currently taxed at 6 per cent. There is no reason for a special regulation for ski lifts.</p>
<h2>Pharmaceuticals, etc.</h2>
<p>At present either a tax rate of 25 per cent or a zero tax applies to pharmaceuticals. The latter means that no VAT is levied on sales, while the seller has the right to a full deduction for input VAT. The zero tax applies to medical products on medical prescription. The Inquiry notes the complexity of the regulations. It also notes that in some instances, they may be questionable with respect to competition neutrality. In view of these factors and especially with the ongoing work investigating the extent of the monopoly held by pharmacies, the Inquiry recommends that the VAT on medical products be the subject of a special investigation.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has also discussed some issues of competition neutrality with respect to the opening of graves and grave maintenance services. It recommends that these be considered in connection with another investigation that has been announced.</p>
