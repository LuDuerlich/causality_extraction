<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Committee’s remit</h2>
<p>The Police Organisation Committee’s task is to investigate the need for an independent body to scrutinise the activities of the police, including the activities of the Swedish Security Service, and the Swedish Prison and Probation Service. The Committee presented its findings with regard to scrutiny of the police in the report ‘Supervision of the Police’ (SOU 2013:42). The report called for an independent supervisory authority to monitor that police activities meet the requirements that follow from laws and other binding regulations.</p>
<p>In this report, the Committee assumes that the regular supervision of the Swedish Police Authority’s and the Swedish Security Service’s activities will be expanded and therefore does not readdress this question. With regard to a more detailed design of the regular supervision of the police, the Committee investigates whether there is reason to amend the proposals and assessments presented in the ‘Supervision of the Police’ report.</p>
<p>The Committee’s remit is now thus to investigate the need for an independent body to scrutinise the Swedish Prison and</p>
<p>Probation Service’s activities. The Committee will also present proposals on how the independent scrutiny of the police and, where relevant, the Swedish Prison and Probation Service will be organised and which activities the scrutiny should cover. Moreover, the Committee will examine whether the task of supervising forced returns could be placed with the intended supervisory authority.</p>
<h2>Some central concepts</h2>
<p>In the report, the term supervision refers to independent scrutiny to monitor whether the scrutinised activity meets the requirements set out in laws and other binding regulations, i.e. control of regulatory compliance. To serve as supervision, the scrutiny should also, where necessary, lead to decisions on measures that aim to correct any errors. Regular supervision refers to supervision carried out by a body that is tasked with exercising control over a certain activity, for instance the supervision by the Data Inspection Board of certain processing of personal data. In addition, there is extraordinary supervision, exercised by the Parliamentary Ombudsmen (JO) and the Office of the Chancellor of Justice (JK). Scrutiny is a broader term than supervision and also includes other types of scrutiny, such as audits. The term police is used as a collective term for the Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Security Service.</p>
<h2>Current external scrutiny of the Swedish Prison and Probation Service’s activities</h2>
<p>In its report, the Committee describes the external scrutiny of the Swedish Prison and Probation Service. The Committee has already, in its report ‘Supervision of the Police’, described the main external scrutiny of police activity. A number of authorities and certain international bodies currently scrutinise the Swedish Prison and</p>
<p>Probation Service’s activities. These include the following supervisory authorities:  Swedish Work Environment Authority (work environment and working hours)  Health and Social Care Inspectorate (health and medical care)  Swedish Schools Inspectorate (formal adult education)</p>
<p>However, supervision of the Swedish Prison and Probation</p>
<p>Service’s activities in relation to their clients is currently, in practice, mainly carried out by the Parliamentary Ombudsmen.</p>
<h2>The regular supervision of the Swedish Prison and Probation Service should be expanded</h2>
<p>The task of the Swedish Prison and Probation Service includes farreaching exercise of powers of enforcement that affect people’s lives.</p>
<p>The regulations that govern the Swedish Prison and Probation</p>
<p>Service’s activities allow, in a number of cases, restrictions in fundamental rights and freedoms for the individual. The Swedish Prison and Probation Service’s clients also have a palpable relationship of dependence in relation to the staff. For this reason, it must be ensured that the legal security is upheld at the Swedish Prison and Probation Service. However, several measures taken by the authorities that are important for the individual cannot be appealed. With supervision, the legal security may be strengthened also with regard to these measures.</p>
<p>The importance of legally secure penal care indicates not only that there is a need for external control of regulatory compliance, but also that it should have a considerable scope. The current external control of regulatory compliance of the Swedish Prison and Probation</p>
<p>Service’s activities is not sufficient, according to the Committee. More self-initiated and strategically governed supervision is needed. The Committee has in this assessment taken into account that the Swedish Prison and Probation Service has undergone a singular authority reform. The central scrutiny of local prison and probation authorities disappeared in connection with the reform. The internal control which the leadership at the Swedish Prison and Probation Service exercises today is not independent to the same degree. In the Committee’s view, an organisational distinction between scrutiny and operational activities creates grounds for a credible monitoring activity.</p>
<p>Under the terms of reference, the tasks of the Office of the Chancellor of Justice and the Parliamentary Ombudsmen fall outside what the Committee is responsible for examining. Thus, there is a need to expand the regular supervision of the Swedish</p>
<p>Prison and Probation Service’s activities.</p>
<h2>A new authority under the Government should be established</h2>
<p>In the ‘Supervision of the Police’ report, the Committee proposed the establishment of a new supervisory authority. In addition to the proposed new supervision of the police, the activities of the Swedish Commission on Security and Integrity Protection would be covered by the supervisory authority. However, the Committee now considers that the reasons for merging these activities are not strong enough to warrant this. In the Committee’s view, there is no other authority with activities that may be suitable to merge with the new supervisory authority. A new authority for the supervision of the police and the Swedish Prison and Probation Service should therefore be established. The supervisory authority should be an administrative authority directly accountable to the Government.</p>
<h2>What supervision is to include</h2>
<p>It should be possible for supervision to cover all activities carried out by the Swedish Police Authority, the Swedish Security Service and the Swedish Prison and Probation Service. It should be possible to conduct with regard to all laws and other binding regulations that govern these activities. This includes regulations that place demands on internal governance and controls, as well as regulations that include proportionality and suitability considerations. It should be possible for the supervisory authority to exercise supervision in individual cases. To ensure efficient supervision, priority should be given to individual cases where there are indications of structural or grave infringements of the regulations. In connection with transports abroad which may come to include coercive measures, there is such a risk of infringement of the regulations that supervision should be regularly exercised in individual cases.</p>
<p>The supervisory authority should thus have a broad supervisory mandate. The principal reason for expanding external supervision is to strengthen legal security in activities that involve very intrusive measures for the individual that cannot be appealed. In light of this, supervision should be focused on conditions that are particularly intrusive or are of great importance in another way for the individual. In line with this, supervision of the Swedish Prison and Probation Service should focus on client-oriented activities. Supervision of the police should focus on activities that limit the individual’s freedom of movement, infringe on their private life, affect their possibilities of disposing of their property or involve the use of violence or similar. Conditions with regard to transports abroad carried out using coercive measures, children deprived of their liberty or children with close relatives who are deprived of their liberty should often fall within this scope.</p>
<p>Conditions that fall under other regular supervision are not excluded from the authority’s supervisory responsibility. By not entirely excluding such conditions, problems of demarcation are avoided. The possibilities of discovering infringements and risks of infringements of the regulations are also improved. However, the supervisory authority should not normally scrutinise conditions where another authority has a special responsibility to exercise supervision. This means that the supervisory authority should mainly only alert the other supervisory authority to issues that fall within its supervision and not investigate them itself. In this way, parallel investigations and conflicting decisions by different supervisory authorities are avoided as is the use of resources to build up skills in the same areas.</p>
<p>It is also important for the focus of the supervision that the supervisory authority is not to comment on the substance of an individual decision if it can be appealed. There is already a functioning control mechanism for such decisions. Neither is the supervisory authority to comment on the substance of an individual decision by the police, if it is or has been the subject of a prosecutor’s examination. If the supervisory authority did make comments, it would mean in practice an examination of the prosecutor’s application of the law in an individual case. The prosecution authorities are not covered by this supervision.</p>
<p>The assignment of the supervisory authority would not be to investigate crimes. A supervisory body does not have the necessary powers for this. If the supervisory authority, in its supervision, finds reason to assume that a crime has been committed, as a general rule, it would report this to the Swedish Prosecution Authority. When there is reason to believe the background to the conditions that may constitute crimes is due to general shortcomings in some respect, such as faulty routines, these may nevertheless be investigated from an overall perspective.</p>
<p>It should be possible to carry out supervision concerning the actions of an individual official. However, any criticism would not be directed at individual officials, but at the authorities – the Swedish Police Authority, the Swedish Security Service and the Swedish Prison and Probation Service. Individual officials act on behalf of the authority. The performance of the individual is strongly dependent on which position he or she has held, the workload, education, division of responsibility, routines and other circumstances that are governed by the authority leadership. The authority leadership is responsible for internal governance and controls and has the best possibilities to take measures to ensure that mistakes are not repeated. In addition, there are already processes in place for individual accountability. Individuals can be held accountable by the authority’s staff disciplinary board and even prosecuted for an offence.</p>
<p>Supervision is not to cover activities conducted by bodies subject to private law linked to the scrutinised authorities, such as a foster home engaged by the Swedish Prison and Probation Service. However, measures and omissions by employees at bodies subject to private law, volunteers, etc. may fall within the supervisory responsibility. This is on the condition that they acted under the leadership of the authority and under conditions that are largely similar to those that would have applied to the authority’s own employees. For instance, measures that have been carried out by a security guard appointed by the scrutinised authority for a security task should be included in the supervision.</p>
<h2>Initiation, planning, methods and administration</h2>
<p>It is not possible to predict with any certainty what will be most important to scrutinise in future. The most effective supervision is therefore achieved if the supervisory authority, within the framework of the regulated mandate, is permitted to largely prioritise on its own which supervisory matters should be initiated. Instructions for the supervisory authority should specify that supervision is to be carried out strategically and that the authority is to utilise risk analyses. The purpose of this regulation is to counteract planned supervision being pushed aside by events-based supervision. The activities should be well-planned, forward-looking and methodical. The supervisory authority is to specify the main focus of supervision in a special supervisory plan.</p>
<p>Although the supervisory authority should be free to develop an effective supervisory methodology by itself, inspections are to constitute part of the supervisory authority’s activities. Monitoring of transports abroad that may include coercive measures are also to constitute part of the supervisory authority’s activities. A Member</p>
<p>State shall, under the Return Directive, provide for an effective forced-return monitoring system. The Swedish Police Authority, the Swedish Security Service, and the Swedish Prison and Probation Service participate in various ways in transports abroad that is carried out using coercive measures. Such transports are especially sensitive and often involve the risk of different types of incidents. The supervisory authority should therefore regularly monitor transports abroad that may involve coercive measures. It should be left up to the authority to, based on a risk analysis, continually assess the frequency with which supervision should be carried out, and which types of transport abroad should be prioritised.</p>
<p>The supervisory authority is also to receive and investigate complaints from individuals. The authority itself may determine which complaints to investigate. Since the supervisory authority should pursue systematic and risk-based supervision, complaints from individuals should not only be used to collect information about individual incidents which may be relevant for investigation. Complaints should also be included in the collective documentation on which the authority’s supervisory planning is based. In handling complaints, the supervisory authority should pay particular attention to the needs of children deprived of their liberty.</p>
<h2>Means for correcting or preventing shortcomings</h2>
<p>Supervisory matters are to be settled by written decisions. In these, the supervisory authority may have the opportunity to comment on the established circumstances’ conformity with laws and other binding regulations.</p>
<p>The decisions are not to be binding. If the supervisory authority had the right to enforce changes, it would affect the scrutinised authorities’ possibilities to take responsibility for their own activity. In a longer perspective, a right to impose binding sanctions may jeopardise the scrutinised authorities’ willingness to cooperate in the investigation. On the other hand, the regulations on which the statements will be based are binding. If activities are not compatible with the binding regulations in some respect, the scrutinised authority is obliged to take measures against the background of these regulations. If necessary, the Government may exercise its option for governance and control to bring about changes in the scrutinised activities. Since the decisions are not to be binding, neither do they need to be appealable. This will avoid the State’s resources being used for the purpose of two government agencies litigating against each other in a court of law.</p>
<p>Decisions in supervisory matters are to be sent or submitted to the scrutinised authority. A report with key findings and supervision conclusions is also to be submitted annually to the Government. The supervisory authority may also, where necessary, inform the Government in another way with regard to individual decisions. The European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) assists Member States with the organisation of joint return operations for removals of third-country nationals residing illegally in the European Union. After monitoring a joint return operation coordinated by Frontex, the supervisory authority should report to Frontex. The outcome of the supervision should also be disseminated to other supervisory bodies and to the general public. The supervisory authority should, taking into account the applicable legislation, for itself assess in which way and to what extent reporting or other information dissemination would be appropriate.</p>
<p>The task of the supervisory authority includes providing the scrutinised authorities with certain counselling and guidance. The authority should not, however, give concrete advice on what should be done to resolve the established shortcomings. It is the scrutinised authority, with responsibility for the activities, that can best determine which measures are needed. The supervisory authority is to have the right to demand that the scrutinised authority, within a certain period, report which measures have been taken or will be taken.</p>
<p>The supervisory authority should also have other ways of working for a change in the activities under supervision. As mentioned above, it may alert other supervisory bodies of shortcomings and risks and report them to a prosecutor if there is reason to assume that a crime has been committed. The authority may also inform individuals of the possibility to contact the Office of the Chancellor of Justice and request compensation by the State. To further enable the authority to promote quality within the scrutinised authority, it should be tasked with, within its area of activity, working to remedy shortcomings in legislation or other binding regulations.</p>
<h2>The right to assist another State with monitoring</h2>
<p>According to the European Commission, an independent monitor should be present at each joint return operation, since these are sensitive and attract much attention. In cases where Sweden organises a joint transport, the other participating States’ treatment of those being transported is closely linked to the activities of the Swedish Prison and Probation Service and the police. In cases where Sweden is the organising Member State, the supervisory authority should, therefore, be permitted to assist the other State in monitoring joint return operations coordinated by Frontex. Such monitoring may only take place following agreement.</p>
<h2>Information gathering, personal data processing and secrecy</h2>
<p>A fundamental prerequisite for exercising supervision is that the supervisory authority is given access to the information it needs. The administrative authorities under supervision are to submit the information and statements and make available documents and other material requested by the supervisory authority. The same is to apply to other administrative authorities and courts of law, if what the request refers to is necessary for supervision. Certain individuals who participate or have participated in the activities of an administrative authority or court of law are also to be obliged to, on request, submit information and statements necessary for supervision.</p>
<p>At the request of the supervisory authority, the information is to be submitted in writing and with a declaration that the information provided is correct. If incorrect information is submitted, penal liability may be relevant under Chapter 15, Section 10 of the Penal Code with regard to untrue or negligent affirmation. The possibility to request that submitted information be solemnly declared to be truthful should be used with restraint.</p>
<p>The supervisory authority is to be able to demand that those who have a duty to report fulfil their obligation. Such demands should be possible to combine with penalties, even in relation to the State. The possibility to combine a demand to fulfil their duty to report with a penalty should, however, be used with restraint. If information is extracted under threat of penalty, in the long term this can undermine the scrutinised authority’s confidence in and willingness to cooperate with the supervisory authority. The individual’s right to remain silent also means not combining a demand with a penalty if there is reason to assume that the individual to be ordered to report information has committed an act that can result in punish or a similar sanction and the demand refers to the investigation of a question in connection to the suspected act.</p>
<p>Authorities under supervision are to submit to the supervisory authority the assistance it requests for its supervision. The supervisory authority is also to have the right to scrutinise in situ activities which are under its supervision. It is to have the right to gain access and investigate spaces and equipment used in the scrutinised activities. However, for access to or investigation of an inmate’s rooms or belongings or other closed places of storage which the inmate has at his/her disposal, his or her consent is required.</p>
<p>No special regulation is necessary with regard to the supervisory authority’s personal data processing, since the provisions of the</p>
<p>Personal Data Act (1998:204) are sufficient. Nor is any special secrecy regulation necessary with regard to data that the supervisory authority receives from other Swedish authorities. Nonetheless, a new secrecy regulation is proposed to achieve fully adequate secrecy protection when data is submitted by individuals, a foreign authority or an international organisation.</p>
<h2>Cooperation and demarcation lines with respect to other authorities</h2>
<p>In relation to other supervisory authorities that exercise regular supervision of the Swedish Prison and Probation Service and the police, there may be a matter of overlapping supervisory responsibility. Yet the problem of overlap is greatly reduced by the proposal that supervision should not normally be carried out in conditions where another supervisory authority has a special task to exercise supervision. An authority for regular supervision of the police’s and the Swedish Prison and Probation Service’s activities does not entail any demarcation problem with regard to the extraordinary supervisory bodies of the Parliamentary Ombudsmen (JO) and the Office of the Chancellor of Justice (JK). The supervisory authority is to cooperate with other authorities and international bodies that may exercise supervision of activities conducted by the police or the Swedish Prison and Probation Service. Cooperation with the Parliamentary Ombudsmen and the Office of the Chancellor of Justice should, however, only aim to avoid duplication and not refer to joint supervisory operations, since the Parliamentary Ombudsmen and the Office of the Chancellor of Justice exercise supervision of the supervisory authority.</p>
<p>There is a close connection between the police and the prosecutor’s criminal investigations. Moreover, prosecution authorities carry out legal supervision. Therefore, the supervisory authority is also to cooperate with the Swedish Prosecution Authority and the Swedish Economic Crime Authority.</p>
<h2>Organisational considerations</h2>
<p>The supervisory authority will be a Director-General governed authority directly answerable to the Government. The authorities subject to supervision have tasks involving far-reaching exercise of powers to take measures that affect individuals. For this reason, it is important to ensure good transparency for citizens and democratic influence in the supervisory operations. This may be provided by an advisory council at the supervisory authority, which in a broad sense represents the general public. The members should therefore have experience of party policies or have broad points of contact in society. The experience, knowledge and opinions of the advisory council should be particularly utilised before the supervisory plan is confirmed.</p>
<p>The supervisory authority should determine its own internal organisation. In order to run an effective supervisory operation, it should, after two years, have resources corresponding to sixty fullyear equivalent positions.</p>
<p>The authority will be called the Supervisory Authority for the police and the Swedish Prison and Probation Service.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the Committee’s proposals</h2>
<p>Exercising this new supervision may require resources from the administrative authorities under supervision, for instance in connection with inspections. At the same time, supervision helps their development work and raises the quality of their activities.</p>
<p>For the supervisory authority to comment on the police’s criminal investigations, the authority must have the possibility to describe the circumstances in which the police acted. A decision by the supervisory authority may therefore indirectly conclude that shortcomings have occurred in the case of an individual prosecutor’s handling or that there are systematic shortcomings in the prosecution authorities. However, according to the Committee, this does not constitute a</p>
<p>threat to the prosecutor’s independence, nor does it constitute grounds to exempt the police’s criminal investigations from supervision. Not permitting the supervisory authority to comment on the substance of an individual decision by the Swedish Police Authority or the Swedish Security Service, if the decision is or has been the subject of examination by a prosecutor, also prevents the supervisory authority from indirectly commenting on the application of the law by an individual prosecutor.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the new supervisory authority be financed through a redistribution of resources within expenditure area 4, the judicial system. Such a redistribution will affect the authorities whose budgets are reduced.</p>
<p>Supervision should lead to stronger legal security in the police’s and the Swedish Prison and Probation Service’s activities. It benefits primarily individuals who are the subject of the examined activity, i.e. are suspects, deprived of their liberty, etc. Stronger legal security may also lead to higher confidence in the police and the Swedish Prison and Probation Service among the general public. Supervision should also lead to the Government, and by extension, the citizens, gaining better control over ensuring that the regulations and laws are respected in the activities of the police and the Swedish Prison and Probation Service. This strengthens democratic insight and control.</p>
