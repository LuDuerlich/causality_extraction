<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit of the Inquiry</h2>
<p>Excessive payment periods adversely affect the liquidity and profitability of businesses, which may ultimately have a negative impact on the economy. Small and medium-sized businesses are hardest hit. In the EU, late payments in commercial transactions have long been seen as threatening the proper functioning of the internal market. The Directive (2000/35/EC) on combating late payment in commercial transactions was adopted in 2000 and transposed into Swedish law in 2002. In February 2011, as a result of an evaluation, a revised version of the Directive was adopted (2011/7/EU).</p>
<p>The 2011 Directive contains rules to protect creditors in commercial transactions, including rules regarding the length of payment periods, default interest and recovery costs. The Directive is to be transposed into national law by 16 March 2013.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s main task has been to propose how the 2011</p>
<p>Directive is to be transposed into Swedish law. The Inquiry has also been able to propose measures other than those arising from the Directive, with a view to mitigating the consequences of late payment and promoting prompter payment. The remit has included a review of the compensation amount the creditor has a right to for various types of recovery measures, including payment reminders and demands.</p>
<h2>Transposition of the 2011 Directive</h2>
<p>General comments on the scope of the provisions</p>
<p>A starting point for Swedish property law is neutrality between different markets. The 2011 Directive has a more limited scope of application. It only applies in commercial transactions, i.e. the delivery of goods or the provision of services for remuneration between undertakings or between undertakings and public authorities (if the authority is the debtor). However, as this is a minimum directive, the provisions proposed may be given a wider scope of application.</p>
<p>General rules contribute to market-neutral legislation and are easier to apply than rules carrying exceptions and delimitations. Nevertheless, it is clear that the 2011 Directive focuses exclusively on commercial relationships. Its provisions are geared to the supply of goods and services. The consequences of a general scope of application are difficult to foresee. It is therefore our assessment that, as a general point of departure, compelling reasons should be given to allow a wider application of the provisions than that of the Directive.</p>
<p>Payment periods</p>
<p>Under the 2011 Directive, the payment period fixed in the contract  must not exceed 60 days, unless otherwise explicitly stated in the contract . What this means is unclear and, to some extent, the provisions can be said to be based on circular reasoning. Our interpretation is that the provisions of the Directive aim to ensure that the creditor has actively (expressly) approved a payment period of more than 60 days.</p>
<p>In certain cases, Swedish law allows payment periods exceeding 60 days, even though the length of the payment period has not been expressly agreed between the parties. It may be a matter of a longer payment period resulting from, for example, a binding commercial practice or a passive contract. Therefore, Swedish legislation does not fully meet the requirements of the Directive.</p>
<p>The general rule in Swedish law is that a claim must be paid in accordance with the creditor’s request. For the purpose of transposing the 2011 Directive, and as a complement to the general rule, we propose the introduction of a provision setting out when a claim falls due for payment. This should be designed as a protection clause for the creditor, aimed at combating excessively long payment periods. The aim therefore is not to specify a ‘normal’ payment period in commercial transactions between undertakings or between undertakings and public authorities.</p>
<p>The proposal means that a claim for payment of goods and services, in a relationship between business operators, should never fall due later than 60 days after the creditor has requested payment. However, a longer payment period should be allowed if the creditor expressly approves. Such a rule meets the Directive’s requirement of the creditor having an active influence over the length of the payment period.</p>
<p>Under the Directive, if the debtor is a public authority or some other public entity, the payment period may not normally exceed 30 days. It is also specifically stated that the provisions of the Directive shall be without prejudice to the ability of parties to agree on payment schedules. Against this background, we propose that if the debtor is a public authority, the payment period, as a rule, must not exceed 30 days. However, a longer payment period should be possible if the creditor expressly approves a payment schedule. In this case, instalments must instead fall due for payment in accordance with the payment schedule.</p>
<p>Finally, the Directive states that if the contract between the parties contains a condition stating that the buyer must be able to examine the goods or services delivered before making the payment, the verification period must not exceed 30 days. No such limitation exists in Swedish law. We therefore propose a provision under which the buyer is not permitted to postpone payment for more than 30 days as a result of such a verification. However, the buyer may postpone payment further if the seller expressly approves a longer verification period.</p>
<p>Default interest</p>
<p>The Swedish regulations concerning default interest essentially already meet the requirements of the 2011 Directive. However, the Directive states that a creditor’s right to receive default interest on late payments is not to be waived; i.e. the right is to be mandatory. Such a rule does not exist in Swedish law. We therefore propose a provision stating that a contract condition stipulating that the debtor is not obliged to pay default interest is to have no legal effect on the creditor.</p>
<p>We have considered whether this mandatory invalidity rule, despite our general starting points, should apply under all commercial relationships, in other words not only to the supply of goods and services. For several practical and economic reasons, the scope of application of this provision should be wider. Under existing law, there is an automatic right to default interest in commercial relationships. It is difficult to see any real problems arising from a wider application. Overall, we have found sufficient reason to propose that the right to default interest should be mandatory in all commercial relationships.</p>
<p>However, as regards the transactions of public authorities, we have made the opposite assessment. Public sector activities extend over a broad area. The conditions when an authority acts outside the area of commercial transactions are multi-faceted and therefore difficult to foresee. Public law and tax financing issues are often involved. In certain cases it cannot be ruled out that a mandatory rule for default interest may be inappropriate. We therefore propose that the invalidity rule in these cases is only to apply when a business operator for remuneration is to provide goods or services to a public authority or other public entity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Directive imposes a mandatory requirement that the default interest in commercial transactions between public authorities and business operators must be equal to the sum of the reference rate and at least eight percentage points. This is the interest rate that applies under non-mandatory provisions of Swedish law. We thus propose a regulation whereby in public commercial transactions a contract condition providing for a lower interest rate than the statutory rate is to have no legal effect on the business operator. However, we have not considered it necessary or appropriate to introduce a corresponding regulation for the default interest rate in relationships between business operators. By and large, it should be possible to deal with a contract condition stipulating that default interest should be paid at a very low rate by applying the general regulations on unfair contract conditions.</p>
<p>Debt recovery costs</p>
<p>Under the Directive, the creditor has a right to compensation for recovery costs. If a payment is late – and the creditor is therefore entitled to default interest – the creditor is entitled to compensation at a fixed minimum sum of EUR 40. In addition, the creditor has a right to obtain reasonable compensation for recovery costs exceeding the fixed sum.</p>
<p>To implement these sections of the Directive, we propose the introduction of provisions stipulating that if a creditor has the right to receive default interest as a result of late payment, the debtor will be obliged to pay – in addition to default interest – a late payment fee of SEK 450. The right to compensation for late payment will apply in commercial transactions between business operators and between business operators and public authorities.</p>
<p>The creditor is not required to have taken any recovery measures to be entitled to compensation for late payment. As a general rule, this is the only compensation the creditor will receive for late payment. Only if the total compensation amount for measures according to the Act on debt recovery costs – payment reminders, debt collection demands and setting up a repayment plan – exceeds SEK 450 is the debtor obliged to pay the excess amount.</p>
<p>Due to an explicit requirement of the Directive, we propose a presumption rule requiring that a contract condition stating that the creditor does not have the right to compensation for late payment, or to compensation for any costs exceeding the compensation for late payment, should normally be invalid. Such a contract condition should only be allowed if there are special grounds. The same will apply to a condition stating that compensation for late payment shall amount to less than SEK 450.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Swedish law meets the requirements of the Directive regarding compensation for reasonable recovery costs.</p>
<p>We propose that the compensation amount for recovery measures under the Act on debt recovery costs be increased somewhat. The creditor will normally have the right to compensation in the sum of SEK 60 for payment reminders, SEK 180 for debt collection demands and SEK 170 for setting up a repayment plan. The proposed increases will affect all types of debt relationships, including consumer debts. The increases roughly correspond to the rate of inflation since the amounts were last adjusted in 2003. We have also considered that, for constitutional reasons, these compensation amounts will no longer be regulated by a regulation but rather by law.</p>
<p>Unfair payment terms</p>
<p>As already mentioned, we propose certain invalidity rules regarding default interest and agreements on recovery costs. The Directive also sets out certain requirements concerning grossly unfair payment terms. Swedish law provides sufficient opportunity under both civil law and market law to deal with these terms. Therefore, the requirements of the Directive in these sections do not require any legislative amendments.</p>
<h2>Other measures</h2>
<p>In addition to the measures resulting from the 2011 Directive, an awareness-raising campaign to increase companies’ understanding and knowledge of commercial credit and credit management is, in our view, the most effective measure to secure prompter payment. We propose that this be done in the form of an internet-based information portal, which the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth will be responsible for developing.</p>
<p>The information portal, which should target small and mediumsized enterprises, will address at least the following issues. Firstly , the importance of credit management to the company’s liquidity and long-term profitability will be explained. Secondly , it should provide concrete information on what the company can do to receive payment for a claim and compensation for late payments. Thirdly,  it should provide general information about cross-border payments.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and consequences</h2>
<p>We propose that the legislative amendments enter into force on 1 March 2013.</p>
<p>In general, the new provisions should apply to the debt relationships arising from contracts entered into after that date; i.e. the regulations will not apply retroactively. However, regarding the new regulations on compensation for late payment, having parallel</p>
<p>systems for a considerable length of time would entail considerable costs for companies. To establish whether a late payment entitles the creditor to compensation, the creditor and debt collection agency would require an IT system containing information on when the contract that is the basis for the claim was entered into. We therefore propose that the new provisions on compensation for late payment should apply for all claims that fall due for payment after the entry into force.</p>
<p>To the extent the proposed measures lead to shortening the payment periods, this will have a positive effect on businesses and ultimately on the economy. However, the immediate consequences are difficult to assess.</p>
<p>These proposals will lead to certain unavoidable one-off costs for both public authorities and businesses. It is primarily a matter of adapting IT systems and training initiatives. It is our assessment that the costs to public authorities arising from the proposals can be managed within the existing frameworks.</p>
