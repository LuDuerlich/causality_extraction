<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The main remit of the Inquiry has been to analyse which legislative amendments are required to adapt Swedish law to the new EU rules on auditors and audits. The Inquiry’s remit also includes considering how the new EU rules and the Swedish rules on auditors’ liability prevents audit firms from taking on auditing assignments in ‘public-interest entities’ (i.e. companies whose transferable securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market and certain financial companies). Finally, the remit includes considering whether the allocation of responsibilities between company bodies can be clarified in any respect.</p>
<p>The part of the remit that refers to the adaptation of Swedish law to the new EU rules was reported in the interim report entitled New rules for auditors and audits  (SOU 2015:49). In this final report we deal with the other parts of our remit.</p>
<h2>Proposals and assessments</h2>
<p>The market for the audit of public-interest entities is at present comprised by a very limited number of audit firms. The market for such audits, both in Sweden and the rest of the EU countries, is essentially completely dominated by four large audit networks. The Commission has long expressed concern about the lack of competition and the fact that the statutory audit market is highly concentrated. The Commission has also recommended that the Member States take measures to address this problem. Also in Sweden the question of auditor liability and the existing market concentration has been a source of concern and debate.</p>
<p>It has also been claimed that the risk of major claims for damages is preventing medium-sized audit firms from taking on assignments in public-interest entities. Moreover, it has been argued that the existing liability regime could lead to extensive damage claims causing one of the major audit networks to collapse, which would increase the market concentration even further.</p>
<p>The Inquiry notes that there is little empirical support for the assertion that it is the risk of major claims for damages that prevents audit firms, other than the four largest audit networks, from taking on assignments in public-interest entities. The same applies to the issue of whether there is an actual risk of an extensive damage claim leading to the collapse of one of the major audit networks. However, it does not seem improbable that the risk of major damages – as one of several factors – may have influenced the current market concentration that has arisen and the fact that it has remained. Moreover, the negative consequences following a bankruptcy of one of the major audit networks would be considerable. Therefore, the Inquiry has considered whether it is possible to reduce the risk of major damages that could have negative consequences for the national economy through certain amendments in the Swedish company law.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, the Inquiry should also consider whether the allocation of responsibilities between company bodies can be clarified. Regarding this issue, the Inquiry’s terms of reference state that it has been claimed that there is some uncertainty concerning how an auditor’s liability for damage that has arisen as a result of mistakes in the company’s accounting is related to the director’s and officer’s liability for the same damage. However, the Inquiry considers that the allocation of responsibilities regulated by law between the auditor and other company bodies is relatively clear. Yet the design of the liability regime, in combination with auditors’ mandatory liability insurance policies and the major audit firms’ general ability to pay, may nonetheless, in practice, result in the auditor ultimately having to pay compensation for damage for which the company management is also liable. The Inquiry considers that it is not desirable that the liability of the company management is passed on to the auditor in this way. Also for this reason, amendment of the rules concerning auditor liability should be considered.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has considered several different alternatives for reducing the risk of major damage claims and to prevent a shift in liability from the company management to the auditor. In this assessment, great importance has been attached to the interest of the injured party regarding the legitimate claims for compensation for damages. The Inquiry concludes that it is currently not necessary to make any extensive changes concerning auditors’ liability. However, the Inquiry proposes some amendments that can be assumed to be beneficial and reduce the risk of major damage claims and maintain the allocation of responsibility between company bodies as intended in the legislation.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that companies should be permitted to limit the liability of their auditors by contract provided that the shareholders’ approval is obtained. This must be done at a General Meeting. The limitation of liability should not apply to damage caused intentionally or through gross negligence. The proposal does not restrict the manner in which liability can be limited. This means that the parties can set out the contractual limits, but it must be fair and reasonable. Further, the Inquiry proposes certain amendments to the provisions on adjustment of liability under company law. The Inquiry also proposes that the corporate governance reports should contain information about existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurances.</p>
