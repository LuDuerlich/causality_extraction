<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Recent economic developments in the Baltic region have been very positive. In 1997 we saw positive GNP development in Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, foreign direct investments doubled and trade increased dramatically. In spite of this, some barriers to trade and investment still remain in the region. This report assesses these barriers and also contains sug - gestions for reducing or eliminating them. The report is essentially based on experience and viewpoints from the Swedish business world and from studies, analyses and inquiries carried out by various bodies concerning conditions in the region.</p>
<p>Regarding economic developments in the region the picture that has sometimes emerged is one characterized by an underestimation of the progress made and an exaggeration of the problems that exist. In view of this, the Committee found it natural to give the report the title "Making Use of the Opportunities in the Baltic Region", despite the fact that our assignment was primarily to assess the problems. This should not, however, be seen as an expression of an underestimation of the problems that do indeed exist.</p>
<p>The following are the principal aims of our report. · To assess in particular the conditions that are obstructing the development of trade with Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. · To provide basic information for Swedish action in various international cooperation organs for the purpose of promoting a positive economic development in the Baltic region. · To elucidate measures that can be taken in Sweden to promote the development of trade and investment in the region.</p>
<p>There are many public and private international, national, regional and local forms of support, initiatives and cooperation projects within the region. In ATTACHMENT  to this report the Committee gives an overview of some authorities and organizations and their main role and efforts for development and cooperation in the region. The report may possibly give tips regarding the organizations and authorities that can be of assistance to Swedish businesses that are thinking of investing in the Baltic area. A great deal of information is available on different web sites on the Internet. The report therefore gives a list of some informative web sites.</p>
<p>The countries in the Baltic region vary a great deal among themselves and they have differing preconditions. The actors on the market, political bodies concerned, authorities and organizations within the respective countries appear to be relatively well aware of the problems and barriers to trade and investment. The scope of the problems and their impact on trade and investment vary considerably among the countries concerned.</p>
<p>Areas where problems exist have been summarized under the following headings. ·  Legislation · Administrative competence · Border crossing · Crime · Technical barriers to trade · Information · Infrastructure/transports · Investments, working capital and customer credits</p>
<p>In the light of the description given of the problems and the obstacles judged to relate particularly to trade and investment, the Committee has chosen to concentrate its deliberations and proposals on the following areas. · Cooperation and the transfer of knowledge to raise the level of administrative competence within the relevant areas. · Border crossing · Information issues · Some other measures</p>
<h2>Deliberations and proposals</h2>
<p>Many of the Committee’s proposals can only be carried out in cooperation with the countries concerned. This means, among other things, that such proposals must be further discussed in bilateral or multilateral contexts. This applies in particular to different EU organs. However, we have been able to establish that there are some measures that can be taken in Sweden without affecting conditions in other countries. There are also objectives that can be achieved by increased direct cooperation between the countries without a requirement of formal agreements or negotiations.</p>
<p>0ICTURE OF THE REGION</p>
<p>Several times in the report, the Committee indicates the importance of giving a nuanced picture of the region. In our view, there is a somewhat too pessimistic perception in Sweden of the conditions prevailing today in our neighbouring countries to the east. The Committee wishes therefore to assert that increased knowledge in Sweden about the actual conditions in the eastern parts of the region is one of the most important components for expanded</p>
<p>trade and increased investment. All those in Sweden who can contribute to the spread of knowledge have an important role to play.</p>
<p>Normally, it would be expected that some of the problems that arise in connection with trade and investment in the Baltic region could be solved with the aid of the Swedish bank system. This applies both to purely financing questions and collection of information on institutional and legal conditions, credit assessments of local businesses, etc. The Committee establishes that the Swedish bank system has so far been represented in the region only to a very small extent. The foreign banks have made more progress as regards their establishment than the Swedish ones. In the Committee’s view, this means that Swedish businesses are at a disadvantage in competition for Baltic trade since their bank connections so far have not been able to provide the same services as their competitors’ banks.</p>
<p>4HE SUPPORT SYSTEM</p>
<p>The Committee has drawn the conclusion that a total review of the support system should be urgently initiated. Such a review should include all the activities and processes that in different ways are intended to promote Swedish foreign trade and the preconditions for Swedish businesses to invest, and which come under various governmental schemes. The review should not only aim to make the system clearer for businesses, but also promote a more comprehensive approach focusing on risk in government commitments. In this way, without being centralized, the system should be able to make more effective contributions at a lower cost than the present partially directed support programme.</p>
<p>3IMPLER RULES</p>
<p>Rules and procedures for trade and investment are often highly complicated. In many cases they are based on international agreements, conventions, etc. which naturally does not facilitate simplification efforts. As simple rules as possible together with good information should always be a fundamental starting-point. It is therefore important that Sweden gives high priority to efforts to simplify the EU’s framework of rules.</p>
<p>4HE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION</p>
<p>Bribery and receiving bribes continue to disturb trade between the countries to some extent, although the problem is considered to have decreased. In their operations, businesses must consistently refrain from any form of bribery both in their relations with authorities and in their business relations. Authorities and organizations must, through training, information and control systems, forestall and prevent officials from requesting or receiving bribes. The recently adopted OECD Convention on bribes was an important step in the fight against corruption. The Swedish Government should encourage Russia and the Baltic countries to accede to the Convention.</p>
<p>.EW BUSINESS CONTACTS</p>
<p>It is of major importance that Swedish small and medium-sized businesses can obtain assistance in connection with market ventures in the Baltic region. Following an assessment of a company’s export opportunities and the suitability of the products for a particular market, definite contact with presumptive business partners is needed. These contacts are often more effective and targetoriented if the company is assisted by an actor in the country in question who is acquainted with businesses, the business mentality and has contacts with authorities, etc.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes increased support for market ventures in the form of Business Opportunity Projects. The Swedish Trade Council should be requested to carry out these projects together with the regional organization for export promotion in Sweden in consultation with the business organizations concerned and chambers of commerce.</p>
<p>&RAMEWORK AGREEMENT</p>
<p>The Committee establishes that the problems connected with exports of projects in the first instance to Russia often seem to be related to difficulties in administering and financing each project individually. One way of facilitating the handling of these problems may be to enter into framework agreements or similar arrangements between the Governments of Sweden and Russia which may make it easier to obtain acceptable guarantees.</p>
<p>3UPPORT TO VOCATIONAL TRAINING</p>
<p>In connection with practically every project-oriented investment to which Sweden contributes in the region, in-house training of staff is required. Measures of this kind are absolutely crucial to the completion of projects and the smooth running of the plants. In the Committee’s view, it should be possible to increase this type of support.</p>
<p>"ETTER INFORMATION FACILITIES</p>
<p>In the opinion of the Committee, it is very important to make practical and rational use of developments in Information Technology (IT) in order to remedy the lack of information and knowledge that is evident with regard to rules and regulations in the trade area. Utilizing IT is a relatively simple and cheap way to supply cross-border information without any restrictions apart from the problem of language barriers.</p>
<p>The Committee recommends more cooperation between Swedish organizations in order to collect information about Sweden and the Baltic region on a single web site with links to other sites and data bases that contain relevant information about regulations, market conditions, statistics, etc.</p>
<p>It is not only important that Swedish authorities have adequate, easily accessible information. The aim should be to provide a similar service for the entire Baltic region. Several countries, including the Baltic states have excellent web sites in English which supply comprehensive information on market conditions. Within the framework of Baltic sea cooperation it should be possible to set out certain specifications regulating the scope and design of information from public authorities on the Internet.</p>
<p>Certain information indicates that Swedish companies and organizations are less involved in the Phare and Tacis programmes than companies in several other countries. It is important that Swedish expertise, including comprehensive knowledge about contacts with international organizations and programmes such as the EBRD, NIB, Tacis and Phare, exists and can be used to give active support to Swedish companies. Various educational and information ac-tivities largely targeted directly at companies, but also at organiza-tions, would substantially raise the level of knowledge about EU projects.</p>
<p>The  %XPORTERS 'UIDE TO 3WEDEN produced by the Swedish International Development Agency (Sida) should be updated and made widely available. This could be arranged via the Internet and with the help of printed material.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that Sida draft standards for study visits for companies thought to be in a position to export to Sweden. Sida’s trade promotion activities should include a certain subsidy towards the costs incurred during a visit to Sweden.</p>
<p>5PGRADING SKILLS IN COMPANIES</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that further efforts be made to help Russian, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian and Polish companies and organizations to build and upgrade their administrative expertise. If a Swedish company finds that its cooperative partner lacks the requisite skills in a key area, it should be in a position to initiate measures to ensure that the partner has access to expertise for the necessary period. For example, more knowledge might be required in order to set up a purchasing or sales organization, a modern accounting system or some other vital function.</p>
<p>&ASTER BORDER CROSSING</p>
<p>It should be possible to achieve faster border crossing for commercial traffic with the present level of control maintained or even increased.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that within the framework of its Baltic cooperation, Sweden should take the initiative for discussions on a joint quality and follow-up programme for the customs authorities. The programme shall support a development towards stipulated requirements for handling different matters and customs formalities. This may include time requirements, ethical requirements, questions of integrity, and a guaranteeing of correctness of implementation and decisions.</p>
<p>Sweden should take the initiative for a common goal for border crossing that shall apply within all the Baltic rim states by the year 2000. The proposal may be seen as a first step in an increased quality and service-minded approach that can be jointly developed within the Baltic region’s customs authorities.</p>
<p>More cooperation between the Swedish customs and the customs authorities in Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland should be encouraged. This cooperation should chiefly aim to facilitate border crossings and improve the service to the industrial sector.</p>
<p>Exchanges should gradually become a natural part of local cooperation between the respective countries’ authorities.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the Board of Customs be requested to draw up a programme for direct exchanges between customs officials from Russia, the Baltic countries, Poland and Sweden. The programme should stress trade promotion measures and services.</p>
<p>We have very clearly perceived a need for easy access to relevant information about import and export rules in the region. The Committee therefore proposes that Sweden should work for the availability on the Internet of all the Baltic countries’ rules for importation and exportation of goods. The rules should be available both in the language of the country and in English.</p>
<p>The Committee considers that Sweden should encourage Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to accede to the SAD/Transit Conventions as soon as is practically possible. Sweden should also act to ensure that the TIR Convention and its implementation can be guaranteed. The possibility of utilizing the ATA carnet in all the Baltic rim countries should be promoted.</p>
