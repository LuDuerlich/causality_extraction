<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The remit of the 2015 Election Act Inquiry was to review how new elections can be held more promptly than at present and to consider how the protection for secrecy of the vote can be strengthened.</p>
<p>Issues concerning earlier new elections are grounded in the discussions surrounding the new elections held in 2011 and 2015 to the county council assembly in Västra Götaland County and the municipal council assembly in Båstad. In the public debate following these new elections, it was stated that they seemed more like extraordinary elections than new elections, partly because the elections were held some eight months after ordinary elections, and because the conditions for the new elections had thus changed. For example, the group of those entitled to vote had changed and parties that had not previously participated were given the opportunity to run in the new elections. The Inquiry was therefore instructed to examine whether the procedure could be simplified with the aims of enabling earlier new elections than at present and ensuring that the conditions during new elections are essentially the same as those during ordinary elections. The Inquiry was also instructed to consider and propose a time limit for holding new elections that should be as short as practically possible.</p>
<p>The part of the remit concerning protection for secrecy of the vote relates to the way in which ballot papers are provided. International election monitors and others have raised objections to the Swedish electoral system because the area where ballot papers are provided in vote reception points is not screened from view. People in the premises can therefore see which ballot papers a voter takes. Whether the secrecy of the ballot is upheld in such a system has thus been questioned. The Inquiry was therefore tasked with analysing and deciding how to tighten requirements on the provision of ballot papers at vote reception points.</p>
<p>The main features of the Inquiry’s proposals and assessments are presented below.</p>
<h2>Earlier new elections A new election should be a new election in the strictest sense</h2>
<p>The current system for new elections is not without its problems. A new election is a considerable process that is largely equivalent to holding an ordinary election. This is because the general provisions in the Elections Act to a large extent also apply to a new election. This has significance for the timing of the new election and the conditions that govern it.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s starting point is that a new election should be a new election in the strictest sense, as far as this is possible. This means the conditions prevailing at a new election should be as similar as possible to those of the ordinary election. The sooner after the ordinary election a new election can be held, the better the prospects of maintaining the original conditions. At the same time, high and equal electoral participation must be sought, as well as secure implementation. A new election should therefore be held as soon as practically possible and appropriate.</p>
<p>To achieve such a system, the Inquiry proposes certain amendments to the Elections Act to bring about greater efficiency and simplification.</p>
<h2>The electoral roll provisions should not be amended</h2>
<p>A simplification of the system for new elections could involve giving only those people who were listed on the electoral roll at the ordinary election the right to vote in the event of new elections. However, such an amendment has proved problematic.</p>
<p>Firstly, it can be stated that some voters who are eligible to vote in a new election under the current provisions would lose that right if the provisions were amended. The right to vote is enshrined in Sweden’s fundamental laws, which means that the system cannot be adjusted solely through amendments to the electoral roll provisions in the Elections Act. Furthermore, an amendment could be assumed to have a not insignificant impact on voter turnout, for example if it meant that people who have moved away from a new election area retained their right to vote while those who have moved to the area were not given a right to vote.</p>
<p>Even in view of the efficiency gains that an amendment to the election roll provisions may entail, the Inquiry has nonetheless found that an amendment to these provisions is difficult to motivate. Consequently, no such amendments are proposed.</p>
<h2>It should not be possible for new parties and candidates to notify their participation in a new election</h2>
<p>According to the starting point recommended by the Inquiry – that as far as possible the same conditions should apply at new elections as at ordinary elections – only those parties and candidates that stood in an election should be allowed to participate in the event of a new election.</p>
<p>With such a system, the conditions placed on parties and candidates would already be clear when it is decided to hold new elections. The same ballot papers could therefore be used. Much of the Election Authority’s administration, surrounding for example the notification and registration process, would also be reduced. Such a system therefore leads to a more efficient and smoother new election process. It also facilitates a new election being held as a new election in the strictest sense and not as a new ordinary election.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes the introduction of provisions in the Elections Act that would prevent a party from being able to make a special notification of participation in a new election. Furthermore, a party’s notification of candidates for a specific election should also apply in the event of new elections. It should not be possible to notify participation of new candidates.</p>
<h2>A new election should be held as soon as possible and within three months</h2>
<p>A starting point for the Inquiry has been that a time limit for holding a new election must be tailored to the current electoral system and the election preparations this demands. The preparations for a new election are a very comprehensive process for the electoral authorities. Relatively extensive preparatory work is also required of the parties. The scale of the new election also has significance for the implementation period. However, there are efficiency gains to be made as a result of the Inquiry’s proposals concerning notification of parties and candidates in the event of new elections. In addition, it is important that the implementation of a new election can always take place securely, so that a further new election is avoided. Any time limit must therefore be generous.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has found that it should be possible to hold a new election within a time limit of three months in a secure manner in all the various situations that may arise. However, in some cases it will be possible to carry out new elections more quickly. The Inquiry therefore proposes the introduction of a provision in the Elections Act to the effect that a new election be held as soon as possible and within three months of the decision to hold a new election.</p>
<h2>Changed timing for the dispatch of voting cards</h2>
<p>For a new election to be held within a shorter period of time than the proposed time limit of three months, consideration of the timing of the dispatch of foreign voting cards is necessary. Under the present regulations, these special voting cards, which are intended for voters who are not registered as resident in Sweden, are posted to such voters no later than 50 days before the election day. There is no specific deadline in the case of new elections, rather the deadline is the same for all elections. This means that new elections cannot be held earlier, which is not an entirely satisfactory system in light of the Inquiry’s other proposals.</p>
<p>To enable a new election to be held earlier, the Inquiry proposes that the provisions be amended so that foreign voting cards are sent to the voters as soon possible after it has been decided when the new election is to be held.</p>
<p>Voting cards for voters who are registered as resident in Sweden are sent according to the current system so that they reach the voters 18 days before election day at the latest. This also applies in the case of new elections. However, advance voting in a new election commences 10 days before election day at the earliest. In addition, the work of the Election Authority is made easier in the event of an extensive new election if voting cards are sent out later. Therefore, the Inquiry proposes that voting cards should reach the voters 10 days before election day at the latest.</p>
<h2>Other time limits in new elections should not be changed</h2>
<p>There are also other time limits covering election preparations for which the Inquiry has considered possible changes.</p>
<p>Under the current system for new elections, postal voting may be arranged only after the date of the election has been set. In new elections, voting by proxy may be arranged ten days before election day, or 20 days for a vote by proxy at a mission abroad. Finally, advance voting may commence ten days before election day at a voting place, and 24 days before election day at a mission abroad.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has noted that these time limits are well adapted to the specific situation that arises at a new election. Nor do they hinder the holding of a new election as soon as is practically possible and appropriate. Therefore, the Inquiry proposes no changes to these time limits.</p>
<h2>The processing of appeals to be made more efficient</h2>
<p>For the purpose of simplifying processing and administration in connection with appeals of an election result, the Inquiry purposes certain legislative amendments to the provisions that relate to processing by the Election Review Board. The amendments can help speed up any new election procedure.</p>
<p>Under the current provisions, the results of elections to the Riksdag and to the European Parliament are announced by public notice. For the purpose of efficiency, the Inquiry proposes that the election result is instead made public by the record being presented for review, which is how the results of county council and municipal elections are made public. This means that the election result can be made public by being posted on the Election Authority’s noticeboard or published on its website, for example.</p>
<p>Today, an appeal of an election result is to be submitted to the authority that issued the appealed decision. The decision-making authority is to make all appeals public, submit them to the Election Review Board and deliver its opinion on the appeals. However, it is the Election Review Board that determines whether the appeals have been received in time.</p>
<p>This is an inefficient system since processing by the Election Review Board cannot start immediately. In addition, the decisionmaking authority often needs to obtain information from other bodies to be able to deliver its opinion to the Board. The Inquiry therefore proposes a more flexible and efficient system whereby appeals are instead submitted to the Election Review Board. The Board can then decide which material is required for the review. The express right in the Elections Act for members of the public to give an opinion on the appeals following their being made public is also removed.</p>
<h2>Strengthened protection for secrecy of the ballot Protection for secrecy of the ballot can be improved</h2>
<p>The right to free and secret elections is enshrined in the Instrument of Government and in international commitments undertaken by Sweden. Voters should thus have guaranteed safeguards so that no one can decide what another person votes for and that no one is subjected to external influence when voting. Voters should not be forced to show or say how they have voted. Nor should it be possible to find out how someone has voted.</p>
<p>Under the current system, ballot papers must be made available to voters by being placed at an appropriate place at the vote reception point. Voters select ballot papers from this place and then, inside a polling booth, place one in a vote envelop.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has made the assessment that, by and large, the requirement that elections must be free and secret has been met by the current electoral system. However, it can be improved. In this respect, the Inquiry considers that the system sought should be as uncomplicated as possible and make it easy for voters to maintain secrecy of the ballot.</p>
<h2>Ballot papers should be placed inside the polling booth</h2>
<p>There are various possibilities for strengthening the protection of the secrecy of the ballot. The Inquiry has considered solutions whereby ballot papers are placed in an area that is screened off or in a separate room. The possibility of voters printing out their desired ballot paper inside a polling booth has also been considered. However, these solutions have been considered complicated, inefficient or too expensive.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposal means that the ballot papers would be made available inside the polling booths. This solution would require a different type of polling booth than those used at present. For example it may be appropriate to have polling booths that have three sides and space for ballot papers, and the possibility of drawing a curtain behind the voter.</p>
<p>This is a solution that would be easy for all voters to use. The voter is also undisturbed during the actual act of voting and is therefore offered very strong protection for secrecy of the ballot.</p>
<p>In addition, the Inquiry makes the assessment that the system can be improved further by strengthening the election boards’ control of arrangements at the vote reception points. During the Inquiry, it has emerged that some of the criticism of the system stems from situations that have been due to the formation of queues at the vote reception points or other disorder. Work at the vote reception points can thus be tightened up. Further improvements can also be made in respect of information and training in matters relating to the secrecy of the ballot for both electoral officers and voters.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>The new provisions are proposed to enter into force on 1 January 2018 and will first apply in the run-up to and during the ordinary elections to the Riksdag and to county council and municipal council assemblies in 2018.</p>
