<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>The Committee has been charged with conducting a review of the Swedish Bar Association's disciplinary activities and the supervision of the practice of law in general, and to submit proposals for any changes which may be justified .</p>
<p>According to the terms of reference, which are attached as an appendix to the report, the Committee specifically had the task of analysing the manner in which the current system satisfies the requirements in respect of skills and ethics among advokats,  as well as confidence in such persons, and the manner in which the current system meets the requirements which should be placed upon the disciplinary activities. The task has included an open-ended review of both the Association's and the Chancellor of Justice's role in conjunction with supervision of the legal profession. According to the terms of reference, the Committee has been at liberty to also consider other issues that are connected hereto, such as the system applicable to the Association's review of fees charged.</p>
<p>It is emphasised in the terms of reference that each change must take into account the requirements imposed by due process, and that the independence of an individual advokat  and the Swedish Bar Association in relation to the Government and Parliament must be preserved.</p>
<p>Finally, the Committee has been charged with investigating whether an amendment may be required to the rule in Chapter 1, section 1 of the Swedish Companies Act (SFS 1975:1385) regarding partners' liability in respect of the practice of law conducted in corporate form. According to the terms of reference, an amendment must serve a client's interests by ensuring that an advokat  retained by him bears a financial liability for any damage that the advokat  may cause.</p>
<h2>Current System</h2>
<p>Rules regarding the legal profession are contained in the Code of Judicial Procedure and regulations of the Swedish Bar Association, which are established by the Government. An advokat  is any person who is a member of the Swedish Bar Association. Certain requirements are imposed for membership of the Association, as specified in the Code of Judicial Procedure. The applicant must have received both a law degree and have a certain amount of experience, as well as be generally suitable to practice law. Admittance is determined by the Managing Committee of the Association. Supervision of the legal profession is managed by the Management Committee of the Association and its Disciplinary Board. The Board consists of eight advokats  who are elected by the Association and three public representatives who are appointed by the Government. The Board may work in departments. The Chancellor of Justice also exercises a degree of supervision of the legal profession. He receives all decisions of the Disciplinary Board for review, and may request that the Board take measures against an individual advokat.</p>
<p>Disciplinary measures that may be imposed on an advokat  are disbarment from the Association, a warning, and a caution. If particular grounds exist, a fine can be imposed together with a warning. Decisions regarding refusal of membership of the Association or expulsion may be appealed by the lawyer concerned to the Swedish Supreme Court. Other decisions of the Disciplinary Board may only be appealed by the Chancellor of Justice.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Board decides whether a particular decision shall be made public. When it has been received by the Chancellor of Justice, it becomes a public document.</p>
<p>The practice of law may be conducted as a sole trader, through the medium of a partnership or a limited company. According to a provision of the Companies Act, a partner of a limited company which conducts the practice of law assumes joint and several liability together with the company for such obligations toward clients which the company assumes whilst he is a partner.</p>
<h2>The Committee's proposals</h2>
<p>Admittance to the Bar Association</p>
<p>The Committee's secretary has reviewed a number of admission matters to the Association. The review is set forth in Chapter 2 of the report. As far as can be judged, the present system functions satisfactorily. Therefore, the Committee does not propose any changes in this respect.</p>
<p>According to the proposal, decisions in respect of admission matters shall, however, be appealed to the Svea Court of Appeal in lieu of the Swedish Supreme Court as at present.</p>
<p>Supervision of the legal profession</p>
<p>The Committee's secretary has reviewed a number of matters considered before the Association's Disciplinary Board and the Chancellor of Justice. The review is set forth in Chapter 3 of the report. The Committee found that the present system functions relatively well, but that the reviews performed by the Chancellor of Justice are somewhat perfunctory. Taking this into consideration, and since the Chancellor of Justice has adduced convincing reasons to be released from the supervisory task, in as much as such relates to advokats,  it is proposed that this procedure shall be discontinued.</p>
<p>The Committee has discussed different alternatives to strengthen the influence of the public control on supervision of the legal profession, such as the transfer of the Chancellor of Justice's functions to another public authority, or the disciplinary operations to a board independent of the Association. The Committee has found, however, that this would not give rise to any evident advantages and, as regards the last-mentioned alternative, this may, moreover, constitute a threat to independence of the position held by advokats.  The Committee has chosen instead to propose that the public's influence, on the supervision be strengthened by requiring the Chairman to be a serving or retired judge. The remainder of the board shall consist of seven advokats  and three public representatives. The advokats  will then still constitute the majority of the board. A quorum shall require the Chairman and a further five members.</p>
<p>Insight into the operations must also be improved if the Chancellor of Justice's supervisory function is discontinued. Therefore, the Committee proposes that the principle of public access to public documents be made applicable to the disciplinary activities of the Association. In this way, the documents in these proceedings will become public documents and a determination of confidentiality may be undertaken case by case.</p>
<p>As regards the right to submit complaints, the Committee does not consider the present system to function satisfactorily. This will become even more pronounced if the Chancellor of Justice's supervisory functions are discontinued. The Committee considers it to be self-evident that an advokat  who is subject to disciplinary measures should be able to appeal. More uncertain is the issue whether the complainant shall also have such right. However, the Committee has decided that the complainant who is affected by the matter shall also be given such a right. Ac- cording to the proposal, the appeal shall be made to the Svea Court of Appeal.</p>
<p>Review of fees charged</p>
<p>The Committee's secretary has reviewed a number of fee-related matters. The review is set forth in Chapter 4. The Committee has found that the client's interests are so well protected by the present system that there is no reason to propose any changes in this respect.</p>
<p>The liability of advokats who conduct the practice of the law through a limited company</p>
<p>The Committee has not found any concrete reasons why the present special rule in respect of personal liability for all partners in a law firm that is a limited company should be maintained. The client maybe regarded as well protected by being able to claim liability against the lawyer responsible and the company, especially since every lawyer must have professional indemnity insurance.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Committee proposes that the Companies Act be amended in accordance with the above. Only the partner(s) responsible for a particular matter shall, together with the company, be liable for such liabilities as the company incurs whilst he is a partner.</p>
<p>Costs</p>
<p>The proposal, if implemented, will give rise to certain increased costs for the State in the form of fees for judges and costs for adjudication by the courts. The costs are not, however, estimated to amount to a particularly significant amount. However, certain costs will result for the Swedish Bar Association.</p>
