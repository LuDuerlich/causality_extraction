<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The remit of the Committee is to conduct a broad review of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act. This review is to cover certain specified matters, but the Committee is at liberty to examine other matters within the framework of its remit.</p>
<p>The Committee is to consider whether there are grounds for restricting opportunities for the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority to conduct independent assessments under the law of damages. The Committee is also to determine whether there are grounds for extending the right to criminal injuries compensation for violations of personal integrity to certain aggravated offences regarding defamation. Furthermore, the 2006 reform on criminal injuries compensation to children who have witnessed violence against a close relative will be evaluated. The Committee will also consider whether there are grounds for lowering the requirements placed on victims of crime to make their own claims regarding payment from the person liable for damages, for example by placing the primary responsibility for demanding payment of imposed criminal injury compensation on the state. Legislation of recourse activities will also be reviewed, as will the maximum amounts in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act. Moreover, the Committee will also examine whether there is a need for legislative amendments, for example as regards application periods, statutory limitations and the general prohibition against the transfer of criminal injuries compensation.</p>
<h2>Independent assessments under the law of damages by the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority</h2>
<p>Criminal injuries compensation is a regulation under public law, unlike damages, which is under civil law. While criminal injuries compensation is mainly to be determined according to the principles of the law of damages, it is nonetheless governed by the regulations of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act. The aim of criminal injuries compensation is that the injured party is to be ensured some compensation if the injury is not compensated from some other source, which essentially means the person who caused the injury or an insurance policy. Thus the size of criminal injuries compensation can, for various reasons, differ from what a court has ordered regarding damages in a judgment. Typically the injured party has received some compensation, either via an insurance policy or via payment by the person who caused the injury. In addition, a basic deduction is made when the compensation is determined.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority is not bound in any other way by what a court has ordered concerning damages. The Authority may make its own assessments under the law of damages, which may differ from what a court has decided.</p>
<p>In order to emphasise the importance of court judgments in situations where there is no substantive difference in the regulations, the Committee proposes that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act should make clear that the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority must follow a court’s order on damages when the court has examined the substance of a claim for damages. However, the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority is to be able to set higher or lower compensation in two situations. One is where there is reason for doing so in view of new circumstances or new evidence, such as an additional medical examination that was not available at the time of the court proceedings. The other situation is when compensation ordered by a court differs considerably from current practice. The proposed provision aims at practice concerning compensation levels and should primarily be relevant in matters of compensation for personal integrity violations, where the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority has extensive knowledge and, via its Board, considerable influence over practice in the area of the law of damages. One condition for the Authority to deviate from a court’s order will be that there actually is established practice that the court has neglected to follow. The Authority’s grounds from deviating from the court’s decision are to be specifically stated in its decision.</p>
<h2>Should the right to criminal injuries compensation for personal integrity violations be expanded?</h2>
<p>A court can order damages for personal integrity violations if, for example, someone has seriously violated another person’s honour (i.e. gross defamation). It is currently not possible to award criminal injuries compensation for an offence of this kind. In light of the increased use of the internet and the extent to which grossly offensive information can be spread there, the Committee’s terms of reference raises the question of whether criminal injuries compensation should be expanded to certain offences regarding defamation.</p>
<p>The Committee finds that a right to criminal injuries compensation for offences regarding defamation should not be introduced. Offences of this kind are not subject to public prosecution and consequently, in the majority of cases, the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority would not initiate an examination of the offence. Nor is there a suitable way to limit an expanded right to compensation. The scope of crime on the internet is not known since it is not possible to select ‘the internet’ in the Police Service’s reporting system. Furthermore, the fact that the internet is borderless means that the effects of an expanded right to compensation are difficult to assess. It is therefore not possible to analyse the impact an expansion would have on public finances.</p>
<p>The problems that exist concerning defamation on the internet are greater than the issue of criminal injuries compensation, and may need to be examined on the basis of other perspectives.</p>
<h2>Crime victims’ obligation to demand payment on their own</h2>
<p>The Committee proposes that a provision be introduced in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act stating that the injured party must, to a reasonable extent, provide assistance so that the reported offence can be investigated. As before, the general rule is that a police report must be made. This would increase the prospects of being able to investigate the offence and of the person who caused the injury being obliged to pay for the injury he or she caused.</p>
<p>As regards other claims regarding the injured party, the alternative most advantageous to crime victims would be to allow payment of criminal injuries compensation in direct connection with the offence. However, the Committee finds that an arrangement of this kind is not compatible with the structure of the current system. Many people consider that restitution from the person who caused the injury is important for the crime victim to gain redress. The basic principle of the law of damages, that the person who caused the injury must pay compensation for it, would be relegated to the background. The function of insurance compensation would also be changed and in time there is a risk that insurance coverage would cease. This is because, if insurance companies were to pay the compensation to the state rather than to the individual policy-holder, the company’s incentive to retain the protection in their policies, as well as the customer’s incentive to have such a policy, would disappear. At present, insurance companies pay at least as much via assault protection in home insurance policies as the state pays through criminal injuries compensation. Changing the arrangement would also result in a deterioration of the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority’s decision-making data. Complications would also arise in relation to a subsequent damages claim against the person who caused the injury. The terms of reference contain little support for proposing such a radical revision of the system of rules nor, in the Committee’s opinion, is it motivated.</p>
<p>The Committee has also considered whether criminal injuries compensation should be paid directly after a final and nonappealable judgment has been delivered. However, it is the Committee’s opinion that even a solution of this kind would have great consequences for the criminal injuries compensation system, primarily through an impact on insurance coverage. The relationship between insurance companies and their customers would be eroded and many companies would probably remove assault protection from their policies. Besides altering the interplay between the insurance companies’ claims review boards, courts and the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority, a solution of this kind would have major consequences on public finances. This kind of construction would also impact on the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority’s work. The ability of the person who caused the injury to pay would not have been examined when the matter comes before the Authority, so that the Authority, after having paid the criminal injuries compensation, would not be able to send the matter directly to the Swedish Enforcement Authority for collection. If all judgments containing orders on damages (some 15 000–20 000 judgments per year) were sent to the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority – rather than the Swedish Enforcement Authority, as is currently the case – it would also be the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority that would review all the judgments and assess whether current offences may result in criminal injuries compensation. All other judgements, as well as judgments where the amount of the damages ordered exceeds that which may be paid in criminal injuries compensation, would be forwarded to the Swedish Enforcement Authority. The Swedish Enforcement Authority would thus still handle some of the matters, although later in the process.</p>
<p>On the whole, the Committee notes that the system is based on interplay between the law of damages, insurance compensation paid by insurance companies and criminal injuries compensation under public law. Changes made in any part of the system would have repercussions for the entire system. The Committee considers that there are insufficient grounds for making a change of this kind. The comparisons often made with Norway and Denmark are therefore not entirely correct. In these countries, policies corresponding to home insurance policies do not cover personal injuries. There are other policies that may be relevant, but these do not seem to be as prevalent as Swedish home insurance policies (97 per cent of the population). Compensation corresponding to the Swedish compensation for violations of personal integrity is not included by any policy in Norway, and generally not in Denmark, either. It would therefore appear that the policies play a greater role in Sweden. In addition, the Norwegian and Danish counterparts to the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority have longer processing times, which means that “payment directly after a final and unappealable judgment” in Norway and Denmark does not in essence entail a difference in time. For this reason the Committee is not proposing that criminal injuries compensation be paid directly after a final and unappealable judgment.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Committee does not recommend changing the current arrangements, which means that the injured party must try to collect compensation from the person who caused the injury and from any insurance policy before applying for criminal injuries compensation. As previously, there will not be an unconditional requirement that the injured party must bring a court action for damages against the person who caused the injury in order for criminal injuries compensation to be paid. However, in terms of an investigation, initiating legal action is advantageous to the injured party.</p>
<p>The Committee has considered whether the newly introduced vicarious liability for parents or guardians motivates a special regulation so that it is not necessary to exhaust the possibilities of also collecting damages from a parent or guardian before payment of criminal injuries compensation can be considered. As far as can be seen from the Swedish Enforcement Authority’s preliminary examinations, it does not take longer to receive a case report from the Authority when claims are also aimed at parents or guardians, and it also appears that frequency of payments is higher than in general. It is not known what impact vicarious liability has had on other public authorities, such as the Swedish Prosecution Authority or the courts. A lack of more detailed experience means that the Committee does not have enough data to determine whether the situation of injured parties has deteriorated due to vicarious liability. However, the Committee notes that as a result of vicarious liability, greater demands are placed on the injured party in that he or she must seek enforcement from more people and fill in more forms, and that there is reason to monitor the reform.</p>
<p>The Committee considers that there are other measures that the relevant authorities can take to make matters easier for the injured party, for example with regard to digital information transmission.</p>
<p>In view of the conclusion that the system’s structure should be retained, the Committee proposes introducing a provision that criminal injuries compensation be granted for that portion of the injury not covered by other compensation that the injured party is entitled to due to the injury.</p>
<p>Finally, it is the Committee’s opinion that there is no need for a provision on advance payment in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act. This is because the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority has short processing times and can often grant compensation for such matters as violations of personal integrity even if compensation for pain and suffering needs to be examined further.</p>
<h2>Recourse activities</h2>
<p>The Committee proposes that a provision be introduced that, if the offender is known, the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority is to recover an amount from him or her corresponding to the criminal injuries compensation that was paid, in so far as this is not inappropriate in light of the offender’s personal circumstances or the possibilities of the claim being paid. The regulation means that the practice followed by the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority, in accordance with its instructions, is given clearer support in the Act.</p>
<p>The Committee further proposes that the state should assume the injured party’s right to damages up to the amount that was paid in criminal injuries compensation plus  subsequent running interest from the day of payment. This means that the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority has the right to interest on the amount in a similar way as the injured party had on damages. However, if the judgment does not include an order concerning interest, the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority is not entitled to any interest. The Committee also proposes that the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority be given the opportunity to enter into agreements that interest is not to be paid, and to deduct payments from the principal rather than from interest and costs. These opportunities available to the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority derive from the fact that the Authority ‘owns its claims’ and are tools that it can use in its recourse activities to achieve a reasonable result (also for the person who caused the injury). The Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority should also have the option of granting exemptions from recourse actions and interest claims, if there are special grounds for doing so. The Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority should also be able to enter into agreements with offenders regarding payment of a certain part of the debt in return for writing off the remainder. The result of such an exemption is that the debt is cancelled. The provision on granting exemptions should only be used in exceptional cases.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that as a rule, the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority should set off a payment of criminal injuries compensation against a recourse claim for such compensation that has been paid. This means that, unlike at present, the person eligible for criminal injuries compensation (the injured party) cannot choose to receive the compensation in cash rather than using the money to pay a previous debt incurred by the person (in his or her capacity as the person who caused the injury). However, payments are not to be set off if this is considered inappropriate, i.e. if the compensation is intended for costs for essential dental care or other compensation of an urgent social nature.</p>
<h2>Children who have witnessed crime</h2>
<p>In 2006, children who witnessed violence against a close relative were, in certain circumstances, given the right to receive criminal injuries compensation. As far as the Committee can determine, the reform has not had the desired impact among the relevant authorities. Children who attend preliminary investigations are still not given the desired amount of attention.</p>
<p>The Committee considers that legislative provisions are not necessary to encourage authorities to give attention to children who have witnessed crime. There is, however, reason to consider introducing provisions in the Preliminary Investigations Ordinance stating that injured parties are to be informed of the possibility for children to collect criminal injuries compensation. Also, it is to be noted in preliminary investigation reports that there were children on the scene, and also where they were situated. The Committee also considers that the National Police Board should consider creating special boxes on the Police Service’s reporting system to be ticked if there were children on the scene, and also that the parent or guardian was informed of the child’s right to compensation. In addition, relevant authorities, particularly the National Police Board, the Swedish Prosecution Authority and social welfare committees, should conduct training activities to increase awareness of the fact that it may be possible for children who have witnessed crime to receive criminal injuries compensation.</p>
<p>The Committee also proposes introducing a legislative provision stating that the signature of one  parent or guardian on behalf of the child on an application is sufficient for criminal injuries compensation, if the crime was committed by the child’s other parent or guardian.</p>
<h2>Maximum amounts</h2>
<p>The Committee proposes that the upper limit for criminal injuries compensation in the form of compensation for violations of personal integrity should be raised from 10 to 15 base amounts. The other maximum amounts, for personal injury, annual life annuities, damage to property and pure financial loss, should remain unchanged.</p>
<p>A certain amount should still be deducted from the criminal injuries compensation that is paid, however it should be renamed ‘basic deduction’ rather than ‘excess’ as is currently the case.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Committee proposes that the minimum amount of criminal injuries compensation that can be paid should be raised from SEK 10 to SEK 100.</p>
<h2>Application period, statutory limitation, review and prohibition of transfer</h2>
<p>The Committee proposes that the period to apply for criminal injuries compensation should be extended from two to three years.</p>
<p>The Committee also proposes that the current reference in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act to the provision on review in the Tort Liability Act should be removed. The extensive right to review under the special provisions of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act is deemed adequate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Committee proposes that statutory limitation matters should be regulated in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act. In this context, it is proposed that a claim for criminal injuries compensation should have a statutory limitation period of 10 years from the time of the criminal act. When conducting a review, the statutory limitation period should begin 10 years after the latest decision of the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority. The running of the period of statutory limitation on a claim for criminal injuries compensation should be interrupted if the injured party demands: a) damages on account of the offence from the person who caused the injury; b) insurance compensation on account of the offence from the insurance company; or c) criminal injuries compensation from the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority. Such demands should serve to interrupt the statutory limitation period for all injuries that may be compensated by criminal injuries compensation. The Committee also proposes a special statutory limitation regulation on the state’s recourse claim against the offender, namely 10 years after the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority has paid criminal injuries compensation to the injured party. Interruption of the running of the period of statutory limitation should be permissible according to the Act on Limitation.</p>
<p>In addition, transferring a claim for criminal injuries compensation prior to the compensation being declared payable should remain prohibited. This means, as far as criminal injuries compensation for personal injuries is concerned, it is prohibited to seize such claims. Notwithstanding this, however, the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority should be able to decide that criminal injuries compensation relating to costs not yet incurred for essential medical treatment should be paid to the care provider when the cost has been incurred. This situation is most likely to arise with regard to costs for dental treatment. However, it should also be possible to apply this provision in similar cases involving other essential costs.</p>
<h2>Repayment of criminal injuries compensation</h2>
<p>The Committee proposes the introduction of a provision in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act on repayment of criminal injuries compensation that has been awarded. This would be applicable if the applicant has submitted incorrect information or withheld circumstances of significance to the decision to award criminal injuries compensation. The same should apply if the applicant, after payment, receives another form of compensation for the injury (usually from an insurance policy). It should also be possible to demand repayment in other cases if criminal injuries compensation has been given in error, or in excess, and the receiver has, or should have, realised this. This may be the case if, for example, the applicant wrongly receives compensation twice for the same injury.</p>
<p>If a person who has received an incorrect payment does not repay the amount following a demand to do so from the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority, the Authority may seek an injunction to pay via the Swedish Enforcement Authority or an indictment at a district court. In other words, a decision on repayment would not be enforceable with immediate effect. However, the provision on offsetting would be applicable. A claim for criminal injuries compensation should be deducted if the injured party is required to make a repayment under the new repayment provisions.</p>
<h2>Other matters</h2>
<p>The Committee has carried out a review of the sections not immediately affected by the matters specifically raised in the terms of reference. In the following respects, the Committee proposes amendments compared with the current Criminal Injuries Compensation Act.</p>
<p>With regard to the scope of the Act, the Committee proposes that criminal injuries compensation, as previously, should not be paid if the offence and the injured party have such a minor connection with Sweden that it would be unreasonable to use Swedish state funds to compensate the injury. However, the provision on exemption should not be applied in cases of intentional crimes of violence committed in Sweden against an injured party who, at the time of the offence, was a citizen or resident of another EU state. This restriction of the provision on exemption is proposed in light of the EU directive on the rights of victims, under which Sweden is obligated to establish a system for</p>
<p>compensation of victims of intentional violent crimes committed in Sweden.</p>
<p>The regulations on criminal injuries compensation for injuries caused by persons who have escaped from custodial care should only be amended to the extent that they would no longer apply if the injury has been caused by a person who is subject to deprivation of liberty in Denmark, Finland, Iceland or Norway. As far as is known, this provision has not been applied.</p>
<p>The provision that currently regulates how criminal injuries compensation is determined should no longer to refer to Chapter 5, Section 4 of the Tort Liability Act. This provision sets out the conditions for granting damages in the form of a life annuity. Rather, the conditions under which a life annuity may be granted should be stated directly in the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act. This is a question of legal design alone, no amendment in substance is proposed.</p>
<p>The Committee also proposes that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act should no longer refer to the provision on adjusting damages in Chapter 6, Section 1 of the Tort Liability Act. The possibilities to adjust criminal injuries compensation based on the provision of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Act are adequate.</p>
<p>It has previously been possible to delegate decision-making on minor compensation amounts to an authority other than the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority. This possibility was used in the past to enable the boards of juvenile detention schools to make decisions on criminal injuries compensation. However, since this possibility has not been used in 30 years, the Committee believes that it should be removed.</p>
<p>Finally, the Committee proposes that the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority, when so requested by the injured party , should treat an application for criminal injuries compensation as an application for European criminal injuries compensation if the offence was committed in another EU state. Currently, all applications that concern intentional crimes of violence committed in another EU state are to be considered as applications for European criminal injuries compensation. The legislative amendment would mean that the applicant is given greater opportunity to influence when this should occur.</p>
