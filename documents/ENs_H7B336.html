<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>• The travel deduction in its present  cost-based form is abolished.</p>
<p>• A  distance-based and mode-neutral tax reduction is introduced for long trips between the home and workplace (commuting trips). Tax reduction as a form means that the tax relief will be independent of the taxpayer’s income and marginal tax rate.</p>
<p>• The tax reduction is given for the part of the  one-way distance between the home and workplace that is greater than 30 kilometres and less than or equal to 80 kilometres.</p>
<p>• The tax reduction is calculated on the basis of the actual number of commuting days in the taxation year with trips longer than the lower distance limit for a tax reduction, but at most 210 days. If there are 59 or fewer commuting days, no tax reduction is allowed.</p>
<p>• The tax reduction is SEK 0.60 per kilometre irrespective of the transport mode actually used for the commuting trip.</p>
<p>• If public transport is considered deficient a further tax reduction is allowed of a fixed amount of SEK 20 per commuting day for a distance of 30 kilometres or more and a variable amount of SEK 0.60 per kilometre for distances between 80 and 150 kilometres.</p>
<p>• Taxpayers who are obliged on account of illness or disability to use their own car or a company car instead of public transport are given a tax reduction for the part of the  one-way distance that is greater than 10 kilometres and less than or equal to 150 kilometres.</p>
<p>• A tax reduction of 30 per cent of reasonable expenses for road, bridge or ferry charges in connection with commuting trips is given for the part of the aggregate expenses in excess of SEK 8 000 in the taxation year provided that public transport is considered deficient.</p>
<p>• The deduction for congestion tax is abolished.</p>
<p>• Administration and control are improved and made more certain with some use of  pre-entered data.</p>
<p>• The proposed legislative amendments should enter into force on 1 January 2021.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In December 2017 the Government decided to appoint a committee of inquiry to examine and present proposals for changes to the system of travel deductions. The present regulations have been considered to favour metropolitan areas and commuting by car compared with other transport modes, which does not reward travel with low emissions. The rules have also been criticised on account of the difficulty of checking that taxpayers claiming deductions for commuting trips meet the requirements for the right to make deductions. A number of government-appointed inquiries, including the Committee on Environmental Objectives and the cross-party Rural Areas Committee, have considered the present system of travel deductions and proposed amending or reviewing the regulations.</p>
<p>Under our terms of reference we are to examine how the system for travel deductions should be revised so as to better favour travel with low emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollution while being simpler to apply, administer and check than the present system. Another starting point for the proposal for a new travel deduction should be that it contributes to regional enlargement and thereby facilitates labour market mobility at the same time as the design of the travel deduction contributes to the climate targets for the transport sector in 2030. The Committee’s remit includes analysing how a distance-based travel deduction can be designed, and the Committee is to assess the suitability of such a design.</p>
<p>The travel deduction has been in existence for more than 100 years and is part of what is called ‘net income taxation’. The deduction is based on the cost of a commuting trip with an element of standardisation. Our historical survey shows that the travel deduction has been called into question throughout almost all of its existence. Many inquiry reports and government bills have stressed that the costs of commuting trips should really to be regarded as private living costs that should not, under the principles of tax law, entitle to deductions in income taxation. The justification for nevertheless retaining the deduction has been that, for some taxpayers, the travel deduction is of great importance and may have some link to the earning of income.</p>
<p>In recent decades, inquiries have been held on changing the design of the travel deduction to base it on the distance between the home and workplace instead of the cost of the trip. As yet, however, these inquiries have not resulted in any changes.</p>
<p>Around half of OECD countries surveyed do not have travel deductions. Among the countries that do have some form of travel deduction the differences in design are considerable. A travel deduction similar to that in Sweden is only found in a few other countries. Denmark and Norway have had distance-based, mode-neutral travel deductions for around twenty years.</p>
<h2>Commuting in Sweden</h2>
<p>The total number of commuters in Sweden is around 4.5 million. Most commuting trips are made regularly on a daily basis for a large part of the year, but there are also other patterns.</p>
<p>The great majority of all commuting trips, around 80 per cent, are one-way trips under 30 kilometres and around half the trips are under 10 kilometres. Just under 60 per cent of the trips are by car, just under 20 per cent are by public transport and just over 20 per cent by walking or cycling; almost all trips in the latter group are under 10 kilometres. Travel patterns differ between different parts of the country. In the metropolitan areas, and especially in Stockholm, the public transport share is much higher than the average for the country, while trips by car dominate strongly in sparsely developed regions.</p>
<p>In taxation year 2017 around 902 000 taxpayers claimed travel deductions in the income class of employment, i.e. about 20 per cent of all commuters. Their deductions totalled SEK 14.2 billion. The deductions vary in size from a few hundred kronor to more than</p>
<p>SEK 70 000. The average deduction is just under SEK 16 000. In total, the deductions correspond to a tax revenue shortfall for central government of around SEK 5.5 billion per year. A smaller number of travel deductions are also made in the income class of business activities.</p>
<p>The distribution of travel deductions by mode of transport is not known. We estimate that around 90 per cent of all deductions relate to trips by car and 10 per cent to trips by public transport. We estimate that travel deductions for cars account for around 95 per cent of the total amount of the deductions and public transport for around 5 per cent.</p>
<p>In a recently published report, the Swedish Tax Agency estimates that more than half of the travel deductions claimed contain errors and that the total tax error is around SEK 1.75 billion per year.</p>
<h2>Main approach and form of tax relief for commuting</h2>
<p>We propose that tax relief for commuting be given a slightly different direction from at present and we also propose using a different form in tax law and a different basis for calculating the tax relief.</p>
<p>We view costs for commuting as a private living cost for which people with normal and low costs should not be compensated via the tax system. Tax relief for commuting should focus on people who have a long distance between their home and workplace and therefore typically have higher costs for their commuting trips, both in monetary terms and in the form of sacrifices of time and convenience. The purpose of that tax relief should be to contribute to regional enlargement, a well-functioning labour market and the possibility for people to have a home and livelihood anywhere in the country.</p>
<p>In our assessment, that approach is best served through a different form of tax relief than at present. Travel deductions have always been regarded as an exception from the principle of tax law that private living costs should not be deductible in income taxation. We take the consequences of this and propose that tax relief for long commuting trips should be given in the form of a tax reduction instead. Unlike a deduction, a tax reduction has the same value for all taxpayers irrespective of their income and marginal tax rate. This means that it is favourable in terms of redistribution policy. The tax reduction has been designed in a way that results in a smaller tax revenue shortfall for central government without impairing the tax relief for taxpayers with normal and low incomes and marginal tax rates.</p>
<p>In addition to these changes, we also propose that the tax relief that is currently calculated using the cost of the commuting trip should instead be based on the distance between the home and workplace. The tax relief, which currently mainly favours trips by car, will therefore be mode-neutral and the same at a particular distance irrespective of the mode of transport chosen.</p>
<p>We have appraised that kind of tax relief, a distance-based and mode-neutral tax reduction for long commuting trips, on the basis of its ability to fulfil the criteria given as starting points in our terms of reference. Our focus on long commuting trips favours region enlargement and expanded labour markets with good freedom of choice for both employees and employers to search for jobs and labour at longer distances.</p>
<p>At the same time, a distance-based and mode-neutral model will, in time, lead to a shift of commuting trips from cars to public transport, which is favourable for the environment and the possibilities of achieving the climate target for the transport sector in 2030. Our approach also involves simpler regulation which has, along with the development of new administrative procedures for tax reductions, the potential to greatly reduce the tax errors that have always been associated with the travel deduction.</p>
<p>However, distance-based relief according to our proposal does not in itself bring any benefits to residents in areas where public transport is deficient. We therefore propose giving a supplement to the tax reduction in areas where public transport is deficient.</p>
<h2>Impact assessment</h2>
<p>The most important impacts of our proposals are summarised in point form below. The travel and environmental impacts are based on modelling results from the Swedish Transport Administration's traffic forecast model Sampers.</p>
<p>• Commuting that has a  home-workplace distance of less than 30 kilometres can no longer receive tax relief, except in the case of people with illnesses or disabilities.</p>
<p>• Most car users and a small number of public transport users who have a high income and therefore a higher marginal tax rate will have lower tax relief and therefore higher tax than today.</p>
<p>• Most public transport users at distances of more than 30 kilometres will receive higher tax relief than today. The maximum tax reduction they can receive is SEK 12 600 at distances of 80 kilometres or longer.</p>
<p>• Car users receive the same tax reduction as public transport users if they cannot show that they make a time gain of at least 2 hours and 30 minutes per day by travelling by car.</p>
<p>• Commuters with low and medium incomes in areas where public transport is deficient receive roughly the same tax relief at distances over 30 kilometres as with present rules.</p>
<p>• Carpooling will be more profitable. People who are ill or disabled and who need to travel by car receive roughly the same tax relief as today.</p>
<p>• No tax relief is given for congestion tax, and the relief for bridge and ferry charges is reduced significantly. Taxpayers with company cars get the same tax relief for commuting trips as other taxpayers, all else equal.</p>
<p>• Around 780 000 taxpayers are assessed to be able to receive the  distance-based tax reduction, a decrease by around 150 000 compared with the present tax deduction. Of those who can receive a tax reduction, 150 000 taxpayers are assessed to be able to access the special supplement for deficient public transport.</p>
<p>• Out of those who can receive a tax reduction, we assess that just over 20 per cent will travel by public transport and just under 80 per cent by car, compared with the estimated distribution of the current travel deduction of around 10 per cent for public transport and 90 per cent for cars. We estimate that just under 20 per cent of the tax relief in kronor will go to public transport users and just over 80 per cent to car users, compared with the</p>
<p>present distribution of roughly 5 per cent for public transport and 95 per cent for cars.</p>
<p>• The number of commuters by public transport is assessed to increase by approx. 3 per cent and transport system work, measured in person kilometres, by 12 per cent. The average commute by public transport increases from just under 19 to 20 kilometres for a  one-way trip. The changes are assessed to come about gradually over a 5–10-year period.</p>
<p>• The number of commuters by car is assessed to decrease by approx. 2 per cent and transport system work by 11 per cent. The average commute for car travel decreases from just under 17 to 15 kilometres for a  one-way trip.</p>
<p>• The number of walking or cycling commuters increases marginally by around 1 per cent.</p>
<p>• The number of commuters and transport system work by car decease most in commuting municipalities and increase most for public transport in rural municipalities, but from a very low starting level. The regional differences are relatively small.</p>
<p>• Emissions from commuting trips are assessed to decrease by around 11 per cent in a period of  5–10 years. This means, for instance, that emissions of carbon dioxide from commuting trips, which are estimated at more than 2 million tonnes per year at present, are estimated to decrease by around 220 000 tonnes. This corresponds to a decrease in emissions from all passenger cars of around 2 per cent.</p>
<p>• The number of traffic accidents on commuting trips is assessed to decrease by around 11 per cent, with, for instance, 6 fewer deaths, 100 fewer serious injuries and 600 fewer less serious injuries.</p>
<p>• It is estimated that the tax error may decrease by up to threequarters as a result of a combination of simpler rules and the development of administrative procedures; this has the potential to decrease the tax revenue shortfall for central government from its present level of around SEK 1.8 billion per year to the order of SEK 0.5 billion per year.</p>
<p>• Our proposals are expected to lead to a total tax revenue shortfall for central government of the order of SEK 4.9 billion per year, a decrease of just over SEK 1 billion compared with the present system. The tax relief for deficient public transport accounts for around SEK 0,7 billion of the total tax revenue shortfall.</p>
