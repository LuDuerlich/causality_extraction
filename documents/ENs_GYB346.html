<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>The Foreign Branch Offices Act (1992:160) – the Branches Act – mainly contains regulations concerning the establishment of independently managed branch offices (branches), i.e. a special form of business establishment. However, the Act’s introductory provisions are formulated in such general terms that the Act appears applicable even when foreign enterprises have only intended to undertake business activities temporarily. This legislation has thus forced companies to set up business in Sweden in situations where they should have had greater freedom of choice under EU legislation. This has now been highlighted by the European Commission, and during discussions in the Riksdag about the Services Directive, the Parliamentary Committee on Industry and Trade stressed the fact that there is a need to clarify the distinction in the Branches Act between the provision of temporary services and the setting up of a business, so that the former case is not included under requirements concerning branch offices. An exemption was introduced into the Foreign Branches Office Ordinance (1992:308) – the Branches Ordinance – in connection with the transposition of the Services Directive into Swedish law.</p>
<p>However, it is not unproblematic drawing a line between business establishment and services in terms of EU legislation. The European Court of Justice, for example, has considered that the provision of services over long periods lasting several years does not necessarily mean that the service provider has developed such links to the country that he or she has established a business there. Moreover, ‘posted worker services’ – i.e. services provided in Sweden by a foreign service provider using his or her own staff – have strong similarities with the establishment of a business, and the posting of workers may be regarded either as the establishment of a business or as the kind of temporary service provision that</p>
<p>meets the criteria of a service under the Treaty, depending on the circumstances. The dividing line is very important in practical terms, as the Swedish regulations – e.g. concerning taxation, accounting requirements and labour law – only actually fully apply when a business is established and to a much more limited extent where only the temporary provision of services is concerned.</p>
<p>The Inquiry shares the Commission’s view that service providers have incorrectly come under the Branches Act’s requirements to register a branch, or at least that they have to some extent had reason to assume that the law has required this. It is also evident that this problem cannot be solved simply by exempting services covered by the Services Directive from the scope of the provisions. This is because the root of the problem lies in the fundamental rules contained in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and not in the Services Directive. The Inquiry considers that the solution lies not in making exemptions, but in ensuring that the regulations contained in the Act meet well- defined purposes that – as far as European businesses are concerned – are reconcilable with EU legislation and that also have such precision and design as to be proportionate in relation to this legislation.</p>
<p>However, if services that were previously covered by the regulations contained in the Branches Act are entirely removed from the scope of the Act, this could result in a regulation loophole in the Swedish system. There is a risk that there would be room for irregularities on the part of less serious enterprises, e.g. in the form of economic crime and attempts to circumvent requirements set out in Swedish legislation. The registration requirement contained in the Branches Act has also made it possible for employee organisations to identify and come into contact with foreign employers, even though the Act was not designed for this purpose. In this sense the provisions have filled a practical function, also in cases that should normally be regarded as only the temporary provision of services. It is the Inquiry’s view that needs such as these that have been met by the Act cannot be completely ignored, although it may be considered to have conflicted with EU legislation in its previous application.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that it is not possible to leave it entirely to market actors to assess whether the provision of a service in a particular case is to be regarded as temporary and thus not covered by the Treaty’s provisions on establishing a business. As the</p>
<p>Inquiry has already pointed out, it is not all that easy drawing a line between the EU legal terms ‘establishment’ and ‘service’. Uncertainty over the legal situation is neither in the interests of the responsible authorities nor those of the market actors. Leaving interpretation issues to be resolved in subsequent legal proceedings</p>
<p>– which can turn out to be costly – is not a good solution for market actors. It is also important that the actors are fully aware of what rights and obligations result from both the EU rules and the Swedish regulations, so that they can adapt accordingly.</p>
<p>Against this background, the Inquiry considers that there is a need to supplement the Branches Act in two respects.</p>
<p>Firstly, guidelines should be designed determining what should be referred to as a service or a business establishment. It would be suitable to provide such guidelines in the Branches Ordinance. This is to be done in order to meet the justified demand for legal certainty and predictability in the application of the legislation on branch offices in Sweden. The guidelines must, of course, be formulated against the background of the dynamic character of EU legislation and in line with European Court of Justice case-law. In light of the fact that these rules may not be made so stringent as to lock the application in conflict with European Court of Justice case-law, it is appropriate for them to be formulated as presumptions. Responsibility for drawing the line should lie with the Swedish Companies Registration Office, which is responsible for the application of the Branches Act. Its decision must be appealable to an administrative court, which has the right to request a preliminary ruling from the European Court of Justice. Important assessment factors besides the time during which business operations are conducted are their continuity, regularity or frequency, assessed with regard to the circumstances of each individual case. It would appear to be in line with well-established practice to state in the legislation that the temporary provision of services refers to business operations that are not permanent considering their limited duration or regularity. In order to define this in concrete form, it should also be possible to use some form of standard model. In line with what has been stated, the Inquiry proposes that, as a point of departure, a business operation that is intended to last for a maximum of one year is not to be regarded as permanent unless there are special grounds to support this. It should be noted that this is simply a matter of a presumption. The Swedish Companies Registration Office should be given the</p>
<p>opportunity to determine on a case by case basis that a business operation that lasts for longer than one year is to be regarded as the temporary provision of a service. The opposite may also be the case, i.e. that an operation that lasts for less than a year may be regarded as an establishment. It should be up to the Swedish Companies Registration Office itself to take up the issue for examination, where necessary.</p>
<p>Secondly, a notification obligation should be introduced in certain cases for foreign business operators doing business in Sweden in order to enable independent control with the aim of ensuring that the business operation qualifies as an establishment when appropriate and not incorrectly as a service, and to contribute to the correct implementation of the Posting of Workers Directive. This notification obligation should target situations in which workers are posted abroad and other situations closely linked to establishment; it should cover, in particular, cases in which business operations in Sweden are of a certain duration and scale. To satisfy the intended purposes, a simple notification process will suffice, and it should be possible for this to be internet-based. The Inquiry proposes, therefore, that business operations run in Sweden by foreign enterprises established outside Sweden and by business operators who are not resident in Sweden are to be reported to the Swedish Companies Registration Office. Exemptions from the notification obligation will exist for operations that are not intended to last for more than six months and are not conducted with employed staff. If there is employed staff in Sweden, there is to be a contact person with an address in Sweden in the event that the operation lasts longer than 8 days. The contact person must also be reported to the Swedish Companies Registration Office.</p>
<p>The Inquiry does not consider that further requirements concerning services should be introduced into the Branches Act. If more specific requirements concerning the posting of workers need to be introduced, the Inquiry considers that the relevant provisions should be added to the Posting of Workers Act (1999:678) which focuses on these kinds of services.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the systems for administrative cooperation between authorities in the EU Member States that have been built up through the Posting of Workers Directive, the Services Directive and other instruments should, in the Inquiry’s view, be better used than has previously been the case. Administrative</p>
<p>cooperation is an important step in the creation of a functioning internal market in the EU and should contribute to increased trust between the Member States’ authorities and, ultimately, consumers. It is important that Sweden uses the opportunities created at EU level. It is a prerequisite for national regulations that limit free movement on the market that it is possible to show that the regulation problem cannot be solved by using the common systems.</p>
<p>In addition, the Inquiry proposes a number of simplifications to the Branches Act and the Branches Ordinance to make things easier for enterprises. There is reason to better reconcile the legislation on branch offices with the companies legislation when the two regulatory systems are comparable.</p>
