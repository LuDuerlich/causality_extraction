<h1>Summary in English</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>This book is published by the Delegation for occupational health services. The Delegation was appointed in 2009 with the task of strengthening this area of knowledge by investing in research, putting in place university programmes for occupational health service professions and implementing training initiatives for employees in this sector.</p>
<p>One important aspect of this initiative was to develop a course focusing on knowledge of occupational health services.</p>
<p>Previously there has been no basic book bringing together theoretical and practical knowledge of occupational health services. This book, which is based on the content of the abovementioned course, is intended to at least partly fill this gap.</p>
<p>The book contains texts and interviews, as well as independent articles, reflecting occupational health services from various angles. At the end there is a study guide/discussion material which is intended for students at higher education institutions, the occupational health service sector and companies/organisations for their own development work.</p>
<p>The book is divided into three sections with varying numbers of chapters. There are also a number of challenges to think about. The first section, The development of occupational health services and the current situation , has three chapters. One chapter describes the benefits and possibilities offered by functioning occupational health services. The next chapter provides a short history, a description of the situation today, an international outlook and a summary of the regulations affecting occupational health services. The third chapter looks at how the social partners view the task of occupational health services.</p>
<p>The second section is called Client relations and dialogue . The six chapters in this section provide theoretical and practical knowledge about how occupational health services can contribute to an improved economy, increased quality and better occupational health, and they also look at the importance of understanding a clientâ€™s requirements and expectations.</p>
<p>One chapter is about selling and buying occupational health services and provides practical examples. The section also contains a chapter about ethics in occupational health services and a chapter about how small companies use, or fail to use, occupational health services.</p>
<p>The third section is entitled Teamwork in theory and practice . It reflects the strength to be gained from inter-professional cooperation. The full range of skills is one of the crucial differences between occupational health services and other businesses offering various forms of services similar to occupational health services.</p>
<p>One chapter provides research aspects concerning efficient teamwork and the next chapter gives concrete everyday examples of how the professions can work together. Finally, the most common professional groups in the occupational health service sector are presented.</p>
