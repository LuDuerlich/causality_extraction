<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The main tasks for the Commission, specified in the terms of reference were:</p>
<p>to chart and analyse how people experience the care at the end of life and to propose, on basis of the Commission’s findings, measures to ensure all terminally ill or dying people a care of a good quality and adequate relief of pain and other symptoms</p>
<p>to describe ongoing research and developmental work as well as different models for collaboration between health care providers and to suggest solutions for the future palliative care</p>
<p>to highlight examples of excellent care and reveal shortcomings in the health care system and propose how to encounter these shortcomings and to consider how to enhance the individuals´ influence on their own care e.g. through living wills or advance directives</p>
<p>to propose how to ensure that health professionals be trained and supported in providing medical, nursing and psychological care according to the highest possible standards for any terminally ill or dying person in a coordinated teamwork.</p>
<p>In the terms of reference government stressed that the Commission was not to deal with euthanasia.</p>
<p>This report contains the Commission’s considerations and proposals referring to a mid way report (Döden angår oss alla – värdig vård vid livets slut SOU 2000:6).</p>
<p>The latter has been sent out for views to a great number of authorities, organizations and institutions during the spring of 2000.</p>
<p>The Commission has carried out its work in an open-minded way with many out-reaching activities.</p>
<p>This report provides among other things an account of the situation for dying people and their next of kin. There are many different models and organizations for palliative care in different</p>
<p>parts of the contry. Some of them are excellent but such care is not available to all people in need of it.</p>
<p>The Commission has not recommended a specified organizational model. Instead it has formulated an ethical basis and standards for the good quality care from the patient’s point of view. One important principal is to enhance patients´ influence and allow the patient to choose whether he/she want his/her care in an institution or at home. The care should be given with respect for the equal value of all people and dignity of the individual. The basis of palliative care is a multiprofessional team, consisting of – at a minimum - a physician and a nurse. But other professionals must be available for consultation when needed. The team must be available 24 hours a day even on very short notice. Important issues highlighted in this report are the need for collaboration between health care providers, education and supervision of staff and research.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that palliative care should be improved and available on equal terms for all people needing it. The care should be evaluated by The National Board of Health and Welfare within a five year period of time.</p>
