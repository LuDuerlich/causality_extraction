<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This final report is an account of the work carried out by the Air Defence Committee, which is the name adopted by the Committee. The Committee submitted an interim report in December 2013 that mainly analysed the task, methods and international development scenarios. This analysis provided an important starting point for the continued work.</p>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>Under its terms of reference, the Committee is to study, analyse and evaluate the entirety of and the needs within the Swedish air defence after 2040.</p>
<p>The Committee is to:  analyse future developments regarding technology, tactics, capability development, etc.;  evaluate future operational needs and capability requirements; and  propose objectives for air defence beyond 2040.</p>
<p>The study’s findings are intended to provide a basis for a long-term strategy concerning the capabilities Sweden will need in this area. In its work, the Committee is to assume an essentially unchanged level of financial ambition for air defence.</p>
<h2>Limitations and methods</h2>
<p>The study covers air power. This refers to air forces and antiaircraft systems included in air operations. This means that air defence intended for a unit’s own protection is not included in the examined air defence. Under the terms of reference, transport aircraft are not included in the study. The Committee has decided not to include helicopter units in the study since these systems are considered to make a limited contribution to air operations.</p>
<p>As the time under examination is far in the future, it is not reasonable to attempt a forecast of security policy developments and the consequent need of air power. However, the Committee has deemed it necessary to investigate alternative international developments that may place different demands on air power in order to assess the consequences of different choices.</p>
<p>The Committee has used capabilities-based planning to produce objectives for air power and air defence. In brief, this means planning under conditions of uncertainty and applying a modular building block approach. Our approach to capabilities-based planning means identifying the most important capability requirements that we foresee could be made of future Swedish air power and air defence. The resulting requirements for air power functions – air systems, airbases, air command and surveillance (command and control and sensors), and anti-aircraft systems, as well as interfaces with the rest of the Swedish Armed Forces and civil society – are listed. Various ‘capability-set options’ can then be identified. A capability-set option is an interesting combination of air power functions. These are initially somewhat abstract, but possible to evaluate overall.</p>
<p>Based on military strategy concepts and concepts of operations, we then create different structures of air defence units that fit within the financial framework. Such air defence structures describe air power in a way that makes it possible to estimate both the economic cost involved and how the structure can be expected to cope with any demands that may arise.</p>
<p>Finally, we present the results of this structural work, which in conjunction with other data are used to describe ‘objectives for air defence beyond 2040’.</p>
<h2>Special areas</h2>
<p>Based on work carried out, including analyses and evaluations of capability-set options and structures, the Committee has selected a number of special areas in which it wants to call attention to an idea and/or make assessments. There are 15 areas which the Committee considers essential for the future of Swedish air power and air defence.</p>
<p>These areas, in no specific order of priority, are:  Defence cooperation  Defence industry  Space capability  Cyber defence and offensive cyber capability  Defence against ballistic missiles and cruise missiles  Automation and humans in the air defence system  System of systems approach  Command and control  Anti-aircraft  Air platforms  Sensors  Airbases  Research and development  Personnel  Finances</p>
<h2>Objectives for air defence 2040</h2>
<p>During the structural work, the Committee found that under the conditions that it studied, an air defence structure able to reasonably fulfil the operational capability requirements that could arise within the framework of defence against an armed attack cannot be achieved at an unchanged level of financial ambition.</p>
<p>Such an air defence structure would substantially exceed an unchanged level of financial ambition.</p>
<p>The Committee considers that there should be a basic air defence capability of this type, regardless of the choice of military strategic direction and concept of operations as examined within the framework of this report, if an armed attack is to be countered in a reasonable way.</p>
<p>It is estimated that a smaller but, in the Committee’s opinion, well-balanced and economically feasible air defence structure could manage tasks falling within the demands of territorial integrity, albeit with certain limitations. These tasks would include detecting and repulsing aerial vehicles violating Swedish airspace. Such a structure should constitute a basis and objective of Swedish air power and air defence forces, so as to be open to increasing the defence capability in the longer term, if a decision is taken to do so. In this connection, one should be aware that such decisions can only gain full effect after 10–15 years. Such a structure allows flexibility for various forms of cooperation by Sweden’s military defence.</p>
<p>Even given this smaller structure, Swedish air power and air defence forces are deemed capable of contributing to international crisis management operations through appropriate units that can participate in tasks where they can contribute to the overall effect sought.</p>
<p>War games and analysis have shown that the Swedish Armed Forces, including Swedish air power, depend on society remaining robust and functional, even in crisis and war. Air power and air defence forces do not function in isolation from society at large, whether in peace, crisis or war.</p>
<p>As there is uncertainty about the financial framework 2040, the Committee considers it valuable to describe to its principals the path that current Swedish air power should pursue to achieve what the Committee considers a well-balanced structure. Operational and financial considerations relating to the tasks and resources of the Swedish Armed Forces should be expected at regular intervals all the way to 2040, the date for the analysis.</p>
<p>The Committee has studied a number of areas in air defence that interact in a complicated manner. For reasons of clarity the Committee has chosen to give special attention to a number of proposals taken from the areas in Chapter 9 Considerations. The proposals will make it easier to gradually improve Swedish air power and air defence capability.</p>
<h2>Priorities</h2>
<p>The proposals are presented on two priority levels. Priority 1 is for measures that, in the Committee's assessment, should be given top priority, the financial position permitting.</p>
<p>Priority 1</p>
<p>Early warning</p>
<p>Early warning is of great importance for the air defence of society, the Swedish Armed Forces and Swedish air defence forces themselves. It increases the ability of the Swedish Armed Forces to provide protection and step into action. Air defence plays an important role together with the other parts of the Swedish Armed Forces.</p>
<p>Situational awareness is vital for the future air defence system to achieve full effect. Several of the aerial vehicles now under development have been designed in a way that makes great demands on future sensor systems intended to detect them. The Committee therefore considers that the challenge in the future is likely to lie in the increasing complexity of creating a complete air situation picture as stealth technology becomes more advanced.</p>
<p>Defence of airbases tailored to threats</p>
<p>As history has repeatedly shown, air platforms are at their most vulnerable when on the ground. Aircraft have to take off and land at known airbases/airports. The threat posed by long-range precision weapons increases this vulnerability. Airbases must therefore be given stronger protection against both airborne and ground-based threats.</p>
<p>A capability to strike airborne targets at a greater distance than today</p>
<p>Anti-aircraft systems can provide persistent, flexible, protection against airborne threats at varying distances. The need for protection against airborne threats applies not only to Swedish air defence forces, but also to the Swedish Armed Forces in general and society as a whole. Anti-aircraft systems need to secure a capability to combat airborne targets at considerably greater distance than at present.</p>
<p>An operationally relevant combat aircraft</p>
<p>The tactical and operational value of a combat aircraft is a consequence of security policy choices, strategic and operational concepts and, not least, technical and systemic conditions. It is therefore important to continuously monitor developments in these areas and to continuously evaluate the continued operational relevance of existing combat aircraft.</p>
<p>Defence against cyber threats</p>
<p>Already now, cyberspace has obvious significance as an arena for affecting an adversary and its importance will grow as society becomes more dependent on computers and communications between computers and people acting as users in one way or another. Knowledge and capability in this area is important to be able to meet tough requirements.</p>
<p>Priority 2</p>
<p>Balance between aircraft and weapons</p>
<p>The need for long-range weapons systems, for example air-to-air missiles, increases drastically in a war situation. There must be a balance between the number of weapons and the number of combat aircraft, based on the operational direction.</p>
<p>The need for protection against conventional ballistic missiles and cruise missiles applies not only to Swedish air defence forces, but also to the Swedish Armed Forces in general and society as a whole. Already now – and all the more so in 2040 – conventional ballistic missiles and cruise missiles pose so serious a threat that this threat demands attention. Sweden will need to work with other states to create reasonable protection against this threat. Active protection against conventional ballistic missiles can only be achieved through cooperation with other nations, for financial reasons as well as to be able to detect and combat incoming missiles.</p>
<p>A secure and robust command and control system</p>
<p>Robust command and control systems are an important foundation for the overall functioning of air defence. Securing a robust and well-balanced common command and control system for the Swedish Armed Forces is not merely of concern for the air defence system but ultimately a significant component of the entire defence system and civil society.</p>
<p>Access to qualified personnel and a robust human resources system</p>
<p>Access to qualified personnel will be highly important in order to ensure that units in the future air defence achieve the maximum possible effectiveness. Issues of recruitment, education and training/exercises for future employees in the air defence are vital here. As a personnel structure must also be able to resist antagonistic and non-antagonistic strains and stress, such a structure should have sufficient redundancy.</p>
<p>Short-range anti-aircraft system for use against small targets</p>
<p>The threat posed to objects such as camps and airbases by rockets, artillery shells, missiles and small remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) is expected to grow, which will increase the need for sensors and units designed to detect and combat these types of small targets.</p>
<p>Passive sensors as a complement to active sensors</p>
<p>In the longer term, passive sensors will be an important complement to active sensors, with which they should be integrated more extensively than at present.</p>
<h2>A secure and sufficient commitment to R&D</h2>
<p>Finally, the Committee would like to underscore the need for R&D and study activities in relevant areas.</p>
<p>To be a competent procurer of advanced defence systems and to have high international competence in certain niches, so as to be an interesting partner for cooperation, more resources must be allocated to R&D than is now the case. In particular, measures are important in areas that are vital for reasons of integrity. These are areas in which it can be difficult to obtain access to results of international research and technology that are classified or subject to other limitations imposed by international agreements.</p>
<p>Increased measures to develop demonstrators can strengthen the development of defence materiel in Swedish air defence, as well as in the Swedish Armed Forces as a whole.</p>
