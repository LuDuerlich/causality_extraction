<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In June 1998 the Commission presented an interim report (SOU 1998:86) on development cooperation in the judicial sector in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>In this final report the Commission has, in accordance with its terms of reference, completed its task by dealing with development cooperation in the judicial sector in other parts of the world. This report also deals with the general question of how to build up the necessary capacity among the staff who are engaged in development cooperation.</p>
<h2>Development cooperation in the southern hemisphere</h2>
<p>In its communications  Democracy and Human Rights in Sweden’s International Development Cooperation (Comm. 1997/98:76) and  Human Rights in Sweden’s Foreign Policy (Comm. 1997/98:89) the Government set forth a new, deeper approach to these issues. The communications were debated in Parliament in the spring of 1998 and were filed.</p>
<p>According to these communications, democracy and human rights must be a more central, conspicuous and consistent element of Sweden’s development cooperation. The promotion of democracy and human rights must lie at the heart of this cooperation so that, basically, all Sweden’s measures, regardless of their content, are assessed in the light of whether or not they help to strengthen democracy and promote respect for human rights in our cooperation partners.</p>
<p>In future we should allocate more resources to developing our cooperation with our partners’ central government bodies. The Government also singles out the judicial system as a priority area for development cooperation. It states that a systematic analysis needs to be made of the experience that has been gained so far. This analysis should be used as a point of departure for development of a future strategy in this area. Furthermore, the Government considers it necessary to develop methodologies for development cooperation in the judicial sector.</p>
<p>The annual development cooperation budget administered by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) totals about SEK 7 billion. During the 1990s, about SEK 600 million per year has been allocated to programmes directly related to the promotion of democracy and human rights, and these programmes are expanding steadily. The judicial sector accounts for a rather small proportion, probably about ten percent on average during this decade, of this allocation.</p>
<p>Relatively few Swedish organizations have been involved so far: the Raoul Wallenberg Institute, the Swedish Institute for Legal Development (SILD), the National Police Board and Umeå University. In 1997 they accounted for 80% of all Sweden’s operations in this field, the remainder being channelled through international organizations.</p>
<p>Geographically, Sweden concentrates on about ten countries in Central America, Southern Africa and Southeast Asia. Our cooperation with South Africa is the most extensive and accounts for about onethird of the total. China, Nicaragua, Vietnam and the West Bank/Gaza are other major cooperation partners.</p>
<p>The Commission has chozen a rather strict definition of the judicial sector. It has concentrated on programmes in the public sector whose main purpose was to strengthen the rule of law. This includes support for the legislative processes and national institutions in the partners’ judicial systems, i.e. the ministries of justice and the interior, the judiciary, the public prosecution and police authorities, the correctional services, the ombudsman institutions, law studies and similar core institutions.</p>
<p>In order to increase the effectiveness of Sweden’s development cooperation it is necessary, in the Commission’s view, to develop our strategic analysis of ways of delivering assistance in the judicial sector. The Commission proposes that, as a step towards developing such a strategy, Sida should initiate a dialogue with the organizations involved in Sweden’s development cooperation in the judicial sector. In order to provide an appropriate starting-point for this dialogue, Sida should in cooperation with the organizations involved commission a report on international and Swedish experience to date and suggest possible policy and strategic conclusions.</p>
<p>The Government’s new focus on democracy and human rights in development cooperation must be implemented in practice. The Commission therefore proposes that Sweden should take further initiatives with a view to establishing a dialogue focusing on the judicial sector with interested programme countries. In the Commission’s view, the most feasible course would be to initiate a dialogue, in particular, on deeper and wider cooperation in the countries with which Sweden has already established judicial cooperation.</p>
<p>The Commission sees no need to change the development cooperation organization in the judicial sector. But there is a need to change the working arrangements in this area. All the parties involved must realize how dependent they are on one other’s competence.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that Sida, as the responsible agency, set up an advisory commission consisting of five or six experts to conduct a structured discussion on ways and means of further developing and implementing Sweden’s contribution.</p>
<p>To improve and broaden Sweden’s activities in order to strengthen the judicial functions of our partners, the agencies involved must enhance their skills also with regard to analysis, planning and evaluation. The Commission also considers it desirable to use more of the resources allocated to individual projects for analyses, quality assurance, planning and evaluation.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that Sida and the judicial authorities agree on more appropriate arrangements for organizing their collaboration, for example as regards controls, accounting, reporting and auditing, as well as cost reimbursement arrangements. This applies both to cooperation with Central and Eastern Europe and with developing countries in the southern hemisphere.</p>
<h2>Expanded operations call for a larger resource base</h2>
<p>As a result of the increased emphasis on judicial matters proposed by the Government in Sweden’s development cooperation with Central and Eastern Europe and developing countries in the southern hemisphere, the volume of activity will increase substantially in the coming years. This will make it necessary to develop and expand Sweden’s resource base.</p>
<p>The Commission estimates that a total of 250-300 Swedes working in the judicial sector have been involved in bilateral development cooperation in recent years. The Commission proposes to increase this resource base by about 200 staff within the next year or two.</p>
<p>The Commission estimates that, provided that they have sufficient scope for planning and preparation and receive full cost reimbursement, the judicial authorities should be able to double their input.</p>
<p>On the basis of the experience of development cooperation in the judicial and other sectors, the Commission has, in the light of the demands made by the Government’s new focus on democracy and human rights in development cooperation, prepared a requirement profile for the staff who will be engaged in development cooperation in the judicial sector. It will be necessary to take a number of measures.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that Sida and the judicial authorities implement a programme of training for project managers and field personnel. Training should be provided for personnel in all judicial sectors, since integration is an essential aspect. If there is sufficient interest, training should also be made available for personnel in other sectors. There is also a need of broader exchanges of experience. Sida should therefore arrange a one-day seminar at least once a year for all the Swedish interested parties in the judicial sector.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that suitable personnel are recruited for the development projects, selection methods should be developed in cooperation between the judicial authorities and Sida.</p>
<p>In order to broaden the resource base at a faster pace, the Commission proposes:</p>
<p>• that the judicial system establish trainee arrangements to give personnel the opportunity of development cooperation experience</p>
<p>• that the teams in the field represent a broad range of competence so as to promote the transfer of knowledge and skills; gender equality should be one criterion when the teams are selected</p>
<p>• that Sida should sponsor a number of Junior Professional Officers (JPOs) in the judicial sector. The judicial authorities should, in cooperation with Sida, investigate the potential recruitment base.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the release of qualified personnel for development cooperation duties, the authorities concerned must make every effort to eliminate obstacles in their own organizations. Personnel who serve abroad will contribute international experience that will be valuable to the authorities in many ways. It is therefore essential that the authorities make it clear that foreign service is a useful qualification that enhances the individual’s career prospects.</p>
<h2>Cost estimates</h2>
<p>The cost of expanding Sweden’s contribution in the judicial sector has, in the Commission’s opinion, already been allowed for in the allocation of funds for bilateral development cooperation.</p>
<p>The Commission presents several proposals concerning training and capacity building in order to implement the expansion proposed by the Government. It estimates the total cost of these measures at SEK 6-8 million in the next two years. The most reasonable course would be to defray these costs via the appropriation for bilateral cooperation in the development cooperation budget.</p>
