<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The remit of the Inquiry was to review the Act on training for peace support operations (1994:588) with the aim of adapting the</p>
<p>Act to the needs resulting from changes in Sweden’s security and defence policy.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Under Chapter 15, Article 16 of the Instrument of Government, the Riksdag’s consent is needed to send Swedish armed forces to other countries unless fulfilling an international obligation that has been approved by the Riksdag or permitted by an act of law setting out the conditions for such action.</p>
<p>With regard to military training, the Riksdag has delegated decision-making power to the Government in the Act on training for peace support operations, allowing it to send an armed force abroad to participate in training for peace support operations in the framework of international cooperation.</p>
<p>The Act originated primarily because of the Partnership for</p>
<p>Peace (PfP) and the Government’s view that, in order for Sweden to be able to contribute to peacekeeping activities, it was essential for Swedish troops to participate in exercises and other training together with other PfP countries. No legislation had existed previously concerning sending troops to other countries for exercises. The change in the nature of international operations to that of peace enforcement in many cases has led to the term peacekeeping operations, previously used in the Act, being replaced by peace support operations.</p>
<p>Changes in Swedish security and defence policy in the 2000s resulted in seeking cooperation with other countries, including the capability to give and receive military support. This new operational organisation has the additional aim of being able to use any available and appropriate units – individually and together with others – at short notice to defend Sweden and Swedish interests in the country, in our region and globally. Because of this and other factors, there is cause to consider whether the Government’s authority under the Act should continue to be limited to training and exercises for peace support operations or whether its authority should be expanded.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s deliberations</h2>
<p>In short, the Inquiry proposes that the authority of the Government to send troops to other countries for training and exercises should not be limited to peace support operations alone. In the Inquiry’s view, its authority should include all types of training and exercises.</p>
<h2>Requirement to obtain Riksdag approval in the Instrument of Government</h2>
<p>It is evident from our review that this requirement in the Instrument of Government’s current Chapter 15, Article 16 for sending troops to other countries was never intended for training and exercises. The wording of the provision, however, appears to have resulted in it being considered necessary to use legislation to authorise the Government to make such decisions.</p>
<h2>‘Peace support activities’ is a multifaceted concept</h2>
<p>The concept of peace support  can include both peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations. Our review of government decisions preceding various types of military exercises in other countries indicates that they all were considered to fall within the classification of peace support. This included everything from exercises conducted at low levels of conflict, such as peacetime mine clearance, to exercises at high levels of conflict aimed at conducting army, air force and navy combat exercises together with NATO units and others. Clearly, many types of exercises can be classified under the concept of peace support if the exercise scenario is linked to a peace support operation of some kind. Many exercises have been justified by the fact that the aim was to practice interoperability in NATO’s structure, which experience shows is a desirable capability in a robust international military operation such as the one in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s view, any rule aimed at stipulating the Government’s authority should not be linked to a concept as imprecise as peace support.</p>
<h2>New need to conduct exercises together with others</h2>
<p>A change in Swedish security policy took place in the early 2000s, culminating in the declaration of solidarity that was approved by the Riksdag in 2009. The declaration means that Sweden will not remain passive if an EU country or Nordic country suffers a disaster or an attack, and that Sweden expects these countries to act in the same way in relation to Sweden.</p>
<p>The Defence Commission’s reports from 2007, 2013 and 2014 also emphasise the importance of international cooperation in gaining experience to defend our nation’s territory in a changed security policy situation. The 2014 report stresses the importance of continued cooperation with both the Nordic countries and NATO, without any limitations other than that cooperation must not entail any mutual defence obligations.</p>
<h2>New exercises will include more than just peace support activities</h2>
<p>Although many exercises can be classified under the concept of peace support, this is not the case for exercises involving larger joint force operations against a sophisticated opponent. According to the report on Sweden’s international defence cooperation (Fö the opportunity to participate in NATO’s most advanced and complex exercises. As a rule, these concern operations under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty and do not come under the concept of peace support. Nor do international exercises in another Nordic country, which the home guard wants to develop, appear to come under the concept, and consequently require that consent is obtained from the Riksdag under the current rules.</p>
<h2>Government’s decision-making authority should be expanded</h2>
<p>Legislation should be adapted if this new type of exercise – highlighted as important, for example, by the Defence Commission in its 2014 report – is to become a reality. Otherwise the Government, likely in a substantial number of cases, will have to obtain the consent of the Riksdag to enable the Swedish Armed Forces to participate in exercises, the necessity of which is underpinned by a high degree of political consensus. The Government’s decisionmaking authority should accordingly be expanded. This will require a legislative amendment.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry proposes that the Government be authorised to make decisions concerning Swedish participation in all types of exercises</h2>
<p>The question is how the Act should be amended. The current Act limits the Government’s authority to certain activities . As previously indicated, it is difficult to make such a limitation sufficiently clear. It is also questionable whether such a limitation is needed.</p>
<p>It is evident from the Inquiry’s comparison with other countries that decision-making power in matters of this type usually rest with governments, and is delegated in many cases to the country’s armed forces.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is questionable whether it would be a good solution to limit the right to send Swedish troops for training purposes to certain countries.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Inquiry proposes that the Government be authorised without any limitations to send an armed force abroad to participate in training in the framework of international cooperation.</p>
