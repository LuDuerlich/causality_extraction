<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Commission was instructed by the Government to ensure concerted action to combat antiziganism and bridge the trust gap between Roma people and the rest of society. Antiziganism refers to the particular type of racism targeted at Roma.</p>
<p>The composition of the Commission has been unique, where the majority of the members were Roma. This had an impact on the conditions for conducting activities based on Roma participation and co-determination. In addition, the Commission’s activities were guided by what emerged in the consultations and dialogues carried out with a large number of Roma.</p>
<p>The remit included persuading responsible actors to take a more active position against the discrimination and everyday racism that Roma face in Swedish society, based on knowledge about antiziganism and its impact on living conditions of many Roma. The Commission was also tasked with following developments and compiling reviews and measures undertaken by various actors regarding the issue of registration of Roma on ethnic grounds. The report Registration of Roma on ethnic grounds , annex 5, describes how the Commission carried out its assignment.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission was tasked by the Government with producing and distributing material based on the White Paper that describes abuses and violations suffered by Roma during the 20th century, The dark and unknown history – White Paper on abuses and rights violations against Roma in the 20th century  (Ds 2014:8). The Commission has carried out this part of the remit by producing and distributing the textbook Antiziganism i Sverige – om övergrepp och kränkningar av romer under  1900-talet  och i dag  (Antizigansim in Sweden – about the abuses and violations of Roma during the 1900s and today) and an associated teacher’s guide.</p>
<p>An important aspect of the work has involved highlighting what the concept of antiziganism refers to and its significance for human rights of Roma. To this end, the Commission has produced a publication, published reports, reacted to events that appeared to stem from antiziganism, published chronicles on the Commission’s website, and written opinion pieces. The overall aim of these activities has been to confront the antiziganist obstacles that Roma face. The activities were motivated based on the Commission’s observation that antiziganism is considered to be legitimate among many people in Swedish society. To break this pattern, it has been necessary to actively take a position in favour of Roma human rights.</p>
<p>In its report, the Commission makes several recommendations to the Government. The recommendations are based on the Commission’s overall conclusion that to a great extent, governance and continuity are lacking in policies and in initiatives by other actors. To combat antiziganism in earnest, a number of measures need to be taken. The Government must, more clearly than today, use its power and available means to put a stop to violations of Roma human rights. To succeed in these efforts, the Government must ensure that future efforts are marked by genuine Roma participation and influence.</p>
<h2>Recognition must be filled with content</h2>
<p>The human rights situation of Roma is serious. Antiziganism affects opportunities for many Roma to be part of existing structures, and discrimination affects access for Roma to housing, education, the labour market, social services and health and medical care. The situation highlights that measures taken have not been sufficient to come to grips with the discrimination and violations that Roma continue to face. This is particularly reflected in the fact that Roma reports of hate crimes and discrimination are allowed to pass unnoticed, and that strikingly often there is a lack of understanding of the gravity of the widespread abuse that Roma face.</p>
<p>There is a continuity to antiziganism, as made clear in how the Skåne police register was handled, and in the public debate on vulnerable EU citizens. The Commission nevertheless notes that there have been developments that point to greater insight today and recognition of the effects of antiziganism on Roma access to human rights. However, this recognition must be reflected in measures that help put a stop to the abuse.</p>
<p>It is important that measures are taken to emphasise that the majority society clearly condemns and takes responsibility for the antiziganism to which Roma have been subjected. For repudiation to help lay a foundation for the future, it must also be accompanied by pledges for measures to stop abuse from recurring. It is against this background that the Commission proposes that the Prime Minister should convey an official apology for the historical abuse which Roma have suffered. The apology can only be credible if it is conveyed as part of forward-looking efforts to prevent abuse of the Roma human rights.</p>
<p>One way to prevent abuse from recurring is through initiatives that help highlight Sweden’s antiziganist history and Roma history, and Roma presence in other respects as well. For this reason, the Commission proposes that the Government ensure access to and distribution of the textbook and the White Paper, and examine the possibility of establishing memorials and commemorative days in suitable form. For instance, 2 August should be celebrated as the Roma Holocaust Memorial Day.</p>
<p>There are many place names that have an undertone of antiziganism. The Commission proposes that the Government initiate an investigation tasked with considering a future position with regard to the view on such names and designations.</p>
<p>The mass registration of Roma by Skåne police has had a serious impact on Roma confidence in their opportunities to assert their human rights, and has widened the confidence gap between Roma and the majority society. The Government should ensure that questions among Roma that remain about this registration receive satisfactory answers. Legal protection against registration on ethnic grounds should also be examined to prevent it from happening again.</p>
<p>Legal proceedings are an effective method to combat antiziganism and are normative for attitudes. Against this background, the Government should take measures to promote that the Equality Ombudsman to a greater extent investigates reported cases of discrimination and that these are examined by a court to a greater extent than today. The Government should also work towards more hate crime reports to the Swedish Police being investigated and prosecuted. In addition, these authorities should strengthen their promotion activities and be a stronger actor against abuse.</p>
<p>Considering the importance of legal proceedings, Protocol No 12 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights should be ratified. The Commission also takes a positive view of the Government’s announcement to establish a national independent body for human rights, and emphasises the importance of starting this work promptly.</p>
<p>Roma experience of discrimination and lack of access to rights in Sweden cannot be seen in isolation from events in other parts of Europe. To more efficiently combat antiziganism in Europe, the Commission considers that the Government should work towards the appointment of a Special Representative in the EU with resources and authority to coordinate and intensify the EU’s activities to promote Roma human rights.</p>
<h2>Control of measures to combat antiziganism</h2>
<p>The Commission wants to emphasise how important it is that the Government considers actions that support a clear approach in the work to combat antiziganism.</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that the Government, in its governance of government administrative authorities, emphasises measures to combat antiziganism. Through clear governance of authorities that convey what the Government wants to achieve in its work to combat antiziganism and with continuous monitoring, there are good prospects of also obtaining data for evaluating the measures. Such an approach can be expected to better help authorities conduct and report back activities aimed at combatting antiziganism.</p>
<p>Roma civil society conditions has been a recurring issue in the Commission’s dialogues with Roma. The opinions expressed concerned opportunities for Roma civil society to act on its own terms, and the size and distribution of organisation grants. The Commission’s examination of how financial support has been distributed shows that there is reason to take measures with the objective of increasing State aid to Roma organisations. In addition, authorities providing grants should be tasked with reviewing work procedures that can increase distribution of operational support to Roma organisations.</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that, in its continued responsibility to implement the strategy for Roma inclusion, the Government consider how authorities tasked under the strategy can receive more support. Several authorities tasked under the strategy would like to see a forum for continuous exchange of past experience. The Stockholm County Administrative Board has had a coordinating function and may have experiences which the Government should make use of when considering a suitable actor to act as a support for and coordinate work by authorities to combat antiziganism.</p>
<p>Public service companies’ annual reports show that the Government’s ambition to considerably increase the range of programmes broadcast in Romani Chib has not been realised. In spite of the fact that the situation has been noted by the Swedish Broadcasting Commission, no noticeable change has taken place. In its report, the Commission recommends that the Government closely follow the length of transmission time in Romani Chib at the Swedish Television, Swedish Radio and the Swedish Educational Broadcasting Company public service companies, with the aim of carrying out a possible revision of broadcasting licences on the next occasion.</p>
<p>The Government has announced a review of the minorities policy. The Commission welcomes the initiative and considers it important that such a review include issues regarding supervision and sanctions. In addition, the Commission considers that the review should include re-evaluating the realisation of minority rights outside the administrative areas and how consultation and dialogue can be strengthened.</p>
<p>The Stockholm County Administrative Board has recently been tasked with developing collaboration and coordinating work with regard to citizens in the EU/EEA temporarily residing in Sweden. The Commission stresses the importance of implementing this assignment based on a rights perspective. The background to this is the Commission’s observation on how the public debate on the group’s rights is being conducted, in which demands are being made to prohibit begging, for ”zero tolerance” and for quick, efficient evictions.</p>
<h2>Centre for Roma issues</h2>
<p>In its report, the Commission recommends that the Government launch work to establish a national centre for Roma issues. The centre should work to promote knowledge development about antiziganism and its effects, and following up, monitoring and evaluating actions taken by actors who have a role in combatting antiziganism, and proposing suitable measures. Further, the centre should work towards the implementation of activities aimed at strengthening Roma culture and language. The centre should also be tasked with providing advice and support to Roma as to who they can contact to assert their rights. The centre should not have any supervisory assignment.</p>
<p>The centre should be designed as a government board, in which Roma are well-represented.</p>
<p>The report provides background material for the Government’s future work in considering this issue in close dialogue and collaboration with Roma representatives.</p>
