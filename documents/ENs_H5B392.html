<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In this official report, the Inquiry concerning a Stronger Status and Improved Living Conditions for Trans People provides an account of the results of our survey of trans people’s living conditions. We also propose measures in several areas with the aim of strengthening the status of trans people.</p>
<h2>Context of the inquiry</h2>
<p>In these sections, the inquiry describes some of the policy areas that our proposals touch on. Beginning with the work undertaken to promote human rights at the global and European level, we then move on to general human rights efforts in Sweden, action to promote the rights of LGBTQI people, efforts to combat discrimination and to promote gender equality and public health.</p>
<p>We describe the design of  A Strategy for Equal Rights and Opportunities Regardless of Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity or Gender Expression , the evaluation of this and some good examples of strategies from other countries. We also conduct a brief analysis of gender equality efforts from a trans perspective and provide an account, from a trans perspective, of some of the latest initiatives to tackle discrimination and promote gender equality. These chapters, as well as the chapter on living conditions, provide the background to the proposals under the following heading.</p>
<h2>Trans people’s living conditions</h2>
<p>According to its terms of reference, the inquiry is to investigate how trans people are affected by society’s cis and hetero norms, identify the barriers in society to trans people’s opportunities to live according to their gender identity and, where necessary, propose interventions to remedy any shortcomings.</p>
<p>Among the inquiry’s conclusions is that efforts to improve trans people’s living conditions must be reinforced at a structural level, with the responsibilities and tasks of public authorities being set out clearly.</p>
<h2>The inquiry’s survey of trans people’s living conditions</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s results indicate that a relatively high proportion of trans people cannot live in accordance with their gender identity and that this has a detrimental impact on their health. Trans people are more likely than the population as a whole to rate their own health as poor.</p>
<p>There is also a clear difference within the group, trans people, where non-binary people to a greater extent rate their health as poor, as is the case with those who state that they cannot live in accordance with their gender identity. Young trans people rate their quality of life as poorer than young cis people. Suicidal thoughts and attempted suicide are more common among trans people than among the population as a whole. A majority of young trans people state that they have had suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>Not having the support of those closest to you is thought to lead to poorer health, with the results of several studies suggesting that trans people as a group have less support from those around them than the population as a whole.</p>
<p>It is more common for trans people to experience harassment, degrading treatment and discrimination than the general population. Many trans people also feel they are made invisible in society, for example, through the use of gendered language, the format of Swedish personal identity numbers and because it is not possible to have a legally recognised identity other than as a woman or a man.</p>
<p>Many trans people have experienced vulnerability and insecurity in various public spaces, for example, in restaurants, while travelling, or when accessing public toilets.</p>
<p>Trans people are more likely than the general population to experience physical violence. In close relationships, there is a specific form of violence that affects trans people, specifically focusing on gender identity and gender expression. Trans people are also affected by hate crimes and honour-related crimes.</p>
<p>One clear challenge is that the crime statistics are incomplete, partly, because many victims do not file police reports due to a lack of trust or confidence that doing so will make a difference.</p>
<p>Younger trans people state that they want more information about sexual health, for example, what impact hormone treatments can have on sexual health and sexuality. Regarding reproductive health and rights, there is also a lack of knowledge available concerning factors such as the need for support.</p>
<p>The incidence of HIV among trans people in Sweden is not known because the statistics do not reveal gender identity or gender expression as a variable. There is a demand for trans-specific information about safe sex.</p>
<p>On the basis of this information, the inquiry proposes the following:</p>
<h2>Improving the coordination and structure of work to promote the rights of LGBTQI people</h2>
<p>• The Government develops an action plan for the equal rights and opportunities of LGBTQI people. This work should involve additional public authorities being appointed as strategic authorities and one assigned permanent responsibility for coordination.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Migration Agency, the Swedish Police Authority, the National Agency for Education, the Ombudsman for Children in Sweden, and the forthcoming Swedish Gender Equality Agency are appointed as new strategic authorities in addition to the existing five.</p>
<p>• The new Gender Equality Agency is given responsibility for coordination and an supportive mandate.</p>
<h2>An inquiry into the feasibility of a third legal gender</h2>
<p>• The Government establishes an inquiry to investigate the feasibility of introducing a third legal gender in Sweden, as well as  gender-neutral personal identity numbers.</p>
<h2>Improved knowledge about LGBTQI people’s living conditions</h2>
<p>• Changes should be made to the qualification criteria in the Swedish Higher Education Ordinance for relevant study programmes to ensure that these include knowledge of the living conditions of LGBTQ people and people with intersex variations.</p>
<h2>Improved opportunities to travel</h2>
<p>• The Gender Equality Agency is tasked with investigating difficulties experienced by trans people when travelling.</p>
<p>• The Police Authority is tasked with investigating the possibility to introduce the option X as a gender signifier on Swedish passport documents.</p>
<h2>More accessible toilets and changing rooms</h2>
<p>• The Government establishes state funding to support development projects for  trans-inclusive environments.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Equality Ombudsman, in collaboration with the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning, is tasked with developing guidelines on designing  trans-inclusive changing rooms and toilets.</p>
<p>• All public agencies should provide  gender-neutral signage on individual toilets.</p>
<h2>Stronger support for victims of crime</h2>
<p>• The Police Authority is tasked with implementing an internal skills development programme with an LGBTQI perspective and a distinct trans perspective regarding hate crimes,  honour-related crimes and violence in close relationships.</p>
<p>• The Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention is tasked with including trans people in the Swedish Crime Survey.</p>
<p>• A  long-term grant for support activities provided by civil society to LGBTQI victims of crime is to be secured.</p>
<h2>Strengthened and improved efforts to promote sexual and reproductive health</h2>
<p>• The Public Health Agency of Sweden is tasked with reviewing the HIV transmission statistics to see how best to include trans people.</p>
<p>• The Government develops a national SRHR strategy that integrates a specific LGBTQI perspective.</p>
<h2>More perspectives on the living conditions of trans people</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s terms of reference state that we must apply an intersectional perspective to the task and explore how other grounds of discrimination such as ethnicity, disability or age intersect with issues pertaining to gender identity and gender expression. The inquiry must also have a life cycle perspective and highlight the barriers that impact the life of a trans person, as well as present the differences among trans people with diverse gender identities. In this section, we have specifically highlighted the situation for trans people at different stages of the life cycle in addition to, among others, the experiences of trans people who are being racialised and trans people with disabilities. The inquiry proposes the following:</p>
<h2>Strengthened trans and intersex perspective in efforts to promote children’s rights</h2>
<p>• The Ombudsman for Children in Sweden is tasked with talking to children and adolescents about issues pertaining to gender identity and to intersex variations, using its Young Speakers method as a basis. The aim of this is to improve society’s knowledge of how children’s rights according to the Convention on the Rights of the Child are fulfilled for young trans people and children and adolescents with intersex variations.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Schools Inspectorate is tasked with investigating the situation trans people face as pupils in compulsory and upper secondary schools.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman for Children has reported to the inquiry that there has been an increase in the number of children with trans experience contacting the office. It has been proposed that the Convention on the Rights of the Child becomes Swedish law and, according to the inquiry, there is a need to include a trans and intersex perspective in the work to ensure that the intentions of the convention are adhered to.</p>
<p>Many of the submissions received by the inquiry from younger trans people concern school. Of central importance is that everyone has an equal right to education and to be able to exercise this right without being subjected to harassment or discrimination.</p>
<h2>Strengthened LGBTQI perspective in efforts to improve the living conditions of older people</h2>
<p>• The Public Health Agency is tasked with developing new knowledge about the living conditions and specific needs of older trans people and investigate what initiatives are required to improve the psychological  well-being of older trans people.</p>
<p>• The National Board of Health and Welfare is tasked with developing recommendations concerning how municipalities can include an LGBTQI perspective, and a distinct trans perspective, in the plans and governance documents that pertain to elder care.</p>
<p>• The National Board of Health and Welfare is tasked with producing guidelines that set out how organisations within the field of elder care can work with issues related to gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, and sexuality.</p>
<p>Knowledge about older trans people is limited. More is known about the situation of older lesbian, gay and bisexual people, and of young trans people. In the Public Health Agency’s study, the older respondents were more likely to lack emotional support than their younger counterparts.</p>
<p>Within the field of elder care, there is a lack of knowledge and measures to ensure that the needs of older trans people are met.</p>
<h2>Strengthened support to LGBTQI families</h2>
<p>• The National Board of Health and Welfare is tasked with investigating support material needs for families where one or more of the parents are trans people and in families with trans children.</p>
<p>• The Government establishes an inquiry tasked with reviewing the Children and Parents Code to make it gender neutral.</p>
<p>There is a lack of knowledge about trans people and parenthood. In a survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, 58 per cent of the trans respondents stated that they were parents.</p>
<p>Trans people who are parents are in need of trans-qualified caregivers within, for example, prenatal care and at child health centres.</p>
<p>The lack of gender neutrality in the Children and Parents Code results in administrative problems when registering trans people as parents in the national population register. The proposals put forward by previous inquiries do not, according to the inquiry, address this problem in a satisfactory manner. According to this inquiry, there is a need to review the Children and Parents Code. Alternatively, an inquiry should be established with the limited task of suggesting necessary amendments from a trans and intersex perspective.</p>
<h2>Improved work for LGBTQI asylum-seeking people</h2>
<p>• The Migration Agency is tasked with improving the possibilities of continually evaluating the quality of the review of LGBTQI people’s asylum applications. These evaluations are to have a normcritical perspective so that any stereotypical assumptions that may shape decisions are highlighted.</p>
<p>• The Migration Agency is tasked with changing the format of the asylum seeker card so that it does not create barriers for trans people.</p>
<p>• The Migration Agency is tasked with registering  asylum-seeking people’s gender on the basis of self-identification.</p>
<p>• The Migration Agency is tasked with ensuring there is safe accommodation for LGBTQI  asylum-seeking people.</p>
<p>Asylum-seeking trans people with whom the inquiry has been in contact state they do not have safe accommodation. It is problematic that the asylum seeker card used to identify them does not reflect their gender identity and/or gender expression and that the Migration Agency’s officers’ trans expertise varies.</p>
<p>Legal counsel and welfare officers with whom the inquiry has been in contact paint a similar picture that includes decisions based on a stereotypical and arbitrary basis and vulnerability in the Migration Agency’s residential facilities.</p>
<p>The Migration Agency has itself evaluated the quality of its decisions pertaining to applications on ‘LGBTQ grounds’ and concludes that there is room for improvement.</p>
<h2>Trans people’s mental health</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s terms of reference state that it is to identify, in consultation with the national coordinator for development and coordination of interventions within the field of mental health (S 2015:09), how interventions that aim to improve mental health and reduce stress among trans people can be incorporated into the work being carried out by public authorities, municipalities, county councils and organisations within the field of mental health. The inquiry is also to propose how targeted interventions to prevent suicide and attempted suicide among trans people can be accommodated in the Public Health Agency’s task of coordinating suicide prevention and propose how current alcohol, drug and tobacco prevention can ensure that the increased risk existing among trans people is taken into account. In addition, the inquiry has a general mandate to investigate trans people’s living conditions, which has been addressed in this chapter with a focus on mental health. The inquiry proposes the following:</p>
<h2>The Public Health Agency’s work given a more distinct trans and intersex perspective</h2>
<p>• The Public Health Agency is tasked with conducting educational interventions aimed at people with strategic responsibility for public health efforts.</p>
<p>• The Public Health Agency is tasked with focusing on trans people’s vulnerability and specific needs as part of its work on suicide prevention. This is to be achieved through means such as increasing, and making permanent, the recently established grant to support civil society organisations in this area.</p>
<p>• The Public Health Agency is tasked with mapping the incidence of eating disorders among trans people in Sweden and drawing up proposals for possible actions and identifying developing needs.</p>
<p>• The Public Health Agency is tasked with developing new knowledge and support materials concerning LGBTQI people and alcohol, narcotics, doping and tobacco (ANDT) problems. Support for  peer-to-peer interventions and developing methods should be made available with the aim of facilitating smaller organisations that represent particularly vulnerable groups to apply for grants.</p>
<h2>A clearer ANDT strategy</h2>
<p>• The existing ANDT strategy should be updated so that it includes clear proposals concerning how particularly vulnerable groups are to be reached.</p>
<h2>A supplement to the agreement with SALAR</h2>
<p>• It should be included in the agreement for mental health between the Government and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR) that municipalities are to report in their  county-wide action plans how they plan to promote mental health and prevent mental ill health among trans people.</p>
<p>Surveys indicate that trans people are much more susceptible to stress than the general population. More research about the situation for trans people in Sweden is needed regarding, among other matters, eating disorders and interventions that are effective, for example, in reducing susceptibility to minority stress.</p>
<p>In Swedish surveys, a higher proportion of trans people state they have contemplated suicide or have attempted to take their own lives, compared with the general population.</p>
<p>The agreement between the Government and SALAR regarding efforts to promote mental health includes the creation of countywide plans for improving mental health. The LGBT group is named in 9 of the 21 plans as a particularly vulnerable group.</p>
<p>The suicide prevention programme contains a national action plan, which is lacking an LGBTQI perspective. In addition, the national ANDT strategy lacks any explicit trans perspective or an LGBTQI perspective.</p>
<h2>Attitudes within the health and social care sectors</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s terms of reference state that, on the basis of past studies, how trans people are treated within the health sector is to be explored. The inquiry proposes the following:</p>
<h2>Knowledge and privacy within the health sector shall improve</h2>
<p>• The National Board of Health and Welfare is tasked with conducting a preliminary study of required training interventions for existing healthcare personnel.</p>
<p>• The National Board of Health and Welfare is tasked with investigating whether the medical record systems used in Sweden for obstetric care and foetal monitoring are adapted to individuals with male personal identity numbers.</p>
<p>• County councils and regions should secure that new medical record systems do not have a block against certain personal identification numbers.</p>
<p>• The National Board of Health and Welfare and the National Agency for Education are tasked with updating  Vägledning för elevhälsan  (Guide to Pupils’ Health) with information about the living conditions of young trans people.</p>
<p>Research indicates that up to one in four trans respondents have been subjected to discrimination or been treated badly within the health sector and that this leads to a reluctance to seek further care.</p>
<p>Through its website, the inquiry has also received a large number of submissions concerning problematic treatment within the health sector, for example, at primary care centres, psychiatric services, including child and adolescent psychiatry, and young people’s clinics.</p>
<p>We have noted specific challenges for trans men and non-binary people who are pregnant, relating to both the need for specific supports and technical difficulties with the medical records system.</p>
<p>The inquiry’s terms of reference state that it is to propose concrete initiatives that improve trans people’s opportunities to safely participate in various recreational activities, in civil society, and in other social contexts, as well as propose measures that improve trans people’s opportunities to participate in exercise and sports. The inquiry proposes the following:</p>
<h2>Safer meeting spaces and strengthened self-organising</h2>
<p>• The Swedish Agency for Youth and Civil Society is tasked with allocating grants to actors that facilitate meeting places and activities for trans people and people with intersex variations, and facilitate relatives of trans people and people with intersex variations to form organisations.</p>
<p>• The Government grant to LGBTQ organisations should be increased.</p>
<p>• The Agency for Youth and Civil Society is tasked with investigating how trans people perceive their opportunities to participate in civil society.</p>
<p>• The Agency for Youth and Civil Society is allocated specific funding to update educational materials and strengthen the trans perspective in its efforts to support open and inclusive recreational activities.</p>
<p>Access to meeting places specifically for their own group is something that young trans people indicated is very important in a survey conducted by the National Board for Youth Affairs, now the Agency for Youth and Civil Society.</p>
<p>Forming organisations and contacts with other trans people is mentioned in several of the submissions received by the inquiry as vital to well-being. Relatives can also be in need of contact with other relatives. There can also be a need to organise groups with a specific focus on trans people with certain experiences, which is why it is important that smaller organisations are also able to apply for grants.</p>
<h2>Increased opportunities for trans people to participate in sports and exercise</h2>
<p>• The National Board of Health and Welfare is tasked with identifying reasons for the sedentary leisure time of trans people, as well as suggesting initiatives to encourage greater activity.</p>
<p>• The Government should initiate a dialogue with the Swedish Sports Confederation on the situation of trans people in sports.</p>
<p>• The Government should design grants and terms of funding in such a way that only children and youth sports taking account of the child rights perspective receive funding.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Research Council for Sport Science is tasked with developing indicators so that the state’s support for sports can be reviewed from a child rights perspective.</p>
<p>Trans people have more sedentary leisure time than the general population. In a survey by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), just over one in four trans respondents stated that they had experienced discrimination at sports facilities. Several studies indicate that young trans people also have negative experiences from their involvement in sports, have experienced harassment associated with their trans identity, as well as a lack of support from coaches when this occurred. More knowledge is required to address these barriers.</p>
<p>Swedish sports policy has aims that include promoting public health and supporting the independent sports movement. The financial support provided to sports is focused on children and young people and emphasises everyone having the opportunity to participate. The Sports Confederation is the umbrella organisation for Swedish sports and its role includes allocating grants.</p>
<h2>Trans people’s situation in the labour market</h2>
<p>The inquiry has been tasked with mapping, in dialogue with the social partners, the barriers to trans people’s opportunities to participate in working life on equal terms and, where necessary, with proposing concrete actions to improve the work environment and the labour market situation for trans people. The inquiry proposes the following:</p>
<h2>Increase knowledge about trans people’s situation in the labour market</h2>
<p>• The new agency, National Work Environment Centre, is tasked with, on the basis of existing studies, developing basic information materials concerning work environment issues with an LGBTQ perspective, including a special focus on the situation of trans people. The information should target employers, as well as safety representatives and other elected representatives at the work place.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Work Environment Authority is tasked with amending or adding to the paragraphs in the work environment directive,  Workplace Design  concerning the rules for changing rooms, washing and shower facilities, and toilets, with the purpose of including a trans perspective.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Equality Ombudsman is tasked with disseminating knowledge to employers with good examples and methods for implementing active measures from a trans perspective.</p>
<p>The inquiry concludes that there is limited knowledge about trans people in the labour market, which should increase. There are certain factors entailing to the situation of trans people in working life differs from that of cis people. These include access to toilets and changing rooms. There is also a fear of coming out in the workplace and risk being subjected to discrimination.</p>
<p>Employers are telling the inquiry that they would like to do more to combat discrimination, but that there is insufficient knowledge, and that it is difficult to know how to implement the new regulations concerning active measures.</p>
<p>The trade unions are realising that while there are few reports of discrimination, there is probably a rather large number of incidents that go unreported. The inquiry has found that the unions have taken a number of settled cases of discrimination against trans people, which should be highlighted.</p>
<h2>Administrative challenges facing people who have changed their legal gender</h2>
<p>The inquiry is to identify the administrative barriers that trans people experience in their everyday lives. The inquiry is also to propose concrete initiatives that can ease trans people’s everyday lives in terms of administration and treatment when engaging with public authorities and other actors. The inquiry proposes the following:</p>
<h2>Obligatory data from the Swedish Tax Agency, improved information, and a new inquiry</h2>
<p>• The Tax Agency and the National Board of Health and Welfare are tasked with producing accessible information about the administrative consequences of a change in legal gender.</p>
<p>• The Tax Agency is tasked with ensuring that the reference personal identity number should be an obligatory item of data in the information system Navet.</p>
<p>• The National Board of Health and Welfare is tasked with following up its 2014 survey of administrative problems for people who have changed their legal gender.</p>
<p>• The Government establishes an inquiry tasked with investigating how to ensure that a person changing their personal identity number is not treated as a different person.</p>
<p>The inquiry has received a very large number of submissions regarding problems that have arisen when engaging with both private sector actors and public authorities following a change of legal gender and subsequent personal identity number.</p>
<p>These problems are due to the individual’s information in Sweden most often being connected to their personal identity number and a change of legal gender means that the person is assigned a new personal identity number. Relatively many organisations that engage with the public have systems that cannot facilitate this change, their procedures are lacking or non-existent and the information provided to those having changed their legal gender is inadequate.</p>
<h2>Reissuing degree certificates, grades and other documentation after change of legal gender</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s terms of reference state that it is to map any barriers that may arise when someone who has changed their legal gender must use documentation in accordance with their previous personal identity number. Where necessary, the inquiry is to propose measures that can be implemented in the short and long term to remove any barriers and propose how contact between individuals and actors within the education system and the labour market can be facilitated.</p>
<p>The inquiry has focused on actors within the education system and trans people’s needs and opportunities to obtain documentation for completed courses and study programmes that lists their new personal identity number, and makes the following assessments:</p>
<h2>Measures to make it simpler to obtain grades and degree certificates with the correct personal identity number</h2>
<p>• The Swedish National Agency for Education, Swedish Council for Higher Education, and the Swedish National Agency for Higher Vocational Education are to jointly investigate and develop guidelines for issuing new diplomas and certificates within their respective educational fields.</p>
<p>• A new inquiry is established to ensure the right to diplomas and related educational documents for people who have received a new personal identity number.</p>
<p>The inquiry has obtained information that the process has been different for different people and that different schools, universities and university colleges make different decisions with respect to obtaining degree certificates or final grades with a new personal identity number. It has been suggested to the inquiry that equivalent processing of such cases is desirable.</p>
<h2>Trans people in statistics</h2>
<p>According to the inquiry’s terms of reference, it is to address how questionnaires and surveys can include non-binary people and present good examples of how this can be implemented. The inquiry is also to review how gender-differentiated statistics can be supplemented by including non-binary people. The inquiry proposes the following:</p>
<h2>Better inclusion of trans people in questionnaires and surveys</h2>
<p>• Statistics Sweden is tasked with producing support material to assist public sector actors to include binary and  non-binary trans people in questionnaires and surveys.</p>
<p>The inquiry has reviewed experiences and examples pertaining to the inclusion of non-binary people in questionnaire surveys from organisations including Statistics Sweden, the Swedish Federation for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Rights (RFSL) and the City of Gothenburg. These emphasise the importance of considering which aspect of gender is to be highlighted in the survey (legal gender, gender identity, gender expression) and posing the question on the basis of this. In order to comply with the legal requirements concerning gender-differentiated statistics, while still being inclusive, questionnaires must ask questions about both legal gender and gender identity. If accurate results are to be obtained from all trans people, there also needs to be a specific question about trans identity.</p>
<p>Gender-differentiated statistics that are based on registry data present some challenges in terms of supplementing these so that nonbinary people, as well as binary trans people, are included. These challenges include the risk of identifying individuals who have not consented to this. The Swedish Personal Data Act’s ban on collecting data that is considered sensitive is also relevant in this context. The inquiry points out that there may be grounds to call into question what might now be regarded as sensitive data.</p>
<p>The inquiry argues that including non-binary people in registrybased gender-differentiated statistics is complicated because it is not entirely possible. Consequently, we present here our proposal to investigate the feasibility of introducing a third legal gender.</p>
<h2>Gender-confirming care</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s terms of reference state that it is to explore how people who undergo gender-confirming care perceive the assessment, care and treatment, including aftercare; how these people perceive their contact with various authorities; map how long people have to wait before assessments begin and the duration of assessments, and propose concrete initiatives to increase the well-being of people who are waiting for care; collect good examples of accurate information provided to people who need to undergo this care and how these can be disseminated; investigate the extent to which gender-confirming care and treatment are adapted to the needs of non-binary people and propose any initiatives that may be required. The inquiry proposes the following principal action:</p>
<h2>An agreement with the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions to shorten waiting times and make access to care more equal</h2>
<p>• The Government initiates an agreement with SALAR with the aim of making  gender-confirming care more equal across the country and ensuring that all those who need have access to this care, irrespective of factors such as their age and gender identity.</p>
<p>• A budget attached to this agreement is to be distributed between the various teams and specialist doctors within various fields of care. The length of waiting times and gender teams’ performance will determine the distribution of funding which will be adjusted as needed.</p>
<p>In 2015, the National Board of Health and Welfare published two evidence-based guides on gender-confirming care, one for paediatric and adolescent care and one for adult care. A follow-up was conducted the following year. The National Board of Health and Welfare concluded that a lack of knowledge and resources among referring county councils leads to the care provided remaining unequal between different regions.</p>
<p>The Swedish Association for Transsexual Health (SFTH) has also noted that gender-confirming care is unequal across the country in similar areas to those identified by the National Board of Health and Welfare and argues that this is a problem.</p>
<p>The inquiry has also received quite a large number of reports of difficulties obtaining a referral for gender-confirming care and has reviewed questionnaire surveys that indicate there is relatively widespread dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Reports received by the inquiry concerning problems within the health sector can be divided into six main areas: long waiting times and the negative consequences for mental health; problems with a lack of information and participation; uncertain benefit of psychological tests and the ‘real-life experience’; perception of being expected to conform to stereotypes; feelings of powerlessness and vulnerability; varying experiences of the attitude of care providers.</p>
<p>According to the gender teams, there are challenges in several areas in terms of the feasibility of delivering a high standard of care. Lack of resources and difficulties recruiting sufficient staff with the correct expertise, lack of knowledge among decision makers and thus difficulties conveying the importance of these services are among the challenges identified.</p>
<p>The inquiry has also mapped the waiting times for accessing the various teams and the subsequent various treatments offered following assessment and diagnosis. Waiting times vary greatly across the country.</p>
<h2>Living conditions of people with intersex variations</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s terms of reference state that, where appropriate, it is to investigate the living conditions of people with intersex variations. We have explored points of view from organisations that represent people with intersex variations and research in this field. On the basis of this, we propose the following:</p>
<h2>Measures to improve care and rights for people with intersex variations</h2>
<p>• The Government appoints an inquiry tasked with unconditionally investigating the matter of legislation or other measures pertaining to surgical and other procedures on people with intersex variations.</p>
<p>• The National Board of Health and Welfare is tasked with investigating opportunities to ensure the patient’s right to information about their own medical history.</p>
<p>• The National Board of Health and Welfare is tasked with developing, in collaboration with representative organisations, an  evidence-based guide for the care of people with intersex variations. This work can be initiated by conducting a survey and is to complement the previous survey.</p>
<p>The inquiry has reviewed the results of a questionnaire survey, dsdLIFE, in which Swedish people with intersex variations answered questions about their quality of life. The majority of respondents are satisfied or quite satisfied with their experiences, but at the same time many argue that the health sector should actually postpone irreversible procedures. The results must be interpreted with care.</p>
<p>The Swedish National Council on Medical Ethics argues in a comment that surgical procedures on infants or young children should not be conducted without a medical indication or when there is a lack of supporting evidence. More knowledge is required, as is more support for parents and children.</p>
<p>There are a variety of perspectives among the organisations that represent people with intersex variations on the issue of performing surgical procedures on infants and young children. However, there</p>
<p>is a consensus regarding the need for more knowledge within the health sector and access to specialist care.</p>
