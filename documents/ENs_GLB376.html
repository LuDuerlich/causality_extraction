<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In Sweden there were in 1996 about 110 000 older persons (over 65 years of age) who were born in other countries. They comprise about eight percent of all old age pensioners. Most come from Northern Europe, but there are significant groups who have recently arrived as refugees from non-European countries. All foreign-born elderly are usually termed ”older immigrants” regardless of why and how they came to Sweden. The question has been raised whether these persons have had unusual experiences in encounters with medical care and old age care, i.e., with thought of communications difficulties or eventual cultural differences. During the 1990’s many activities and programmes have been started for particular groups of foreign-born old people. These programmes can build on religious basis as for Assyrians/Syrians and Jews or build on ethnic and national belonging as with Finns, Greeks, Turks and Iranians or on the basis of a common language as with Spanish or Arabic speakers. ”Older immigrants” are poorly represented among those who use home care services or who live in sheltered housing. Utilisation of such services varies according to land of origin. Older persons who come from the Nordic countries and other of Sweden’s closest neighbouring countries use home care services and the public health service and care to the same degree as the average. For people who come from non-European countries, the figures for access to service are low.</p>
<p>Older persons in Stockholm come from 112 different countries but among home care services users only 61 countries are represented; among residents in sheltered housing there are representatives of only 39 countries. What role does culture play in the low utilisation of public medical and home care?</p>
<p>In order to answer these and similar questions connected with encounters, two national studies of ”older immigrants” were completed. The one was quantitative and used a questionnaire which was answered by 141 persons from thirty different countries. The other was qualitatively based encompassing long interviews with sixteen persons from nine different countries. The interviews were held in the interviewed person’s mother tongue (unless he or she expressed a wish to speak Swedish) and took place mainly at the homes of the interviewed persons. This was done in order to create an interview situation which was comfortable and secure for those who participated.</p>
<p>The report begins with a survey of relevant Swedish and international literature on ageing, ethnicity, health and encounters. Then follows a critical examination of the politicaladministrative concept ”older immigrants” from linguistical, statistical and social-psychological perspectives. The main problems are to grasp who and what is actually covered by the term ”older immigrants” since the group is very heterogeneous. Another problem is that individuals can relate in many ways to the group to which they are considered to belong. Many of the foreign-born elderly belonged to minorities in their country of origin. A third problem is that the concept lends itself to a negative stereotype of elderly from foreign cultures as being placed in much jeopardy since they are assumed to be poorer, sicker and less socially integrated than Swedes in general.</p>
<p>From different macroand microsociological perspectives seven hypotheses could be formulated for testing on the collected materials. They are (in shortened form): 1. Some elders who come from other cultures will have difficulty in assimilating to the Swedish medical and care structures and will prefer the ways of their home country. 2. Some elders who come from other countries will appreciate and prefer the Swedish health service and its ways of encountering patients. 3. Elders coming from the nearest neighbouring countries will find it easier than  non-European immigrants to place demands on and to make changes in the health and care services. 4. Elders will try to figure out the rules in order to adjust their behaviour to the existing ways of Swedish care environments. 5. The ability to adjust behaviour varies. Those who came from neighbouring countries will find it more easy, others must invent strategies for coping with unusual and unexpected situations. 6. The experience of encounters in the medical and care services can be similar for both Swedes and immigrants, thus they react over the same conditions. However, the way they react may differ. 7. Many professionals have a definite idea of what they perceive to be ”older immigrants”. Immigrants who can communicate in Swedish will be treated differently than those who need interpreters.</p>
<p>The collected material verifies (although in different degrees) these hypotheses, but with one exception. Persons who came from cultures where the health system was very different from the Swedish did not express difficulty in accepting the new Swedish ways. Of course there were some persons who travelled back to their home countries for medical care, but they did so first after many years of difficult negotiation with the Swedish health service. Usually these problems concerned difficulty in making a diagnosis for persons who had diffuse symptoms and who came from non-European countries.</p>
<p>On the whole the ”older immigrants” were satisfied with the encounters they had with medical care and old age care. The questionnaire answers are overwhelmingly positive, with only a few individuals expressing any criticism. The judgements in the interviews are also positive, but they do contain criticism of particular details. Examples of criticism: being encountered in an ”infantilizing” manner; many Muslim and Christian women from countries in the Middle East told of difficulties they had in accepting examinations by male doctors; many complained that the staff have too little time to talk; that services were hard to reach by telephone; that the rate of staff turn-over is so high; that carers can be rigid and unwilling to listen to the wishes of the elderly person; some tell of malpractice.</p>
<p>Some persons from the Nordic countries and Eastern Europe have been successful in complaining about and changing medical or old age care. But none of the non-European elderly had even attempted to complain. Many of these say that they would never raise a complaint regardless of what their children and families thought. Instead some of them had travelled back to seek care in their home countries.</p>
<p>The report ends with some recommendations about planning of service directed towards older persons from other countries, the educational needs of the staff and the need for continued research.</p>
