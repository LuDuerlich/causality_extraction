<p>No set timetable – with the objectives in focus</p>
<p>The five-year pilot scheme for compulsory school education with no set timetable, involving 900 compulsory schools in 79 different municipalities, began at the start of the 2000/2001 academic year.</p>
<p>The government exercises control of the Swedish compulsory school via the Schools Act, the national curriculum and syllabi. There is also a national timetable stipulating the subjects to be read in compulsory school and the minimum number of teaching hours each pupil is guaranteed during his/her compulsory school education, both in total and for each subject/group of related subjects respectively.</p>
<p>The schools participating in the pilot scheme were given total exemption from the time distribution per subject or group of related subjects stipulated in the national timetable but were still governed by all other provisions applicable to compulsory schools. These include following the national curriculum (Lpo 94) and working to existing syllabi for compulsory school subjects/groups of related subjects; providing the stipulated total number of guaranteed hours for nine years of compulsory school (6,665 hours); and ensuring pupils receive both a well-balanced education as well as well-proportioned academic years and schooldays.</p>
<p>The idea of the pilot scheme is not to replace the national timetable with municipal schedules but for the participating schools to decide themselves how the time is to be allocated.</p>
<p>The School Timetable Delegation has the overall responsibility for managing, supporting and evaluating the pilot scheme and is to submit documentation to be used by the government as a basis for deciding whether (and if so how) to abolish the compulsory school timetable. According to the instructions it has received, the delegation need not wait until the final report to submit its recommendation but may do so in the interim report if it feels there is already sufficient evidence for its standpoint at that time.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The role of the timetable in a school governed by objectives and results has been the subject of debate for a long time. It was highlighted in particular when the responsibility for schools was decentralized and was the subject of several government enquiries during the 1990s. There has been widespread consensus that having a national timetable in a system governed by objectives and results is rather illogical and that such a timetable can lead to an inflexible “schedule-bound” approach, hindering the desired development of school education in Sweden. Furthermore, the “steering” effect of the timetable on how education is organized and how teaching resources are utilized is also brought into question.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the nationally established timetable has been viewed as a tool with which to promote equity and quality. Misgivings about the abolition of the timetable have included the effects it might have on various school subjects. The need for more detailed syllabi objectives in the event of the timetable being abolished has also been discussed. Efficient evaluation and quality assurance systems have been highlighted as absolute necessities for being able to abolish the timetable.</p>
<p>In its final report  School issues – school in a new era (Official Government Report 1997:121), the Schools Committee proposed that the school’s existing timetable be abolished and that only a minimum number of teaching hours should be regulated. An alternative proposal was a pilot scheme, which was the option finally adopted by the government and the Riksdag.</p>
<p>The government then appointed a working group at the Ministry of Education and Science, which presented a green paper entitled</p>
<p>No set timetable – but the same assignment (Ds 1999:1). The government and the Riksdag adopted the proposals in the paper, paving the way for the current pilot scheme testing the flexible timetable system.</p>
<p>Should the timetable be abolished?</p>
<p>The analysis in this report is based on extensive research and evaluation of school development. The delegation has carried out an unusually in-depth analysis of the current Swedish compulsory school system and studied how schools with no set timetable have</p>
<p>organized their teaching. The national evaluation of compulsory schools NU03 , performed by the National Agency of Education, will further elucidate the picture as far as the content, working methods and results of compulsory schools are concerned, when it is published later in the spring.</p>
<p>The delegation has observed activities but, in accordance with the principles of governance by objectives and results, has refrained from issuing directives on working methods and choice of subject matter. In order to be able to form an opinion of whether the timetable can or should be abolished, it has been necessary for the delegation to make certain assessments of working methods and other aspects of teaching in the schools.</p>
<p>It is difficult to draw unequivocal conclusions about how far the observed development depend on the schools being exempt from following the timetable and to what extent it depends on school development in general. The development in the pilot schools is also happening in other schools, albeit not with the same force, and much of what the schools are doing in the pilot scheme can also be implemented within the framework of the current national timetable. It is nevertheless apparent that the timetable has been or is still seen as a hindrance to school development in many schools.</p>
<p>The timetable can and should be abolished – but the decision should be put on hold</p>
<p>The delegation’s fundamental perception is that the timetable is poorly suited to a school governed by objectives and results. It lacks the significance it once had for how schools are governed and is no longer seen by school practitioners as a policy document of any great importance. The timetable clearly risks gradually losing its legitimacy if it is retained.</p>
<p>The timetable can and should be abolished. The delegation also feels that the pilot scheme should be brought to a close at the end of June 2005 prior to a recommendation for the abolition of the timetable being submitted to the government. The delegation is of the opinion that the research and evaluation reports as well as other follow-up data such as the results of the national tests to be presented in 2004 and the first half of 2005 will provide a much clearer picture of the pilot scheme.</p>
<p>Schools must take control of time</p>
<p>The responsibility for day-to-day activities in a decentralized school governed by objectives and results rests first and foremost with the professionals, i.e. the teachers and the school principal. In a school where every pupil has the opportunity to develop in the best possible way, it is reasonable for teachers and the staff to be given the best possible scope for designing activities. Each school should also be empowered to decide itself how the time is to be used to achieve the objectives. Reaching a similar conclusion as the government School Committee did in 1997, the delegation feels that deciding how time is to be allocated should be part and parcel of the planning and organization of each individual school’s activities.</p>
<p>A school employing a more flexible, holistic approach is better able to prepare its pupils both for adult life and modern-day working life. Such a school is also better suited to the pupils of today and their demands. The timetable is also a poor guarantee that the pupils actually learn anything, making it an ineffective instrument.</p>
<p>Positive development in the pilot schools – but there are question marks</p>
<p>Teachers and school principals, pupils and parents alike are basically positive to the working methods developed in the pilot scheme. These methods are objective and result-oriented and largely based on the needs, prerequisites and interests of the individual pupil. They also take a holistic approach, by e.g. a higher degree of subject integration and themes.</p>
<p>Although the main impression is positive, the delegation feels there are still question marks, for example concerning the relationship between private study and group learning and the tendency towards excessive fragmentation of objectives. Teachers describe the pilot scheme as time-consuming, but above all fun, stimulating and developmental.</p>
<p>Improved study results</p>
<p>Grade statistics indicate a positive trend in the pilot schools concerning both the overall merit rating and the proportion of pupils with complete grades as well as the proportion of pupils eligible for</p>
<p>national upper-secondary programmes. From having a poorer average merit rating than other schools at the start of the project, the schools had reversed the situation by the spring of 2003. The proportion of pupils eligible for upper-secondary school has increased in the pilot schools, whilst it has remained unchanged in other schools. This positive development is also evident when we analyse the grade results for different subjects/groups of related subjects.</p>
<p>Development is particularly favourable in the pilot schools for the two pupil groups that generally have poorer grades otherwise, i.e. boys and pupils of foreign extraction. Improvement has been greatest among pupils of foreign extraction.</p>
<p>Results in the compulsory schools that are not involved in the pilot scheme have not improved to the same extent as in the pilot schools. They have even deteriorated in some respects. The trend for boys and pupils of foreign extraction in these schools is either positive but noticeably weaker than in the pilot schools or negative, i.e. results have deteriorated.</p>
<p>The objectives in focus – taken holistically or fragmented?</p>
<p>The schools put considerable energy into understanding, interpreting and breaking down the objectives, which are then evaluated, documented, verified and communicated to pupils and parents later on. Various support systems are used to plan and document the work. Such systems for younger pupils might consist of “castles”, “spinning tops”, “beehives”, “apple trees”, etc., that are gradually filled in as and when the pupils reach the set targets. Tables of some kind or another are often used for older pupils. Documenting their progress helps the pupils, their parents and teachers to feel they are more in control of development towards the objectives.</p>
<p>Intensified efforts with the objectives have given rise to more pedagogical discussions, better quality teaching and better results in the pilot schools. This is, however, an area where there is a considerable need for skills development and knowledge exchange. It is important, for example, not to allow work with objectives to deflect from the holistic approach nor to focus too much attention on objectives to be achieved  and grading criteria. Objectives to be achieved  were the centre of attention at the beginning of the pilot scheme. The perspective has, however, gradually been broadened to include objectives to strive towards  as well.</p>
<p>Individualization – private study or group learning?</p>
<p>The aim of greater individualization has noticeably changed the way many of the pilot schools work and organize their teaching. Pupils have to a greater or lesser extent been given their own time on the timetable. The pupils can use this time to work on things that for one reason or another have been allocated priority. This “own time” has been given different names such as “pupil time”, “private study”, etc. Individualization has obviously also manifested itself in other ways. The general idea is that the teachers adjust and organize their teaching in accordance with the pupils’ needs, prerequisites and interests.</p>
<p>Misgivings have been expressed that individualization may lead to the pupils doing too much private study and that this may detract from the intentions of group learning as expressed in the curriculum. The delegation does not see this as such an apparent risk. On the contrary, the evidence points to pupils in the pilot schools being given more opportunity to participate in joint projects of different kinds to a greater extent than in other schools. This is well in line with the various educational goals in the curriculum. The balance between individual work and group learning should, however, be studied in more details during the remainder of the pilot scheme.</p>
<p>There is also a good deal of evidence suggesting that this more individualized working method leads to pupils in need of special support actually receive such support to a greater degree. Clearer and more carefully considered pedagogical strategies are however needed for pupils with severe disabilities, as is also the case in other schools.</p>
<p>Greater pupil participation – only for some?</p>
<p>The follow-up and evaluation indicate that pupils have more influence over their studies. The pupils appreciate the greater degree of freedom and are comfortable with having control over some of the time they spend at school. Influence exercised by the pupils over teaching content is still the exemption rather than the norm, however. The pupils have asked for greater influence in several of the studies. Boys feel they have greater influence than girls and are</p>
<p>more positively inclined than girls are towards the greater degree of influence in the pilot schools compared to other schools.</p>
<p>Pupils that are finding it difficult to reach their objectives are not always able to make as good use of the freedom they are given as other pupils are. They tend to be more controlled by the teachers and their own ambitions to succeed in Swedish, English and mathematics in particular. The delegation feels it is important to respect the choice of the pupils even if they prioritize in this way. It is equally important, however, for teachers to help ensure the teaching doesn’t just focus on the pupils’ difficulties but also on their opportunities.</p>
<p>A balance between subjects</p>
<p>There has been apprehension as to the effects on compulsory school subjects in the event of the timetable being abolished. This has mainly concerned the risk of a “three-subject school” developing, with the focus on Swedish, English and mathematics (subjects that provide eligibility for the national upper-secondary programes), and the fact that so-called practical/aesthetic subjects may lose out when it comes to time and scope for more in-depth studies.</p>
<p>The follow-up and evaluation do not provide any evidence for such misgivings. As before, most of the schools have woodwork, sport and health, music, domestic science /consumer studies and art on the flexible timetable. Furthermore, they are often part of integrated subject periods and thematic projects, resulting in more time being devoted to them. In light of this, there is little justification for the misgivings about there being insufficient scope for more in-depth study, even if there is evidence to suggest their role in integrated subject periods can be further developed.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the balance between different subjects and groups of related subjects will shift as a natural consequence of changes in society and the world at large. A reappraisal of the curriculum and syllabi should then be carried out. When reviewing syllabi, the scope for working with objectives within the overall stipulated framework should be reassessed. How to strike a reasonable balance between the various prioritized subjects/groups of related subjects in the syllabi should also be looked into when the time comes.</p>
<p>Teachers’ working situation and developing their role</p>
<p>The various reports point to an increase in the teachers’ responsibility for planning, objective-setting and follow-up. This is a joint responsibility for the whole staff, which means that the teachers work much less on their own and in part have different tasks to perform. The ability to work together and formulate joint strategies is becoming ever more important as is the capacity to “speak up for one’s subject”.</p>
<p>The teachers are comfortable with having no set timetable and feel job satisfaction. They do point to an initial increase in workload and lack of time, however. The need for skills development is paramount, e.g. concerning organizational development, planning and documentation.</p>
<p>The role of the school principal is changing</p>
<p>There is considerable consensus regarding the important role played by school principals in the development of schools. This is not least true of the pilot scheme. The fact that the staff has expanded its area of responsibility does not necessarily mean that the role of school principal has become less important, but it has changed and is now more a question of supporting and stimulating development in a decentralized organization. School principals also need to develop their skills as the structure and relative responsibilities of schools start to change.</p>
<p>Future tasks for the delegation</p>
<p>This interim report will hopefully spread knowledge about the pilot scheme and provide a basis for a more in-depth discussion on what a flexible less system with no set timetable involves.</p>
<p>Before submitting its final report, the delegation may look into and consider the following:</p>
<p>Will the current system for following up the educational development of pupils need to be further strengthened if the timetable is abolished, e.g. will there be a need for diagnostic instruments in more subjects and in earlier years?</p>
<p>Is there a need to review the syllabi in the light of the development that has occurred in the pilot schools?</p>
<p>Is there a need for further clarification in the curriculum of certain balance issues if the timetable is abolished, e.g. the balance between private study and group learning and between practical/aesthetic subjects and others?</p>
<p>How can activities in a school with no set timetable be organized seen from a special education perspective?</p>
<p>How do the school, pre-school class and leisure-time centre relate to each other in a school employing the flexible timetable system?</p>
<p>What long-term support and development stimuli will a school with no set timetable need?</p>
<p>In what way will teacher education, school principal education and teacher skills development be affected and how can these support development based on the conditions that will prevail should the timetable be abolished?</p>
<p>How should an implementation plan be formulated if the timetable is abolished?</p>
<p>Other questions may arise or some may fall by the wayside as the delegation continues its work, depending on the results of future follow-ups and evaluations.</p>
