<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>Objectives</p>
<p>The inquiry has been commissioned to make proposals for a system of audits on official controls performed to verify compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules, referring to requirements in Art. 4.6 in Council Regulation 882/2004.</p>
<p>In accordance with directives, the inquiry is asked to submit proposals to the organization and responsibilities of the audit activities and to provide proposals for constitutional amendments as well as calculate the amount of any expenses for the State and municipality which arise by reason of the proposals of the inquiry.</p>
<p>Overall assessment</p>
<p>The overall assessment is that the Swedish audit system reveals deficiencies in many areas. The problems can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>• lack of a comprehensive and national overall planning, management and monitoring of audits,</p>
<p>• deficiencies in scope and quality of audits and in documentation and information on audit results,</p>
<p>• complexity in roles and responsibilities between the control authorities, and weak coordination at central level,</p>
<p>• unsufficient support and guidance to the control authorities, including efforts to support and develop methodology and training.</p>
<p>The starting point is a large and geographically dispersed organization, with more than 280 control authorities at various levels of government. Furthermore, there are two central authorities with divided competencies in the food chain.</p>
<p>The general assessment is that it is not appropriate to implement changes which further complicate the control organization. Changes should at this stage focus on strengthening the overall coordination of the audit system, and on improving conditions for developing the scope and quality of audits performed by the control authorities. A combination of different measures and efforts will be needed for some time to build a comprehensive audit system.</p>
<p>Control authorities shall carry out audits</p>
<p>The inquiry suggests that the audits which each competent authority is required to perform under the EU control regulation should form the basis of the audit system. But the current regime needs to be developed and strengthened in several areas. At first, there is need for a stronger and more comprehensive support and guidance to the control authorities. Joint development efforts are needed to develop methodology and skill in carrying out the audits. Futhermore, it is important to support the development of closer cooperation between the control authorities.</p>
<p>Central control authorities</p>
<p>The central competent authorities, National Food Administration and the Swedish Board of Agriculture, have a fundamental responsibility for management, coordination and monitoring of the official controls and to provide guidance and support to the control authorities. The inquiry suggests that this coordination should also include the audits performed by regional and local authorities. The responsibilities of the central authorities are proposed to be clarified in the regulations with instructions for the authorities.</p>
<p>National coordination of audits</p>
<p>The overall planning, management and monitoring of audits need to be strengthened at the national level. The investigation suggests that one of central control authorities, the National Food Administration or the Swedish Board of Agriculture, should be mandated to coordinate the national audit work and establish a coordination body – an audit committee – for interfacing with the other control authorities. The audit committe should be headed by a president who can be appointed by the Government. The committee should also be able to have external participants.</p>
<p>The mandate includes the following tasks:</p>
<p>• draw up a  multi-annual national audit plan covering the whole control system and the whole food chain,</p>
<p>• monitor audits nationally, analyse and assess results,</p>
<p>• coordinate and initialize joint operations,</p>
<p>• report aggregate analysis and assessment of control system.</p>
<p>The audit committee shall regularly meet to assess overall audit results obtained and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses in the control system as a whole and the need for adjustments in the national control plan and the planning of further audit work.</p>
<p>An important task of the audit committee is to develop a common structure for information and reporting on audit findings and circumstances within the control arrangements.</p>
<p>The committee will report regularly to the Government. Reports should include an account of the work of the committee, the audits reported and an overall assessment with recommendations relevant for the control and audit planning.</p>
<p>Central audits</p>
<p>Central or joint audits need to be developed in order to be able to conduct comprehensive audits of the control system. The central audits should be planned and implemented within the audit committee. Implementation of central audits should be done through a joint collaboration between the authorities.</p>
<p>The focus of the centrally initiated audits should be on crosscutting issues or risk areas in the entire control system, on selected thematic reviews, or other areas identified in the risk analysis. Possibility should also be made through the central audits to carry out system audits, i.e. reviews of selected control authorities and audit procedures.</p>
<p>Development Efforts</p>
<p>Concrete development efforts is needed to improve the conditions for the control authorities to carry out audits of high quality and uniformity. Development efforts is proposed to be planned and implemented by the audit committee and focus on the following areas:</p>
<p>• information, communication,</p>
<p>• method support and method development,</p>
<p>• support for the development of cooperation between authorities.</p>
<p>Implementation</p>
<p>The Government should give clear guidelines for the implementation of measures and set requirements for regular reporting in order to support the development of the audit system. An evaluation of the changes should be carried out after a few years to ensure that the measures have had the expected results.</p>
<p>Other issues</p>
<p>The work on monitoring and reporting of the official controls is proposed to be strengthened in parallel with the development of the audit system. An important measure is that the Government is requesting regular reporting in support of its governance. It should also be considered if the Government and the responsible ministry need to have a clearer role in the preparation and monitoring of the multi-annual national control plan.</p>
