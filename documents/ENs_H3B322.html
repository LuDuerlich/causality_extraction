<p>The pedagogical leadership of head teachers is vital to the quality and development of school operations. The remit of this Inquiry has included examining how the working situation of head teachers within the school system can be changed to enhance opportunities to improve pupil outcomes in school.</p>
<p>It is well known that many head teachers feel that they are unable to allocate sufficient time to their role as pedagogical leaders of school activities due to their large administrative burden. Previous studies have also shown that many head teachers experience difficulties managing the tasks they are responsible for.</p>
<p>This Inquiry indicates that many of the problems head teachers experience result from deficiencies in the school system’s ‘chain of command’. This chain of command refers to the sequence consisting of ‘central government–school governing body–govern- ing body’s management–head teachers–teachers’. The corresponding chain for schools with an independent school organiser is often comprised of ‘central government–school organiser–head teacher’s manager–head teacher–teachers’, and in practice is often somewhat shorter.</p>
<p>One problem is that the dialogue conducted between the various levels in the chain of command is often unclear in various respects. Consequently, the dialogue does not result in a common strategy on how to achieve the national goals in the individual school.</p>
<p>My overall conclusion is that there is a great need to reinforce head teachers’ pedagogical leadership capacity. Head teachers need to be better at organising and managing schools in the context of the national school assignment, pupils’ development and the results of systematic quality enhancement work. One important element of the pedagogical leadership role of head teachers is building and</p>
<p>managing a well-functioning school organisation based on the needs of pupils, staff and other stakeholders. Well-developed active pedagogical leadership is a prerequisite for successfully fostering pupils’ knowledge development. For it is specifically through active pedagogical leadership focusing on learning that the head teacher gains the knowledge required to organise and staff the school and develop staff expertise and skills in the best possible way, and to allocate resources where they are most needed. The question is how  the pedagogical leadership capacity of head teachers can be strengthened.</p>
<p>I believe that there is primarily a need for cultural changes  aimed at paving the way for head teachers’ pedagogical leadership. The responsible governing bodies and the leading officials representing these bodies need to follow up the work of head teachers to a greater extent and clarify the existing demands for change in the management and leadership of individual schools. It is also important, however, that the governing body supports head teachers in various situations. Interaction, support, leadership and management need to be developed within the entire chain of command. The governing body in municipalities is represented by a politically elected committee, and officials who supervise head teachers. Similarly, independent schools also often have different actors that in various ways represent the school’s governing body. In general, there is a great need to develop knowledge of the national assignment among school governing bodies and the different officials established between the school leader/administrative director and the head teacher.</p>
<p>The working situation of head teachers is unsatisfactory, and changing it will require an in-depth dialogue between the various levels in the chain of command, and in this regard the school governing bodies, or those representing these bodies as the managers of head teachers, play an important role in upholding the national assignment. If an in-depth dialogue based on sound knowledge of the challenges in relation to the assignment and clear objectives existed, the head teacher culture would also develop in general. Many head teachers need to be better at setting priorities and otherwise developing a well thought-out and thorough pedagogical leadership role. The different school cultures of which teachers are the vehicles are also important to note in this context.</p>
<p>The chain of command and the national educational goals certainly also include teachers and their work with pupils.</p>
<p>A lack of trust or confidence between the various actors in the school system’s chain of command is one of the problems with the educational system. A lack of confidence in the head teacher on the part of the governing body risks leading to overburdened school offices, which in practice creates more work for head teachers rather than lightening their work load. In many areas there is also a lack of confidence between head teachers and teachers. The problem with low levels of confidence between head teachers and teachers seems to be related to the existence of a school culture involving a ‘negative view of leadership’. This school culture needs to transition to more peer collaboration between teachers and acceptance of the head teacher’s pedagogical leadership role, and peer learning between teachers.</p>
<p>Changing a culture among professional groups is not a quick or easy task. It requires regular goal-oriented dialogues and discussions on the ground, and education and training connected to the chain of command and pupils’ knowledge development. Governing bodies, head teachers and even teachers should be included in various activities – dialogues and education – with the aim of increasing understanding that the head teacher’s pedagogical leadership role is an essential prerequisite to enable schools to achieve the national goals. Dialogues, education and other initiatives must of course be based on proper factual background information that convincingly demonstrates the need for a comprehensive pedagogical leadership from the head teacher.</p>
<p>Against this background, I propose a multi-annual national action programme to strengthen schools’ chain of command in relation to the national goals. The programme is proposed to enter into force on 1 January 2017 and end on 1 January 2022, after which time an evaluation should be carried out.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the action programme consist of the following.</p>
<p> A government recruitment training programme for prospective head teachers</p>
<p>I propose that a new recruitment training programme be established that is intended for teachers and others who are interested in future leadership roles at various levels in the</p>
<p>school system. The aim of the training programme is to promote recruitment of school leaders, but it will also provide continuing professional development for people who have, or will have, other leadership roles, such as team leaders. It is proposed that the recruitment training programme for prospective head teachers consist of 10 higher education credits, at a cost of SEK 20 000 per place. A total of 500 places per year is proposed. The total cost of a national recruitment training programme would consequently be SEK 10 million annually. The Swedish National Agency for Education will receive a sum equivalent to 6 per cent of the programme costs to produce a steering document for the programme and its evaluation, and to cover administration of the national admission process.</p>
<p> A somewhat adjusted focus for the National School Leadership Training Programme</p>
<p>I propose that the existing National School Leadership Training Programme be adjusted somewhat. The programme should be focused more on the national assignment and the local chain of command, from the governing body and its various managers to head teachers and teachers. It is important that head teachers learn about their role in the central government chain of command and also learn to make demands on the local governing body and its representatives concerning support, leadership and management to ensure a school system that effectively achieves the national goals and promotes good pupil outcomes in terms of both knowledge and social maturity. The programme can be adjusted in this way without allocating additional funds.</p>
<p> A compulsory advanced education programme following the National School Leadership Training Programme</p>
<p>I propose the introduction into the Education Act of an obligation for school governing bodies to ensure that their head teachers take an advanced education programme as soon as possible once three years have passed since they completed the National School Leadership Training Programme. The programme should primarily deal with role of the systematic quality enhancement work in the school’s chain of command. It is proposed that the advanced programme consist of 10 higher</p>
<p>education credits. I propose that SEK 15 million annually be allocated to this programme, which will permit around 550 places per year. The Swedish National Agency for Education receives a sum based on 6% of the course cost to cover their work in relation to administration of the admission process.</p>
<p> Training programme for school leaders</p>
<p>I propose that a training programme be established for school leaders and other managers who are under the school leader but above the head teacher in the chain of command. Head teachers’ management problems should be analysed during the programme and, in addition, efforts to remedy these management problems should be initiated, i.e. the course should be both theoretical and practical, focusing on operational analyses and support, management and leadership. It is proposed that this training programme for school leaders consist of 10 higher education credits, at a cost of SEK 28 000 per place and year. A total of 200 places annually is proposed. The cost of the programme will be SEK 5.6 million per year. The Swedish National Agency for Education receives a sum based on 6% of the course cost to cover their work in relation to administration of the admission process.</p>
<p> Training for teachers on the school management system</p>
<p>I also propose a renewed and strengthened discussion of the emphasis on and scope of knowledge and understanding of the national chain of command in teacher education programmes. Knowledge and understanding of the function of the chain of command can be developed and improved in most teacher education programmes.</p>
<p> Training and dialogue for elected representatives</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Government should consider education and training for members of municipal committees with responsibility for schools. This should be possible through regional and/or local conferences. It may be best to hold such training the year after a general election.</p>
