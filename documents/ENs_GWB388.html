<p>The Inquiry’s proposal</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that acts and ordinances be published electronically in the Swedish Code of Statutes, which will be made available on a special website on the Internet. It is proposed that a statute have the same wording as that of the electronic publication in the Swedish Code of Statutes. This means that the electronic version on the special website is the official version of a statute and the one that the public can assume to be correct (the authentic version).</p>
<p>The proposal proceeds from the principle that all legislation included in the Swedish Code of Statutes are to be authentic. In line with this, the Inquiry also proposes that the version of a statute that is incorporated in its entirety into the Swedish Code of Statutes in connection with an amendment to the statute – known as a reprint in the current system – be regarded as authentic. Therefore, there will be no difference between cases where a statute is incorporated into the Swedish Code of Statutes as part of a normal publication and cases of ‘reprints’. A reprint should only be possible following a decision by the Government.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the new regulations enter into force on 1 January 2011, and that they apply to statutes published after that date.</p>
<p>The considerations of the Inquiry</p>
<p>An electronic publication system should be introduced</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that it is both possible and appropriate to introduce an electronic system for the publication of acts and ordinances. From a technical point of view, it is possible to create a</p>
<p>reliable and secure system with a reasonable level of resources. Moreover, there are strong practical arguments for introducing such a system. Electronic publication would provide greater access to the authentic version of a statute. Studies show that the public has very good access to the Internet. For many people, the Internet is an increasingly common source of information. Since the purpose of publication is to make a statute public knowledge, it is a natural step – in view of developments – to publish the Swedish Code of Statutes on the Internet. In turn, this could strengthen the general principle that everyone is expected to be familiar with the content of current statutes. Access will also be improved by virtue of the fact that the user can read the statutes on a computer linked to the Internet, regardless of time and place.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind, in particular, the fact that some people do not have access to a computer, it is proposed that public libraries be obliged to provide the public with free access to the Swedish Code of Statutes website.</p>
<p>With an electronic system, it will be possible to publish acts and ordinances every Monday–Friday, excluding public holidays. It will also be possible to shorten the period of time between promulgation and publication, and statutes will thus be published long before they enter into force.</p>
<p>An electronic publication system is also in line with international developments. Several countries have introduced such systems and seen positive results.</p>
<p>Another positive effect of electronic publication is that it will lead to more rational and efficient working methods at the Government Offices.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s view, it is possible to safeguard the long-term preservation of statutes in an electronic publication system.</p>
<p>The legal status of various versions, etc.</p>
<p>It is proposed that acts and ordinances only be published in electronic form, and that the electronically published version be the only official and authentic version. However, the Inquiry considers that a paper copy should nonetheless be produced, in light of the additional security a paper copy provides. A paper copy will, therefore, be a carrier of a Government decision, as has previously been the case. The paper copy of a statute must be</p>
<p>signed, enclosed with the cabinet minutes and kept in the same way as is currently the case.</p>
<p>The electronically published version and the paper copy expressing the Government decision are to be identical to one another, both in form and content. Statutes are to be published in an electronic document format that will insure this.</p>
<p>One person at the ministry that has processed the matter will be responsible for checking that the versions are identical and approving the incorporation of the statute into the Swedish Code of Statutes. The published version must also be kept.</p>
<p>It is proposed that there no longer be a special option of publishing statutes in codes of statutes or any publication other than the Swedish Code of Statutes. This will enable greater consistency and clarity in the publication of the authentic text of an act or ordinance.</p>
<p>If a statute becomes difficult to understand as a result of amendments, it should be possible – as in the current system – for it to be incorporated in its entirety into the Swedish Code of Statutes by means of a ‘reprint’. However, it should only be possible to do this in connection with an amendment to a statute, and hence only following a decision by the Government. The version of a statute that is incorporated in its entirety into the Swedish Code of Statutes by means of a reprint is to be regarded as authentic.</p>
<p>The electronic system</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Director-General for Legal Affairs at the Ministry of Justice have the overall responsibility for the Swedish Code of Statutes and for taking decisions on certain issues concerning the Code.</p>
<p>The Swedish Code of Statutes is to be electronically published on a special website that is updated with new data once every Monday–Friday, excluding public holidays.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Government Offices have a particular responsibility for the security of the system and the website used to electronically publish the Swedish Code of Statutes.</p>
<p>Costs and implementation</p>
<p>The costs that would arise as a result of this proposal should preferably be financed within the existing financial framework; otherwise they can be financed within the regular budget process. In the long term, it can be expected that the proposal will lead to the more efficient use of resources and cost savings for central government.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the new regulations enter into force on 1 January 2011. They will apply to acts and ordinances published after that date, and to provisions incorporated into the Swedish Code of Statutes in connection with publication (reprint). In the Inquiry’s assessment, it is not possible – for reasons of principle and practicality – to allow the new regulations to apply retroactively, and regulations that previously applied for publication will therefore continue to apply for statutes published under the current system.</p>
