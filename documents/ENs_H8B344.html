<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Chapter 2 of the Instrument of Government, which is part of the Swedish Constitution, regulates the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. This protection, which varies in degree and form, applies in relation to public authorities.</p>
<p>There is no specific legal regulation concerning the right to compensation for violations of Chapter 2 of the Constitution (‘constitutional damages’). The basic premise in Swedish law is that a right to compensation for non-pecuniary or non-material damage requires a specific legal basis. However, the Tort Liability Act includes possibilities for an injured party to receive compensation for material damage caused by error or negligence in the exercise of public authority.</p>
<p>The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms also offers protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. In certain circumstances, violations of the Convention can lead to damages. Since 1 April 2018, the Tort Liability Act has contained a provision on damages of this kind (Chapter 3, Section 4, ‘convention damages’).</p>
<p>The Committee of Inquiry was tasked with considering whether the right to compensation from public authorities for damage caused by violations of Chapter 2 of the Constitution should be expanded. Irrespective of its conclusions in this respect, the Committee’s remit also included considering whether it is appropriate and desirable for the right to compensation to be regulated in law.</p>
<p>The Committee’s remit stems from the judgment of the Supreme Court in the ‘Citizenship I’ case. In that case, the Court concluded that despite the lack of an explicit legal basis, the State was liable to pay compensation for non-material damage due to a de-registration of Swedish citizenship in contravention of the Constitution. The legal case in question does not give a clear picture of which of the fundamental rights and freedoms in the Constitution can potentially be successfully cited in a damages case.</p>
<h2>Constitutional damages should be regulated in law</h2>
<p>The protection of rights has been strengthened both in Sweden and in other countries in recent years. There has been a transition to a more rights-based legal order, primarily on the basis of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p>The provision on convention damages and the ‘Citizenship I’ case highlight the fact that when it comes to damages, there is currently far greater uncertainty surrounding the possibility for individuals to assert the protection of their rights under Chapter 2 of the Constitution than the largely equivalent protection under the European Convention.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s assessment, there is good reason to question why the protection of rights and freedoms under the Constitution is thus inferior to, and less clear than, the protection under the European Convention. The protection should be at least as strong.</p>
<p>For this reason, there is a need to clarify the legal situation with respect to constitutional damages. A clarification of this kind would have a positive effect on the protection of the rights of individuals. This applies in particular to non-material damage, which is of crucial importance in many rights violations.</p>
<p>From points of view other than the possibility for individuals to receive compensation for rights violations, too, it is questionable whether the differences in the possibilities to legally assert the rights and freedoms listed in the Constitution and the European Convention are warranted. This is particularly true from a constitutional perspective. The Constitution is the fundamental law that constitutes the foundation of democracy and the form of government in Sweden. Fundamental rights and freedoms have a central place in it.</p>
<p>It is therefore important that the Constitution does not appear to be of less practical use to citizens than the European Convention. A provision on constitutional damages would have the effect of elevating the Constitution in the application of the law and making it clearer in relation to the Convention. This will strengthen the legitimacy and democratic basis of the legal order.</p>
<p>An approach of this kind also tallies with one of the main ideas behind the European Convention, namely that violations of rights and freedoms should preferably be handled within the framework of the national judicial system.</p>
<p>If no legal regulation is introduced, the legislator will continue to give the courts a prominent role in determining the situations in which an individual will be able to obtain constitutional damages. Given that the number of damages cases in which rights violations are cited as grounds for liability is relatively low, and that the proceedings often require considerable resources of the parties, it will in all likelihood take a long time before the legal situation can be said to be clear and predictable.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s view, legislation will better fulfil the requirements of efficiency and predictability. A legal regulation will show individuals that there is a possibility of having the question of a violation of Chapter 2 of the Constitution examined within damages proceedings, and that they may be entitled to damages if a violation is established. It will make it easier to determine whether there are grounds to take measures against public authorities when a violation is perceived.</p>
<p>The Committee also considers that it is generally unsatisfactory that a question as important as public authorities’ liability for compensation when rights and freedoms in the Constitution are violated should be developed without the legislator having considered the matter and provided guidance to the courts. A legal regulation would appear to be the best way to achieve an effective order in a broad and complex legal area.</p>
<p>In light of the possibilities for compensation from public authorities for rights violations already offered to individuals by the Tort Liability Act and other legislation, a provision on constitutional damages would probably not, in reality, broaden the protection of rights to any particularly significant extent. Nevertheless, as previously mentioned, such a provision may help invigorate the protection of rights and ensure that it achieves the intended reach. There is considerable value in ensuring that the Constitution contains a dynamic catalogue of rights that is of practical use to citizens.</p>
<p>In view of this, the Committee considers that the possibility of constitutional damages should be regulated in law. The regulation can be designed to allow the legal situation to remain dynamic.</p>
<h2>How a legal regulation should be designed</h2>
<p>A provision with the primary purpose of clarifying the legal situation with respect to constitutional damages, and thus strengthening the protection of individuals’ rights and freedoms, should be introduced into the Tort Liability Act.</p>
<p>One overall objective should be that the provision will be part of a clear and transparent tort law system that offers the conditions for legal certainty in its application. The provision on convention damages and the case-law of the Supreme Court should serve as guides. The provision should also be defensible from a public finance standpoint.</p>
<p>In the same way as for convention damages, the fundamental delineation of the scope of application of constitutional damages will be made by assessing whether or not a right or freedom has been violated. The question of whether a decision or other measure or a piece of legislation constitutes a violation must be determined based on an overall assessment of the specific situation. This assessment should be made taking account of legal cases, statements in legislative history and general legal principles, but also of how the corresponding right or freedom is handled in convention law and EU law. Not every error by a public authority or court that is linked to a right or freedom constitutes a violation of that right or freedom.</p>
<p>In the case of convention damages, a ‘requirement of necessity’ is applied when determining liability. This requirement, whose design is based on Sweden’s international law obligations, means that damages should only be paid to the extent that this is necessary to compensate for a violation.</p>
<p>As well as the condition that there must have been a violation of one of the fundamental rights and freedoms in Chapter 2 of the Constitution, in the Committee’s view a regulation on constitutional damages should contain a corresponding delineation of liability. Situations in which for some reason it appears less reasonable that public authorities should be liable should not be covered. Certain violations – typically less serious ones – should not be compensated through damages. The conditions for constitutional damages should be determined following an overall assessment.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s view, it would be appropriate to prescribe that constitutional damages be paid to the extent that this is needed in order to compensate the injured party for the violation. In the examination, particular consideration should be given to what other possibilities are, or have been, available to the injured party for other indemnification and for rectification or remedy.</p>
<p>This requirement of need is intended to ensure that courts will, in practice, undertake the same deliberations as when applying the requirement of necessity with regard to convention damages. It involves balancing different interests in the same way, for example taking account of whether the injured party has received compensation for the violation in some other way than through damages, e.g. through a reduced sentence. Furthermore, account must be taken of whether the injured party has done what could reasonably be expected of them to address a violation, e.g. by appealing an incorrect decision.</p>
<p>A provision that is structured in this way will create good conditions for a flexible application of the law that, with a high level of legal certainty, takes account of the possibilities to prevent or remedy violations of the Constitution through substantive and procedural provisions in the existing regulatory system.</p>
<p>A provision on constitutional damages should be inserted into the existing section on convention damages, thus broadening its scope of application. Apart from the requirement of need, the regulatory framework can be drafted in the same way, for example with regard to the calculation of damages.</p>
<p>It should be possible for the new provision to enter into force on 1 January 2022.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>The proposed legislation will make it clearer for individuals that they are entitled to insist that public authorities protect and uphold the fundamental rights and freedoms contained in Chapter 2 of the Con- stitution. In the longer term, this should lead to strengthened pro-</p>
<p>tection of rights. Moreover, courts, law enforcement agencies and others will have a cohesive tort law framework to follow.</p>
<p>The Committee concludes that the proposals will not lead to increased costs for public authorities. Only a negligible increase in the number of legal disputes before the general courts linked to rights violations is expected.</p>
