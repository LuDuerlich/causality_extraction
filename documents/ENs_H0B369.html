<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit of the Inquiry</h2>
<p>Under its terms of reference, the Inquiry’s remit is to analyse and deepen knowledge about the opportunities for recently arrived women born abroad and family member immigrants to become established in the labour market. At the same time as a newly arrived individual looks for employment, he or she often needs to build up skills and networks that can provide a sustainable connection with the labour market and community life. The Inquiry therefore aims to strengthen the conditions for more men and women to work or look for work during their first period in Sweden and, as necessary, participate in relevant measures that facilitate participation in the labour force.</p>
<p>The analysis focuses on describing and explaining the differences is participation between men and women, and between those who are granted a residence permit on humanitarian grounds (refugees, persons otherwise in need of protection and their families) and other family member immigrants who are granted residence permits on grounds of family ties. The Inquiry was also instructed to conduct a survey of the parental benefit claims of recently arrived men and women, which was presented in the interim report ‘ Benefit and trap – parental benefit claims by recently arrived immigrants ’ (SOU 2012:9).</p>
<p>Based on the analysis, proposals are to be presented on measures that need to be taken to increase labour force participation and speed up labour market establishment of recently arrived women and family member immigrants. The Inquiry’s analysis and proposed measures are presented in the final report, ‘The right to participate. Recently arrived women and family member immigrants in the labour market’  (SOU 2012:69).</p>
<h2>Recently arrived immigrants’ need of support for labour market establishment not currently satisfied</h2>
<p>Background of recently arrived immigrants</p>
<p>The majority of those who migrated to Sweden in the 2000s were granted residence permits on humanitarian grounds or on grounds of family ties. In 2011, 13 000 people were granted residence permits as refugees or persons otherwise in need of protection, while 32 500 people were granted residence permits as family members. New ties represent about 90 per cent of family member immigration. In these cases, those applying for residence permits have not previously resided permanently together with their sponsor. Just over nine per cent, or some 3 000 people, were family members of a person that had immigrated of humanitarian reasons. Two out of three of the other family member immigrants are women, and one out of three was married to a person born in Sweden. In 2011, family member immigrants primarily came from Asia, while Africa was the dominant region for humanitarian migrants.</p>
<p>Age, educational background and family situation are factors that affect the labour market outcomes of recently arrived immigrants. Most of those who migrate for humanitarian reasons or family member immigrants are young; the average age is just over 30. The level of education varies greatly. Between one in three and one in four have higher education. At the same time, the educational level of at least one in four corresponds to at most compulsory school. Women often have little education, compared with men. A very large percentage among those in need of protection and their family members who have migrated in the last two years have little education; at the time of their migration, over half of them had less than nine years of schooling.</p>
<p>It was unusual for humanitarian migrants and family member immigrants who migrated in 2000 and 2005 to have many children. One or two children was most common, and even after five years in the country, just a few per cent had more than four children.</p>
<p>Labour market establishment is difficult for refugees and family member immigrants – and particularly difficult for women</p>
<p>The opportunities for recently arrived immigrants to begin a new life in Sweden are naturally very different depending on what they bring with them in the form of previous work experience, education and language skills. Some individuals quickly find a first job without having to contact the Swedish Public Employment Service, and learn Swedish without participating in Swedish for Immigrants (SfI) courses. Others have a much more difficult time establishing themselves in the labour market. Refugees and their family members are the group that generally find it the most difficult to gain a foothold in working life. After five years in Sweden, just over 45 per cent of women in need of protection, and 25 per cent of men, have still never had a job. Among family members of persons in need of protection, half of the women and 20 per cent of the men have never worked five years after having migrated.</p>
<p>Other family member immigrants generally find it somewhat easier to establish themselves in the labour market. However, the thresholds for establishment are also relatively high for this group. This applies particularly to the women, of whom one of four has never worked after five years in the country. During the first years in Sweden, some of the other family member immigrants also have difficulty earning a living; some 40 per cent of the men and 20 per cent of the women receive income support the year after migration. Thus the design of Swedish maintenance requirements do not guarantee that a person who migrates on grounds of family ties comes to a person who is able to assist in the introduction process.</p>
<p>Society’s introduction support does not reach other family member immigrants and recently arrived women</p>
<p>To speed up entry into the labour market, humanitarian migrants and their relatives are offered special introduction activities during the first period in Sweden. The intention is for other family member immigrants to receive introduction support within the framework of the general measures offered to all jobseekers. However, the Inquiry’s analysis shows this target group currently makes very little use of this support. Only about one in four unemployed family member immigrants is registered with the Swedish Public</p>
<p>Employment Service during the first years in Sweden. In addition, of those who are registered, less than ten per cent are assigned to an employment preparation activity during the first registration period.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s analysis also shows that recently arrived women, regardless of whether they immigrated for humanitarian reasons or as family member immigrants, are offered less extensive and relevant support compared with recently arrived men. Women register with the Swedish Public Employment Service later than men, they begin their participation in SfI courses later, and even regular studies are begun later than among men. Furthermore, women make less use of employment preparation activities, and there are differences in the types of measures that men and women take part in. Among recently arrived immigrants who have an introduction plan, the proportion of men who take part in vocational training is three times as high as the proportion of women, and stepin jobs are twice as common among men. It is also more common that women who do not have a job also do not participate in qualifying or employment preparation activities. More than one in three women who came to Sweden in 2005 as a family member of a person in need of protection, and one in four who came as other family member immigrants, neither worked, studied nor took part in employment preparation activities after three years in Sweden. The corresponding proportion among men was about 20 per cent.</p>
<h2>Increased labour force participation is important for society, for individuals and for children</h2>
<p>Working life is the hub of the Swedish welfare model. For individuals, work provides the opportunity to earn a living and the power to control one’s own life. For society, a high employment level is a prerequisite for maintaining generous welfare systems for those who, for various reasons, cannot work. Also, from the perspective of integration, work plays a decisive role in the opportunities of recently arrived men and women to enter into Swedish society. Work and opportunities to support oneself and one’s family can also help an individual’s sense of participation and of belonging in the new country grow stronger.</p>
<p>Increasing labour force participation and employment of recently arrived immigrants is also important for strengthening the situation of recently arrived children and young people. It is much more common that children of parents who have migrated to Sweden are economically vulnerable than children whose parents were born in Sweden. In 2011, nearly half of all people in households with children where the parents were born abroad lived in relative poverty – more than 90 000 children under the age of 17 are part of these households, with low income standards and/or income support. People born abroad have particularly low incomes during their first years in Sweden, but parents who have migrated to Sweden also dominate among households with children that have had a low economic standard of living over several consecutive years. Increased employment among people born abroad is a prerequisite for decreasing child poverty.</p>
<p>In addition, children with foreign backgrounds run a higher risk of themselves becoming unemployed than do children with Swedish backgrounds. Greater opportunities for recently arrived immigrants to take part in working and community life reduce the risk of children inheriting their parents’ social exclusion. Participation in knowledge enhancement and employment preparation activities gives recently arrived parents a better foothold in and increased knowledge about society, which improves their opportunities to support their children in school and in social relations. Access to preschool is also important to both children and parents. At preschool, children have the opportunity to learn the language, which can facilitate schooling. Research shows that preschool contributes to increased welfare and social mobility for children from families that are poor or have limited resources.</p>
<h2>Conditions for increased labour force participation</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has analysed factors that affect the extent to which recently arrived men and women look for work and take part in measures that can strengthen their opportunities to find work. Significant factors are that recently arrived men and women want to  and can  work and take part in measures, and whether they have contact with the actors  that can support the recently arrived immigrant’s introduction, such as the Swedish Public Employment Service and the municipality. In addition, these actors must have access  to relevant measures, and match  existing measures in an appropriate manner, based on the needs of the individual.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s overall assessment is that these conditions harbour a number of shortcomings that, together, make it difficult for recently arrived immigrants to obtain relevant support for establishing themselves in working life. Men and women are not offered measures based on their individual needs, cooperation between the actors is deficient, relevant measures for short-term training are lacking and many other family member immigrants are not offered support eventhough their needs are the same as the needs among people who have migrated for humanitarian reasons. Furthermore, the economic incentives to work are contradictory. Both the child-raising allowance for children between the ages of one and three and the opportunity to collect parental benefit for older recently arrived preschool children raise the reservation wage for women without other sources of income and thus create thresholds to the participation of recently arrived mothers in the labour force. Another obstacle is the wait for preschool places and longer interruptions due to care of children, which in particular make women’s participation in the labour force more difficult.</p>
<p>However, since most women who migrate as family members or for humanitarian reasons have one or two children, care of many children cannot be the decisive cause of women’s lower labour force participation. Nor is the target group’s attitude towards work an obstacle. Most women born abroad who are outside the labour force are, in principle, positive to taking on an employment.</p>
<p>Based on the analysis, the Inquiry summarises the following five premises, which form the basis for the Inquiry’s proposals and assessments concerning measures that can increase labour force participation among recently arrived women and family member immigrants.  The individual’s needs are to determine what support is offered</p>
<p>For general measures to be effective, they must be based on the needs of the individual. Furthermore, a broad selection of measures is necessary to meet individual needs.  Early action is key</p>
<p>Recently arrived immigrants who are in need of measures to facilitate their establishment in the labour market should be able to make use of such measures as soon as possible after migration. The Inquiry’s analysis shows that there is a significant correlation between early participation in labour market measures and the likelihood of being employed five years after settlement in the country. A recently arrived woman who is only able to make use of a measure three years after being registered as unemployed with the Swedish Public Employment Service has a 31 per cent lower probability of being employed five years after migration than a recently arrived woman who is offered a measure the same year she is registered.   Introduction period – an investment to enable active participation in working and community life</p>
<p>The first period in Sweden represents an investment period when the recently arrived person, at the same time as he or she looks for work, is to have a chance to build up skills and networks that can lead to a sustainable connection with both the labour market and community life. However, even a temporary job is generally valuable for strengthening both the recently arrived person’s connection with the labour market and continued language and competence building.  Measures and incentives concerning equal terms for men and women</p>
<p>Men and women are to be given equal opportunities to establish themselves in working and community life. Women who migrate as family members risk becoming both economically and socially dependent on their sponsor. Individualised compensation is therefore key, as is ensuring that the offer of participating in measures also reaches women staying at home who, at the time, are being supported by a family member. It is also important that the matching of measures is based on the actual needs of the specific individual rather than on genderstereotyped conceptions of men and women as a group.  Effective,  high-quality measures require cooperation</p>
<p>To ensure a high level of effectiveness and quality in the introduction process, it is important that the actors who are to support the recently arrived immigrant’s introduction cooperate. Cooperation between the Swedish Public Employment Service and municipalities is of particular importance, and the forms of such cooperation must be flexible, depending on the local conditions.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals aim to increase labour force participation among recently arrived women and family member immigrants. They focus on more recently arrived men and women registering as jobseekers at an early stage, more people being offered opportunities early on to take part in measures that can facilitate establishment in working life, and recently arrived immigrants being given access to more relevant measures that to a greater extent meet their individual needs. Overall, the measures contribute to a more effective introduction process, with greater opportunities for recently arrived women, in particular, to take part in the labour force.</p>
<h2>Introduction guarantee for recently arrived family member immigrants</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Public Employment Service establish a new labour market policy programme, an ‘introduction guarantee’. The introduction guarantee will assure recently arrived family member immigrants, who are not covered by the ‘Act on introduction activities for certain recently arrived immigrants’, access to early and parallel measures, and enhanced support from the Swedish Public Employment Service in looking for work. During a maximum of 24 months, participants are to receive support, consisting of employer contacts and coordinated measures, which can facilitate and speed up establishment in working life. The content of the programme is to be designed in cooperation between the Swedish Public Employment Service and the municipality, based on the individual’s need of measures that can strengthen his or her position in the labour market. SfI courses and employment preparation activities are to be included for everyone, and account is to be taken of educational needs through preparatory measures, such as municipal adult education. The general rule is that the activities are to correspond to a full-time programme.</p>
<p>A person participating in the introduction guarantee will receive compensation in the form of activity support or development allowance. Individualised compensation will particularly stimulate women’s participation in the labour force. The majority of family member immigrants are women, which means that the introduction guarantee will help strengthen the opportunities for women, in particular, to enter the labour market more quickly. The Inquiry estimates that between 5 200 and 11 000 people per year are in need of participating in the introduction guarantee.</p>
<h2>Skills enhancement initiatives</h2>
<p>Recently arrived immigrants with little education have a weaker connection with the labour market and lower labour force participation than people with higher education. The labour market for people with little education is shrinking, which further raises the threshold to working life for many recently arrived immigrants. At the same time, eight of ten employment officers state that the Swedish Public Employment Service has poor or very poor access to measures for these people. The Inquiry considers that introduction plans, to a considerably greater extent than at present, should include studies in municipal adult education. The Inquiry proposes measures that strengthen opportunities for recently arrived immigrants to take part in skills enhancement initiatives alongside of employment preparation activities. Since women generally have somewhat shorter educational backgrounds than men, these measures particularly favour the opportunities for recently arrived women to establish themselves in working and community life.  The Swedish Public Employment Service is to be given the right to enter into agreements with a municipality on arranging measures for recently arrived immigrants without the need for this to be preceded by a procurement procedure.  Practical orientation modules in a limited number of subjects are to be added to the SfI syllabus for courses A and B on study level 1 in order to give people with little education basic skills in combination with language studies. An Inquiry will be tasked with developing a proposal for a new syllabus.  Compensation to municipalities that receive refugees is to be raised by SEK 8 000 for adults to enable increased language support by means of mother tongue trainers within SfI to enhance the quality and effectiveness in language training.  Recently arrived immigrants are to be given the opportunity, during a  six-month period, to take part in coordinated educational courses at folk high schools that are to include SfI courses, basic knowledge, and orientational and employment preparation activities.</p>
<h2>Incentives and support for both men and women</h2>
<p>Income support during the first years in the country increase the risk of getting stuck in prolonged dependence on benefits. Women’s labour force participation is particularly sensitive to economic incentives. Both individualised compensation and individually designed work incentives should therefore be sought. Municipalities can encourage increased participation by consistently inviting both the man and the woman in a family to all discussions about the family’s economic situation, and by targeting activation requirements and offers of qualifying measures to both the woman and the man in families that need economic assistance.</p>
<p>The employment officer’s treatment of individuals and matching of measures are coloured by assumptions about women born abroad as a group. A recently arrived woman who is registered with the Swedish Public Employment Service has to wait longer before being assigned to a measure if she has children under the age of six and if she has a husband who was born abroad. There is no corresponding connection when it comes to recently arrived men. The Swedish Public Employment Service should therefore conduct a skills development programme on norms and conceptions linked to gender and ethnicity.</p>
<h2>Stronger incentives and opportunities to participate for recently arrived mothers of young children</h2>
<p>For women, interruptions of both SfI courses and the municipal introduction programme have often been due to childbirth and care of children. In certain cases, the general rule concerning full-time participation can lead to women choosing not to resume their introduction activities. Recently arrived immigrants who begin their time in Sweden by caring for children also risk a protracted and less effective introduction. It is therefore important that stayat-home parents of young children are given opportunities to take part in measures both during and after parental leave.  The Swedish Public Employment Service should in its regulations clarify what actions employment officers should take so that continuity is not lost regarding recently arrived immigrants who interrupt their introduction plan or introduction guarantee to care for children  It should be possible for a recently arrived person with parental benefit, whose level of participation is at least 75 per cent of full time due to care of children, to have their introduction plan extended by at most an additional eight months. The introduction guarantee should also contain a corresponding possibility of extension.  A  two-year pilot project will be conducted within open preschools where recently arrived parents will be given opportunities to learn the language, gain knowledge about the society and plan for the future. The National Agency for Education will be tasked with taking decisions on and allocating funds to various activities.  Parental insurance should be changed so that the opportunities of being granted parental benefit for older preschool children are limited.  Income support should not be granted to families receiving  child-raising allowance that have chosen to refrain from looking for work and taking part in measures for care of children.</p>
<h2>Stronger contact between recently arrived immigrants and actors that can offer support for introduction</h2>
<p>Recently arrived immigrants who are not part of refugee reception are not always reached by the traditional information channels used by the Swedish Public Employment Service and municipalities. In addition, many recently arrived immigrants have limited access to informal contact networks that can provide guidance and information. Better information is necessary if offers of SfI courses and other introduction support are to reach their intended recipients. By means of outreach activities at arenas where recently arrived immigrants are found, such as maternity clinics, child welfare centres and schools, municipalities can to a better extent also come into contact with stay-at-home municipal residents.  Recently arrived immigrants are to receive information about the opportunities regarding support and measures to establish themselves in Swedish working and community life as soon as they learn they have been granted a residence permit. The Swedish Migration Board will be tasked with developing easily comprehensible, printed information.</p>
<h2>Expanded follow-up and analysis</h2>
<p>In order to follow up the extent to which measures supporting the introduction of recently arrived immigrants contribute to strengthening the target group’s active participation in community life, the Inquiry proposes that a research institute be charged with following up these measures every four years. The follow-up is to be based on interview surveys in combination with register information.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that county administrative boards analyse the needs that recently arrived parents have of parental support, and to evaluate the extent to which the parent support programmes conducted by municipalities, county councils and non-profit organisations meet the needs of recently arrived immigrants. Based on this analysis, the county administrative boards are to prepare advice on how parent support programmes for recently arrived parents should be designed.</p>
<h2>Economic impact</h2>
<p>An increased labour supply has a significant net positive effect on public sector finances. In a few years’ time, it is expected that the Inquiry’s proposals will lead to increased employment among recently arrived women and other family member immigrants. The</p>
<p>Inquiry’s estimates also indicate a strong link between taking part in employment preparation activities at an early stage and the likelihood of having a job five years after migration.</p>
<p>It is expected that the introduction guarantee will lead to increased central government expenditure. These costs will depend on how many recently arrived family member immigrants who are job-</p>
<p>seekers are assigned to the programme. The Inquiry estimates that when the programme is fully implemented, the gross costs will amount to between SEK 947 million and SEK 1 977 million per year. After account is taken of the fact that the Swedish Public Employment Service already works with a large share of the introduction guarantee’s target group in other forms, the Inquiry estimates the net cost to be between SEK 435 million and SEK 970 million per year. The Inquiry notes that in the last few years, considerable appropriations have been removed as appropriation savings from expenditure area 14, The labour market and working life , and therefore considers that the increased expenditures fall within the current parameters. It is proposed that the increased compensation to municipalities that receive refugees, persons in need of protection and their family members be financed by means of reprioritisation within expenditure area 13 Integration and gender equality.</p>
<p>As regards municipalities, the Inquiry’s proposals involve reduced expenditures for income support and enhanced financing to meet the need of language support within SfI among municipalities that receive refugees, persons otherwise in need of protection and their family members.</p>
