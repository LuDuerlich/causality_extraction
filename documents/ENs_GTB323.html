<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Swedish Government has appointed a commission, lead by an investigator. In accordance with the given directives, the commission should submit a proposal as to how a tax on waste that is incinerated can be legally formulated. The commission should assess the suitability of introducing a tax of this kind, or whether other economic policy instruments should be recommended instead. The commission should also assess what, if such is to be the case, the appropriate tax level should be, taking into consideration the policy effects that are to be achieved. The economic consequences and environmental impacts of a tax on waste that is incinerated, along with its relationship to energy taxation, are of particular interest. The commission should take the results of previous relevant enquiries into consideration. The development of costs for different forms of waste management and recycling should also be taken into account in the analysis. The commission should also take note of the work that is taking place within the European Commission in developing strategies for recycling, waste management and definition of waste in accordance with the sixth environmental action-programme.</p>
<p>In addition the commission should undertake a review and evaluation of the Waste Tax Act (1999:673). The commission should follow developments within the EU and devote particular attention in its analysis to EC legal prerequisites, in particular the rules on state aid. The commission should analyse the impact that taxation of waste has on different types of waste and different forms of waste management, and the extent to which taxation of waste has contributed to achieving the goals that have been set within waste policy.</p>
<p>The commission’s report on taxation of waste that is incinerated is to be given priority, as represented by this interim report.</p>
<p>The terms of reference comprise policy instruments primarily within the area of waste policy. Even though the interim report covers a relatively well defined issue, the commission is aiming for an overall perspective. It might therefore be necessary in our final report to add some additional perspectives to the proposals that are now being submitted.</p>
<p>Legal formulation of the tax on incinerated waste</p>
<p>Some points of departure</p>
<p>An overarching aim behind a tax on incinerated waste is to increase material recycling. The tax shall therefore be a means to ensure that recycling is utilised when it is deemed to be environmentally motivated in terms of an overall assessment (see the government bill A society with non-toxic and resource-efficient ecocycles</p>
<p>2002/03:117, p. 33). In addition to the overarching aim behind the tax, the commission should also consider the extent to which the tax moves towards compliance with other relevant goals, e.g. energy policy goals (see bill p. 35).</p>
<p>The commission, for which this is an interim report, is required to formulate a tax on incinerated waste, and thereafter to evaluate the suitability of introducing a tax in accordance with the proposed formulation. A natural starting point for the commission has however been to try to achieve a formulation that can, in the final analysis, be deemed a suitable one for introduction, as well as moving towards both increased recycling and towards other relevant political objectives.</p>
<p>The tax’s formulation</p>
<p>Considerations</p>
<p>A natural place to start when formulating a tax on incinerated waste and assessing its suitability, has been to first try to clarify where a tax such as this belongs in the taxation system and if, within the framework of this system, there are any established principles to consider. On the whole, all waste that is incinerated is used for energy recovery, i.e. production of (district-) heating and electricity. In this context, waste is thus one among several types of</p>
<p>energy products on the market. When comparisons are made between other fossil fuels and waste, it can be noted that incinerated waste enjoys a tax subsidy for that part of the waste that is of fossil origin, as other fossil fuels are taxed according to the (1994:1776) Excise Duty on Energy Act (LSE).</p>
<p>The commission has elected to formulate a tax on incinerated waste that accords with a model that the commission is designating the energy taxation model. The term expresses the fact that the tax on incinerated waste is to be achieved through incorporating waste within the framework of existing energy taxation.</p>
<p>The reason for inserting the fossil waste categories into LSE is to focus on waste as a resource and on its energy content. This energy can be utilised for heating purposes and should thus be taxed on the same basis as the fossil fuels that are already taxed in accordance with LSE. There will thus be a neutralisation of the distortion which benefits incineration of waste for heat production which is a consequence of the current energy and carbon dioxide taxation of mineral oils, carbon/coal and natural gas. An alteration such as this will bring about a change in economic relationships and will mean that in some cases it will be profitable to exploit the material resources in waste before its energy resources are finally used. Incineration of waste will thus be more expensive in relation to other methods of waste management.</p>
<p>The current tax exemption for the fossil element of waste involves difficulties, both in the short and somewhat longer term, in achieving the objective of increased material recycling, at the same time as tax exemption for biofuels is undermined in relation to waste-derived fuels. Furthermore, it can be observed that the prevailing tax exemption for waste-derived fuels means that it is of no significance whether the waste is incinerated in a heating plant (hot water boiler) or in a combined heat and power plant. In addition to the inadequate waste policy instruments in the tax system (which is the principal reason for a tax on incineration of waste) there are consequently no energy policy instruments in respect of waste-incineration.</p>
<p>By incorporating waste into energy taxation with the aim of neutralizing the distortion that currently exists in the energy taxation system, which, within the energy and heating sectors, represents a substantial incentive for incineration of waste at the expense of other fuels, of which biofuels are naturally the most important. Indirectly, this also represents a waste policy</p>
<p>instrument, due to the fact that alternative methods of waste management will become relatively cheaper. Taxation such as this consequently provides an incentive for increased material recycling, in particular of plastics and rubber, but probably also for increased material recycling of other waste categories. The energy taxation model also brings about a substantial incentive for combined heat and power production, as production of this kind is subject to considerably lower taxation than hot water production.</p>
<p>As the tax can be well positioned within the framework of the nature and general scheme of the existing energy taxation system, it will be cheaper to administer both in relation to revenues and to its policy effect. In terms of state aid, the supplementing of LSE is deemed to have a good chance of receiving the necessary approval. Against the background of the gravity accorded to competition issues within the Community, this benefit should not be underestimated from an overall cost effectiveness perspective, but quite the reverse, should be given considerable weight in the choice of a legal solution.</p>
<p>Energy taxation of waste which has a fossil origin would facilitate a continued positive development in the area of material recycling, and would simultaneously position Sweden at the frontline when it comes to development and application of policy instruments that contribute to several goals within the areas of both waste and energy policy. In the opinion of the commission, the natural procedural order is to deal with the existing distortion within waste and energy taxation first, before the possible introduction of any further policy instruments.</p>
<p>Suitability of the tax</p>
<p>In terms of the suitability assessment, the commission is entering into the sort of considerations that have partially guided the formulation of the tax model. As mentioned above, the commission must – in addition to the overarching aim of promoting increased material recycling – also consider other relevant goals, e.g. energy policy goals. It is therefore in the nature of the process that the suitability of the model selected must be weighed against all the goals that are judged to be relevant.</p>
<p>In terms of an overall assessment, we can observe that introduction of the energy taxation model – even if to a different</p>
<p>extent - moves towards several relevant goals. It is therefore in line with the development, for example, of the ecocycle strategy that the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency is proposing. Having taken the advantages and disadvantages of the model into account, the commission finds that the advantages of introducing the model outweigh the disadvantages. In terms of this overall assessment it is hard to see that any other policy instrument would be recommended in the place of the energy taxation model. On the other hand, the model might require some form of supplementary instrument in order to achieve a greater fulfilment of objectives within one or more areas. However, this condition does not change the commission’s judgment that the model – in terms of an overall assessment – is an appropriate one to introduce.</p>
<p>The tax’s formulation in closer detail</p>
<p>A tax on incinerated waste is to be achieved by making the fossil carbon element in the waste a fuel that is liable to taxation in accordance with LSE. As such the fuel will be subject to the general rules that are in LSE. In brief, it means the following.</p>
<p>• Energy tax and carbon dioxide tax shall be levied on fuel when it is used for heating purposes.</p>
<p>• The total tax rate for the new taxable fuel will amount to SEK 3,487 (387 €) per tonne in accordance with the following.</p>
<p>- SEK 150 (17 €) per tonne in energy tax, and</p>
<p>- SEK 3,337 (370 €) per tonne in carbon dioxide tax.</p>
<p>• The tax rates indicated are only partially levied for certain applications and within certain sectors. Consumption within combined heat and power production and manufacturing industry, as well as within commercial agriculture, forestry or aquaculture is thus only subject to the 21 percent carbon dioxide tax. No energy tax is levied. Table 1 below shows the actual different tax rates that might be put in place.</p>
<p>• For consumption within manufacturing industry as well as within commercial agriculture, forestry or aquaculture, the industrial tax rate is supplemented by special reduction rules.</p>
<p>Table 1. Tax rates for incineration of fossil waste within different sectors/plants</p>
<p>Other formulations that have been considered for a tax on incinerated waste</p>
<p>During the work of formulating an appropriate legal solution, the commission has tested several different models on the basis of their respective prerequisites. A tax that is completely straightforward (i.e. without any form of exemption) has been deemed to be unrealistic. The model that represents the other real alternative to a tax on waste that is incinerated is instead the model that the commission has designated the waste tax model. The starting-point for the model is the existing Waste Tax Act (1999:673) according to which tax is levied on waste that is deposited. According to this model, the tax will be weight-based and it should, in the opinion of</p>
<p>the commission, be combined with exemptions for certain types of waste. In comparing it with the energy taxation model, the commission has found that it is appropriate to deal first with the distortion that currently exists within the areas of energy/waste, which is why the commission is recommending the introduction of the energy taxation model.</p>
<p>Supplementary economic instruments</p>
<p>If during a subsequent evaluation the proposed alteration is judged to provide insufficient direction towards waste policy goals, that waste shall be managed in accordance with the waste hierarchy, supplementary policy instruments should be considered. An alternative to introducing supplementary measures in the form of a new policy instrument is to adjust the extended producers responsibility that already exists in order to achieve the objectives that have been set via that route.</p>
<p>The commission has discussed a number of different kinds of alternative economic instruments and the forms they might take. It primarily involves the so-called waste charge, recycling certificate and raw material or product taxes. In addition to these policy instruments there is also the possibility, within the framework of the Waste Tax Act (1999:673) of introducing supplementary measures.</p>
<p>Green certificates for waste incineration?</p>
<p>During the commission’s work there have been discussions on whether the renewable portion of the waste should be proposed as a fuel that is entitled to green certificates for electricity. This is a highly relevant question, however it is not accommodated within the restrictive framework of the interim report, as is also made clear by the commission’s directive. The commission intends however to return to this question in conjunction with submission of its final report.</p>
<p>Consequences of the proposals</p>
<p>Environmental consequences</p>
<p>With regard to the scale of the increased material recycling, or more correctly, sorting, it is hard to assess. The commission however estimates that an increase in sorting can amount to about four percent. The proposal represents in this respect a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of about 65,000 tonnes per year, as a result of increased material recycling of plastic.</p>
<p>As hot water production, as a consequence of district heating taxation, is expected to be replaced by combined heat and power production, it is assessed that additional long term reductions in carbon dioxide could, in a global perspective, amount to about one million tonnes per year.</p>
<p>Budgetary consequences</p>
<p>Table 2 below shows an assessment of the budgetary consequences of the commission’s proposals. The calculation of periodized net effects does not take into account effects on tax revenues as a result of increased material recycling. The tax revenues can however be expected to be of at least the size indicated in the table. This is due to the fact that it is based on actual waste statistics for 2003. By the time it comes into effect, the incineration capacity will have increased and consequently the size of the possible tax base as well. This effect is expected to be greater than the reduced tax revenues that are anticipated by the proposal (depending on reduced increase of incineration and increased material recycling along with a change-over to combined heat and power production).</p>
<p>Table 2. Periodized net effects for the public sector 2007–2009 and permanent net effects, millions of Swedish krona (euro)</p>
<p>The additional administrative costs for the Swedish Tax Agency to expand the energy taxation system to include the fossil components of waste can be calculated at about SEK 2 million (221,500 € )  in increased annual operational costs, and about SEK 800,000 (88,600 € )  as an initial investment cost. The calculations are based on the number being liable to tax amounting to a maximum of 100.</p>
<p>Cost increases for households and industry</p>
<p>Costs to households for waste management are estimated to increase by 3.5–26.5 percent. On average this increased cost will be 50–400 kronor (5.50–44.30 € )  for a household in an individual house, and 30–250 kronor (3.30–27.70 € )  for a household in an apartment block.</p>
<p>The increased costs for trade and industry as a result of the tax are significant in those businesses where there are few possibilities for adjustment, and where there are simultaneously large amounts of fossil waste. Even though the overall number of companies that handle large amounts of fossil waste is relatively small, these companies may suffer high costs. It involves a limited number of companies within the chemicals and plastics industries, and also waste paper mills (in particular the two that recycle plastic covered cardboard). In addition there is the so-called plastic reject within the plastic recycling industry. In those cases where the fossil waste is material that is within the extended producers responsibility, it should however be possible to pass on the cost increases. In this context it should be taken into account that the tax will be incorporated into existing legislation that contains certain restrictive rules as protection for businesses that are exposed to competition. As it is an issue concerning the general taxation system, the commission has refrained from proposing that any special rules are introduced into the energy taxation, but have elected to leave the general structure of LSE unchanged.</p>
<p>Entry into force</p>
<p>It should be possible for the changes proposed by the Commission to enter into force on the 1 st  January 2007.</p>
