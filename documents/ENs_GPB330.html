<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The assignment</h2>
<p>The Drunkenness at Sea Commission has been instructed to investigate whether there are reasons for introducing for the whole or parts of shipping a pro mille limit for drunkenness at sea which is not substantial (see Annex ).</p>
<p>According to the guidelines, the commission has also been instructed to analyse certain technical legal issues relating to drunkenness at sea offences and to take a position on whether the expansion of criminal liability for driving under the influence of narcotic substances that came into force on 1 July 1999 should also affect the formulation of the provision on drunkenness at sea. The commission should also examine to what extent the possibilities of detecting and punishing drunkenness at sea can be facilitated and, if this is the case, to make recommendations as to how this can be done.</p>
<p>The assignment furthermore includes:</p>
<p>• analysing whether a stricter view of being under the influence of alcohol than that at present expressed in legislation is justified for certain categories of seafarers,</p>
<p>• analysing whether special provisions on release from liability are required, which are applicable in the case of being under the influence of alcohol at sea,</p>
<p>• analysing in more detail and shedding light on the problems that can occur in the application of the prerequisite “being in charge of a ship” and “carrying out a task of considerable importance for safety at sea” in Chapter 20, section 4, of the Maritime Code (1994:109),</p>
<p>• considering in more detail how the possibilities for checking compliance with any pro mille limit for drunkenness at sea which is not substantial can be facilitated,</p>
<p>• considering whether the Coastguard Authority can assist in monitoring shipping,</p>
<p>• considering whether the police or any other authority, e.g. coastguard officials, should be given the right to take routine alcohol breath tests for persons who are subject to the provisions of the Maritime Code on drunkenness at sea, i.e. those who are in charge of a ship and those who otherwise fulfil a task of considerable importance for safety at sea,</p>
<p>• checking the technical opportunities that exist for carrying out screening or quantitative tests at sea,</p>
<p>• studying legislation and methods for detecting and punishing drunkenness at sea in some comparable countries,</p>
<p>• making recommendations on amendments to the law and other changes that the review can give rise to, and</p>
<p>• making recommendations on how information can be disseminated to ensure that the purpose of the provisions on being under the influence of alcohol are achieved to increase sobriety at sea.</p>
<h2>Present regulations</h2>
<p>According to the present provisions in the Swedish Maritime Code (1994:1009), a person who is in charge of a vessel or is otherwise carrying out a task of considerable importance for safety at sea on a ship and is then so affected by alcoholic beverages or some other substance, that it can be assumed that he cannot carry out what is incumbent on him in a satisfactory way, shall be sentenced for drunkenness at sea  to a fine or imprisonment for at most six months (section 4). If the offence is considered to be grave, he can instead be sentenced for grave drunkenness at sea to imprisonment for at most two years  (section 5). In the assessment of whether the crime is grave, special consideration shall be given inter alia to whether the offender has had a concentration of alcohol which amounts to at least 1.0 pro mille in his blood or 0.50 milligrams per litre in the breath. The limit of 1.0 pro mille for alcohol in the blood or the equivalent in the breath was introduced as late as 1999 as one of the special circumstances to be taken into account if the crime is grave.</p>
<p>The present provisions on drunkenness at sea offences apply not only to those in charge of ships but also to others who carry out tasks of considerable importance for safety at sea. The provisions on criminal liability are applicable to all types of vessels. Swedish courts are – with a few exceptions - competent to judge in the cases where the crime has been committed on Swedish territorial waters.</p>
<h2>The recommendations of the commission</h2>
<p>Pro mille limit for being under the influence of alcohol at sea</p>
<p>The development of maritime traffic has been exceptionally fast in recent years and in many respects it now increasingly resembles traffic on our roads. The number of leisure craft has increased greatly and vessels have also become larger and faster than before. Traffic on our waterways has become more intensive. Boating therefore makes higher demands than previously for swift reactions, good judgment and other important characteristics.</p>
<p>It is a natural starting point for the commission that alcohol and shipping are not compatible and that legislation should communicate this educational message clearly. There is probably broad agreement that alcohol is a risk factor in traffic for accidents and that this risk increases with the increasing concentration of alcohol. Every year, there are fatal accidents on the water where alcohol has been part of the picture. In, for instance, the Stockholm archipelago, the number of suspected cases of serious drunkenness at sea was twice as high in 1999 than in the previous year.</p>
<p>In many places, major educational initiatives were undertaken with regard to issues relating to being under the influence of alcohol at sea and some of the major shipping organisations have agreed recommendations on pro mille limits. The commission views these initiatives very positively although it considers that the measures are not sufficient to deal with being under the influence of alcohol at sea.</p>
<p>A pro mille regulation is justified by it offering considerable procedural advantages in relation to rules that require an assessment of the degree of influence to carry out a task in a particular case. A provision of this kind reduces the problem of evidence and improves opportunities to carry out a more intensive and efficient monitoring of being under the influence in traffic. Special provisions on pro mille limits already exist for other areas of traffic.</p>
<p>The commission recommends that  a pro mille limit be introduced for being under the influence of alcohol at sea . This limit should apply to  all kinds of vessels but not to all kinds of waters. The commission recommends that the pro mille limit is restricted to the waters where the similarities with road traffic are most obvious and the element of danger more explicit, i.e.  canals, locks, waterways and public harbours .</p>
<p>It is proposed that the pro mille rule only apply to those who are in charge of the ship.</p>
<p>The commission takes the view that the pro mille limit should be set at the same level that applies to road and rail traffic, i.e. 0.2 pro mille in the blood and 0.10 milligram per litre in breath.</p>
<p>The commission considers that expansion of criminal liability in the areas of road traffic, a so-called zero limit for drugs has been in force for too short a period for the commission to make an assessment of whether the same or similar rules should be introduced at sea. The commission has therefore not made any proposals in this part.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the regulations come into force on 1 January 2002.</p>
<p>Routine alcohol breath tests at sea</p>
<p>Now that the commission is proposing a pro mille limit for being under the influence of alcohol at sea, at the same level as applies to other areas of traffic, it seems almost self-evident to also propose that it be made possible to carry out routine checks at sea. This opportunity is limited to the same areas of water as apply to the proposed pro mille limit i.e. canals, locks, waterways, and public harbours. Taking into consideration inter alia the rules in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, foreign ships in Swedish territorial waters are exempted from the proposed regulation.</p>
<p>The commission proposes that the authority to carry out routine alcohol breath tests at sea shall not only be given to police but also to coastguard officials. It is also proposed that these officials should have the right to carry out tests on those who are reasonably suspected of offences referred to in Chapter 20, sections 4 and 5 of the Swedish Maritime Code (1994:1009).</p>
<p>Dispersion of information on applicable regulations on being under the influence of alcohol</p>
<p>The commission considers that the Swedish Sea Safety Council, private boating organisations, and the shipping employers’ organisations and trade unions, are suitable channels for communicating information on the applicable regulations on being under the influence of alcohol in the field of shipping. The commission further considers that it is very important for the impact of the provisions that these organisations continue the work that is already taking place today.</p>
<p>Other issues</p>
<p>In the view of the commission, it is important that the issues on compulsory liability insurance and compulsory leisure craft register that have been initiated in the Government Office be further investigated without delay. A regulation of these issues would in the view of the commission probably further contribute to ensuring that the purpose of the rules on sobriety at sea was achieved.</p>
<p>Costs</p>
<p>The proposals of the commission do not entail any significant increases in costs for the state. The costs that arise as a result of the proposal are the costs for the alcohol breath test instruments that the Coastguard authority must acquire. However, according to available information, these costs are marginal and can be met – according to the representatives of the Coastguards – within the existing budget limits.</p>
