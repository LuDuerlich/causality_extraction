<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The state of the marine environment</h2>
<p>For decades, our oceans and seas have been seriously affected by emissions of nutrients and toxic substances both from land and from air. Furthermore, the marine ecosystems risk being disturbed by the over-extraction of fish. According to scientists, completely different species than previously may start to dominate marine ecosystems. Stickleback are replacing young plaice on the west coast, sprat is replacing cod in the Baltic and our bays and beaches are being invaded by fine-threaded algae. Blue-green algae is replacing diatom in plankton blooms and the European population of longtailed duck is threatened by oil discharges in the Baltic. We are far from knowing the true extent of damages caused by over-fishing, eutrophication, emissions of toxic substances and oil. Nevertheless, the Commission on the Marine Environment appointed by the Swedish government, can ascertain that substandard shipping, insufficiently regulated fisheries, hazardous emissions and eutrophication are having and will continue to have such a negative impact on marine ecosystems that their ability to provide goods and services is dramatically being undermined. In addition, climate change may further impact the conditions for healthy ecosystems.</p>
<p>Essentially, the state of the Baltic and the North Sea has not improved over the last 15 years despite the numerous measures implemented. Some examples of successful environmental protection can be found, however. When widespread damage to seals and white-tailed eagles was discovered in the 1960s, the use of PCB and DDT was banned or limited at the beginning of the 1970s. As a result of the measures, the occurrence of these substances in the marine environment decreased considerably. The white-tailed eagle has now returned to our archipelagoes and the grey seal population is improving.</p>
<p>After decades of bathing restrictions, people can again swim in the sea and enjoy the sandy beaches along the coast of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and the former DDR. A large number of point sources have been rectified within the framework of the Joint Comprehensive Programme, initiated by the Heads of State and Government in 1990. This programme aims to address the most significant point sources of pollution and is seen as one of the successes of international environmental protection.</p>
<p>But the way in which marine environment protection currently is being conducted suggests that the state of our seas will either remain unchanged or deteriorate further in the next decade or two. Shipping is expanding rapidly in the Baltic Sea. Oil exports from Russian and Baltic ports has risen substantially over the last few years, which increases the risk of accidents. Ships are also increasing in size. A serious problem as regards oil transportation is the occurrence of substandard vessels, which, in combination with insufficient maintenance, substantially increases the risk of accidents. Accidents often occurr due to a combination of factors, such as a substandard vessel that has a crew lacking the necessary skills or training. Many ports and harbours still lack facilities for forcing vessels to deposit oil and other waste while in port. Up to one thousand illegal discharges of oil waste are thought to occur every year when vessels flush out their oil tanks, clean their machinery and empty unfiltered water into the Baltic.</p>
<p>Numbers of demersal (bottom-dwelling) fish have radically decreased over the last 25 years. For many demersal fish species, the number of sexually mature individuals at the end of the 1990s was only a tenth of what it was at the beginning of the 1970s. For certain species, such as cod, the numbers of sexually mature individuals have dwindled even more drastically. These severe reductions risk leading to dramatic changes in marine ecosystems (so-called “flips”) that can make it impossible for cod stocks to recover which, in turn might lead to the disappearance of bladder wrack over large areas. Furthermore, exploratory fishing data indicate almost a complete disappearance of local cod stocks along the Swedish Skagerrak coast. If these stocks were genetically unique, there is a risk that they will not be replaced, should they die out. The amount of cod landed by Swedish fisheries has decreased substantially since the 1980s, whilst sprat, used to produce animal feed, now constitutes a predominant proportion of the total catch. Sprat has benefited from the disappearance of cod and large stocks of sprat hinder cod reproduction by eating up its eggs.</p>
<p>Baltic herring and salmon should not be eaten in large quantities since the levels of toxic substances in them are too high. The amount of toxic substances used in todays society is increasing, which may lead to more dietary restrictions. One example is the use of pharmaceuticals in Sweden which has risen drastically. The amount of active substances in pharmaceuticals sold every year in Sweden is the same as the amount of pesticides used in agriculture. Residues of these active substances are flushed out in the wastewater of households and hospitals and reach the sea via municipal treatment plants.</p>
<p>Eutrophication causes great problems in coastal waters and leads to more extensive algal blooms out at sea. Many bathing areas and beaches along our coast are covered by large amounts of decomposing algae. The depth dispersion of bladder wrack is decreasing as the water becomes more and more clouded with plankton. Shallow sandy bottoms are becoming overgrown with fine-threaded algae, which for example prevents plaice from breeding properly. Oxygen deficiency in the deep waters of the Baltic is threatening the reproduction of cod and the dying seabed extending over large parts of both the Baltic and the North Sea is eradicating demersal species. Large areas covered with fluffy-white hydrogen sulphide bacteria are also a common problem affecting the shallow waters of our archipelagoes in the summer.</p>
<p>In addition, climate change will have an impact on our seas. Rising atmospheric temperature leads to warmer seas which in turn will reduce the ice-caps in the winter and impact populations of grey and ringed seal. Changes in water temperatures and salt content primarily affect the species composition of floral plankton and the risk is that toxin-producing species will become more common if temperatures and precipitation rise. Increased nutrient concentrations and a higher water temperature also promote fast-growing and fine-threaded algae in shallow sea areas.</p>
<p>We are far from achieving our national environmental quality objective for a healthy marine environment.</p>
<h2>Anthropogenic impact</h2>
<p>Our seas and oceans belong to everybody and nobody. At the same time as many people claim the right to use our marine resources, no-one takes ultimate responsibility for what is happening to our seas. Industries which utilise the sea have assumed a right to do so but they do not take on sufficient responsibility for protecting marine ecosystems. There is a lack of comprehensive responsibility both internationally and nationally. Coordination on all levels is found wanting. There is insufficient analysis of the activities of different sectors and their impact on the sea and what analysis there is uncoordinated. The imposition of sector responsibility has not yielded the desired results for the sea; namely a healthy environment and ecological sustainability.</p>
<p>The discord in efforts to improve the marine environment is further exacerbated by poor dialogue and coordination among the various stakeholders, scientists and authorities. Protecting the environment is essentially a matter of altering and stimulating human behaviour, which requires considerable changes to current attitudes.</p>
<p>It is not a lack of appropriate proposals and measures that has put our seas in such a serious state. The problem lies in extensive and systematic shortcomings in implementing proposed measures. If all the measures proposed both nationally and internationally had been implemented and if the precautionary principle had been applied, our marine environment would have been in a considerably better state.</p>
<p>The Commission on the Marine Environment concludes that the environmental state of our surrounding seas is that short-term economic interests, in combination with insufficient understanding of the complexity of marine ecosystems, have been allowed to dictate how the sea is managed. The sea is a victim of the tragedy of the commons.</p>
<p>The Commission on the Marine Environment believes that current methods must undergo a fundamental change. Makeshift repairs to the current system are not enough. Our way of working and addressing the issues has led us to the end of the road. Our current regulatory frameworks do not protect our seas. Our seas must be decoupled from the regulatory frameworks which currently restrict the efforts.</p>
<h2>Sustainable management of the sea</h2>
<p>Ecosystems consist of different components, partly of flora, fauna and other organisms and partly of the surrounding environment. The various organisms in an ecosystem make up a food web, where everything is interconnected and where the different levels influence each other as the result of complex and dynamic relationships. If a critical species decreases in number or disappears, these relationships can break down. The ecosystem can then ”flip” and take on a completely different state. Sustainable management must be based on this perspective and consider the impact of proposed measures in a holistic manner. The Commission on the Marine Environment bases its new management proposals on an ecosystem approach.</p>
<p>The ecosystem approach places more far-reaching demands on protection measures than is the case with the current “sectorised” method. Management must be more adaptive and instructive with clear links between implemented measures, environmental monitoring and research. Management must be based more on the obligations of the sectors and less on their rights. The environmental requirements placed on the sectors must be founded on the limitations of marine ecosystems. The aim is to preserve the structure and function of marine ecosystems and hence maintain their capacity to provide us with goods and services.</p>
<p>Ecosystem-based management would pioneer marine environmental protection. Such an approach has been a matter of course for the European air quality work. In comparison with measures within the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP), the Commission on the Marine Environment has identified a number of areas within regional marine conventions that are lacking. The analysis indicates that the work done to protect the marine environment lacks four essential components: unanimity and collaboration among authorities, the research community, industries and other stakeholders, common effect-based targets for both national and international work, the flexibility to implement cost-effective measures within relevant sectors and establish legally binding agreements at the national level.</p>
<p>Management of the sea within current decision-making structures must change both nationally and internationally. A new form of management must be intersectoral and able to handle complex relationships. Fish and fisheries can for instance not be separated from other marine environmental issues. International decisionmaking structures must be changed to allow relevant coastal states the autonomy to decide how the sea is to be protected.</p>
<p>If we are to reverse the negative trend in our seas, it is absolutely essential that there is international coordination. The Commission on the Marine Environment therefore proposes a new regional management structure, through a regional pilot initiative in the Baltic Sea (including the Kattegat). The Commission sees the Baltic Sea as the ideal area for a new management strategy. The work should be evaluated so that experiences gained can be passed on and benefit other marine areas, e.g. the North Sea (including the Skagerrak).</p>
<h2>Revising the Helsinki Convention</h2>
<p>The aim of using the Baltic Sea (in accordance with the definition of the Helsinki Convention) as an international pilot initiative is to transpose the ecosystem approach into concrete legal principles.</p>
<p>This presupposes a revision of the Helsinki Convention to bring about sustainable use of the seas. A new form of management should be based on biological systems, on an ecosystem approach, and implemented by using a modus operandi that is broadly international, intersectoral and adaptive.</p>
<p>The proposal of the Commission on the Marine Environment means that the Baltic Sea states, as the result of a jointly binding commitment, supported by a strengthened Helsinki Convention, can generate the necessary force to regionally adapt the common European fisheries policy and the relevant environmental components of the agricultural policy to the sensitive environment of the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this the Heads of State need to agree to a joint initiative to reverse the negative trend in our seas.</p>
<p>The Helsinki Convention must develop legally binding decisions and estimation models, which make it possible to evaluate proposals for action strategies established in relation to various set objectives for marine ecosystems. Fisheries and agriculture must be an integral part of the Convention’s remit. A revised Helsinki Convention must also incorporate a mechanism for resolving disputes.</p>
<p>Moreover, a revised Helsinki Convention should divide the Baltic into different zones. Such zoning should consist of a core of areas where no resource extraction is allowed, a large network of areas where some types of resource use is permitted, and other areas where special rules of consideration apply for various activities.</p>
<p>This kind of zoning is similar to what has been applied on land for some considerable time.</p>
<p>The Commission on the Marine Environment also proposes a temporary, time-limited ban of fishing in the Baltic Sea. In order to effectively manae the over extraction of fish, the common European fisheries policy must be implemented within the framework for a revised Helsinki Convention. A total fishing ban should cover all stocks which, currently are outside biologically safe limits. The ban would be lifted only when stocks are once more within biological limits. The sooner such a ban is imposed, the greater chance stocks will have of recovery. The longer such a ban is postponed, the greater the risk is of stocks collapsing and disappearing.</p>
<p>The Commission on the Marine Environment proposes that measures aimed to combat eutrophication are urgently needed. The measures should be based on effect-based criteria, modelled on European air quality initiatives. The system of environmental subsidies which are incorporated in the European agriculture policy should be adjusted so that the Baltic Sea states are given the opportunity to direct support to areas where the greatest benefits for the marine environment can be achived.</p>
<p>The Commission on the Marine Environment proposes a number of minimum requirements for shipping within the framework of a revised Helsinki Convention. These requirements must be developed in partnership with the IMO. The proposed requirements include: only high-quality vessels being allowed to transport hazardous cargo; vessels being classified by a well-reputed classification society and be subject to ”black listing” from previous harbour visits; vessels being equipped with control and tracking devices; shipping lanes and traffic regulations being designed so as to protect especially sensitive areas. It should also be possible to control ballast water discharges so as to avoid the input of alien species. Practical, efficient harbour facilities to dispose of different forms of waste and wastewater should be available. There should be sufficient capacity for coping with and limiting the impact of collisions/shipwrecks.</p>
<p>The Marine Environment Commission feels that a strengthened legal structure is required to come to reverse the negative trends in the Baltic Sea.</p>
<h2>A national marine strategy</h2>
<p>The Commission on the Marine Environment also feels that Sweden as a nation is in a position to unilaterally implement a number of measures and proposes the establishment of a national marine strategy. The strategy must overcome the disarray that currently characterises marine environment efforts. The national environmental quality objectives for A balanced marine environment, sustainable coastal areas and archipelagoes, A  non-toxic  environment  and Zero eutrophication  should therefore be supplemented and elaborated further.</p>
<p>The proposal from the Commission on the Marine Environment for measures within the framework of a national marine strategy are:</p>
<p>• The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (Swedish EPA) shall be given the overall responsibility for the marine environment.</p>
<p>• The Swedish EPA shall be charged with the task of drafting a plan for Sweden’s marine environment, in partnership with relevant actors.</p>
<p>• Use of the sea shall be regulated by zoning with different forms of resource use being allowed in the various zones.</p>
<p>• The effects of measures taken shall be evaluated and the knowledge used to employ adaptive management able to suit each catchment area, coastal zone and sea basin.</p>
<p>• Active participation and changes in attitude shall be stimulated by information initiatives.</p>
<p>According to Commission on the Marine Environment, the measures that can be taken immediately pending the implementation of more extensive measures mentioned above are as follows:</p>
<p>• As a first step to zoning the Commission on the Marine Environment supports the proposal to extend the trawling limit.</p>
<p>• Pending the availability of complete documentation for a planning scheme, the Commission on the Marine Environment proposes that at least four areas in both the Baltic Sea (excluding the Kattegat) and the North Sea (including the Skagerrak and the Kattegat), two coastal areas and two  deep-sea areas shall be established with fishing bans.</p>
<p>• All shipping shall be moved south and east of Hoburg’s Bank.</p>
<p>• The Swedish EPA shall develop a first draft for the planning of the marine environment using existing knowledge.</p>
<p>The Commission on the Marine Environment has had the help of four working groups made up of experts within the fields of shipping, fisheries, chemicals and eutrophication. Each of these groups has carried out extensive analyses of the situation, reviewed current lists of measures and proposed additional action. Based on their findings, the Commission on the Marine Environment proposes more precise details, interim targets and measures to supplement the initiatives already being implemented to achieve the environmental quality objectives.</p>
<h2>Shipping</h2>
<p>The Commission on the Marine Environment proposes that the following details be added to the environmental quality objective A balanced marine environment, sustainable coastal areas and archipelagoes . 1. No  sub-standard vessels shall operate in our surrounding seas. 2. The most valuable areas shall be protected from the negative impact of shipping. 3. Rescue contingency plans shall be guaranteed.</p>
<p>The Commission on the Marine Environment proposes supplementary measures for shipping:</p>
<p>• The charterer should assume greater responsibility for his choice of transport.</p>
<p>• Measures to facilitate quality shipping shall be taken.</p>
<p>• All shipping traffic shall be diverted away from the most valuable areas.</p>
<p>• Rescue contingency plans shall be strengthened regarding the capability of rescue services to carry out emergency towing, emergency lighterage and fire extinguishing at sea.</p>
<h2>Fisheries</h2>
<p>The Commission on the Marine Environment also proposes national measures for fisheries. The overarching perspective is that fish should be managed as part of the ecosystem. The precautionary principle shall also be applied. Commission on the Marine Environment proposes a revision of interim targets 4 and 5 of the environmental quality objective A balanced marine environment, sustainable coastal areas and archipelagoes . 1. Annual  by-catches of marine mammals shall be less than 1 per cent of the population of each species no later than 2010. Bycatches of seabirds, unwanted fish species and young fish shall not have a negative impact on populations nor on the ecosystem. 2. By 2010, the percentage of fish caught by fisheries shall not exceed what is needed to maintain the natural role of fish in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The Marine Environment Commission proposes the following supplementary measures:</p>
<p>• The prerequisites for enacting a fish conservation law shall be examined.</p>
<p>• The proportion of fish stocks caught shall be reduced and extraction shall be based on biological grounds.</p>
<p>• Catch restrictions shall be established for all species and stocks.</p>
<p>• The size of the catch shall be adapted to the available resource.</p>
<p>• Selective and considerate fishing methods and gear shall be developed and employed.</p>
<p>• Consultation groups shall be set up to reduce  by-catches.</p>
<p>• An institute for fishing technology shall be established.</p>
<p>• Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) shall be introduced for exploratory fishing and when testing fishing methods the Best Available Technology (BAT) principle shall be applied.</p>
<p>• Training initiatives for professional fishermen and research in fish and fish ecology shall be established.</p>
<p>• More and broader scientific advice shall be provided to ICES.</p>
<p>• An  eco-labelling system for fish shall be developed and applied.</p>
<h2>Chemicals</h2>
<p>Amendments to the environmental quality objective A  non-toxic  environment  should also be made. 1. All fish caught in Swedish seas shall be suitable for human consumption. 2. The impact of toxic substances on the marine ecosystem shall be negligible.</p>
<p>Necessary measures include:</p>
<p>• Sources of toxic substances which lead to current dietary restrictions shall be identified and adressed as far as possible.</p>
<p>• The input of toxic substances caused by combustion shall be reduced to harmless levels.</p>
<p>• Environmental monitoring shall be able to predict risks before damage occurs.</p>
<p>• Environmental monitoring activities shall be linked to the need for measures.</p>
<p>• The capacity of municipal wastewater treatment plants to treat new substances shall be guaranteed.</p>
<p>• An information requirement for chemical substances shall be introduced.</p>
<h2>Eutrophication</h2>
<p>Eutrophication represents one of the largest problems in Baltic Sea and the North Sea. The Commission on the Marine Environment has ascertained that achieving the environmental quality objective Zero eutrophication  will necessitate a reduction in nitrogen emissions to the level they were in the 1940s. According to the Commission on the Marine Environment calculations, this is equivalent to 40 000 tonnes of nitrogen emissions each year.</p>
<p>The Marine Environment Commission proposes supplementary measures be added to the Zero eutrophication  objective: 1. The cultivation of  follow-up crops (catch crops) shall be set at a permanent level of 100 000 hectares. 2. The area of arable land tilled in the spring instead of in the autumn shall be set at a permanent level of 100 000 hectares. 3. The supply of nitrogen during cultivation shall not exceed the crops’ need. 4. The spreading of liquid fertiliser from animals in the autumn for  autumn-sown seed shall be reduced. 5. Permanent fallow land shall be introduced. 6. 12 000 hectares of wetlands shall be constructed. 7. Farmers shall be required to take part in compulsory environmental studies. 8. An inquiry into the geographical distribution of farm animals shall be conducted. 9. Further nitrogen removal shall be implemented in some treatment plants. 10. Private wastewater facilities shall be improved.</p>
<p>Environmental monitoring must be better coordinated both with research and with the evaluation of various action strategies.</p>
