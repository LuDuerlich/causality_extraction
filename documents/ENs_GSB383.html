<p>The assignment</p>
<p>The assignment of the Inquiry on the Act concerning Support and Service for Persons with Certain Functional Impairments and assistive devices is to analyse certain issues relating to assistive devices and submit proposals for measures in this area. The Inquiry’s assignment covers the following five aspects of the assistive devices area:</p>
<p>• the fee system for assistive devices</p>
<p>• the changed circumstances in the field of assistive devices arising from developments in information and communications technology and digital technology</p>
<p>• the provision of assistive devices in education</p>
<p>• the system for vocational assistive devices, and</p>
<p>• the distinction between individual assistive devices and vocational assistive devices for use by personal assistants.</p>
<p>Points of departure</p>
<p>A starting point for the Inquiry is provided by the objectives of the national action plan for disability policy (Government Bill 1999/2000:79) and the national objectives of Sweden’s policy for the elderly (Government Bill 1997/98:113). The objectives of disability policy that are particularly central in the context of assistive devices are equality of living conditions and full participation. The objectives of elderly policy include ensuring that the elderly can grow old in security and with their independence intact, lead an active life and take part in decisions affecting the community as a whole as well as their everyday lives.</p>
<p>To achieve these objectives, society must be accessible to everyone. This applies as much to the physical environment as to information and services. General adaptive measures do not always suffice; supplementary measures are required in the form of special services and individual assistive devices.</p>
<p>Background: users and assistive device services</p>
<p>It is estimated that more than one million people in Sweden have one or more permanent disabilities. About ten per cent of the population is estimated to use assistive devices, many users being elderly people. Various disabilities, such as visual impairments, hearing impairments or deafness, restricted mobility or cognitive impairments may limit the individual’s opportunities for activity and participation. An accessible environment and appropriate assistive devices allow people with disabilities to enjoy a better quality of everyday life and improve the conditions for their participation in education, work and leisure time.</p>
<p>People with disabilities generally obtain their assistive devices through the health and medical care system or in the workplace. Assistive devices are largely provided by the county councils and municipalities in accordance with the Health and Medical Services Act. Under the Act, the local authorities are responsible for providing assistive devices for daily life and for care and treatment, and personal assistive devices for use in education and training. Vocational assistive devices for people with reduced working capacity are the responsibility of social insurance offices and employment offices.</p>
<p>Assistive devices according to need</p>
<p>The Inquiry is required, in the various tasks it has been assigned, to take a position on issues relating to how the health authorities assess a user’s need for personal assistive devices. These issues include, for example, why it is difficult for groups of people with certain disabilities to obtain assistive devices, why certain types of assistive devices are not prescribed and whether a user studying away from home is entitled to more than one personal assistive device of the same type.</p>
<p>It is unreasonable that a person needing an assistive device is not provided with one simply because of a lack of resources. Such an approach may mean that it is the time at which a need arises that will determine who receives an assistive device, rather than an assessment of whose need is greatest. In a situation where resources are scarce, priority must be given to the person who has been found to have the greatest need. If a need cannot immediately be met due to a lack of resources, a person whose needs have been assessed should be entitled to an assistive device at a later stage and not simply be denied it.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the need for personal assistive devices arises, the patient or user has the right to have his or her need for assistive devices assessed on the basis of his or her own individual circumstances. No one can be denied a needs assessment on the basis of type of disability or diagnosis or the type of assistive device that may be required. The Inquiry therefore proposes that every patient or user that turns to the health and medical services to obtain a personal assistive device must be given an opportunity to have their needs for an assistive device assessed, unless this is obviously unnecessary.</p>
<p>Fees for assistive devices</p>
<p>The disability policy action plan states that people with disabilities are citizens with rights and responsibilities. One of the preconditions to enable these people to exercise their rights and fulfil their responsibilities can be access to appropriate assistive devices. In addition to the positive effects for the people in question and the value to society of having all its citizens participate in the life of society on as equal terms as possible, assistive devices can lead to economic savings. This is because the use of assistive devices can reduce the costs of health care, support and medicines.</p>
<p>People with disabilities, even those with a normal income, risk having inadequate cash margins and experiencing difficulty in meeting day-to-day expenses. This can make it difficult for them to pay high fees for assistive devices. In some parts of the country, people may have to pay about SEK 7 000 for hearing aids for both ears, some may have to pay over SEK 1 000 a year for an electric wheelchair, and some pay SEK 2 400 a year for two years for a computer. Meanwhile, other people are offered assistive devices at</p>
<p>a low cost or free of charge. This present situation, in which conditions differ and some people are paying high costs because of where they live, which assistive devices they need or which disability they have, calls for general regulation of the fees that the health services can charge in connection with the provision of assistive devices. Otherwise, there is a danger that the objective of health and medical care on equal terms will be undermined and that people with disabilities will simply not be able to afford the assistive devices they need. The factor determining whether users are able to obtain assistive devices must be their need and not their personal financial circumstances. Any other criteria would conflict with the goals of national disability policy and the UN Standard Rules, which the national action plan is based on.</p>
<p>The responsibility of the health authorities to provide assistive devices includes both financing and providing devices, and testing – or modifying – them. As providing assistive devices involves more than simply delivering a product, there are strong arguments in support of fees being charged as health care charges payable per health care visit, just like fees for other types of care and treatment in the health care system. This means the fee would be the same for everyone in need of assistive devices regardless of the type of device they need.</p>
<p>Under the Inquiry’s proposal, county councils or municipalities will not be allowed to charge a fee for providing assistive devices other than as a fee for a health care visit in connection with assistive device prescription, testing and modification or training.</p>
<p>Even if the health authorities’ charges for assistive devices are restricted to fees for health care visits, a person who needs to make many visits for testing or training can be faced with high costs. The fee for a health care visit itself is not necessarily low. There is good reason, therefore, to discuss whether these fees should be included in some form of high-cost protection scheme. The disadvantages of a high-cost protection scheme that only includes fees for assistive devices provided by both municipalities and county councils are so great, however, that such a scheme should not be introduced at present. The Inquiry therefore proposes that only the fees paid to county councils for visits in conjunction with prescription, testing, modification of or training in the use of assistive devices should be covered by the provision in Section 26 of the Health and Medical Services Act (the high-cost protection provision for out-patient</p>
<p>care). According to the proposal, this should be financed by raising the cost ceiling from SEK 900 to SEK 1 000.</p>
<p>Fees paid to municipalities for visits in conjunction with prescription, testing, modification of or training in the use of assistive devices will not be covered by a cost ceiling or any other form of high-cost protection. The fees charged by municipalities are low at present and there is no reason to assume that the proposal will mean higher municipal fees for assistive devices.</p>
<p>Assistive devices for users or personal assistants</p>
<p>A problem of definition exists in distinguishing between vocational assistive devices for personal assistants to be provided by the employer and personal assistive devices to be provided to users by the health authorities. This problem often results in long processing times and, in some cases, to people receiving compensation under the Assistance Compensation Act not being given the personal assistive devices they need. The Health and Medical Services Act therefore needs to be clarified.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes an amendment of the Act to clarify the responsibility of county councils for personal assistive devices needed in daily life to enable individuals to satisfy their basic personal needs on their own or with someone else’s help.</p>
<p>Assistive devices in education</p>
<p>The terms of reference relating to the area of education concern two main issues. The first concerns who should be responsible for supplying personal assistive devices in forms of education where no entity is or considers itself responsible for providing these devices. This is an issue to varying degrees for pupils and students with disabilities in preschool, pre-school classes, folk high schools and special needs schools, advanced vocational training and supplementary education that entitles students to government grants or study support.</p>
<p>The second issue concerns where the boundary should lie between the responsibility of the health authorities for providing personal assistive devices and the responsibility of schools or edu-</p>
<p>cation authorities for providing educational assistive devices or equipment (basic equipment).</p>
<p>From the point of view of the users, i.e., children, pupils, students or course participants, it is obvious that they should be entitled to the personal assistive devices they need in an educational context regardless of the form of education that they choose or are eligible for. It should be clear where to turn for the personal assistive devices that are required. Any lack of clarity may result in discussion about whether an assistive device should be provided. There is a risk that it will then take a long time to receive an assistive device and, in the worst case, that the necessary device will not be provided. In the school and education context, a single entity should be responsible for providing personal assistive devices to people with disabilities. In most forms of education, the health authorities are already providing assistive devices to people with disabilities. It therefore seems most appropriate to establish that this responsibility also includes people in other forms of publicly financed education and programmes that entitle students to study support. This responsibility does not entail any limitation of the responsibility that any other party may bear under an act or ordinance. The responsibility of health authorities to provide personal assistive devices does not extend to equipment and educational assistive devices. Products that are required in order to meet the needs of more than a single student and that do not require any very extensive individual modification are to be regarded as equipment.</p>
<p>Educational assistive devices that are the responsibility of school or education authorities and personal assistive devices that are the responsibility of health authorities are characterised in schools for young people (forms of school up to and including upper secondary school) by the following.</p>
<p>Educational assistive devices are characterised by the fact that</p>
<p>• they are chiefly vehicles for knowledge, or</p>
<p>• they can be used by more than one pupil, or</p>
<p>• they do not require extensive individual modification, or</p>
<p>• they can be modified for other users without much difficulty.</p>
<p>Personal assistive devices are characterised by the fact that</p>
<p>• they are chiefly compensatory in function, and</p>
<p>• they have been tested and specially modified for the user, or</p>
<p>• they cannot be used by another person without substantial measures, or</p>
<p>• they cannot be used, now or in future, by another person.</p>
<p>The conditions for defining the limits of the responsibility of health authorities to provide personal assistive devices to people with disabilities in forms of education intended for adults differ from the conditions applying in schools for young people. When responsibility does not rest with the health authority, this may mean that the individual will need to purchase an assistive device personally. In that case, there is no reason to take into account whether or not an assistive device can be used by more than one person. The responsibility of the health authority to provide personal assistive devices for use in education should therefore include assistive devices that compensate for disabilities. With regard to assistive devices that can be both compensatory and vehicles of knowledge, the health authority is responsible for those devices that chiefly have a compensatory function for the individual.</p>
<p>Assistive devices in working life</p>
<p>The Inquiry is instructed in its terms of reference to review the present system for assistive devices in working life (vocational assistive devices), paying attention to the division of responsibilities and coordination between the authorities concerned. In addition, the Inquiry is to survey the procurement and ownership of such devices. The point of departure for this review is to make it easier for people with disabilities to enter the labour market and to keep a place in it.</p>
<p>It is the employers, the Swedish National Labour Market Administration and the social insurance offices that are responsible for ensuring that an employee or a person seeking work has the vocational assistive devices he or she needs. The responsibility of employers is laid down in the Work Environment Act, which stipulates that the work environment shall be adapted to people’s different abilities and needs. The Act prohibiting discrimination in working life against people with disabilities also requires the employer to be able to make certain adaptations to the workplace.</p>
<p>The responsibility of the Swedish National Labour Market Administration to provide support for assistive devices in the workplace is laid down in the Ordinance on special measures for people with occupational disabilities. This responsibility applies only for the first twelve months a person is employed by the employer. The support has an upper limit of SEK 50 000, which can be exceeded in the case of computerised assistive devices or in exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p>The person receiving a grant for an assistive device in the workplace is also the owner of the device. Grants can be paid to both employees and employers.</p>
<p>Social insurance offices are responsible for grants for assistive devices for people who have been employed for more than twelve months. Such grants from the social insurance office can be paid both to the individual concerned and to the employer. Special rules limit the value of grants to the employer.</p>
<p>Officials processing applications for grants for vocational assistive devices often deal with a small number of cases, which makes it difficult for them to build up expertise and develop working routines. Moreover, it is clear from a questionnaire circulated to insurance offices and from interviews with officials at employment offices and insurance offices that these officials lack satisfactory opportunities for professional development. Failings in the regulatory framework and organisational shortcomings also hinder the efficient and effective use of resources.</p>
<p>There is therefore a need for coordination between employment offices and insurance offices so as to allow an exchange of information, professional development and the development of assistive devices for use in working life.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals do not involve any change in the way the provision of vocational assistive devices is organised. However, the employment offices will take over all responsibility for vocational assistive devices for people employed with the support of wage subsidies or in sheltered employment with a public employer (sheltered employment schemes). The National Labour Market Board and the National Social Insurance Board/social insurance offices must take augmented measures where assistive devices in working life are concerned. This will include drawing up quality criteria for their activities and offering officials opportunities for professional development.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Swedish Handicap Institute should receive a special appropriation for joint activities with the National Labour Market Board and the National Social Insurance Board/social insurance offices. The aim of these activities will be to carry out development work in the area of vocational assistive devices, participate in professional development for personnel and be able to give advice and information with respect to purchases of assistive devices for use in working life.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the rules limiting the value of grants available to employees and employers should be eliminated.</p>
<p>New circumstances arising from IT developments</p>
<p>The Inquiry has been assigned the task of analysing the new circumstances in the area of assistive devices brought about by the development of information and communications technology and digital technology. The purpose is, in part, to enable better provision of assistive devices needed by groups of disabled people who have been unable for one reason or another to take advantage of advances in the field of technological development. The Inquiry must also take into account the goals in the action plan for eEurope</p>
<p>– goals to the effect that no one shall be excluded from the information society.</p>
<p>The assignment given in the terms of reference concerning information and communications technology and digital technology is interpreted by the Inquiry to refer to technological applications that support communication between people and technology that supports the transfer of information to and from people. It also includes technology that supports human cognitive functions. In addition, the work of the Inquiry in the IT area encompasses the interface between people and technology. This interface includes, for example, arrangements for controlling and manipulating computers. Assistive devices are taken to include hardware (e.g. computers and accessories), software (programs) and digital services.</p>
<p>Developments have opened up a great potential for improved functionality for people with disabilities. Access to computerbased assistive devices has brought new opportunities in everyday life, working life and education for many people with disabilities. The Inquiry has revealed that IT-based assistive devices are provided in many contexts and on the basis of several different regulations. Such devices are provided with public support from county councils, municipalities and the state.</p>
<p>However, the volume of IT-based assistive devices provided as personal assistive devices has so far been limited and the cost of such devices represents a very limited proportion of total costs to health authorities for assistive devices. Moreover, public spending in this area is exhibiting a downward trend. The regulations for prescribing computer-based assistive devices can differ markedly between health authorities, and whether or not the user receives an assistive device depends on the assessment made by the authority.</p>
<p>Much remains to be done to ensure that people with disabilities in Sweden are more broadly able to benefit from technological advances. The inquiry presents proposals for measures in the following areas:</p>
<p>• More work with statistics</p>
<p>• Better access to technological opportunities</p>
<p>• Augmented  know-how and skills for personnel</p>
<p>• Improved support and information for users</p>
<p>• Enhanced opportunities for research and development</p>
<p>• More advanced coordination, planning and  follow-up.</p>
<p>One crucial issue in this connection concerns the knowledge and skills of personnel. In many different categories of personnel, there is a need to enhance knowledge and expertise relating to IT-based assistive devices. The Inquiry therefore proposes that a more indepth audit, follow-up and evaluation should be made of how well health authorities perform in providing people with disabilities with IT-based assistive devices for purposes of information, communication and cognitive support. It is also proposed that the Government instruct the Swedish National Labour Market Administration and the National Social Insurance Board to set up plans for professional development relating to IT-based assistive devices for relevant personnel categories.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has found that the capacity of assistive devices services to respond to new developments needs to be strengthened and therefore proposes that health authorities and authorities responsible for assistive devices in working life establish take-up organisations for new advances in the IT area. It is also proposed that a number of centres should receive special funds to enable them to test new products and services for people with disabilities,</p>
<p>in the context of their practical operations. Overviews of experience of IT support for “new” needs groups should be compiled and disseminated.</p>
<p>Although IT developments have brought valuable opportunities for people with reading and writing difficulties, these groups have fallen behind in terms of access to assistive devices. The Inquiry therefore proposes a multi-year, temporary incentive grant to health authorities and to the Swedish Library for Talking Books and Braille to increase opportunities to provide assistive devices to people with reading disabilities.</p>
<p>To reduce the digital divide, a proposal is made to introduce opportunities for grants for purchasing subsidised computers for individuals aged 19–29 who are receiving full-time activity compensation or sickness compensation.</p>
<p>Opportunities should be grasped to offer older people an active life with unimpaired security. Accordingly, a proposal is made for a special programme of incentive funds to provide skills development for health and social services staff relating to IT support for older people with disabilities.</p>
<p>The fact that IT-based assistive devices are being made available in many contexts follows naturally from developments and is a consequence of the fact that many actors share the responsibility for disability policy. However, this joint responsibility involves a risk of fragmentation. In order to guarantee the user competent support in connection with needs for advanced IT solutions, while avoiding fragmentation of resources, it is proposed that regional specialist units should be established. The regional units should be based on existing resource centres. The purpose is for the regional centres to be able to offer advanced support to the many different authorities responsible for meeting the needs of users for IT-based assistive devices. Users must be able to have their need for advanced IT assistive devices assessed by a single body. Under the proposal, the regional centres will be established following an organisational study. In order to enhance coordination and ensure efficient use of existing resources, it is also proposed that the responsibilities of the Swedish Handicap Institute in the area of ITbased assistive devices should be broadened from the health and medical care sector to encompass education, working life, culture and transport.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has found that the conditions for continued research and development activities in the area need to be boosted. Opportunities for receiving funding for disability research in the IT area cannot be considered satisfactory. The establishment of research positions for younger researchers is proposed. Work on monitoring and reporting on developments also needs continued implementation and reinforcement. The Inquiry proposes that the Government instruct the Swedish Handicap Institute to prepare regular reports on developments in the IT area for people with disabilities. It is proposed that the Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems should be instructed to report on the measures relating to IT for people with disabilities that are carried out at the Agency.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s other proposals in the IT area concern, for example, the development and coordination of work on statistics describing access to and use of IT among people with disabilities. Forms for more in-depth cooperation with the business sector and better developed opportunities for cooperation and user participation in developing IT assistive devices are also proposed. In order to support older people with disabilities in the area of electronic assistive devices in the home, a trial project is proposed involving education and training for a new professional group, electronic devices instructors. To make it possible to plan further measures in the area, the Inquiry proposes an in-depth analysis of users’ needs for support. Finally, the Inquiry proposes an initiative focusing on developing users’ IT skills and an intensification and acceleration of ongoing work on developing available and usable systems for information about assistive devices targeting users.</p>
