<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Commission on Design Protection proposes that the present act on design protection be replaced by a new Act. The Commission proposes that the new Act should be named formskyddslag  (Swedish for Design Protection Act) and that the intellectual property that is protected by the Act should be referred to as formgivning  (design).</p>
<p>In an interim report submitted in September 2000 (SOU 2000:79) the Commission proposed amendments to the existing Design Protection Act that would have to be made in order to incorporate Directive 98/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 on the legal protection of designs into Swedish law. The report also contained proposals for certain changes in the procedure for registration of designs etc.</p>
<p>Most of the proposals presented in the interim report have been incorporated into the draft Design Protection Act presented by the Commission in its final report. It should also be mentioned that many of the provisions of the present Act remain unchanged in the draft of the new Act, but significant changes are proposed in other respects.</p>
<h2>Nordic cooperation and the consequences of Community law for the draft Act</h2>
<p>The Commission considers it important as far as possible to contribute to harmonization of the Nordic countries’ legislation on the protection of designs. Although these countries have different timetables for their revision of this legislation, they have been engaged in close cooperation with a view to harmonization. The structure of the legislation in the Nordic countries is basically similar and their solutions to the legal problems involved are essentially the same.</p>
<p>A new Design Protection Act was adopted by Denmark in December 2000. In Iceland, amendments to the legislation were adopted in the spring of 2001 so as to bring it into line in all essentials with the Danish Design Protection Act. A new Design Protection Act drafted by the Norwegian Patent Office is now being considered in Norway. In the spring of 2001 Finland presented proposals for partial revision of the existing Act, although a comprehensive review has not yet been made.</p>
<p>Work has been in progress for several years in the EC on the drafting of a new Regulation containing rules that would ensure Community-wide protection for designs. However, the Council of the European Union has not yet approved the draft Regulation that has been presented. Nevertheless, the Commission on Design Protection has sought to coordinate the rules that should in any case be included in national legislation with those of the draft EC Regulation.</p>
<p>The draft Regulation provides a measure of protection for designs even where they are not registered. Since Regulations are directly applicable in all Member States, the Commission does not consider it necessary to provide corresponding protection in the Swedish Design Protection Act.</p>
<h2>Criteria for design protection etc.</h2>
<p>As in the existing Design Protection Act, registration by the Swedish Patent and Registration Office should provide protection for designs. The Commission devoted special attention in this connection to the possibility of submitting electronic applications for the registration of designs.</p>
<p>The basic information to be included in applications for design registration should be specified in the Act, as is the case at present. In addition to the information required by the existing rules, the new Design Protection Act should contain provisions requiring applicants to state their name or business name. However, it should no longer be necessary for an applicant to present a transfer deed in cases where the designer is another person. But the applicant or the designer should in such cases be entitled to have the designer’s name recorded in the Design Registry. Where the design is the result of collaboration between a group of designers, it should be possible to record the name of the group instead of the names of the individual designers.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to stipulate in the Act that applications for design registration must be made in writing and signed by the applicant. Rules on such matters should in further be included in the Ordinance containing the provisions implementing the Act. It would then be possible, without any need for amendments, to introduce a procedure allowing for the submission of electronic applications. The Commission also concluded that no future statutory amendments are necessary to enable the Swedish Patent and Registration Office to accept electronic applications for design registration.</p>
<p>The Commission also proposes amendments to the rules concerning confidentiality. The documents illustrating the design that are attached to an application should be treated as confidential up to the date of registration without a request to that effect by the applicant. At the request of the applicant such documents could be treated as confidential for a period of up to twelve months. This period should be calculated from the date of application or, if priority is claimed, from the priority date. The confidentiality of the documents should naturally be lifted and the illustrative material made public if the applicant so requests. The reason for this amendment is to facilitate for an applicant who may need to alter an application depending on the progress made in the development of the product to which the application relates, and this makes it necessary to amend the provisions concerning confidentiality.</p>
<p>The Commission also proposes introducing a provision concerning the confidentiality of information involving business secrets in cases and application procedures relating to design protection. Such information would only be treated confidentially in response to a request to that effect by the owner of the design or another party.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes extending the scope of priority. The new Design Protection Act should lay down the right to ‘exhibition priority’. This right should be provided only for designs displayed at exhibitions referred to in the Convention on International Exhibitions signed in Paris on 22 November 1928.</p>
<p>All the conditions that must be met by applicants to be eligible for convention or exhibition priority must be set out in the Act.</p>
<p>The Commission found it necessary, in view of the comments submitted during the consultative process following the interim report, to reconsider the scope of the statutory review of applications carried out by the Swedish Patent and Registration Office. As a result, the Commission has altered its recommendation in the interim report and now proposes adding a provision to the Act explicitly stipulating that statutory reviews should be carried out with respect to state arms and similar symbols referred to in section 4, paragraph 2 (a) of the present Design Protection Act.</p>
<h2>Cancellation of design registrations</h2>
<p>The Commission proposes introducing the possibility of determining the validity of registrations by administrative procedure. The Commission has sought to coordinate the procedural rules governing this possibility with the corresponding rules proposed in the draft Trademarks Act (recently presented in SOU 2001:26).</p>
<p>Applications for the cancellation of design registrations should be submitted to the Swedish Patent and Registration Office. The Office should be authorized to take decisions in cases that can be processed simply  and without delay . The Office should not, however, be authorized to consider claims for a better right to a design in doubtful cases.</p>
<p>If the Office cancels a registration, the holder must have the right to bring an action before Stockholm City Court for reinstatement. In cases where the Office does not consider that an application can be processed simply and without delay, the applicant must have the right to refer the matter to Stockholm City Court for a decision. Appeals against other final decisions, including decisions by administrative procedure to deny a request for cancellation, must be lodged with Stockholm City Court. There should be no right of appeal against decisions taken in connection with the processing of an application. The same should apply to a decision to refer a case to the City Court and to dismiss a case where an application for referral is submitted too late or not at all.</p>
<p>If, as proposed by the Commission, the Swedish Patent and Registration Office is authorized to take decisions concerning registrations by administrative procedure, there is no need to retain the present opposition procedure. The possibility of opposing a registration has been abolished in Denmark and</p>
<p>Iceland, and this has also been proposed in Norway. The need to harmonize legislation in the Nordic countries thus provides a further argument for abolishing the right to oppose a registration.</p>
<p>It should still be possible to cancel a registration where a design without authorization by a rightholder contains another party’s business name or trade sign, that enjoys protection in Sweden, or anything that can be construed as a sign that is established in Sweden by usage in a business activity. However, the Commission proposes abolishing the provisions stipulating that designs must not contain anything that can be construed as the name of a foundation or a non-profit or similar association.The existence of a right to a distinctive surname, a well-known artist’s name or similar name that obviously does not refer to a person who has been dead for a long time should continue to constitute grounds for cancelling registrations, provided that use of the design would be to the detriment of the bearer of the name.</p>
<p>It should also be possible to cancel a registration where the design infringes another person’s work that is protected by copyright or another person’s right to a photographic image that is protected in Sweden.</p>
<p>The fact that a design contains a distinctive title of another person’s work that is protected by copyright or a portrait of another person should no longer constitute grounds for cancellation.</p>
<h2>Sanctions</h2>
<p>The provisions of the existing Design Protection Act relating to damages should be amended in order to improve the rightholder’s prospects of obtaining full compensation for any loss incurred in consequence of an infringement of a protected design.</p>
<p>One of the main problems confronting the owner of a protected design when it comes to obtaining full compensation for the loss caused by an infringement is the difficulty of proving the extent of the loss. In the Commission’s view, the provisions relating to damages in the present Act have not had the intended remedial and preventive effects as a result of this problem.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore proposes that, when a rightholder’s loss is determined, a decline in sales should be attributed to the infringement where this appears to be the most likely cause.</p>
<p>The Commission also proposes that the amount of the loss incurred due to a decline in sales and of the profit made by the infringer should be deemed to be as claimed by the rightholder, provided that his or her estimate appears reasonable and the infringer fails to prove that it is incorrect.</p>
<p>Even if the burden of proof is lighter for the owner of a protected design, the aim of the proposed provisions is not to relieve him of the obligation of presenting the evidence that reasonably can be required.</p>
<p>The Commission also proposes that the requirements for prosecution in cases of infringement of a protected design should be relaxed. Where a person infringes a protected design, the public prosecutor should institute proceedings if this is justified from the point of view of public interest, which means that ‘special circumstances’ would no longer be a condition for prosecution.</p>
<h2>International registration of designs</h2>
<p>The Commission proposes that Sweden should accede to the Geneva Act of the Hague Agreement concerning the International Registration of Industrial Designs adopted in 1999. The Act introduces a new system for international registration of protected designs.</p>
<p>Applications for international registration of protected designs should be submitted directly to the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in Geneva or to the Swedish Patent and Registration Office. Applications submitted to the Office must be forwarded to the International Bureau within a month.</p>
<p>Under the Geneva Act, each Member State decides whether an international registration is valid in its territory. When a decision is taken as to whether an international registration pursuant to the Act should be valid in Sweden, the same criteria should apply as for national applications for registration. This means that the Swedish Patent and Registration Office must examine whether the international registration (1) contains anything that is covered by the definition of a design in the Design Protection Act, (2) is compatible with public policy and accepted principles of morality, and (3) does not, without permission, contain arms or similar symbols mentioned in section 4, paragraph 2 (a) of the Design Protection Act.</p>
<p>Prior to publication by the Swedish Patent and Registration Office an international registration should have the same legal consequences as in connection with a national application for design protection.</p>
<p>The Design Protection Act should stipulate that when a registration is cancelled, wholly or in part, the Swedish Patent and Registration Office or a court of law should notify the International Bureau of WIPO of the decision or judgment.</p>
<p>In conjunction with its accession to the Geneva Act Sweden should declare that all communications between the Swedish Patent and Registration Office and the International Bureau are to be in English and should inform WIPO that under Swedish law the time limit on confidentiality is twelve months.</p>
<h2>Other matters relating to design protection</h2>
<p>In view of the small number of cases involving registered designs, the need for uniform case law and efficient use of resources, the Commission proposes that all cases relating to design protection should be tried by Stockholm City Court. Where an action involving infringement of a protected design is brought before the City Court, it should be possible, if it is claimed that the design is protected under the Copyright Act (1960:729) or the Trademarks Act (1960:644), to include infringements of copyright or trademarks in the action.</p>
<p>It should be possible to pledge the right to a design that is registered in Sweden as collateral for a loan. The same should apply to a design that is subject to a international registration that is valid in Sweden and to a Swedish application for registration of a design. As regards agreements concerning the pledging of protected designs and applications for design registration, rights in rem should be conferred by virtue of the registration of the agreement in the registry kept by the Swedish Patent and Registration Office.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the rights to designs developed by employees in the course of their duties or on the instructions of their employer shall vest in the employer, unless otherwise agreed. This would achieve the necessary harmonization with the future provisions of the EC Regulation mentioned above.</p>
<h2>Spare parts and design protection</h2>
<p>The Commission’s study of the situation as regards car spare parts does not indicate that design protection has made such an impact on the pricing of spare parts that there is any need as yet to propose special provisions providing protection for such parts.</p>
<p>This matter is currently being considered by the European Commission, which will submit a uniform solution for the Community as a whole to the Council by 2005. In view of the risk, among other things, that frequent legislative amendments will be necessary and the fact that the present Design Protection Act has not had any appreciable effect on the spare parts market, the Commission on Design Protection recommends that the question of the need for legislative amendments be deferred until the EU has adopted a uniform solution for the Community.</p>
<h2>Economic consequences of the Commission’s proposals</h2>
<p>The proposals presented by the Commission are in all essentials cost-neutral from the point of view of central government finance.</p>
