<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The terms of reference of the committee into knowledge concerning sexual exploitation of children in Sweden were, among other things, to make an inventory of and compile knowledge about sexual exploitation of children and to consider the need for additional measures on the part of the Government to fulfil the work against sexual exploitation of children in accordance previous undertakings. The committee has collected information from, inter alia, four networks made up of representatives of authorities, NGOs, parliamentarians and experts, from a number of study visits and from two studies carried out within the framework of the committee. One of the studies was carried out by the National Council for Crime Prevention. It refers to reported and processed sexual offences against children that includes elements of sexual exploitation. The other study is a survey concerning the sexuality of young people – attitudes to and experience of sexual exploitation – carried out by researchers at Lund University in cooperation with the committee of inquiry.</p>
<p>Sexual exploitation of children comprises trafficking in children, child prostitution/sexual exploitation for payment and child pornography. The report contains a description of these three problem areas, relevant legislation is reported and risk factors identified. Investigations, measures and treatment for both victims and perpetrators are reviewed as well as joint action at both national and international levels. The committee has also presented certain proposals for continued work on issues concerning the sexual exploitation of children.</p>
<p>Sexual exploitation in the form of human trafficking for sexual purposes is a relatively new phenomenon although sexual exploitation in other forms has long existed. Young girls with alcohol and drug abuse problems in particular have been sexually exploited. This is a well known fact but has not been the focus of attention in</p>
<p>investigations and treatment. The exact extent of exploitation cannot be assessed, however the investigations and assembly of knowledge carried out by the committee show that the number of children exposed to sexual exploitation is considerable. As in the case of sexual abuse, the part of sexual exploitation of children that is visible, that is to say in criminal statistics and information from authorities and organisations, is probably just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Poverty, patriarchal structures and the sexualisation of society create a breeding ground for sexual exploitation</p>
<p>Children who have been subject to sexual exploitation have major social and mental problems. Many have been subjected to sexual violation/abuse before or in connection with sexual exploitation.</p>
<p>However, the models based on the individual are not sufficient to explain sexual exploitation of children and must be supplemented by factors of a structural nature. The problem must be seen in its social context. Poverty in combination with patriarchal structures constitutes a major risk of the exposure of women and children to violence and different forms of sexual abuse/exploitation. In cultures where women and children are not seen as individuals of the same value and with the same rights as men, they risk being regarded and treated like objects.</p>
<p>Another factor that makes sexual exploitation of children possible is the sexualisation of society. Erotic messages are communicated in advertising, TV programmes, films, music videos, fashion and on the Internet. Films and images that would have been classified as pornography are shown today on some TV channels and appear in certain evening papers and weekly magazines. Children are drowning in material with a sexual content which is a completely different situation from that which applied for earlier generations.</p>
<p>The consequences of the sexualisation of the public sphere can currently be perceived for example in changed attitudes to sexuality, changed sex habits and a strong increase in the consumption of pornography.</p>
<p>An exposed group</p>
<p>At the individual level, there are certain factors that imply children run a greater risk of being subjected to sexual exploitation. The risk factors are sexual and physical abuse and neglect. The youth poll shows that young people who have sold sexual services have many problems, which are expressed in different ways such as sexualised behaviour, alcohol and drug abuse, criminality and mental illness. Children who come to Sweden from other countries as asylum seekers with or without legal custodians, or because their mother is to marry a Swedish man and also children who are smuggled in or come on their own, may also run the risk of sexual exploitation.</p>
<p>Lonely, sad, lost and deserted children are exposed to the greatest risks since contacts via the Internet may be a compensation for other human company. Children, who have poor relations with their parents, have no friends or for other reasons feel lonely and excluded are particularly defenceless when an unknown person seeks contact with them via the Internet.</p>
<p>Children may be subject to sexual exploitation even if no real risk factors are present. It may, for example, be children who have been photographed secretly for pornographic purposes. The strategies used by many perpetrators can be difficult for children to see through, particularly if the perpetrator is someone they know, have faith in or see as an authority. Not all the children that have been caught up in sexual exploitation after making contact via the Internet have social problems. It may be a case of curiosity, innocence or of testing limits. Children may become involved in something they do not understand and cannot judge the consequences of.</p>
<p>Connections between child pornography and sexual violations</p>
<p>Pornographic pictures/films of children almost always mean that the child has been subjected to sexual abuse/violation that has been documented. It does happen, however, that pictures are not taken for pornographic purposes but are used in such a way that they appear to be pornographic. It may concern pictures that have been manipulated or included in a sequence together with pictures of a pornographic nature. Viewing pornographic pictures/films of children may be temporary but it may also be part of a pattern of transgressing limits and sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Possessing, collecting and distributing child pornography is a crime in itself but attention should also be given to it as a risk factor for physical sexual abuse. The investigation by the National Council for Crime Prevention for instance shows that there is a connection between child pornography offences and sexual abuse. Thirty-eight per cent of those convicted of child pornography offences had also been convicted for sexual crimes against a child in the same case. Another link is that people who are members of one of the closed paedophile networks that operate on the Internet may be obliged to distribute new pictures in order to get access to the material of others. To produce these pictures the person may sexually abuse a child, photograph or film the abuse and distribute the pictures/film to people in the network. Hence, children are sexually abused because the ‘market’ continually demands new pictures.</p>
<p>The majority of people consider sex with children unacceptable but when the boundaries for what is normal shift, a breeding ground is created for degenerate variants such as e sexual exploitation of children. Child pornography may influence attitudes so that what was previously inconceivable may be seen as a possibility, not just by paedophiles but also by people who would not normally exploit children. Another step in the process of normalisation is perceiving that many others are doing the same thing. Today, the Internet offers opportunities of feeling a mutual interest with others who are sexually interested in children. A further essential factor for lowering thresholds is accessibility. Pornography has above all become readily accessible. Those who are well acquainted with Internet can easily find what they want and the risk of being discovered is minor. Furthermore, the large supply of pornography and other material with a sexual content may have an effect on children and young people so that their limits are shifted. It may then be easier to persuade them to carry out sexual acts. Lastly, the thresholds are lowered considerably when it becomes easier to find victims. Previously, perpetrators had to find children in their nearest circles which could be difficult, risky and take time. With the protection of anonymity it is easier to find suitable victims.</p>
<p>A special problem connected with child pornography on the Internet is that the pictures/films never disappear. They are in circulation on the network eternally. This means that the violation of the child never ends.</p>
<p>After the criminalisation of possession of child pornography, there has been an explosive development of Internet opportunities for contacts between people. This has meant a radical increase in opportunities to commit child pornography crimes.</p>
<p>Trafficking in children for sexual purposes</p>
<p>Human trafficking for sexual purposes is a crime planned by criminal organisations and takes place well hidden from agencies, organisations and the general public. Operations are facilitated by the open borders in the Schengen area which imply border supervision without passport control and a chance to cross borders with juveniles without any questions being asked about their relationship or where they belong.</p>
<p>Most cases of human trafficking concern adult women over 18 but the victims may be juvenile girls, usually aged 16–17. These girls are mostly enticed to come to Sweden in the belief that they will earn money and in this way change their future. Sometimes they are forced or duped into believing they will get a regular job. Some are certainly aware that they will be selling sexual services but believe it will be temporary, something they will be doing for a short time. In fact they become the victims of a modern form of slavery.</p>
<p>Through reports and contacts with the committee’s network it has emerged that cooperation takes place between agencies and organisations, at both national and international levels on the policing side. On the other hand, regarding care of the victims of human trafficking for sexual purposes, there is a general lack of cooperation, coordination, knowledge and clear division of responsibility between the agencies and organisations concerned at both national and international levels. Furthermore, there is no clear child perspective in treatment of the victims.</p>
<p>Sexual exploitation for payment</p>
<p>The survey has mapped out the extent of selling sex among young people in the third year of the upper secondary school. The study (Svedin and Priebe 2004) shows that 60 young people – 1.4 per</p>
<p>cent – had sold sex for payment. That is equivalent to about 1 000 young people in the third year of the upper secondary school.</p>
<p>Of the 60 young people, 23 were girls (1 per cent) and 37 boys (1.8 per cent). Boys with an immigrant background were overrepresented. Characteristic of those with experience of having sold sex was an early intercourse debut, several sex partners, behavioural problems, criminality (especially among boys), mental problems and alcohol and drug abuse (especially among girls). Forty-nine stated that they had been subjected to sexual acts against their will. It was most often a question of someone pawing/groping them and of indecent exposure. Forty-two per cent (30 per cent of the boys and 60 per cent of the girls) had been subjected to sexual penetration.</p>
<p>To a remarkably high degree the young people who answered the questionnaire about attitudes to and experience of selling sex for remuneration/money accept that people sell sex or take part in pornographic situations. A majority of the young people in the survey had seen pornography on some occasion. Boys who sold sex viewed most. Forty-two per cent of them stated that they more or less daily viewed pornography. This group also considerably more often viewed sex involving violence, sex between children and adults and sex with animals. Many stated that they are affected by what they see and want to try it out which is alarming, not least bearing in mind that they have viewed child pornography and pornography involving violence.</p>
<p>The victims</p>
<p>The victims of sexual exploitation may be anyone from small children photographed for pornographic purposes without being aware of it, to teenagers forced into prostitution. The mental, physical and social consequences of having been exposed to sexual exploitation varies depending on factors such as the age of the child, the type of exploitation and the relationship to the perpetrator.</p>
<p>In the National Council for Crime Prevention survey of judgments pronounced in cases with an element of sexual exploitation, 70 per cent of the victims are girls. In the survey, the majority of those who had sold sex were boys. There is reason to assume that sexual exploitation of boys is even more concealed than exploitation of girls.</p>
<p>Over 80 per cent of the boys and 65 per cent of the girls in the Council’s survey were under 15. Forty-six of the 60 young people who had sold sex stated that they were between 14 and 18 when they sold sex for the first time. The median value was 16.</p>
<p>The perpetrators</p>
<p>It is usual for perpetrators of crimes with elements of sexual exploitation to be sentenced for crimes against several children. In the National Council for Crime Prevention survey, about a quarter had been sentenced for crimes against two or three children and a quarter for crimes against four or more children in the same case. Ninety-five per cent of those sentenced are men.</p>
<p>It is also common that the perpetrators have previously been sentenced for crimes. In the National Council survey, 72 per cent had appeared before court on at least one previous occasion. One fifth had previously been sentenced for sexual crimes against children and more than a quarter had been sentenced for crimes of violence.</p>
<p>Very few of those who sexually exploit children for payment consider themselves to be child molesters. They try to deny, justify their behaviour and make it humane. Occasionally they also claim that the young people themselves should take responsibility for what has taken place. They imagine that sexual contact is something the child can consent to and benefit from. This attitude is apparent in some of the judgments studied in the committee. In Svedin’s and Back’s study of children exploited in child pornography (2003) there is a description of the intervju with the perpetrators. No one expressed guilt about hurting the children and they did not consider they had done anything wrong. They were usually unable to remember and diminshed their role in the abuse. The majority of perpetrators had cognitive distortions; they distorted reality, redefined relationships of power and strength, reversed roles, etc.</p>
<p>The Internet as a risk and an opportunity</p>
<p>The Internet has meant a radical change in children’s and young people’s social and cultural environment. The majority of children aged 9–16 chat on the Internet but parents generally are not aware</p>
<p>of this. The difference between what parents think children use the Internet for and what they do use it for is great. For example, children can easily find pornographic material or involuntarily open such material on the display.</p>
<p>Certain homepages have children and young people as targetgroups. There they can present themselves, write their own diaries or in the diaries of others, chat, send e-mails and take part in discussion groups. The new digital camera technology with web cameras and mobile telephones makes it easy to photograph and publish the pictures on the Internet. Like other pictures, the pictures become a “public property” and can end up on pornographic sites. The anonymity of the Internet offers an opportunity to talk about problems that children dare not discuss face to face, for example sexuality or relations. This can be positive but there are also risks with this open communication. You can never rely on the person you are chatting with being whom he/she claims to be. Contact through the Internet can lead to personal meetings that may be risky. The Internet has made it easier for paedophiles and other sex criminals to make contact with children.</p>
<p>Through the Internet children can be exposed to new risks. Parents have less control over their children’s contacts and the perpetrators have obtained greater opportunities to find children to sexually abuse or exploit.</p>
<p>Investigations, measures and treatment</p>
<p>Sexual abuse of children is not new for social services. The matter has been given attention since the late 1980s. Thus, in training, research and practice, social services and other authorities have had several decades in which to develop methods for investigation and treatment. Sexual exploitation on the other hand has been given attention relatively recently and experience and knowledge is largely non-existent. To be able to identify the problem, increased knowledge is needed both in personal and family counselling and in institutional care.</p>
<p>Children who have been subjected to sexual exploitation have often experienced sexual violations, violence, neglect and abandonment. Abuse of alcohol and drugs is generally the most visible problem, which may mean that this problem is emphasised in</p>
<p>investigations and treatment while other problems such as sexual exploitation are neglected.</p>
<p>Since children exposed to sexual exploitation are a heterogeneous group, generalisations cannot be made about treatment needs. Some children have been exploited without being aware of it, others have been subjected to serious violations in connection with exploitation. For some children exploitation was a single event, for others something that has gone on for many years. Some come from well functioning families and have not been exposed to any special psychosocial strains, while others are affected by several risk factors. Hence, treatment needs may vary from children who are not in need of any professional treatment at all to children with very extensive need of treatment.</p>
<p>With their shrinking resources and long queues child psychiatric clinics have prioritised children with serious mental problems. Exposure to trauma does not give entitlement to treatment automatically. It is not until the child shows serious mental problems that treatment is offered. There are examples where clinics have worked actively on questions concerning sexual exploitation but as a rule sexual exploitation is probably seldom given attention. To be accepted by clinics, in addition to the child showing serious symptoms, the child and parents must be motivated for treatment and contact the clinic themselves. Hence, these clinics are not a realistic treatment alternative for sexually exploited children, with the exception of clinics with a special focus on sexual assault.</p>
<p>The most vulnerably young people are to found in institutional care. There is reason to assume that many of them have been exposed to sexual exploitation. It is therefore important to clarify whether this is the case and to develop knowledge and methods for giving these young people care that covers the area of sexual exploitation.</p>
<p>Adults that have committed sexual violations against a child have very few chances today of receiving adequate treatment. This applies to both open and closed psychiatric care. Persons sentenced for sexual crimes against children may, however, be given treatment at one of the prison establishments that have special treatment programmes for perpetrators of sexual crimes. There is no treatment in Sweden directly intended for persons sentenced for child pornography offences as far as we know.</p>
<p>Cooperation</p>
<p>Regarding suspected sexual offences against or abuse of children, cooperationgroups have long operated in most municipalities. Their task is primarily to ensure that the child is protected and to coordinate work, particularly the investigations. Sexual exploitation is also a crime that calls for cooperation between different agencies. As there are similarities and connections between these different types of crime, there is reason for collaborating groups to deal with both sexual abuse and exploitation.</p>
<p>The fight against sexual exploitation of children requires well developed international cooperation. These crimes, especially child pornography and human trafficking, are cross-border crimes. Both formal and informal contacts between anti-crime agencies in different countries are needed.</p>
<p>Committee proposals</p>
<p>The committee suggests that:</p>
<p>• the Government investigate and clarify the issue of damages in connection with child pornography crimes</p>
<p>• the Government consider a review of the period of limitation for sexual assault when the crime is connected with childpornography crimes</p>
<p>• the Government review legislation regarding the age criterion in connection with child pornography crimes in cases where the Supreme Court affirms the judgment of the Svea Court of Appeal (Svea Court of Appeal,  B228-03)</p>
<p>• that the Goverment consider how caching of childpornographic pictures i temporary files, as described in the report, shall be criminilized</p>
<p>• the workingmethods that have been used by Save the Cildren in their hotlineproject should be utilized by the police when the project is finished in 2005</p>
<p>• the Government consider the need of reviewing costs for delivering IP numbers and the issue of saving loggfiles to facilitate police investigatory work with crime concerning sexual exploitation of children. Tracing mobilecommunication should also be concidered in this connection.</p>
<p>• the Government raise matters concerning child pornography on the Internet in appropriate international contexts</p>
<p>• the Government consider commissioning the National Police Board, the Swedish Migration Board and the Swedish Customs to draw up guidelines for border control in order to prevent the sexual exploitation of children</p>
<p>• the judicial system’s attitudes to and processing of cases concerning physical and sexual abuse and sexual exploation of children be reviewed in a manner similar to that initiated by the Government for rape of women</p>
<p>• further training for the police and prosecutors concerning child physical and sexual abuse should also comprise sexual exploitation of children</p>
<p>• prosecutors at the international public prosecution office investigating crimes against children should have special qualifications for the task</p>
<p>• judges and lay assessors of cases concerning physical and sexual abuse and , sexual exploitation should have special qualifications for the task</p>
<p>• guidelines for how the police should deal with cases of sexual exploitation of children should be prepared by the National Police Board</p>
<p>• the Government consider whether the Law (2000:87) concerning testing by reference the criminal record of personnel in  pre-schools, schools and school-age child care should cover more professional groups for example certain doctors, personnel at institutions for children and young people, contact persons in social services and guardian ad litem</p>
<p>• schools give priority to sex education and make great efforts to create an environment where no pupil is subjected to sexual harassment and act as a  counter-force to the view of women and men that is spread through advertising, docusoaps and pornography</p>
<p>• the National Board of Health and Welfare should within the framework of the Government order regarding a national function for children at risk concider sexual exploitation of children. The need of regional competence centres should also be concidered</p>
<p>• the National Board of Health and Welfare should in producing a documentation system for investigation and  follow-up (BBIC, focus on children’s needs) and a handbook for social investigations give attention to matters concerning sexual exploitation of children</p>
<p>• in connection with the ADAD (Adolescent Drug Abuse Diagnosis) interview, the National Board of Institutional Care in Sweden ask questions about sexual exploitation where relevant, and develop methods for treatment of young persons who have been subjected to sexual exploitation</p>
<p>• in its work, the Committee on a National Action Plan for Social services for Children and Young People (S 2003:06) give attention to matters concerning sexual exploitation of children</p>
<p>• the Government consider how knowledge compiled by the committee shall be spread nationally, regionally and locally</p>
