<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Schools Agency Inquiry presented its proposals to the Govern- ment in June 2018. The remit was to conduct a broad review of the agencies in the area of schools with a view to creating a more appro- priate agency structure that can contribute more effectively than is currently the case to better schools. The remit also included sub- mitting proposals for a suitable responsible entity for the Sami Education Board or its activities.</p>
<p>Change is needed to remedy the shortcomings in the school system and the current agency structure. To be appropriate and effec- tive in relation to education providers, central government needs to take a coordinated, holistic approach with different tasks reinforcing each other. The aim is to improve the capacity of education providers so that pupils and children receive a good education and achieve good results. The professions must have equal opportunities to develop, and Swedish schools must be competitive in an international per- spective.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore proposes the introduction of a Schools Agency and an Institute for Professions in the School System. This proposal would entail the discontinuation of the National Agency for Education, the Swedish Schools Inspectorate and the National Agency for Special Needs Education and Schools. It is proposed that both the Swedish Institute for Educational Research and the Board of Appeal for Education remain in place.</p>
<p>It is also proposed that central government no longer be the edu- cation provider for special schools and that they instead have new education providers in the form of the municipalities in which they are located.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, the Sami Parliament will become the edu- cation provider for the Sami schools and it is therefore proposed that the Sami Education Board be discontinued.</p>
<p>The Schools Agency – a holistic view of the school system</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Schools Agency be tasked with working on supervision, support for improvement measures, special needs education support, policy documents and tests, follow-up and evaluation, handling of central government grants, production and adaptation of certain teaching aids, and the approval of and grants to independent education providers. It is proposed that the Schools Agency have its head office in the Stockholm area, and ten regional offices throughout the country, from Lund in the south to Luleå in the north.</p>
<p>Its supervisory remit is proposed to consist of needs-based supervision and special supervision. Needs-based supervision will be conducted at education providers and in their schools approximately every five years following a risk and materiality assessment. It is proposed that needs-based supervision be located regionally, but it should be centrally coordinated for reasons of equitability. It is proposed that special supervision be located centrally and include targeted supervision, notification matters and start-up inspections of independent schools.</p>
<p>Support for improvement measures, which is proposed to be located regionally, should always be offered to education providers when shortcomings have been identified in the supervision process. The intention is for central government to support education providers but not to take over responsibility, and for education pro- viders to have sufficient time – once measures have been taken – to work on this basis before the next needs-based supervision process. It should also be possible to offer support following other obser- vations, or on the initiative of an education provider that has analysed its activities and needs support in its continuing work. The support function is also proposed to be centrally coordinated.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, support on special needs education matters should be offered at provider, school and individual level. This kind of support is necessary for pupils and children with disabilities, and for those in need of support for other reasons. Making special needs education support a part of the Schools Agency’s remit increases the chances of all those who need help with special needs education actually finding and receiving this help. This support should also be included in the support for improvement measures. Moreover, it is</p>
<p>proposed that there be a national resource centre with cutting-edge expertise, primarily for groups of pupils and children with a dis- ability that occurs more rarely than in 1 per cent of children. It will be stated in the Agency’s instructions that special needs education expertise must be included.</p>
<p>The Inquiry believes that the Government should consider whether any central government grants could be reduced or phased out in favour of targeted support, but a number of central govern- ment grants will probably remain in place. It is proposed that the Schools Agency handle those who are not covered by continuing professional development for the professions in the school system.</p>
<p>It is proposed that tasks concerning policy documents and tests be transferred unchanged from the National Agency for Education to the central part of the Schools Agency and include work on curriculums, subject plans and syllabuses for various school forms, as well as national tests. The Inquiry wishes to stress the importance of the general advice and support material that is produced targeting all school forms and being made available where needed.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, follow-up and evaluation will be reinforced. It is proposed that this activity be centrally located and include responsibility for official statistics in the school system and various types of evaluation. Formative evaluation should be carried out to ensure that the aim of an initiative is achieved. Thematic evaluations are proposed to highlight work and results in relevant areas. System evaluations involving more comprehensive evaluations are needed to obtain a broad view of how the school system works. The results of follow-ups and evaluations must be presented in an easily accessible and user-friendly way for education providers and schools, and these results will also function as sound background material for govern- ment policy.</p>
<p>There are no teaching aids available for Sami schools, pupils with certain disabilities and some additional areas. It is therefore pro- posed that the Schools Agency, in cooperation with experts from each area, centrally produce and adapt teaching aids for the above- mentioned groups and, in line with separate government decisions, also for other groups.</p>
<p>Finally, it is proposed that the Schools Agency have response- bility for approval of and grant entitlements for independent educa- tion providers. Under the proposal, this task should be placed at the head office.</p>
<p>Board of Appeal for Education – unchanged remit</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Board of Appeal for Education be transferred unchanged from the Swedish Schools Inspectorate to the Schools Agency. However, it is proposed that the Board be given greater scope to delegate the right to take decisions to case officers.</p>
<p>The Institute for Professions in the School System</p>
<p>– for lifelong professional learning</p>
<p>The teaching and preschool teaching professions need to become more attractive, as do the professions of principal and preschool head, so that all pupils and children receive their education from registered and qualified teachers or preschool teachers, and so that the management of school activities functions well in relation to the national targets for education. The professions need to be high- lighted and given equal opportunities to develop their profess- sionalism.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore proposes that an Institute for Professions in the School System be established and located in the Stockholm area. It will collaborate with the Schools Agency to ensure a regional connection. It is proposed that the Institute be tasked with issuing registration certificates for teachers and preschool teachers, deciding on standards for professional development, offering professional programmes with a clear progression and also other skills develop- ment for principals, preschool heads, teachers and preschool teachers. It is proposed that school managers or equivalent and local politicians within the school system should be considered for short skills development measures.</p>
<p>It is proposed that ongoing initiatives such as the Teachers’ Salary Boost, the Career Stage Reform and Boost for Teachers II be transferred from the National Agency for Education to the Institute for Professions in the School System. This includes processing</p>
<p>central government grants for skills development. It is also proposed that the Institute be responsible for the training programmes for principals and others.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Teachers’ Disciplinary Board be placed within the Institute.</p>
<p>The Swedish Institute for Educational Research to remain, but with a slightly altered remit</p>
<p>The Swedish Institute for Educational Research was established in 2015 and the Inquiry proposes that it remain in place. The reason for this is that there is a great need within the school system for both systematic research overviews and the allocation of funding to practice-based research that takes its cue from the needs that exist in schools. It is now also proposed that the Institute be tasked with compiling tried and tested experience.</p>
<p>The Swedish Institute for Educational Research will also contri- bute scientific material to the Schools Agency and the Institute for Professions in the School System with the aim of developing the scientific basis in the school system and making it equitable.</p>
<p>It is also proposed that the scientific council that is based at the Institute remain in place, while the Swedish Educational Research Board be discontinued. The Board decides on systematic reviews and advertisements for funding, which should become a task for the Director-General.</p>
<p>Municipalities to be responsible for special schools</p>
<p>The National Agency for Special Needs Education and Schools is responsible for special schools. The Inquiry considers that it is time for a change, so that special schools are no longer run completely separately from other school forms. It is proposed that the six municipalities in which the special schools are located become new education providers.</p>
<p>Municipal education providers are used to having pupils or children with disabilities in their schools, and a number of muni- cipalities also have groups of pupils who could be entitled to attend special schools. The intention of giving municipalities the role of</p>
<p>education provider is that the same type of responsibility for com- pulsory school, compulsory school for pupils with learning dis- abilities and special schools could benefit pupils’ development and simplify cooperation concerning pupils and their opportunities for exchange and interaction, and opportunities for staff to exchange experiences. Work on accessibility, participation and equality should be promoted, helping to combat exclusion. The same type of responsibility is also expected to contribute to equal conditions for teachers in different school forms, which could result in labour market advantages.</p>
<p>Special school is a statutory school form and will remain in place under the proposal. To continue to guarantee the learning environ- ments needed, the Inquiry proposes a special central government grant, in addition to the fee paid by pupils’ home municipalities. For reasons of equitability, the Inquiry wants to draw the Government’s attention to the fact that there are similar municipal activities that have not been allocated corresponding central government funds.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the board that takes decisions on admission to special school remain in place and be placed within the Schools Agency.</p>
<p>Sami Parliament to be the new education provider for Sami schools</p>
<p>The Sami Education Board has long had problems governing its schools and maintaining stable finances based on its allocated bud- get. It has also been difficult to guarantee pupils the teaching they are entitled to.</p>
<p>It is therefore proposed that the Sami Parliament take over responsibility for the Sami schools. The Sami Parliament has a stronger organisation than the Sami Education Board concerning the Samis’ position as an indigenous people and their right to self- determination; it also has a larger administrative organisation, which will lead to synergy gains. There are also natural areas of collabo- ration between the Sami schools and some of the Sami Parliament’s activities.</p>
