<p>Remit of the Inquiry</p>
<p>The remit of the Inquiry on Coordination of Social Insurance Legislation (SamSol) is to carry out a technical review of the National Insurance Act (1962:381) and other statutes in the area of social insurance (ToR 2001:70).</p>
<p>The object of the Inquiry is to submit proposals for legislation to give improved clarity and better assurance against lack of consistency as regards rules and concepts common to social insurance. The present legislation must be better coordinated, and if possible brought together, so that it is easier to take in and apply. Proposals are also to be submitted as to how coordination benefits can be achieved even in material respects.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a social insurance code</p>
<p>After having considered various alternatives we in SamSol are unanimous in our opinion that in principle all legislation on social insurance should be collected in a social insurance code, which will replace about 30 existing acts. Benefits are to be administered by the new Swedish Social Insurance Agency and the Premium Pension Authority. We have considered examples from France, Germany, Ireland and Norway. We have also looked at EC regulations 1408/71 and 883/2004 as well as the Swedish Environmental Code and the Income Tax Act (1999:1229).</p>
<p>We believe that the following general benefits will follow from a comprehensive social insurance code. In the first place there is of course the clear comprehensive picture, which is the overall objective of our inquiry. The citizen perspective requires a clear system with an improved and consistent legislative structure, which</p>
<p>will probably also give citizens a greater understanding of the system.</p>
<p>The code will also give the social insurance system and the new social insurance administration a clearer identity. It will be easier for everyone to search in and apply an integrated code of law instead of the 30 or so different acts which it will replace. It will, for example, be possible in a simple way to read the contents of all the cross-references that must be retained. It will be easier to see the connections between and consequences of various regulations and measures. It will also be easier to provide information and other services. In particular, electronic accessibility and communications will be significantly easier.</p>
<p>Additional advantages for agencies and legislators are the value of common regulations and the fact that it will be easier to pay regard to the whole situation. It will be easier to coordinate and maintain consistency and easier to avoid omissions, inconsistencies and duplicate regulations. It is, of course, easier to amend a single piece of legislation than several acts simultaneously and this will probably also improve cooperation between different agencies and other actors.</p>
<p>No essential changes in the contents of the code</p>
<p>Apart from issues relating to the processing of cases and appeals, our task has been very limited with regard to changes in substance. Nor do we propose any major changes of this kind in the draft code that we are presenting. On the other hand, case law is codified in several instances.</p>
<p>To obtain the benefits of coordination, we also propose that a number of provisions on benefits and processing be made uniform throughout the social insurance system. Some special provisions cannot be dispensed with, however. Nonetheless, as far as possible they should be brought together in common sections dealing with specific subjects.</p>
<p>The scope of the code in terms of substance</p>
<p>With regard to the substantial scope of the code, we propose that the social insurance code mainly include legislative rules on benefits that are currently covered by the Social Insurance Act (1999:799). However, we consider that the compensation for medical care, etc. now referred to in the National Insurance Act should not be incorporated into the code, but should be regulated in a special act.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we propose that, compared to the Social Insurance Act, the integrated legislation should be extended to include the rules on sick pay, public personal injury protection for conscripts in the national total defence services, etc., war injury compensation for seamen and disease carrier allowances, all of which are now provided for in special legislation. It should also cover the regulations governing voluntary sickness benefit insurance in the National Insurance Act and include the car allowances regulated in the Ordinance on car allowances for people with disabilities. However, we have allowed unemployment insurance and a number of other benefits to continue to remain outside the realm of social insurance.</p>
<p>The structure of the code</p>
<p>With regard to the structure of the social insurance code, we propose that it is divided into eight titles designated with capital letters, some 30 subdivisions designated with Roman numerals, approximately 120 chapters and some 1 860 generally short sections. The code is intended to be flexible and able to be easily expanded since each title has been divided into separate chapters.</p>
<p>It is proposed that title A contain general provisions on the persons to whom the legislation is to apply and the social insurance protection in different branches of insurance and certain common definitions. This title corresponds to the Social Insurance Act, which at present applies to housingor work-based benefits. The code will now be supplemented by a third branch of insurance, which we have termed “other benefits”. We also propose a number of general definitions for the entire code which can subsequently be supplemented in the future so as to continuously enhance consistency.</p>
<p>Titles B–G are proposed to include provisions on the various social insurance benefits, basically listed according to situations of need in the course of the citizen’s lifecycle. The focus is therefore on the citizen, instead of insurance categories. Title H is proposed to include some common provisions on benefits, processing, reappraisal, appeal procedures and organisation. These titles have the following headings:</p>
<p>Title G Housing allowances</p>
<p>Title H Certain common provisions</p>
<p>We propose that the system have a clear structure even at lower levels by making the provisions in the various sectors on benefits recur under similar headings in more or less the same positions in each sector, so that the reader can easily find them. In addition the approximately 600 intermediate headings and 700 subheadings will make it considerably easier for citizens and agencies to search in the code, particularly as regards electronic searches.</p>
<p>The structure of the code will make it easier for those using the legislation in their work. Formulation of decisions will be facilitated both by the structure of the code itself and by the fact that the language of individual provisions will be more accessible. As a result of this clarity, the regulatory framework may become the natural working tool for responsible officials at the Swedish Insurance Agency. This in turn may lead to a more legally secure and consistent application of social insurance.</p>
<p>Entry into force of the code and costs</p>
<p>Considering the extent of the legislation necessary in this case, it is difficult to predict when the social insurance code will be able to enter into force. A reasonable assessment however may be that this should be possible on 1 January 2008.</p>
<p>The social insurance code will apply to benefits with regard to the period after entry into force. The common provisions on processing, etc. will however, be applied immediately even if the benefit concerns a period before entry into force. Entry into force and interim provisions will be included in a special introductory Act. This Act will also include the interim provisions for the annulled acts that continue to be of importance and some provisions of an interim nature in the annulled acts.</p>
<p>We consider that a new social insurance code will lead to certain costs over an interim period, but that in the long term it will lead to more efficient and economic management of the social insurance system.</p>
