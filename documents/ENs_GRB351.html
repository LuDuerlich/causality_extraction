<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The assignment</h2>
<p>In 1997 the judicial protection of unaccompanied refugee children was improved when the possibility to appoint a custodian for nonnordic children was expanded. The assignment of the investigation in the part that is accounted for in this report has been to follow up the amendment of 1997 and consider whether further measures need to be taken to strengthen the protection for the unaccompanied children.</p>
<h2>Custodian for unaccompanied children and others</h2>
<p>By an amendment of Chapter 4, Section 3, second paragraph of the Act (1904:26 p. 1) on Certain International Judicial Circumstances Concerning Marriage and Guardianship, the possibility to appoint a custodian for unaccompanied children was expanded in 1997. The amendment involved that ever since, most of the unaccompanied children to arrive in Sweden have been assured a custodian during their stay here.</p>
<p>Lately the situation of the unaccompanied children has attracted attention in several respects. In relation to this, it has emerged that there is a need for further protection of these children. The major problem is that the present custodians for unaccompanied children only can take the place of the child’s guardian, i.e. their authority mainly concerns the economic affairs. The possibilities of the custodian to decide in matters concerning the personal relations of the child are thus highly limited. This has shown to be a severe shortcoming and has furthermore led to the fact that there presently are obscurities regarding the extent of the custodian’s assignment.</p>
<p>To master the problem, the investigation suggests that a possibility for a chief guardian to appoint a custodian who can take the place of the caretaker as well as of the guardian is created within the scope of a specific legislation aiming at unaccompanied children. Hereby is secured that the custodian can act and make decisions in all matters concerning the unaccompanied child. This gets special significance in matters concerning the child’s housing, since the custodian is given better possibilities to prevent the child from deviating from an assigned form of housing.</p>
<p>In the course of the investigation it has emerged that there is a group of non-nordic children that are many times as vulnerable as the unaccompanied children. These are children who are accompanied by an adult when arriving in Sweden, but who in one way or another are left alone during their stay. These children are also comprised by the suggested legislation.</p>
<p>The custodians who are to take care of unaccompanied children are to be especially suitable for this assignment. In order for the chief guardian to be able to be assured that the unaccompanied child is not being committed to the keeping of someone unsuitable, the investigation suggests that it should be possible for the chief guardian to demand an excerpt from the criminal record concerning the proposed custodian.</p>
<h2>Childrens’ right to apply for a residence permit</h2>
<p>According to the United Nations’ Convention on the rights of the Child, the countries of the convention are to secure that a child who seeks the status of refugee or who is considered a refugee in accordance with international or national jurisdiction is given proper protection and humanitarian aid. A basic presupposition is hereby that the child can have an application for a residence permit examined. Currently there are no clear rules regarding when a child can apply for residence permit himself. The investigation suggests that a child who has reached the age of 15 should be allowed to file such an application. In order to secure that a child who has not yet reached the age of 15 also is given the right to have an application for residence permit examined, the investigation suggests that a new section be entered in Chapter 11, Section 1 c, of the Aliens’ Act, which prescribes that a custodian, or a public assistant, has an obligation to apply for a residence permit on the account of the unaccompanied child if the child has a need for such a permit.</p>
<h2>Especially appointed caretaker of unaccompanied children and others</h2>
<p>The task of the custodian should, in the opinion of the investigation, be to take care of the unaccompanied child during the first, and often most difficult, period of time in Sweden. During this period of time the child’s application for a residence permit is to be treated and the child is to be placed in some sort of housing and to be educated. The custodian has a coordinating function and is to see to it that the rights of the child are being looked after in these different situations.</p>
<p>If the child has been granted a residence permit in Sweden and thereafter acquires a permanent residence here, the custodian should be replaced by a more permanent representative. The investigation therefore suggests that when an unaccompanied child acquires a permanent residence in Sweden an especially appointed caretaker is to be chosen for the child. If the parents of the unaccompanied child are deceased, an especially appointed caretaker can be chosen in accordance with Chapter 6, Section 9 of the Code on Parents and Children. In the event of the child’s parents are alive, or it is uncertain whether or not this is the case, there is however currently no possibility to chose an especially appointed caretaker for the minor. With regards to this, the investigation suggests that a new section be entered in Chapter 6 of the Code on Parents and Children, Section 8 a, that prescribes that an especially appointed caretaker can be chosen for a child whose parents are durably prevented from exercising their care. A parent who for a foreseeable period of time is unable to see to it that the child’s needs are looked after, e.g. due to a vast geographical distance or insufficient means of communication, will normally be considered durably prevented to exercise the care.</p>
<p>The section suggested is not limited to situations regarding unaccompanied children. A particularly appointed caretaker can e.g. also be chosen for a child whose parents due to a long-lasting and serious illness are unable to take care of their child or are gone missing during travels abroad.</p>
<h2>Authorized court and chief guardian in questions regarding guardianship, custodianship in accordance with Chapter 11, Sections 1, 2 and 4 of the Code on Parents and Children, and trusteeship</h2>
<p>The present order implies that the permanent residence of November 1 the previous year decides which court and chief guardian respectively that is qualified in cases and matters regarding guardianship and custodianship in accordance with Chapter 11, Sections 1, 2, and 4 of the Code on Parents and Children, and matters regarding trusteeship. This order has shown to give rise to practical problems, since the municipality that is considered to be the permanent residence of the individual often does not coincide with the municipality in which he is actually living or has a more permanent stay. This involves that the practice of these cases becomes unnecessarily complicated and in some cases involve long travels for the people involved.</p>
<p>To avoid the problems mentioned above, the rules of authority should better mirror the real situations. The investigation suggests that the authority of the court and the chief guardian in accordance with Chapter 10, Section 13 and Chapter 11, Section 25 of the Code on Parents and Children in the cases mentioned above should be connected to the municipality in which the individual is registered. If the individual is not registered in Sweden, the authority should be connected to the actual location of the individual. In the same way it is suggested that the supervision in accordance with Chapter 16, Section 2 of the Code on Parents and Children is connected to the municipality in which the individual is registered respectively to the location of the individual. In matters regarding guardianship in accordance with Chapter 11, Section 3 of the Code on Parents and Children, except guardianship for investigating the estate of a deceased person, the investigation suggests that the supervision in accordance with Chapter 16, Section 2 of the Code on Parents and Children is to be exercised by the chief guardian in the municipality in which the guardian is registered.</p>
