<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Our remit</h2>
<p>Our overall task has been to consider measures to encourage ‘perpetual debtors’ to apply for debt reconstruction rather than, year after year, be subject to attachment of salary orders or similar measures. The remit has included considering the following:  Proposing improvements to ensure those entitled to debt reconstruction also receive it.  Whether the requirements currently placed on debtors, creditors and public authorities regarding debt reconstruction are appropriate or whether the requirements should be designed differently than at present.  Whether it should be easier to apply for debt reconstruction.  How the requirements concerning qualified insolvency in the Debt Restructuring Act are applied.  The length of the payment plan.</p>
<p>The remit emphasises that we are to focus on how the changes we propose satisfy the fundamental ideas behind the debt reconstruction mechanism.</p>
<h2>General considerations</h2>
<p>The basic assumption in a society in which credit is granted extensively is that debts are paid when they fall due for payment. This presupposes that credit is granted in a serious manner with consideration given to the fact that a credit agreement is normally entered into between two parties.</p>
<p>Debt reconstruction is to be considered only when something has occurred to the debtor’s circumstances that he or she had no reason to take into account when the credit came into existence. In such cases it is important that society in general, and municipal authorities and institutions in particular, are sufficiently knowledgeable about debt reconstruction. The Inquiry has been able to establish that society currently knows little about debt reconstruction and that measures in this area are therefore necessary.</p>
<p>It is also important that the debt reconstruction mechanism itself does not contribute to practical difficulties for the debtor to apply for and implement debt reconstruction. We consider that there is a need for a number of measures that simplify the current debt reconstruction process and can make it easier for an individual to become debt-free.</p>
<h2>Our proposals</h2>
<p>Internet portal</p>
<p>There should be a publicly operated internet portal containing information on debt reconstruction for debtors, creditors and other actors who come into contact with people in debt.</p>
<p>The Swedish Enforcement Authority’s obligation to provide information</p>
<p>The Swedish Enforcement Authority is to provide information on debt reconstruction to debtors who, over a long period of time, have been subject to attachment of salary orders or other executive measures.</p>
<p>The Swedish Enforcement Authority should provide more information on the general debt situation in each of the country’s municipalities so that the importance of municipal budget and debt counselling is highlighted in each municipality, and to provide better data to the counselling services.</p>
<p>Other information and education</p>
<p>The Swedish Enforcement Authority and the Swedish Consumer Agency should be in charge of raising awareness of debt recon- struction in society through various information campaigns. To a greater degree than at present, they should also offer education on debt reconstruction to actors who come into contact with people in debt.</p>
<p>Checking the debtor’s data</p>
<p>The Swedish Enforcement Authority should be given greater responsibility for checking that data provided in an application for debt reconstruction is correct. Debt reconstruction officers should be given greater access to the Authority’s own databases and data should be collected more regularly.</p>
<p>Application for debt reconstruction</p>
<p>It should be possible to apply for debt reconstruction via a web- based application procedure.</p>
<p>There are currently far-reaching requirements as to what a debt- or is to include in a debt reconstruction application. We believe this probably results in people refraining from applying for debt recon- struction. At the same time, it is not possible to lower the investigation requirements in a debt reconstruction matter. We consider that responsibility for the investigation should have a different breakdown than under the current arrangement.</p>
<p>The debtor should not have to provide details of all his or her debts in the application. Instead, creditors who, following the initiating decision, can be expected to monitor an announcement on debt reconstruction are themselves to report each of their claims to the Swedish Enforcement Authority. On the other hand, this means that in their applications, debtors are always to provide information about debts to creditors who are private persons as well as companies that are not debt collecting agencies or rep- resented by such an agency. The debtor is always to provide a serious estimate of the total burden of debt and the background as to why the debt was accrued, so that there is data available to assess whether the debtor is totally insolvent.</p>
<p>Qualified insolvency</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s opinion, a Supreme Court decision, NJA 2010 p. 496, has in recent years contributed to stricter application of the insolvency requirement in the Debt Restructuring Act, the</p>
<p>‘qualified insolvency’ condition. Following that case, it has become more common to use a 15-year forecast when assessing a debtor’s ability to pay.</p>
<p>The current application of the insolvency forecast results in certain debtors not being granted debt reconstruction even though, considering the fundamental aims of the mechanism, debt recon- struction is warranted. Under current practice, young, unemployed and employed people in particular have found it hard to come under consideration for debt reconstruction.</p>
<p>To be sure, in spring 2013 the Supreme Court again addressed the issue of qualified insolvency and then emphasised the impor- tance of a balanced assessment. But in that decision, the Court limited itself to pointing out that a shorter forecast can be applied to an older person and debtors suffering from serious health problems.</p>
<p>We consider that legislative measures are necessary to allow de- viation from the now established 15-year forecast and bring about a more balanced application of the law. We therefore propose that the qualified insolvency condition and the definition of that term be added to the text of the Act. The term ‘qualified insolvency’ should refer to when a debtor cannot pay his or her debts when due and that it can be assumed that this incapacity, with respect to all circumstances,  will continue for the foreseeable future (compare the definition of insolvency in the Bankruptcy Act, Chapter 1, Section 2).</p>
<p>Payment plan</p>
<p>In debt reconstruction, it is determined that the debtor is to pay off his or her debts according to a payment plan that normally extends for five years. During the time a payment plan is in effect, the debtor is to live at subsistence level, which can be burdensome. There is already an option to set a shorter payment plan if there are special grounds for doing so, but in practice this rarely happens. To allow giving greater consideration to a person’s individual situation,</p>
<p>we propose making the length of the payment plan more flexible than at present. It should be possible to set a shorter plan if reasonable, for example when it comes to heavily indebted old-age pensioners and debtors who are seriously ill.</p>
<p>Payment-free months</p>
<p>To improve the prospects for a debtor to carry out debt recon- struction, we propose two payment-free months each year. These are to occur in June and December. This kind of release valve during the payment period can relieve some of the pressure that a debtor feels. It can also make the debt reconstruction mechanism more attractive, for example to debtors who, year after year, are subject to attachment orders. In addition, a debtor who has fallen behind by a monthly payment will be given the chance to catch up on the missed payment.</p>
<p>The debtor is to begin the payments earlier</p>
<p>To achieve a more effective debt reconstruction process we pro- pose that debtors begin making their payments in connection with the initiating decision, which can result in the debtor becoming free of debt earlier. Further, a long processing time at the Swedish Enforcement Authority would not delay debt reconstruction. Creditors would no longer be affected by the prohibition against attachment that commences when the initiating decision is taken. The way in which the debtor manages the payments after the initiating decision should also be considered and influence the assessment of whether granting debt reconstruction is reasonable.</p>
<p>Payment service</p>
<p>Under most payment plans that are currently set up, the debtor is to pay many small amounts to a number of different creditors each month. The plans are therefore often difficult to understand. We feel that it is important to both make it easier for the debtor to carry out the payment plan and keep down the costs for creditors to receive payments. We therefore propose that the sum the debtor is to pay to the creditors during debt reconstruction be handled by</p>
<p>means of a payment service. Each month, the debtor – both prior to and after the final debt reconstruction decision – would pay a set amount to an account held by the Swedish Enforcement Authority. The creditors would subsequently receive their individual payment once a year as opposed to every month, as is normally the case at present.</p>
<p>If the debtor is not granted debt reconstruction, he or she would be entitled to be reimbursed for the money paid to the above-mentioned account.</p>
<p>Modified attachment prohibition</p>
<p>If, prior to the initiating decision, the debtor has been subject to an attachment of salary or some similar measure, the money in the account should not be repaid to the debtor. It should instead be paid to the attachment claims that were stopped as a result of the initiating decision.</p>
<p>A second chance</p>
<p>At present, it is in principle impossible for a debtor who has been granted debt reconstruction to be granted debt reconstruction a second time. This applies regardless of whether the debtor has completed the debt reconstruction process and is completely free of debt or whether he or she has failed in this process and is still encumbered by the debts that were previously in place.</p>
<p>We propose that a debtor who has previously failed with debt reconstruction and has had the plan cancelled can again be offered debt reconstruction without restriction. However, as regards debtors who have gone through debt reconstruction and become free of debt but again became indebted, this opportunity should remain restricted to when exceptional grounds are considered to exist.</p>
