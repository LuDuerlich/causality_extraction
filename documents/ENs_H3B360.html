<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The National Negotiation on Housing and Infrastructure has been given a remit for the period 2014 to 2017 to negotiate on the financing of high-speed railways between Stockholm and Gothenburg/Malmö and on measures to improve the accessibility and capacity of the transport system and lead to increased housing construction in the metropolitan regions. The purpose of the negotiation is to facilitate a rapid implementation of high-speed railways, maximising their socioeconomic profitability, and to identify cost-effective measures that will lead to improved accessibility and increased housing construction, particularly in metropolitan areas, with a focus on resource-efficiency, sustainability and densification. The Negotiation also has instructions to look into a possible expansion of railways in northern Sweden and to enter into agreements to promote cycling.</p>
<p>The National Negotiation on Housing and Infrastructure also has a remit to propose legislative amendments on land value capture. Public investments in transport infrastructure often lead to property increasing in value. The terms of reference therefore see certain arguments for making property owners who benefit from a public investment return part of that value to society (‘land value capture’).</p>
<p>Land value capture can be achieved, for example, by means of development contracts that share undertakings and costs between a municipality and a developer in connection with the adoption of a local detailed development plan. Land value capture through development contracts can give the actors incentives to find solutions for infrastructure and development that maximise benefits and reduce costs. Within the limits set by our terms of reference, funds from land value capture will be used to finance the infrastructure that generates the increase in the value of property, directly via municipal infrastructure investments or indirectly via municipal co-financing of central government infrastructure. Our remit, which is presented in this interim report, is to propose legislative amendments that clarify how property value increases can be made a basis for cost-sharing in connection with development contracts.</p>
<p>The proposal is to take account of existing legislation that affects the possibilities of basing cost sharing on an increase in property value, such as the Local Government Act (1991:900) and the Act on certain Municipal Powers (2009:47). If we consider it necessary, we are to propose amendments to these Acts.</p>
<h2>Land value capture</h2>
<p>Land value capture in one form or another is increasingly common internationally. The instruments vary depending on the organisation and regulation of planning in the country concerned, its tax system and other factors. In Sweden, increases in property value are captured through taxes and fees, contracts, sales or leases of publicly owned properties, compulsory purchase of land, orders issued by government authorities or expropriation. A range of different factors, not just transport infrastructure, may have caused the property to increase in value. The declared purposes of the regulations governing the instruments listed above vary. What the regulations have in common is that in practice, they lead to land value capture.</p>
<p>There are three instruments that have the purpose of capturing values that have arisen as a result of investments in transport infrastructure. These are ‘value gains expropriation’ (in the Expropriation Act, 1972:719), provisions on payment for street costs, and compensation through development contracts (both in the Planning and Building Act, 2010:900). ‘Value gains expropriation’ is an instrument that allows society to expropriate a property so as to capture increased property value that results from investments by society in building or civil engineering measures. Transport infrastructure is one example. Expropriation is an instrument that has very far-reaching consequences for a property owner. However, no expropriation has ever occurred pursuant to this provision. The thinking behind this instrument is primarily that it will serve as a means of bringing pressure to bear so as to bring about voluntary agreements on land value capture. The way this works is that property owners can avoid expropriation if they voluntarily compensate society for the value gains that can be expected to arise as a result of measures taken by public actors. However, the reach of the provision in this respect is debatable. In addition, value gains expropriation is not primarily a contractual instrument and therefore lacks clarity in contractual respects.</p>
<p>The second instrument is payment for street costs, which a municipality may impose to cover the costs of municipal streets, roads and other public places. Only a few municipalities make use of the option of imposing a payment for street costs. This is because the administrative procedure is felt to be burdensome and the regulations have not won broad acceptance among affected property owners and developers. Instead, many municipalities choose to negotiate on compensation for street costs within the framework of the third instrument, which is the one that works best: development contracts.</p>
<p>However, land value capture in development contracts is conditional on the investment being regarded as necessary for the development. It can happen that municipal transport infrastructure that leads to an increase in property values is not regarded as necessary for the implementation of a detailed development plan. Consequently, a development contract cannot be used as an instrument for land value capture where such municipal transport infrastructure is concerned. It is possible that a street cost charge could be applied for such transport infrastructure, but this is not clear. The current rules on development contracts do not cover national or regional transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>Land value capture concerning transport infrastructure also occurs when property owners who see great benefits in a transport infrastructure investment choose to make a voluntary contribution to the investment with a view to enabling its implementation. However, this occurs to a limited extent and there is uncertainty about how land value capture in this form can be realised by mutual undertakings.</p>
<h2>Proposal for a new instrument for land value capture</h2>
<p>In practice, then, land value capture concerning transport infrastructure primarily occurs through contracts and is surrounded by unclear, unpredictable and unsatisfactory circumstances. Against this backdrop, and in the knowledge that land value capture can help to generate value for both society in general and individual property owners, we consider that a new instrument is needed for land value capture for national transport infrastructure, regional public transport structures and some municipal transport infrastructure. What we mean by ‘value’ in this case is more funds for transport infrastructure and cost-minimising and benefit-maximising solutions for society and the property owner. The instrument for land value capture is intended for use with reference to national transport infrastructure, regional public transport structures and municipal transport infrastructure not covered by current development contracts.</p>
<p>In this interim report, we present legislative proposals on land value capture with respect to transport infrastructure. Under the proposals, a municipality and a property owner will be able, using a voluntary and negotiation-based instrument, to enter into an agreement on the recovery of increases in property value arising from transport infrastructure financed by the municipality. The proposed name of this instrument is ‘value gains compensation’. An agreement on value gains compensation can be made in conjunction with the drawing up of a development contract. The advantage of entering into an agreement in conjunction with a development contract and a detailed development plan is that the design of the detailed plan and the cost-sharing arrangement in the development contract will influence the value of the transport infrastructure for the property owner. The possibility of a mutually advantageous negotiation thus arises in connection with the negotiation of the development contract.</p>
<p>Funds from land value capture will be used to finance the transport infrastructure that yields the value gains, whether this is through the municipality’s own investments in transport infrastructure or through municipal co-financing of central government or county council investments in transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>Municipal guidelines for development contracts should clearly state whether municipalities intend to use value gains compensation, so that property owners can foresee well in advance what conditions they will face in their negotiations with the municipality. The purpose of such information is to create predictability.</p>
<p>When applying value gains compensation, the municipalities must conform to the principle of equal treatment in the Local Government Act and EU state aid rules. The idea of these rules is to treat all parties in the same way and not to favour anyone more than anyone else.</p>
<p>While the primary responsibility for building roads and railways rests with the central government, the responsibility is shared between central government and the municipalities, and in some cases county councils. Co-financing means that municipalities, county councils or the central government contribute to transport infrastructure construction for which another actor is responsible.</p>
<p>A basic rule of municipal activities is that they must be associated with the municipality’s area or members and concern measures that are not the sole responsibility of the central government, another municipality, another county council or some other body. This basic rule is given in Chapter 2, Section 1 of the Local Government Act (1991:900).</p>
<p>With regard to municipal co-financing of central government road and railway projects, special rules are provided in the Act on certain Municipal Powers (2009:47) (the Municipal Powers Act). This Act gives the municipalities increased powers concerning co-financing of central government projects, compared with what applies under the Local Government Act. Under this Act, municipalities and county councils may contribute to road and railway construction and to the establishment of public fairways for which central government is responsible. If special grounds exist, such contributions may be made even in the absence of the kind of connection with the area of the municipality or county council referred to in Chapter 2, Section 1 of the Local Government Act. ‘Special grounds’ means that the project is intended to be of regional benefit to a larger area than each individual municipality. The new traffic solution must also markedly improve communications possibilities in the area.</p>
<p>Joint transport infrastructure ventures between municipalities and county councils are becoming increasingly common. A municipality may therefore have grounds for wanting to co-finance public transport structures for which a county council is responsible. Such municipal co-financing is not regulated in the Municipal Powers Act. In these cases, Chapter 2, Section 1 of the Local Government Act applies. This provision does not prevent a municipality from involving itself in transport infrastructure beyond the municipality’s boundaries, but the municipality must be able to demonstrate the benefit of the cost for the municipality itself and the cost must be proportionate to the benefit. Case-law shows that a municipality can involve itself in road construction projects beyond its own boundaries, though mainly in adjacent areas. It is unclear where the geographical limit goes for municipalities’ involvement outside the municipality itself.</p>
<p>We propose that municipalities be able to co-finance the construction of public transport structures for which a county council is responsible subject to the same conditions as apply to a municipality co-financing central government roads and railways. This entails an exemption from the geographical limitations that follow from Chapter 2, Section 1 of the Local Government Act. The proposal is submitted in the form of an addition to the Municipal Powers Act.</p>
<h2>Consequences and alternative proposals</h2>
<p>With regard to the consequences of the proposals, our assessment is that value gains compensation can increase the implementation rate for important investments. Value gains compensation in connection with development contracts can also give the actors incentives to find solutions for infrastructure and development that maximise benefits and reduce costs. The proposed provisions on land value capture build on a voluntary basis and their application will depend on whether it is possible to find winning agreements. The companies affected are property owners who want to build on their land and enter into development contracts with the municipality concerned. The socioeconomic consequences are considered cautiously positive. The central government, county councils and municipalities could obtain increased revenues, though they cannot assume this will be the case. The size of revenues is difficult to estimate and will be determined by</p>
<p>the extent to which value gains compensation is used. However, the experience of the 2013 Stockholm negotiation shows that the development value arising from changes in land use and investment in transport infrastructure may be substantial. Based on these experiences, and on international experience, we estimate that funds received from value gains compensation could represent a limited but important part of total public costs for transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>As an alternative to the voluntary system that we advocate, we have also considered the possibility of land value capture being enforced by decision of an authority. We submit an alternative proposal for a binding instrument for land value capture along these lines. One advantage of binding rules is that they make it easier for municipalities to promote equal treatment between property owners, since municipalities can simply take decisions on value gains compensation rather than having to negotiate. Another advantage of binding rules is that case-law can be created, as municipalities’ decisions must be appealable in material respects. This can contribute to predictability.</p>
<p>However, the binding alternative presupposes much more farreaching regulation of the design of the instrument and associated procedures than a voluntary instrument based on agreement. We recommend that value gains compensation should be applicable by means of agreements, because a voluntary instrument is less intrusive for the property owner than binding regulations and such an instrument has better prospects than a binding instrument of leading to a negotiation that generates value for both parties. Our assessment is that a voluntary system has good prospects of being accepted by property owners. This ought to provide better conditions for cooperation and dialogue between municipalities and property owners than binding rules. A voluntary instrument also creates incentives for municipalities to listen to the needs of property owners during negotiations in a way that would not happen in the case of binding decisions by authorities.</p>
<p>A binding instrument presupposes that the authority’s decision can be appealed in material respects. Appeals against authorities’ decisions therefore risk leading to delays in the detailed planning process. A voluntary instrument can delay the detailed planning process since a new issue for negotiation is added in connection with the development contract, but we regard this as marginal since</p>
<p>the new issue will be one of many issues included in the negotiation of the development contract.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our assessment is that a voluntary instrument such as the one we recommend has the best prospects of leading to more efficient and value-generating planning and development.</p>
