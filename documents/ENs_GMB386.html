<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>By order of the Government the Minister of Justice formed a comission for international development cooperation in the legal sector in October 1996.</p>
<p>In May, 1998 the Parliament passed a Government Bill introducing a new programme for development cooperation in Central and Eastern Europe (Gov. Bill 1997/98:70). This new programme, which covers the period 1999-2001, will concentrate on facilitating the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union and, in particular, the accession to the Union of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Furthermore, it is designed to promote closer integration of Russia and Ukraine into the European cooperation structures. Given this orientation, the legal sector will be a priority area for development cooperation. The Government returns to this theme in its Spring Economic Bill (Gov. Bill 1997/98:150), which notes that “Sweden’s development cooperation with Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland will be intensified in order to expedite these countries’ accession to the EU and to enhance the rule of law and reduce crime in our neighbouring region”.</p>
<p>Sweden has spent a total of 63.5 million SEK in the seven years during which development cooperation in the legal sector with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe has been in progress, and about 50 million SEK of this has been allocated to the judicial authorities. The contribution of these four authorities has focused mainly on the Baltic states, at which 90 per cent of the programmes have been directed. The National Police Board and the National Prisons and Probation Administration have accounted for the major share of these activities, while the contributions of the National Courts Administration and the Office of the Prosecutor-General have been on a smaller scale.</p>
<p>During the first years of development cooperation the focus was on supplying equipment for the purpose of modernizing the counterpart organizations in the cooperation countries, police organizations in particular. Starting in 1997, however, the thrust of development cooperation has shifted, and it now focuses almost exclusively on transfer of knowledge and training.</p>
<p>Given the orientation of the new development cooperation programme, rapid intensification of Sweden’s activities in the legal field (justice and home affairs) is essential in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The Commission has decided, in consultation with the Ministry of Justice, to concentrate its work during the spring on this area. The present report therefore deals solely with development cooperation with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The purpose of the Commission’s proposals is to facilitate the necessary intensification of activities by ensuring broader political support and creating an organization that will improve coordination between the judicial authorities.</p>
<p>Since 1989 Sweden’s cooperation with Central and Eastern Europe has been wide-ranging and has involved a large number of public authorities and other organizations. The Commission has been in contact with several of these and has concentrated on the organization and financing of cooperation. We decided to select six sectors in which the organization differs greatly. The Commission has based its proposals on the future orientation of development cooperation in the legal field on the experience gained from these six sectors.</p>
<p>The points of departure for our proposals were as follows: · Under Gov. Bills 1998:70 and 1998:150 the judicial authorities must intensify their operations during the forthcoming programme period. · The cooperation efforts of these authorities will focus mainly on the Baltic states. It should also be possible for Sweden to develop its cooperation with Poland, Russia and Ukraine, assuming that there is a demand and that sufficient resources are available, but there is no scope for  large-scale Swedish input in these countries. · The contribution of the judicial authorities must be based on an integrated approach. This means that the Government, primarily through the Ministry of Justice, must assume effective responsibility for operations and cooperation. It also means that project proposals must be reviewed in a single context. · The guidance of the work of the authorities must improve significantly during the forthcoming programme period. There must be a clearly defined, unified implementation framework both in Sweden and the recipient countries, and development cooperation must likewise command political support both in Sweden and among its cooperation partners. · The Government’s  long-term objective is to build up regular cooperation with the neighbour countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Therefore, the support given under the transitional period must be organized in such a way as to promote lasting contacts and regular cooperation. · Sweden must strengthen its commitment to the EU’s Phare programme, not only because we share responsibility for its operations, but also because of the possibility that Phare can cofinance some of the Swedish projects. Consequently, Swedish experts from the judicial authorities must play a more prominent part in various Phare projects.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the Government, through the Ministry of Justice, initiates discussions with Sweden’s cooperation partners, above all Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, with a view to conclude bilateral agreements on a governmental level concerning development cooperation in the legal sector for the programme period 1999-2001. In preparing for such agreements representatives of the police, the Prisons and Probation Service, the National Courts administration and the Office of the Prosecutor-General in Sweden and its cooperation partners should elaborate plans of action for the forthcoming programme period. Officials from the respective ministries of justice should discuss cooperation on legislation and devote special attention to ensuring that projects are integrated into a coherent framework throughout the judicial chain. This preparatory work should also include assessments of ways of coordinating Sweden’s efforts with those of other countries and of the extent to which these efforts should be channelled through Phare. In order to assure the financing of the proposed projects, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) should participate in the planning phase.</p>
<p>To ensure that the higher level of ambition set by the bilateral agreements can be achieved, the procedures applied by the authorities will have to be modified. They will have to integrate development cooperation more closely into their regular activities. To ensure that sufficient resources are allocated, the managements of the authorities will have to play an active part in decisionmaking and control of the authorities’ participation in development cooperation.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the integrated approach that must characterize Sweden’s cooperation in the legal field, the authorities concerned and the Government Offices will have to find better forms for their cooperation and coordination arrangements. The Commission therefore proposes a working model that is appropriate to the special situation in the law enforcement sector.</p>
<p>We propose that a steering committee be set up for development cooperation in the legal field for the programme period 1999-2001. This committee should consist of the Directors-General (or Deputy Directors-General) of the National Police Board, the National Prison and Probation Administration, the Office of the Prosecutor-General, the National Courts Administration and Sida. In addition, the Government Offices should take part in the committee’s work through the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. A secretary/coordinator should be appointed by the Ministry of Justice.</p>
<p>The steering committee should be assigned the following tasks: · active participation in the preparation of the bilateral agreements · responsibility for ensuring that the intentions of these agreements are fulfilled · assessments of the projects planned by the authorities as to whether they are consistent with the concluded agreements · to promote the  build-up of competence within the judicial authorities concerning international cooperation and within Sida concerning the legal sector and also to promote the exchange of experience between the authorities · attaching special importance to integrating the projects in the cooperation countries into a coherent framework throughout the judicial chain · developing and increasing, together with the authorities concerned, Sweden’s commitment to the Phare projects under way in the cooperation countries · promoting a better coordination between the Swedish projects and the projects of other countries · to identify the needs for financing of  fact-finding missions or other preparatory studies.</p>
