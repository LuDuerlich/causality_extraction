<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>Forms for implementation</p>
<p>The professional drivers directive shall be implemented in Swedish law through legislation. The professional drivers directive should be incorporated by means of a new act, the qualification of professional drivers act, and a new statute, the qualification of professional drivers ordinance. The administrative provisions should in all essentials comprise the directive’s prescriptions and its annexes.</p>
<p>Area of application</p>
<p>The new legislation should be applied to drivers who</p>
<p>• are nationals in a member state within the European Economic Area (EEA) and other nationals employed or engaged by a company which is established within the EEA, and</p>
<p>• engage in carriage of goods or passengers on roads in Sweden which requires the driver qualifications C1, C1E, C, CE, D1, D1E, D or DE according to 2 chap. 5 § of the Driving Licence Act (1998:488).</p>
<p>The legislation shall however not apply to all drivers of vehicles who engage in carriage of goods or passengers. Among others, drivers are exempted who engage in transportation in a national or municipal capacity to protect the state and its citizens.</p>
<p>Driver requirements</p>
<p>To be permitted to drive vehicles which come under the scope of the act, drivers should obtain a certificate of professional competence certifying initial qualification and periodic training. The driver shall also fulfil certain age requirements.</p>
<p>Exemptions on account of acquired rights</p>
<p>Drivers who hold or who have held a Swedish driving licence with one of the following driver qualifications shall be exempt from the requirement to obtain the certificate of professional competence certifying initial qualification:</p>
<p>1. D1, D1E, D or DE issued for the first time before 10th September 2008, or</p>
<p>2. C1, C1E, C or CE issued for the first time before 10th September 2009.</p>
<p>In this respect driving licences issued in other states within the EEA are classed in the same category as the Swedish driving licence.</p>
<p>Carriage of goods</p>
<p>A driver who has obtained a certificate of professional competence for initial qualification for vehicles which require the driver qualification C or CE shall from the age of 18 be permitted to engage in carriage of goods in such vehicles. Alternatively, if the driver has obtained a certificate of professional competence for accelerated initial qualification, from the age of 18 this individual shall only be permitted to engage in carriage of goods with vehicles which require the driver qualification C1 or C1E. A driver who has obtained the certificate of professional competence for the accelerated initial qualification will not be permitted to engage in carriage of goods with vehicles which require the driver qualification C or CE until the age of 21.</p>
<p>Carriage of passengers</p>
<p>A driver who has obtained a certificate of professional competence for initial qualification for vehicles which require the driver qualification D or DE shall from the age of 21 be permitted to engage in carriage of passengers with such vehicles. If the driver has obtained a certificate of professional competence for accelerated initial qualification for vehicles which require the driver qualification D or DE, this individual will be permitted to engage in carriage of passengers with such vehicles from the age of 21, if the vehicle is used for carriage in regular services and if the length of the route does not exceed 50 kilometres. A driver who has obtained a certificate of professional competence for the accelerated initial qualification shall from the age of 21 be permitted to engage in carriage of passengers with vehicles which require the driver qualification D1 or D1E. A driver who has obtained a certificate of professional competence for accelerated initial qualification for vehicles which require the driver qualification D or DE will not be permitted to engage in carriage of passengers with such vehicles until the age of 23.</p>
<p>Initial qualification</p>
<p>Training</p>
<p>A driver shall obtain initial qualification by attending a course at a training centre. The course shall conclude with a test. If the test is successful, a certificate of professional competence shall be issued. Drivers who hold a driving licence may, if there are special circumstances, obtain their initial qualification through a shortened basic course (accelerated initial qualification).</p>
<p>Driving practice</p>
<p>An individual who engages in driving practice does not need to hold a driver qualification for the vehicle. In that case, the driver must however have a provisional driving licence and fulfil the age requirements as well as the requirements pertaining to certain driver qualifications according to the Driving Licence Act. Driving practice shall take place under supervision of an instructor at a</p>
<p>training centre. There should be certain exemptions from the requirements for pupils at upper secondary schools, municipal adult education institutions and independent schools with equivalent courses.</p>
<p>Test</p>
<p>A professional driver trainee shall take the final test in the presence of the National Road Administration or whoever the National Road Administration has appointed to arrange and supervise the test.</p>
<p>Periodic training</p>
<p>Drivers who have obtained their initial qualification through attendance at a basic course and drivers with the acquired right shall undergo periodic training. It shall take place within five years of the date of issuing the certificate of professional competence or, for drivers with the acquired right, within five years of the date from which the Act shall apply. As the drivers have completed their first periodic training they shall undergo periodic training every five years during the period of validity of the certificate of professional competence.</p>
<p>In order to be permitted to return to the occupation of road haulage operator or road passenger transport operator, a driver who has not completed the prescribed periodic training shall undergo a periodic training course. A driver who is engaged in carriage of goods or carriage of passengers and who has completed periodic training should not be obliged to undergo additional periodic training during the period of validity of the certificate of professional competence.</p>
<p>A periodic training course shall comprise 35 hours. The course may be divided into sub-courses comprising at least seven hours. Individual elements in the course should be permitted to consist of simulator training or distance tuition.</p>
<p>Certificate of professional competence and Community code</p>
<p>The National Road Administration shall issue a certificate of professional competence to a driver who has completed the prescribed training. The Community code shall be indicated on the certificate. A certificate of professional competence for drivers issued in another state within the EEA is valid in Sweden according to its contents.</p>
<p>A driver who is a national of a country outside the EEA and who is employed or engaged by a company which is established within the EEA and which is engaged in carriage of goods or passengers by road must be able to demonstrate that he or she has the prescribed qualification and training.</p>
<p>A driver who is in engaged in carriage of goods or passengers and who comes under the requirement to hold a certificate of professional competence should carry the requisite documents on their person. It might be the certificate of professional competence, or another certificate in combination with a document authenticating the driver’s identity.</p>
<p>At the request of a vehicle inspector or policeman, the documents shall be presented for inspection.</p>
<p>Certificate of professional competence etc. should be registered by the National Road Administration. As soon as possible after the driver has completed the periodic training course, the training centre should report the necessary data to enable the National Road Administration to make a decision on awarding the certificate. The training centre should keep notes on the driver’s attendance at the periodic training course. When assessing what periodic training remains for the driver to be considered to have completed the course, the individual in question may include subcourses which he or she has completed at other training centres etc.</p>
<p>Drivers who are not nationals of an EEA state, but who are employed or engaged by a company within the EEA which is engaged in carriage of passengers must be able to demonstrate their professional driver qualification by means of either</p>
<p>1. The Community code marked on the Community model driving licence,</p>
<p>2. certificate of professional competence for drivers marked with relevant Community code, or</p>
<p>3. a national certificate mutually recognised by the member states within their respective territories.</p>
<p>Place of training</p>
<p>A driver who is a Swedish national or a national of another state within the EEA shall obtain the initial qualification in Sweden if he or she is permanently resident in the country. If the driver is not a national of a state within the EEA but is employed or engaged by a company which is established within the EEA he or she shall obtain the initial qualification in Sweden if a permanent residence permit or a work permit has been issued in this country. All these drivers shall also undergo periodic training in Sweden if they are permanently resident in the country or work here.</p>
<p>Training centres</p>
<p>The training centres referred to in the professional drivers directive shall be designated training centres (utbildare för yrkesförarkompetens). Training centre refers to the physical or legal person who supplies basic training or periodic training for professional driver qualification. The training activities should be carried out solely by the training centre who has a permit. Permits may be awarded to instructors if they are judged with regard to their economic and general circumstances to be qualified to conduct the operation in such a way as to satisfy the requirement for satisfactory training in accordance with the application. The licence may be subject to conditions. Upper secondary schools, municipal adult education institutions or independent schools with equivalent courses should not be obliged to have a permit.</p>
<p>A training centre shall have an approved manager, who is responsible that the activities covered by the permit are pursued in such a way that the requirement for satisfactory driver training is met.</p>
<p>Supervision</p>
<p>The National Road Administration should exercise supervision over the training activities according to the qualification of professional drivers act. With regard to the supervision of the testing operation at upper secondary schools, municipal adult education institutions or independent schools with equivalent</p>
<p>courses, the National Road Administration shall consult with the National Agency for Education. The National Agency for Education carries out supervision of the courses at these training institutions in other respects.</p>
<p>If a supervising authority requests it, a licence holder shall provide entry to the centre and its accompanying premises and supply documents which relate to the operation, as well as assist in the supervision. Those who have been granted a permit should be obliged to report certain changes in the operation.</p>
<p>Cancellation of permit or approval</p>
<p>The National Road Administration should be able to cancel the permit for a training centre if the centre is shown to be unsuitable to run the operation, the training activities are carried out in contravention of the applicable regulations or in an otherwise unsatisfactory manner, training is not carried out or the training centre requests it. If the National Road Administration finds that the individual approved as manager is unsuitable, the approval should be withdrawn. The same applies if the activities are carried out in such a way that the requirement for satisfactory training is not fulfilled or regulations are not followed. Instead of cancelling a permit or approval, the National Road Administration may issue a warning if it can be assumed that the training centre or manager will correct the fault or shortcoming.</p>
<p>Penalty provisions</p>
<p>It should be possible to fine those individuals who, intentionally or through negligence, infringe the requirement that the training centre shall have the authorities’ permission to carry out operations. A driver who is not carrying the prescribed certificate of professional competence and thereby violating the regulations should be sentenced to fines specified to a maximum sum. It should apply irrespective of whether the action was intentional or negligent. The driver should however not be sentenced if he or she has notified the fact that the certificate has been destroyed or been lost.</p>
<p>Appeals etc.</p>
<p>It should be possible to appeal a decision of an administrative authority at a general administrative court. Leave to appeal shall be required for appeals to the administrative court of appeal. A decision of an administrative authority according to the act, or according to instructions that have been issued by virtue of it, should apply immediately if not otherwise stipulated in the decision.</p>
<p>Authorization</p>
<p>The government, or the authority decided on by the government, should issue further regulations in certain respects. The National Road Administration is responsible for execution of tasks in accordance with the new legislation. Exemptions should apply for the areas where the tasks fall on the National Agency for Education.</p>
<p>Entry into force and provisional regulations</p>
<p>It is proposed that the act enters into force on 10th September 2006. The provisions regarding the requirement for initial qualification and periodic training to engage in carriage of passengers with vehicles which require the driver qualifications D1, D1E, D and DE shall apply from 10th September 2008. The provisions regarding initial qualification and periodic training to engage in carriage of goods with vehicles which require the driver qualifications C1, C1E, C and CE shall apply from the 10th September 2009.</p>
