<h1>Summary – Careers for quality</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>If Sweden and Europe are to be able to compete with the surrounding world in the global knowledge economy, an attractive career system is needed for academic teachers and researchers. More than one third of all staff at Swedish universities and other higher education institutions have fixed-term contracts. Vague and insecure terms after the completion of a doctorate hamper recruitment to the academic world. At the same time, changes in employment protection lead to difficulties in continuing with a system involving many fixed-term appointments (see Appendix 3, Changes in the Employment Protection Act).</p>
<p>In view of this, the Government decided in April 2006 to appoint an Inquiry Chair to review current career structures at higher education institutions. The terms of reference of the Academic Career Inquiry were to examine the current academic employment structure and propose improvements to achieve an efficient and coherent qualification and career path for both women and men at higher education institutions and in relation to the community as a whole. The Inquiry was also to examine whether employment procedures were appropriate and effective, to throw light on the situation of academics on fixed-term contracts and to examine how the Higher Education Act and the Higher Education Ordinance stood in relation to the Employment Protection Act (LAS) (see Appendix 1, Terms of reference). The Inquiry has had a reference group at its disposal (see Appendix 2, Reference group).</p>
<p>The post-doctoral situation – the period from the doctoral degree until permanent employment – has been identified as the main problem. However, the excessively detailed management of recruitment and appointment procedures in the Higher Education</p>
<p>Ordinance has also been put forward as a factor hampering the development of a modern, strategic employer’s responsibility.</p>
<p>The overall objective of the Inquiry is to enable the country’s higher education institutions to secure high operational standards in the long term by developing a strategic employer’s responsibility and an active employer’s role combined with secure, clear terms of employment for staff and a well-functioning system for recruitment, careers and promotion. This includes enabling higher education institutions to carry out their various tasks in the best possible way and to be attractive working places that are equipped to compete in both national and international contexts. Gender equality is naturally a precondition for this.</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, the task of proposing a coherent career path leads to a form of report that describes the individual’s progression through the career structure, and may give the impression that the Inquiry has focused on the interests of the individual. However, the Inquiry’s deliberations have focused to an equal extent on future needs for quality, based on the sector’s strategic and overall conditions.</p>
<p>Implementation of the Academic Career Inquiry’s proposals as presented in Careers for quality will mean:</p>
<p>Sound, clear conditions for attracting and keeping the most suitable teachers/researchers by giving them good, clearly defined positions at the start of their careers and through well-functioning terms of employment irrespective of the source of their salaries, and strategic, active and clear employer’s responsibility.</p>
<p>Transparent and functional career and promotion paths, by introducing more career stages that provide a progressive and internationally comparable promotion system encompassing all permanently employed academically qualified staff.</p>
<p>Higher standards in the recruitment of teachers/researchers by giving them clearly defined positions at the start of their careers for strategic recruitment in national and international competition, instead of fixed-term contracts and subsequent conversion to an open-ended contract on the basis of the Employment Protection Act.</p>
<p>Greater gender equality through clearer and more attractive career paths and a new possibility for the free nomination of professors from the under-represented gender.</p>
<p>Improved mobility via shorter, clearer routes into the academic career and suitable career stages for national and international recruitment.</p>
<p>Greater exchange with other parts of the labour market and the business sector through more local self-determination with regard to teaching categories, qualification criteria and assessment grounds, opportunities for promotion of academically qualified staff and the opportunity to appoint adjunct professors and lecturers without limiting their period of appointment.</p>
<p>More efficient and appropriate appointment procedures by reducing the number of central rules and increasing local self-determination.</p>
<p>Greater self-determination by delegating regulatory powers concerning teaching categories other than professors, more precise definitions of qualification criteria and assessment grounds and regulation of the appointment procedures in local appointment rules.</p>
<p>Fewer yet more flexible fixed-term appointments governed by the rule of law by removing some of the special rules, replacing the position of research assistant by appointment as associate senior lecturer with a right to be considered for promotion, extending application of the rules on damages and other protective rules in the Employment Protection Act to also include the special fixedterm positions at higher education institutions, and enabling the social partners to regulate this in collective agreements.</p>
<p>An invitation to a national systems thinking approach concerning teachers and researchers as a strategic resource. The Inquiry report draws attention to the importance of employers as well as financing bodies (funders) drawing up strategies for the career development of academic teachers and researchers. Everyone, at every stage of their career, should be given the opportunity for in-service education and better employability. Since responsibility is shared, everyone’s initiatives need to be coordinated so that the whole has a greater impact than the sum of its parts.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Starting points</p>
<p>The Academic Career Inquiry’s work and proposals are based on a number of basic assumptions.</p>
<p>Gender equality is a prerequisite</p>
<p>Enabling women – who now make up the majority of students, and half of those obtaining doctorates – to be recruited as teachers and researchers to the same extent as men and giving them the same opportunities for an academic career is not just a question of democracy and fairness but also very much a question of quality.</p>
<p>Part of the international knowledge society</p>
<p>Higher education and research are key resources in the knowledge society. Our prospects for success depend on our ability to attract, keep and develop the best employees. Developing knowledge is complex and a cost-driving factor and therefore requires increasingly intensified international cooperation and mobility between higher education institutions both nationally and internationally. Strategic deliberation on both the content and organisation of education and research is becoming increasingly crucial to success. The extent to which knowledge can be translated into production and growth also has a decisive influence.</p>
<p>Our employment structures and career paths must be attractive and have a high degree of comparability in international contexts. All higher education must in principle be based on research and ensuring that both research and teaching are part of the duties of teachers is therefore an important issue for the future. The dual role of researchers as teachers determines the quality of higher education and the level of recruitment to the researcher career.</p>
<p>However, quality and success are not just a question of attractive terms of employment and career systems; they are equally a question of strategic leadership and of the employer role. Recruitment in open – national and international – competition must increasingly replace the “informal recruitment” that prevails at present. It is important that the academic world is given an opportunity to develop its employment structures and recruitment procedures more independently and in more flexible forms than is possible today. The central role of the sector in the knowledge economy in interplay with the rest of the community also increases demands for the area to be given conditions that more closely resemble those applying to the rest of the labour market.</p>
<p>The higher education sector is moving from constant growth to balanced excellence</p>
<p>The Swedish higher education system has begun a process of transformation – a new phase in its development. Centuries of more or less constant expansion appear to have come to an end. On the education side, declining numbers of applications speak for themselves. For research, fulfilment of the EU objective of one per cent of GDP for publically funded civil research – the Barcelona Strategy – still means continued expansion, but the growing complexity of knowledge production, and endeavours towards concentration, profile development and cooperation mean the end of general growth for everyone. The allocation of resources – both of direct and external resources – will increasingly take place in competitive forms.</p>
<p>The pre-conceived idea that growth would be constant is one major explanation for the weak leadership of higher education institutions, including poorly developed employer’s responsibility for teachers and researchers, frequently sloppy recruitment routines and a polarised workforce, with many in insecure posts and a high level of employment protection for a minority. Through a culture of internal recruitment with an unclear structure, this has also contributed to a lack of mobility. A well-balanced status quo with regard to higher education places and resources, where success and possible growth increasingly depend on developing profiles, cooperation, expertise and excellence within more or less given frameworks – “balanced excellence” – requires clearer leadership. In the future, the management of higher education institutions must not only assume greater strategic responsibility for deciding who is to be included in an organisation, but must also build up better mechanisms for caring for them.</p>
<p>Freedom under responsibility</p>
<p>Researchers must be independent and free in their role as seekers and creators of new knowledge. Academic freedom, however, is not the same as institutional or administrative freedom. Concentration, profile development and cooperation together with increased competition for research resources in Europe and globally require greater strategic leadership. The Inquiry’s point of departure is that this type of more extensive strategic responsibility for an organisation and its staff is conditional on higher education institutions having greater freedom to set up rules for recruitment, appointments and promotion locally. When it comes to scope for fixed-term contracts, regulation of this should take place in collaboration with the social partners and in the form of collective agreements.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s opinion, greater freedom via locally established appointment rules in the higher education institution’s employment procedures will automatically lead to them taking greater responsibility. Individual interpretations of the national regulatory framework – often at Head of Department level – can now be replaced by efforts at institutional level to create and apply procedures that are adapted to the institution’s own specific needs. Decentralised regulatory powers such as these will simultaneously provide a new arena for trade union negotiations.</p>
<p>The EU and Community law frameworks</p>
<p>In the EU, the Lisbon and Barcelona Strategies have led to the establishment of the European Research Area (ERA). In the Green Paper ‘European research area: new perspectives’, the Commission develops its vision of an ‘internal market’ for research with free movement for researchers, technology and knowledge. The rules for the ERA concerning personnel strategy issues are developed in the Commission’s recommendation on a Charter for Researchers and a Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers (2005/51/EC), which represents an important background document for the Inquiry’s proposals.</p>
<p>Gender equality and women’s opportunities with regard to higher education and research are an important part of EU research policy. Equal treatment of both sexes is also a well-developed area of Community law. Gender mainstreaming – i.e. that gender equality objectives are continually integrated into the design of important systems and policies – is the general approach and is also the way in which the Academic Career Inquiry has performed its assignment.</p>
<p>In the Council Directive concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work (1999/70/EC) (the Fixed-Term Work Directive) there are rules aimed at improving the quality of fixed-term work and preventing the abuse of consecutive fixed-term appointments. The Fixed-Term Work Directive has served as a guideline for the proposals presented by the Inquiry, both as regards the special regulations in the Higher Education Ordinance and access to protective regulations and sanctions.</p>
<p>Regulation of Higher Education and the Employment Protection</p>
<p>Act</p>
<p>The basic rules about when fixed-term employment – fixed-term contracts – are permitted are to be found in the Employment Protection Act. On 1 July 2007 through amendments to the Employment Protection Act, that which is termed ‘general fixed-term employment’ replaced a number of previous special regulations on fixed-term contracts, such as project appointments. General fixedterm employment can be used freely, but after 24 months of employment within a framework period of five years, it automatically becomes permanent employment. From 1 January 2008, this also includes substitute posts. The conversion of a fixed-term contract to an open-ended contract on the basis of the Employment Protection Act may apply to teaching posts such as lecturers and senior lecturers at higher education institutions, but does not apply to professors, nor – under the Inquiry’s proposals – to associate professors. Appointments other than the specially regulated teaching appointments at higher education institutions may be directly based on the Employment Protection Act (LAS). This applies, for example, to researchers, who are called ‛ LAS researchers’ in the Inquiry report, i.e. researchers who have obtained their employment under the terms of the Employment Protection Act.</p>
<p>The existing career structure and the need for change</p>
<p>When examining the existing career structure, the Inquiry has identified a number of shortcomings, illustrated in Figure 1 below. One shortcoming is that there are no clear entrance positions in the academic career. This applies particularly to the early postdoctoral period after a doctoral degree and is symbolised by the ‛post-doctoral cloud’. It is, however, also clear that current qualification-enhancing positions, including those of research assistants and associate senior lecturers are used to a distinctly limited extent. Instead the group of LAS researchers – people who are often on fixed-term contracts based on the Employment Protection Act – has grown considerably in recent years.</p>
<p>Surrounding Labour Markets</p>
<p>These shortcomings reduce the attractiveness of the academic career, contribute to the lack of mobility and are bad for gender equality. They thus give rise to concern from the quality point of view, since they mean recruitment in forms other than open competition. The latter problem is underlined in the study of postdoctorate careers commissioned by the Academic Career Inquiry – see Appendix 6, The post-doctoral period for people obtaining doctorates in academic year 1998/99 – which shows that a main route to an academic career today seems to be through conversion of a fixed-term contract as a senior lecturer to one which is openended, all under the Employment Protection Act.</p>
<p>Another deficiency in today’s career structure that can be seen in Figure 1 is that there is no step in the career path after the qualification-enhancing positions of research assistant and associate senior lecturer. This becomes particularly clear in an international comparison. It is also reflected in the fact that the Swedish higher education system has maintained the review system for docent (associate professor/reader) despite the fact that this position has long disappeared from the career structure. A review is also made of associate senior lecturers prior to promotion to permanent positions as senior lecturer, and the requirement is that ‘the employee is formally qualified for such an appointment and is in addition deemed suitable in the light of the grounds of assessment established by the institution for promotion’. However, lecturers who have obtained their doctoral degrees are also subject to review for promotion to senior lecturers, but in this case, their formal qualifications are sufficient to obtain such appointments. The result is an asymmetrical entry into senior lecturer posts and a lack of clarity in the progression of the career ladder. It would be reasonable to expect that after four years in a qualification-enhancing position, a person has achieved a markedly higher level of qualification than simple formal qualification for a senior lectureship, and that this is also reflected in the career ladder.</p>
<h2>Proposals</h2>
<p>A coherent career path</p>
<p>The Academic Career Inquiry’s proposals for a new coherent career path for quality are outlined in Figure 2.</p>
<p>Lecturers with basic eligibility for education at research level</p>
<p>The Inquiry makes the assessment that teachers with doctorates are an important quality factor in higher education. While lecturers without doctorates will continue to be needed at higher education institutions, an important structural precondition is that they generally fulfil the requirements for entry into education at research level. For this reason, the Inquiry proposes that basic eligibility for education at research level is introduced as a qualification requirement for a lecturer.</p>
<p>New post-doctoral position – the first step on the career ladder</p>
<p>A two-year post-doctoral position will be introduced as a first step on the career ladder. Unlike general fixed-term employment based on the Employment Protection Act, this position can be extended by up to one year for such reasons as parental leave and an extensive teaching load. The post-doctoral position will allow a person who has recently taken his or her doctorate to further develop, disseminate and make use of his or her research, and will provide an opportunity for reflection and decisions concerning the future direction of his or her career. The position can also be used to combine activities inside and outside academia. A post-doctoral position should be available for application by people who have obtained doctorates no more than three years prior to the application date, and must be advertised and filled in open competition. Considerably more people than those who subsequently continue in an academic career should be given such positions.</p>
<p>The post-doctoral position will help disperse the post-doctoral cloud and replace informal recruitment into general fixed-term employment with recruitment in open competition. It will thus be a clear, attractive career stage for both women and men, which will promote mobility at the early stages of people’s careers.</p>
<p>Associate senior lecturer to replace research assistant</p>
<p>The position of associate senior lecturer will replace that of research assistant. At present, both are clear qualification-enhancing positions in the academic career and the changes in the Employment Protection Act can be expected to lead to greater use of these instead of general fixed-term employment, since both types of employment can last considerably longer than 24 months. Employment as an associate senior lecturer which comprises the right to a review for a permanent position, is an attractive post for both women and men (see Appendix 7, VIP lane or B-team? Study of the associate senior lectureship form of employment). International comparisons show that the position is also an important personnel strategy instrument for promoting quality in recruitment (compare Chapter 3, International comparisons and Appendices 4, The System of Academic Tenure in the United States and 5, Career structures at universities and other higher education institutions in the USA).</p>
<p>The risk that staffing needs would be quickly saturated through this type of recruitment, which in the long-term often – but not always – becomes permanent employment, is refuted by the estimates for the next ten-year period as presented in Appendix 8,</p>
<p>Recruitment and retirement in higher education in the next decade. Keeping the post of research assistant, in combination with other opportunities for fixed-term positions, may lead to an inexcusably prolonged series of consecutive fixed-term positions. Associate senior lecturer appointments should be open for application by people with doctorates received no more than five years prior to the application date, and must be advertised and filled in open competition. Here too, there will be scope for extending the period of employment, which is four years in principle, when there are special reasons for doing so.</p>
<p>Appointments as associate senior lecturer will be a clear and attractive step on the career ladder for both women and men, which will lead to permanent employment within a reasonable time and will promote mobility in the early phases of people’s careers. At the same time it will be a quality-promoting recruitment instrument both nationally and internationally with the potential of being an alternative to conversions to open-ended contracts on the basis of the Employment Protection Act, primarily in respect of senior lecturer posts.</p>
<p>Associate professor – new career stage</p>
<p>The associate senior lecturer will be subject to review for promotion to associate professor, a new career stage that is needed for a progressive career system. The new career stage will not entail any major change compared with today’s career structure, but can be seen as a development of the review conducted when appointing docents. For those currently holding the title of docent, a radically simplified procedure could be used in their promotion to associate professor. It must of course also be possible to use the position of associate professor for external recruitment. Just as is now the case for professors, it should not be possible to obtain a conversion to an open-ended employment contract as an associate professor under the Employment Protection Act, via a substitute position or general fixed-term employment.</p>
<p>The new post as associate professor will help make the career structure progressive and consistent. It will make the career more attractive by adding a further career stage and will facilitate national and international recruitment of talented researchers who have not yet reached the level of full professor. All this will increase quality and promote mobility.</p>
<p>Coherent employment in several stages with the right to promotion</p>
<p>The above flow diagram of the career structure proposed can be interpreted so that the fields coloured in green represent a coherent employment process in several stages. The colour green represents permanent employment.</p>
<p>The right to promotion significantly contributes to enhancing the attractiveness of the academic career and gender equality in higher posts. The Inquiry’s proposals mean that for a teacher who is permanently employed, the path to promotion according to merit is open. This right to promotion naturally also includes the new career stage of associate professor. As has already been noted, promotion from the position of senior lecturer to associate professor should in fact be able to replace today’s docent review in the future. The Inquiry also proposes that other academically qualified people in permanent posts – for example those who have acquired permanent positions in research posts under the Employment Protection Act – could, after application, be promoted to a permanent post as associate professor or professor. Being able to promote academically qualified staff other than teachers will prevent a “shadow structure” of other teaching and researcher staff from being made permanent and may become an important bridge from surrounding labour markets into an academic career.</p>
<p>Evaluations of the promotion reform have shown that this has essentially become a reform in titles. In the Inquiry’s opinion this is actually a precondition for retaining the right to promotion. Changes in the conditions of operations require clear scope for strategic managerial decisions and are not compatible with strongly standardised job descriptions. At the same time it is natural that promotion is accompanied by a certain wage growth and that the employer uses staff according to their skills.</p>
<p>The appointment process – deregulation and greater selfdetermination</p>
<p>Delegated regulatory power</p>
<p>The Academic Career Inquiry proposes that a clear career path and career structure continue to be regulated in the Higher Education Ordinance. Higher education institutions are however authorised, in their appointment rules, to issue provisions on teaching categories, with the exception of professors, other than those given in the Higher Education Ordnance, and on the assessment grounds that are to apply when appointing and promoting such teachers. The appointment rules must also include the rules that the higher education institution applies with regard to appointments, promotions and positive action. The higher education institution may also include in these rules more detailed provisions on the eligibility requirements and assessment grounds that are to apply concerning the teaching categories regulated in the Higher Education Ordinance.</p>
<p>Review procedure to continue</p>
<p>It will still be possible to apply for review of an appointment decision via the Board of Appeals for Higher Education, but now in the light of both the regulations in the Higher Education Ordinance and the local appointment rules of the higher education institution. In this matter, the Inquiry finds that application of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and developments in Sweden concerning the review of central government appointment decisions in general, has led to the Inquiry being unable at present to come to any other conclusion. In future, however, there should be scope, in a broader context – central government appointments in general – to consider whether the extent of review procedures should be limited, and no longer comprise a full review of the decision appealed, but consist primarily of cassation and/or damages, as in the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>Eligibility and promotion</p>
<p>Eligibility requirements for employment as a professor, associate professor and senior lecturer are proposed to include academic, pedagogical and other expertise and to require training in teaching and learning methods in higher education. According to the main rule, a person is qualified for appointment as a lecturer if he or she has basic eligibility for studies at research level. For the post-doctoral and associate senior lecturer qualification-enhancing positions, the main criteria to be used in an assessment are the requirement for a doctorate and academic expertise.</p>
<p>As previously, the discipline for the appointment after promotion must normally be the same as that of the previous appointment, but can be changed via a decision of the vice-chancellor. The vice-chancellor also determines the name of the discipline when promoting an academically qualified person other than a teacher.</p>
<p>Preparation of appointments to be regulated locally</p>
<p>It is proposed to abolish most of the many rules of the Higher Education Ordinance concerning appointment procedures, including the rules involving expert opinions, and to replace them by local regulations in the appointment rules of each higher education institution. However, the Higher Education Ordinance still contains rules on requirements for advertising vacant posts and a rule that the body preparing appointments and any expert groups are to be adequately balanced with regard to gender representation. The specific eligibility rules and assessment grounds that exist for different teaching positions, and the principles generally applying to the exercise of official authority will continue to require thorough preparation of appointments in higher education institutions that will often include some type of external assessment. This applies in particular to the qualification-enhancing position of associate senior lecturer and the posts of associate professor and professor – those posts in which attainment of a conversion of the employment contract under the Employment Protection Act is not possible. The higher education institution’s credibility in national and international contexts also requires careful regulation of the appointment procedure in the appointment rules.</p>
<p>Nomination as a gender equality tool</p>
<p>The possibility to nominate a specific person to an appointment as professor will be introduced. The rule is designed as a gender equality tool. If there is unequal gender distribution, a person of the underrepresented sex can always be nominated. Otherwise, when there is an unequal gender distribution, nomination requires exceptional grounds. If the point of departure instead is equal gender distribution, special grounds are sufficient. The vice-chancellor is always the person to take the strategically important decision to nominate a professor, and this right to decide cannot be delegated. A nomination is conditional on the person in question being eligible for appointment as professor and also assessed as being suitable in a review according to the assessment grounds established by the higher education institution.</p>
<p>Positive action</p>
<p>The rule of Chapter 4, Section 16 in the Higher Education Ordinance will be eliminated since the lack of clarity concerning positive action and preferential treatment has led to it no longer being used. Existing scope for positive action should continue to be regulated locally in the appointment rules of the higher education institution. Recruitment targets should continue to be set, both by the Government and locally.</p>
<p>Fixed-term contracts in higher education</p>
<p>Fewer fixed-term contracts</p>
<p>According to Section 2 of the Employment Protection Act, special regulations such as those in the Higher Education Ordinance take precedence under the principle of lex specialis. The special rules on fixed-term contracts are to be found in Chapter 4, Section 30 of the Higher Education Ordinance. In addition to the situations listed in this provision, an appointment may be limited to a fixed term under the Employment Protection Act if it does not concern a professorship or – in the Inquiry’s proposal – an associate professorship.</p>
<p>The Academic Career Inquiry proposes certain amendments to Section 30 to the effect that the possibility of a one-year initial ‘probationary employment’ for lecturers and senior lecturers be abolished, as well as the three-year fixed-term employment of people who have permanent positions at other higher education institutions. The limitation on the period of employment is removed when appointing adjunct lecturers and professors, which is always conditional on the employee having his or her main activities elsewhere outside the higher education system. The period of employment for visiting teachers is shortened to three years, while the special rule for teachers in artistic disciplines remains unchanged in principle, as is the rule for part-time teachers.</p>
<p>Improved rule of law</p>
<p>For reasons of fairness and because the Fixed-Term Work Directive requires that the Swedish legislator introduce severe and effective sanctions also with regard to abuse of the rules on consecutive fixed-term appointments in the public sector, the Inquiry proposes that a number of protective rules concerning fixed-term appointments in the Employment Protection Act are made applicable to fixed-term appointments under the Higher Education Act. Damages should be paid when these rules are abused.</p>
<p>Greater flexibility via collective agreement regulation</p>
<p>Allowing adjustment of labour legislation via collective agreements is characteristic of Swedish labour law. The Academic Career Inquiry proposes that it be possible to replace the special rules on fixed-term appointments in Section 30 of the Higher Education Ordinance with collective agreements if the social partners agree on this. This is in line with regulations in the higher education sector becoming more aligned with those of the labour market in general and provides openings for more flexible adjustment to the special needs of higher education – generally, subject-specifically and locally.</p>
<p>The special Ordinance on Research Councils’ Appointments will be adapted to the career structure proposed by the Academic</p>
<p>Career Inquiry. It is proposed to abolish the possibility of employing professors for a limited period of sex years.</p>
<p>Teachers and researchers – a strategic resource</p>
<p>In the European Commission’s recommendation for a European Charter for Researchers and The Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers (see Chapter 2, The European Union and the Community law framework), attention is given to a stimulating research environment and an attractive career system as an integrated part of institutional quality assurance. A strategic approach to human resources issues – from recruitment and management to career support and professional development – is both a necessary and natural process in the shift from constant growth to a development characterised by balanced excellence, which is the present situation of higher education and research in Sweden.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that universities and other higher education institutions must take full employer’s responsibility for all staff, irrespective of the source of funding, and must therefore face the same risks as other employers with regard to the unpredictability of the future. A broader strategic employer’s responsibility must be created and this is ultimately the responsibility of the board of the higher education institution. It is also this board that will decide on the appointment rules that will be so important in the future.</p>
<p>Chapter 8, Teachers and researchers – a strategic resource describes how retirement rates and today’s recruitment paths are related to the career structure proposed by the Inquiry. The aim is to provide examples of the possible dimensions of the reform if the predominant recruitment and career path were instead post-doctoral position – associate senior lecturer – associate professor – professor. The Academic Career Inquiry considers that an important factor for achieving quality is that a considerably larger proportion of new recruitment is conducted via qualification-enhancing positions advertised in open competition than is the case today. The</p>
<p>European Charter for Researchers and The Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers also emphasises the importance of employers and funders drawing up strategies for the career development of researchers.</p>
<p>All researchers, at every stage of their careers, should be given the opportunity for in-service education and better employability. Career counselling should therefore be introduced at all higher education institutions.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>The proposals presented by the Inquiry should be seen as a cohe- rent whole and the greatest impact for increased quality will natu- rally be achieved if the report’s proposals are implemented in a coherent package of measures. The Inquiry proposes 1 July 2009 as a suitable date for such implementation. However, implementing parts of the Inquiry’s proposals earlier could be considered. The proposals whose implementation, in the opinion of the Inquiry, is particularly urgent concern the introduction of a qualification- enhancing post-doctoral position of two years and transitional measures concerning the integration of so-called LAS researchers.</p>
