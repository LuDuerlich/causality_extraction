<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Inquiry remit was to:</p>
<p>• submit proposals, on the basis of existing structures, for how more efficient work to prevent violent extremism can be developed and organised at national and local level; and</p>
<p>• develop training material on violent extremism that can be used to prepare and train those who are involved in various ways in this preventive work.</p>
<p>The emphasis is on violent  extremism, in other words violence that is committed by extremists for political/ideological reasons.</p>
<p>Although the Inquiry’s proposals focus on crime prevention work to combat violent extremism, we also emphasise that this is ultimately about how we in society lay the foundations of confidence and build up faith in democracy and human rights. In other words, preventive work can never just be about measures to prevent young people from being drawn into crime with political/ideological motives – we must have a broader perspective than this.</p>
<h2>Definition of extremism</h2>
<p>The Inquiry remit was to propose how violent extremism can be prevented, irrespective of what ideological motives may be behind it. We stress that it is possible to be radical and to want to drastically change society without being an advocate of violent extremism. Extremism is about intolerance of opinions and interests that are not consistent with one’s own. Extremists claim to stand for what is right and good. Anyone else who has opinions that differ from theirs is wrong and stands for what is evil. Extremists who overstep the mark and resort to violence always use arguments to make their acts of violence appear rational and justified. Those who adopt violent extremism often have violent tendencies to begin with. This means that an individual’s original violent tendencies, combined with social criticism or some form of political frustration, may be the most important warning signals for a development towards violent extremism.</p>
<h2>A structure for preventive work</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Government establish a national coordination unit for the prevention of violent extremism. Our main proposal is that the coordination unit be placed as a division at the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention and that the Council be allocated additional resources for this assignment. Alternatively, the Inquiry considers that the national coordination unit for the prevention of violent extremism could be established as an independent body with its own staff. The national coordination unit should be established indefinitely.</p>
<p>The remit of the national coordination unit should be to develop and support local cooperation in the prevention of violent extremism, based on the Danish SSP model (cooperation between schools, social services and the police). In support of this work, a national coordination group should be set up, with the core members being representatives from the Swedish Police, the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions, the National Board of Health and Welfare and – because of the specific type of crime the remit involves – to some extent also the Swedish Security Service.</p>
<p>It is not part of the Inquiry’s remit to propose how crime prevention work in Sweden should be organised in general. For this reason, the proposal that the national coordination unit for the prevention of violent extremism base its work on the SSP model does not include any requirement that a uniform structure for all crime prevention work in the country be designed according to this model. It is up to others outside of the Inquiry to decide this. However, the SSP model or variations on the same set-up are already in place in several Swedish municipalities and the Inquiry considers it to be a very suitable template structure for the prevention of violent extremism. The core at local level consists of the municipality and the police, and beyond this core there is flexibility to be able to involve the key actors that need to be involved in order for the work to be effective, given the circumstances of each individual case. This includes not only government agencies but also actors such as associations, religious communities and parts of the local business community.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also considers that the Nordic countries would benefit from cooperating on preventive work to combat violent extremism. In the Inquiry’s view, the Swedish Government should therefore actively promote the development of joint preventive work to combat violent extremism at Nordic level.</p>
<h2>The remit of the national coordination unit</h2>
<p>The remit of the special coordination unit should include:</p>
<p>• gathering and disseminating relevant Swedish and international research and other knowledge on the prevalence of violent extremism and effective preventive work to combat it;</p>
<p>• providing advice and support to local actors that identify extremism problems and take preventive measures to stop these problems from taking root;</p>
<p>• taking responsibility for, administering and developing the training material produced by the Inquiry;</p>
<p>• offering regular basic and  in-depth training to relevant professional groups on violent extremism and how it can be prevented;</p>
<p>• annually inviting relevant actors involved in work to prevent violent extremism to coordination talks so that all resources can be used effectively and gaps or duplicate work in the area can be avoided; and</p>
<p>• continuously following up on going work to prevent violent extremism.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the national coordination unit have staff corresponding to five full-time positions. The coordination unit should be established permanently, which means that the cost will be permanent. The Inquiry proposes that the national coordination unit be evaluated in its fourth year of operations. This evaluation should include an evaluation of staffing and of the scope, structure and direction of activities. If the national coordination unit is established as an independent body, the evaluation should include a re-examination of whether its activities should come under the activities of the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention or of another crime prevention agency.</p>
<h2>Purpose and key points of training material</h2>
<p>The purpose of the training material for preventive work to combat violent extremism was formulated on the basis of the Inquiry’s terms of reference on three fundamental points:</p>
<p>• To create awareness</p>
<p>• To disseminate knowledge</p>
<p>• To propose methods</p>
<p>The Inquiry has chosen to set up a simple website for the training material, making it possible for any future owner to continuously update and thus assure the quality of the content. The material is intended for the dissemination of knowledge to a broad target group, primarily police officers, employees of the municipalities’ social services and staff in schools, but also people working in the judicial system, prison officers, youth leaders, association officials and other relevant actors.</p>
<p>The training material also includes proposals for methods to use in preventive work. These are methods that can be used in the training, but also as tools when meeting individuals at risk of joining violent extremist movements. The Inquiry does not claim to present the  comprehensive training initiative or method that is best for solving the problem. We present a proposal for a reasonable and wellconsidered first step on a long training ladder that requires competent ownership for its administration and development. This provides the opportunity for a future owner to influence the future design of the training ladder, which increases the chances of the first step of the ladder being better adapted to the educational activities of the organisation in question.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the training material is to contribute to an increased awareness among relevant professional groups by disseminating knowledge about what violent extremism is and why and how it can attract young people. Another purpose is to highlight potential signs that could be used to identify people who could be at risk of being drawn into such environments, and to learn to</p>
<p>recognise and understand the behaviour of young people who risk becoming radicalised.</p>
<p>The training material also contains proposals on what can be done to prevent this happening. The Inquiry has come up with two approaches where the focus is on dialogue. The first targets joint action groups and offers the possibility of strengthening the shared work process through discussion and reflection exercises. The second method approach is a dialogue series for meetings with young people who risk being drawn into violent extremism. It builds on the Norwegian model of ‘concern dialogues’ and is being developed to create greater opportunities for continuous dialogue and follow-up.</p>
<p>The Inquiry stresses that violent extremism is one of several perspectives in the field of crime prevention, and that the training measures can therefore not be completely separated from other related subjects. A young person who risks becoming radicalised may at the same time have committed other types of crime or be at risk of, for example, drug abuse. The target groups that work on prevention must be able to develop their knowledge and their ability to place violent extremism in a wider context.</p>
