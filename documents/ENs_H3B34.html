<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>According to the directives, the inquiry shall analyse the possibility of introducing a tonnage tax system in Sweden and in conjunction with this it will also review other existing aid for the maritime industry. The inquiry shall submit a proposal for a comprehensive tonnage tax system and, to the extent that it is deemed necessary, submit proposals for amendments to existing support for the maritime industry. The directives explain that the task must be seen against the background of increased international competition in the maritime sphere and the declining number of Swedish flagged ships in recent years. The aim is to increase the proportion of Swedish flagged ships in the Swedish merchant navy. According to the directives, the objective is for Sweden to have a competitive shipping industry in an international perspective.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The inquiry has, within the framework of the directives, drawn up a proposal for the regulation of a tonnage tax system. A tonnage tax system is an alternative taxation method to corporate taxation. The tonnage tax system is intended to be directed to shipping companies operating maritime transport of goods and/or passengers. One of the requirements to be approved for tonnage taxation is that the company operate a qualified shipping operation with qualified ships.</p>
<p>The main features of a tonnage tax system are that a company pays corporation income tax on an amount that is calculated using a standardized approach and not the real result. A company calculate the tonnage income based on the net tonnage of the companyâ€™s qualified ships.</p>
<p>The majority of EU member states with a significant maritime transport sector, have a tonnage tax system. The aim of the proposed tonnage tax system is to contribute to a competitive environment so that the number of ships in the Swedish registry increases.</p>
<h2>A tonnage tax system</h2>
<p>The inquiry has drawn up a proposal for the regulation of a tonnage tax system. The report proposes that the material rules on the calculation of profits of certain shipping operations shall be incorporated in the Income Tax Act (1999:1229) in a new chapter with the title, Tonnage taxation of operations. The inquiry also proposes that the rules of procedure be incorporated into the Tax Procedures Act (2011:1244), here too mainly in a new chapter with the title, Approval of Tonnage Taxation.</p>
<p>The tonnage tax system will be voluntary for companies. Any company that wishes to be part of the tonnage tax system should apply to the Swedish Tax Agency which, if conditions are fulfilled, will approve the company for tonnage taxation. An approval for tonnage taxation means that the profits from certain operations, - qualified operations -, are calculated according to the provisions of the Income Tax Act referring to tonnage taxation of operations. Under the tonnage tax system companies will be taxed based on the net tonnage on the ships and not based on the economic result.</p>
<p>A prerequisite for operations to be qualified operations is that they are carried out using qualified ships. Qualified ships are those that have a gross tonnage of at least 100, that have their strategic and financial management in Sweden and that during the tax year are mainly used for international transport or domestic transport in another country.</p>
<p>For a ship to be qualified, it must be part of a fleet of a specific nature. A ship is only qualified if at least 20% of the gross tonnage of the ships included in tonnage taxed operations are owned or chartered in on bareboat terms by the company operating the ships. For a ship to be qualified it is also required that at least 20% of the gross tonnages of the ships included in tonnage taxed operations are registered in the Swedish register. Furthermore, the proportion of gross tonnage of the ships included in tonnage taxed operations that are registered in a register within the European Union (EU) must either increase or be maintained during the tax year. There is one exception in respect to the requirement on EU registered tonnage that must either increase or be maintained. If at least 60% of the gross tonnage in tonnage taxed operations or in other tonnage taxed operations within the same group are registered in a register within the EU, no requirement is imposed that tonnage must increase or be maintained during the tax year.</p>
<p>Qualified operations are transport of goods or passengers on qualified ships (maritime transport) and operations necessary for or closely related to maritime transport. A prerequisite for such necessary or closely related operations being qualified is that compensation for operations are included in compensation for maritime transport. The qualified core operations are thus maritime transport and its necessary or related operations. Qualified operations also include certain combined transport services and qualified ships chartered out on bareboat terms during temporary excess capacity.</p>
<p>Operations that are necessary for or closely related to maritime transport refer to operations such as transport to and from the ship in the port area, loading and unloading of goods, embarkation and disembarkation of passengers, temporary storage of goods, ticket sales and booking of maritime transport and the running of freight and passenger terminals. The said operations are examples of operations which, by their very nature, are considered to be necessary for or closely related to maritime transport.</p>
<p>Certain operations on board ships used for maritime transport are also included in the area of qualified operations. These onboard operations are the sale of goods for consumption on board, catering on board, rental of premises on board as well as light entertainment and other activities provided during the maritime transport and included in the price of maritime transport.</p>
<p>Tonnage taxation means that incomes for tax purposes are determined on the basis of the ship's net tonnage. Tonnage tax, unlike conventional taxation, is not based on profits. The taxable income does not consist of the surplus from commercial operations, but by a standardized calculated income based on the net tonnage of the ships. This is called tonnage income. A company that has chosen tonnage taxation is thus not taxed on the basis of actual income gained by tonnage taxed operations and, as a consequence, a deduction may not be made from tonnage income. The tonnage income must be calculated for each qualified ship on the basis of the ship's net tonnage per 100 net tons at a fixed amount. It is proposed that the fixed amount be indexed and follow the general Swedish price level. The inquiry proposes that the fixed amounts consist of a percentage of the Swedish price base amount. The calculated tonnage income will be added to the taxpayer's other income from business operations and be taxed at the appropriate tax rate.</p>
<p>Companies which after the entry into the tonnage tax system are carrying out mixed business operations must distribute assets and liabilities, including untaxed reserves, to their respective business operations. If equipment can be regarded as equipment utilized in both tonnage taxation operations and conventional taxation operations, the equipment shall be allocated to the business operation where the equipment is to be mainly used. Ships that are to be used in the tonnage taxation operation shall be allocated to that business operation. If other assets or liabilities are to be distributed between business operations, the allocation is to be made on the basis of what is reasonable. The distribution must be carried out at the beginning of the first tax year using tonnage taxation.</p>
<p>During the transition to tonnage taxation, companies will in many cases have provisions, deficits and accumulated accelerated depreciation, i.e. residues of the conventional taxation method. Previous years' provisions to periodic allocation funds, compensation funds and expansion funds are not to be included in tonnage taxed operations, but shall be returned in accordance with the provisions in Chapters 30, 31 and 34 of the Income Tax Act, hence they shall be reported in the conventional taxation. The same principle applies to previous years' deficits. Previous year's deficits are not included in tonnage taxed operations, but may, in so far as possible, be deducted within the framework of conventional taxation under existing provisions in Chapter 40 of the Income Tax Act.</p>
<p>According to the directives of the inquiry, deferred tax of accumulated over-depreciation should not be remitted, but nor should taxation of these liabilities be made immediately. Furthermore, it is stated that the method of taxation of deferred tax liabilities chosen by the inquiry should aim at encouraging companies to maintain or increase the activities of the company at the time of the transition to tonnage taxation. Deferred tax liabilities consist mainly of accumulated over-depreciation on ships. The inquiry proposes that cumulative over-depreciation, to the extent that it is attributable to equipment included in tonnage taxed operations, shall be determined as a differential amount. If the book value of ships and other equipment in the tonnage taxed operations at the end of the tax year immediately preceding the first tax year of tonnage taxation should be greater than the fiscal value, the difference shall be determined as a differential amount. A special allocation must be made in the company's accounts for the differential amount. The allocation must be made from the first year with tonnage taxation. If the differential amount is reported as income, fully or partially, the allocation shall be reduced by the corresponding amount.</p>
<p>The differential amount shall be reversed for taxation. If a company has increased both its total net tonnage and the owned share of the net tonnage, reversal does not need to take place. If the total and owned net tonnage is unchanged or has been reduced, however, 25% of the differential amount is reported for taxation. If the proportion of net tonnage has been reduced by more than 25%, the differential amount must be reported for taxation at the amount corresponding to the proportion of reduced net tonnage. The differential amount should be taken up as income under Chapter 15 of the Income Tax Act, i.e. in conventional taxation.</p>
<p>A reconciliation of net tonnage for reviewing whether the differential amount should be reported for taxation must be carried out in the fifth tax year of tonnage taxation and every five years thereafter in relation to the previous reconciliation. The differential amount must be reversed for taxation no later than the date the company leaves the tonnage tax system and resumes conventional taxation. When leaving the tonnage tax system or in the case of withdrawal of approval of tonnage taxation, the differential amount, or what remains of it, is reported as income in the last year with tonnage taxation or in the tax year when withdrawal takes place.</p>
<p>During the time with tonnage taxation, companies which operate both tonnage taxed operations and other operations taxed conventionally, called mixed business operations, shall continuously allocate income and expense items, as well as assets and liabilities, to the operations where they belong. A company that has mixed business operations and financial income or expenses must allocate these in proportion to the assets' book value in each of the activity areas. If a company can show a more appropriate basis for distribution, such as one based on turnover, another allocation principle may be applied. The principles for allocation must be specified in the application for approval for tonnage taxation. Other income and expense items that cannot be attributed to either tonnage taxed or conventionally taxed operations must be allocated between tonnage taxed and conventionally taxed operations on the basis of what is reasonable. Ships that are categorised as equipment in tonnage taxed operations may not at the same time be categorised as equipment in other business operations. If equipment other than ships is included and used in both tonnage taxed and conventionally taxed operations, they must be allocated to the operation where they are mainly used.</p>
<p>For tonnage taxed operations accounts and documentation must be easy to identify and follow. For value transfers to or from tonnage taxed operations, the so-called arms length principle should be applied. The rules on withdrawal taxation shall be applied when assets are transferred from one part of business operations that are conventionally taxed to a tonnage taxed part. In the case of transactions between tonnage taxed operations and other operations, these must be treated as if the transfer of assets and services were made with compensation equal to the market value.</p>
<p>An approved application to be included in the tonnage tax system should be valid for a period of at least ten years. During this time, the company has committed itself to comply with the conditions for tonnage taxation. Just as it is optional for companies to be part of the tonnage tax system, after a period of at least ten tax years with tonnage taxation a company may withdraw from the system and go back to conventional taxation. Changes between tonnage taxation and conventional taxation caused by variations in business cycles or income trends in a company are not possible in the short run. A request for withdrawal must therefore be made in good time and be received by the Tax Agency at least four years before the last year in which tonnage taxation will take place. If the time period under tonnage taxation will have lasted for at least ten years (period of validity) the withdrawal will be granted.</p>
<p>It must not be permissible to directly switch between tonnage taxation and conventional taxation to obtain tax benefits. A company that withdraws from the tonnage tax system is therefore prevented for a restriction time of at least ten years from being allowed to re-join the tonnage tax system.</p>
<p>If a company no longer fulfils the conditions for the tonnage tax system, tonnage taxation may not continue. The approval for tonnage taxation must then be revoked. Revocation will be carried out if the conditions for tonnage taxation are no longer met; for example, if the requirement that at least 20% of the gross tonnage of the ships that are included in the tonnage taxed operations must be registered in the Swedish register is not met. Revocation may also be carried out if the accounting or documentation obligations are not fulfilled or if the Tax Evasion Act (1995:575) has been applied to the company approved for tonnage taxation.</p>
<p>Revocation of approval for tonnage taxation means that tonnage taxation should never have been applied. The legal conditions for reviewing the taxation decision, however, limit the possibilities of re-establishing taxation for the whole period. If approval of tonnage taxation is revoked, a review of taxation must be carried out in accordance with the provisions in the Tax Procedure Act (2011:1244). This means that a review through additional taxation, for example, may be made up to six years after the end of the tax year. A company may not deduct any deficits for the taxation years which the withdrawal applies to. Revocation of approval for tonnage taxation shall also apply to the remaining years of the period of tonnage taxation.</p>
<p>Restriction time must also be applied in the case of withdrawal of approval for tonnage taxation. The restriction time for reintegration in the tonnage tax system in the case of withdrawal shall run for a period of at least ten taxation years from the end of the year of withdrawal.</p>
<p>If there are exceptional circumstances, however, the withdrawal of approval may be omitted. An example of exceptional circumstances is if the requirement that 20% of the gross tonnage must be recorded in the Swedish register is not met temporarily due to an ordered ship not being delivered in time.</p>
<p>In the case of withdrawal of approval for tonnage taxation, a withdrawal fee is charged. The withdrawal fee consists of two parts: a basic fee and an additional fee. The basic fee is calculated on the basis of the previous tax years that the revocation refers to. The additional fee is calculated on the basis of the tax years which revocation refers to but is not used for calculation of the basic fee.</p>
<p>When withdrawing from the tonnage tax system or on withdrawal of approval, the acquisition value and acquisition charges for assets and liabilities that are included in operations that have been tonnage taxed are calculated as during initiation of taxation, according to the provisions of Chapter 20a of the Income Tax Act.</p>
<p>For companies included in a group, there is a special condition: they may only be accepted for tonnage taxation if all the companies within the group that intend to conduct qualified operations apply for approval of tonnage taxation simultaneously. For companies included in groups, special regulations should also apply during the time they apply tonnage taxation. In the case of changes of ownership or operations within a group that result in companies with qualified operations being included in a group with tonnage taxed companies, yet without approval for tonnage taxation, such qualified companies must apply for approval within three months. The period of three months shall be calculated from the date when the change took place. In the event of mergers and fissions involving companies that are approved for tonnage taxation, rules are proposed regarding the application for approval of tonnage taxation. In the case of changes in ownership or operational changes in a group, as well as mergers and fissions, the period of validity may be changed for the companies involved depending on the period of validity applied to the last company approved for tonnage taxation.</p>
<h2>Aid pursuant to the Ordinance on Maritime Transport Aid</h2>
<p>Maritime transport aid is paid to employers in accordance with the Ordinance (2001:770) on Maritime Transport Aid, the amount being equal to the tax paid by the employer on seafarers income, employers' social security contributions and general payroll tax for all seafarers working on Swedish-registered cargo and passenger ships. Maritime transport aid was extended in June 2014 from ships carrying out transport of goods or passengers mainly used in international traffic of importance for Swedish foreign trade or Swedish export of services, to ships used in traffic that is subject to international competition in the maritime transport market. In addition to cargo and passenger ships, other types of ships such as research ships, survey ships, cableand pipe laying ships, supply ships and crane ships will be qualified to apply for maritime transport aid. Ships such as tugs and dredgers will also be qualified, but in line with the EU guidelines more than half of their total operations must consist of maritime transport and the maritime transport aid will be granted only for the time when the ship is engaged in maritime transport operations. The new regulation means that, in addition to cargo and passenger ships, other ships may also qualify for maritime transport aid. To give examples, this applies to cable laying ships, survey ships and supply ships. Tugs and dredgers may also qualify for maritime transport aid if the operations constitute maritime transport for half of the aid period.</p>
<p>The inquiryâ€™s directive (dir. 2013:6) clearly states that maritime transport aid shall remain essentially unchanged. The inquiry sees Swedish maritime transport aid as well-functioning and competitive in relation to other countries' manning aid. Hence the inquiry concludes that the current aid to maritime trade in accordance with the ordinance on maritime transport aid ought to remain unchanged. In order to finance the tonnage tax system, changes may be required that in term of the amount of aid correspond to a part of the costs of the tonnage tax system.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>Companies that are subject to tonnage tax will be taxed on the amount of net tonnage they own or operates during the year. In order to obtain a general idea of the consequences, the inquiry has made certain assumptions on which companies are deemed likely to enter into the tonnage tax system. The assumptions of the inquiry are based on the companies having qualified ships, that the operations are qualified and that there are financial reasons for enter into the tonnage tax system. The report has assumed that companies which obtain tax benefits from enter into the tonnage tax system and companies that have an age structure of 15-20 years in their fleets will enter into the system. There are 23 such companies with 125 qualified ships at their disposal. The proposed tonnage income levels, with a corporate income tax rate (22%), will raise approximately SEK 3.8 million annually from these companies. These companies pay a yearly average of around SEK 48.8 million in corporation income tax. The inquiryâ€™s proposal to finance the introduction of tonnage tax is based on three sources of funding. The three sources of funding are tonnage tax, interest on the abovementioned differential amounts and a minor reduction in the level of existing maritime transport aid.</p>
<p>It is mainly the Tax Agency that is deemed to have increased costs for the introduction of the tonnage tax system. Initially, the estimated costs amount to approximately SEK 2.2 million. This cost includes the development of forms, information material and the development of new computer systems. Running costs are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 320,000 per year.</p>
<p>Companies involved are assumed to have increased administrative costs for the calculation of tonnage income for each ship and for auditing consultants.</p>
