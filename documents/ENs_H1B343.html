<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>We were tasked with developing a strategy for long-term sustainable land use (ToR 2011:91). The final report is to be delivered on 15 June 2014.</p>
<p>Long-term sustainable land use is essential if we are to achieve the generational goal and many of our environmental quality objectives. At the same time, how we use land has great significance for several industries, such as agriculture, forestry, tourism and energy production. Land use also plays an important role for infrastructure, regional development, the cultural environment, outdoor activities and recreation. To achieve long-term sustainable land use, many different interests and demands must be considered, and social objectives must be counterbalanced in the long-term. The strategy aims to carry out this long-term political counterbalancing.</p>
<p>In this interim report, we focus on the protection and management of land and freshwater areas and on environmental consideration in the forestry sector. Our next and final report within the framework of the strategy will contain an analysis of how the management of land use can be improved to promote a more holistic approach. We will also discuss the issue of how to achieve the sustainable use of agricultural land.</p>
<p>In SOU 2011:34, the Cross-Party Committee on Environmental Objectives proposed five interim targets on biodiversity. The Government approved the interim targets on 26 April 2012. These interim targets are an integral part of the strategy for long-term sustainable land use.</p>
<h2>Our proposals – prioritised measures based on long-term counterbalancing</h2>
<p>Holistic approach to land policy</p>
<p>Long-term sustainable land use requires us to see the landscape as a whole. During the course of our work on the strategy, we have seen how difficult it is for central government administration to take a holistic approach, and that this can create problems in the surrounding society. In our next report within the strategy, we will tackle the overarching issue of how the management of land use can be improved to achieve a more holistic approach. The coordination of central government administration is related to this overarching issue. Because the need for strengthened coordination of central government administration is very clear to us, we do not see any reason to delay proposing this interim target and therefore present the proposal now.</p>
<p>We therefore propose:</p>
<p>• An interim target on a more holistic approach to the use of land through strengthened coordination in central government administration.</p>
<p>Appropriate nature conservation</p>
<p>Appropriate nature conservation with regard to the protection, management and restoration of particularly valuable areas is necessary in order to reach the environmental quality objectives. In this respect, we discuss nature conservation on land and in freshwater areas.</p>
<p>We consider that the functionality of Swedish work on the protection of land and freshwater areas needs to increase by strengthening the ecological connections in the landscape and the level of ecological representation in protection. This is important if the environmental objectives are to be achieved and if we are to live up to our international commitments in the Nagoya protocol under the framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity.</p>
<p>The state is a significant landowner and holds areas that are entirely or partially set aside for agriculture and forestry. Therefore the state has a major responsibility to act as a role model as a landowner.</p>
<p>We therefore propose:</p>
<p>•  An interim target on the protection of land and freshwater areas.</p>
<p>Here we also raise two particularly important issues through assessments:</p>
<p>• An assessment concerning prioritised management and restoration initiatives.</p>
<p>• An assessment that the state should be a role model as landowner.</p>
<p>Environmental considerations in forests</p>
<p>Current forestry policy is based on freedom with responsibility in forestry. Forestry legislation specifies the minimum level for environmental consideration in forestry. In addition to this, considerable voluntary initiatives from the forestry sector are required if the environmental objectives regarding forests are to be achieved. Central government funded initiatives should be focused on stimulating voluntary initiatives. We emphasise the importance of continued ambitious voluntary initiatives. It is also important to ensure that a minimum level of environmental consideration is clearly stated in the Forestry Act. We also need to secure the conditions for varied forestry.</p>
<p>The overall economic, social and environmental values of forests need to be highlighted more from a long-term perspective. Farreaching consensus with regard to desirable development and priorities in forestry policy should be sought. Based on this, we see a need for a national forestry programme.</p>
<p>We therefore propose:</p>
<p>• An interim target on the clarification of environmental consideration in the forestry legislation.</p>
<p>• An interim target on varied forestry.</p>
<p>• An interim target on a national forestry programme.</p>
<p>Here we also raise two particularly important issues through assessments:</p>
<p>• An assessment that voluntary environmental consideration initiatives in forestry are crucial to achieving the environmental quality objectives regarding forests.</p>
<p>• An assessment concerning prioritising of central government initiatives for increased environmental consideration in forestry.</p>
<h2>Overall impact assessment</h2>
<p>We present an overall impact assessment of our strategy. Specific impact analyses are linked to the different proposals.</p>
<p>Our proposals are based on the fact that the efforts of the whole of society are required if the environmental quality objectives are to be achieved. Our proposals contain a combination of voluntary and central government initiatives. We consider that this combination of initiatives is appropriate and cost-effective for creating the conditions to achieve the environmental quality objectives and other important social objectives.</p>
<p>The proposed interim targets do not conflict with Sweden’s commitments as a member of the European Union or its other international commitments.</p>
<p>The interim targets concerning the protection of land and freshwater areas and the clarification of environmental consideration in the forestry legislation may lead to a small change in the supply of forest raw materials. However, it is considered that the reduction in supply will be so minor that it would only have a marginal impact on forest industry economy and central government tax revenues. Neither will the proposals significantly change the conditions for the use of biofuel or Sweden’s ability to reduce its climate impact or meet its international climate policy commitments.</p>
