<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Broadband Committee’s assignment has been to submit proposals for a national IT infrastructure programme and for how the aid allocated by the State for the interurban network is to be used.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the national IT infrastructure programme should include initiatives in the following areas: 1. Svenska Kraftnät’s buildout of a national backbone network according to Government decision N1999/11617/SÄ. 2. State aid to area networks according to SOU 2000:68. 3. Tax reduction where the connection cost of building networks is substantially more expensive than normal according to the proposal for a law on tax reduction of expenses for certain connections for telecommunications and data communications (Gov. Bill 2000/01:24). 4. State aid to interurban networks. 5. Competence-enhancing measures in the IT infrastructure field including research and development. 6. Measures to realize an IT infrastructure with the best possible design and function.</p>
<p>Points 4, 5 and 6 are covered by this committee report.</p>
<p>These three points, which correspond to Chaps. 3, 7 and 2 in this report, are summarized below together with a summary of chapters 4–7.</p>
<h2>Future IT infrastructure (Chap. 2)</h2>
<p>The main track for the buildout of IT infrastructure is that it should be carried out by the market on a commercial basis. Where the market does not fully assume this responsibility, the State can support the buildout via incentive grants. However, it is important that the reliability and security of the network are adequate and that functioning competition exists between network operators and service operators. The State should therefore give particular attention to certain aspects: network structure, nodes, security, reliability, open network, price-setting, quality, interaction and guide documentation.</p>
<p>Network structure and nodes are above all aimed at achieving a smoothly functioning, cohesive IT infrastructure throughout the country. The redundancy in the network should be very good. The goal is that no more than 100 households should lose their connection in the event of an outage. A properly built node system also facilitates interconnection of different operators’ networks, benefiting competition. This in turn requires agreements on interconnection which, aside from the regulations in the Telecommunications Act, should also be achieved via industrywide agreements.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the review of the Telecommunications Act planned by the Government also explore the possibility of introducing compulsory notification for all operators who provide network capacity and electronic communications services. The same review should consider whether general conditions regarding planning, building, planning etc. of IT infrastructure should be introduced.</p>
<p>The State should take the initiative in arranging an annual conference on IT infrastructure questions.</p>
<p>A main node system is proposed to be built so that each such node covers 20,000 to 40,000 households. Responsibility for this should primarily be borne by the market in consultation with municipalities. It is proposed that the nodes be classified into two security classes. It is proposed that The Swedish Post and Telecom Agency (PTS) be given the task of devising such a classification system.</p>
<p>Security and reliability are provided primarily by means of a redundant network structure. Security questions are regulated today in the Telecommunications Act and via instructions to PTS. For the IT infrastructure that is now in the process of being built up, PTS should be commissioned to analyze how the Telecommunications Act is to be applied.</p>
<p>Open network and open line are important fundamental concepts to obtain a well-functioning market in IT infrastructure and service offerings. The rules governing access and interconnection should be revised in connection with the upcoming review of the Telecommunications Act, while at the same time industry-wide agreements on interconnection should be reached. To guarantee openness in the entire network up to the end customer, building networks should also be covered by access regulation. In our opinion, these aspects should also be taken into account in the review of the EU’s directives in the area and when implementing the directives in Swedish legislation.</p>
<p>The goal for the price policy is that the end customer price for communications services should be distance-independent, while a certain reasonable difference can be accepted in connection cost.</p>
<p>For network buildout financed by State aid, the traffic tariff should be distance-independent within the municipality. The municipalities can regulate prices in the agreements they sign with the network operators.</p>
<p>In order to be able to maintain high and consistent quality, it is important that it be made clear what a customer is buying from his network operator. It is proposed that the Swedish Agency for Administrative Development’s and the IT Commission’s specification of Internet services be used in the procurement of services. The industry should agree on how operator performance is to be measured and how the results are to be presented to the customers.</p>
<p>To develop interoperability between different players in the IT infrastructure segment, it is proposed that the IT Infrastructure Commission be given the task of exploring such interoperability questions.</p>
<p>It is also important that the buildout of the IT infrastructure be documented in different ways, in terms of both programme documents and accounting documents. It is therefore recommended that the municipalities establish municipal IT infrastructure programmes. This will be a requirement for obtaining State aid. Furthermore, it is proposed that the IT Infrastructure Commission be commissioned to design a GIS system for documentation of the IT infrastructure buildout.</p>
<p>The Committee has also submitted proposals for a terminology within the IT infrastructure field aimed at providing uniform definitions in the field.</p>
<h2>Aid to IT infrastructure (Chap. 3)</h2>
<p>The State has appropriated SEK 2,050 million for aid to an interurban network. The Committee proposes that the appropriated aid be destined for conurbations with fewer than 3,000 inhabitants. It is assumed that larger conurbations will obtain access to IT infrastructure with a high transmission capacity on a purely commercial basis within four years.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that SEK 1,750 million be distributed as funding for aid to the primary municipalities and SEK 250 million as a county kitty to the county administrative boards or regional self-government bodies. The aid is intended to cover some of the cost of building an interurban network.</p>
<p>The aid should primarily be used to procure networks. In cases where no tenders, or no acceptable tenders, are received, the municipalities can themselves choose to build, own and operate the networks.</p>
<p>The funding for aid to the municipalities has been distributed according to a theoretically calculated total cost which each municipality can be expected to incur in building a comprehensive interurban network. The distribution is presented in Appendix 11. The county kitty has been distributed in a similar manner.</p>
<p>A number of conditions must be met for utilization of the funding for aid. The first fundamental condition is that the municipalities have established a municipal IT infrastructure programme.</p>
<p>The municipal IT infrastructure programme shall describe the current situation and needs, the desired IT infrastructure in ten years, which parts are not expected to come about within four years on a purely commercial basis, the geographic and chronological priorities which the municipality believes the buildout should follow, how price aspects for the end customers are taken into consideration, and how collaboration with nearby municipalities has taken place.</p>
<p>In addition to the precondition of a municipal IT infrastructure programme, the following preconditions shall also be fulfilled:</p>
<p>The aid may only go to publicly available telecommunications networks where the network owner undertakes to grant the use of network capacity to anyone who asks for it, i.e. provides open line.</p>
<p>The aid may only go to connections whose capacity is such that they are able to convey multimedia services with good quality. Here it is assumed that the connection is designed to handle the number of users who are connected.</p>
<p>Aid may only be used for connections which are prioritized for reasons of regional or industrial policy. Such a prioritization of conurbations is set forth in Annex 7.</p>
<p>In order to obtain aid, procurement of the network buildout shall take place in such a way that competition on the market is not distorted. If no tenders are received, or no tenders that satisfy the tendering requirements are received, the municipalities may themselves build, own and operate the network.</p>
<p>The municipality may require that the aid be reflected in the prices which the end customer in the municipality has to pay. As far as the traffic tariff is concerned, the municipality may require that it must be distance-independent within the municipality.</p>
<p>Aid may be used to build new connections. Aid may also be used to obtain access to existing connections, provided that the contractual conditions are sufficiently long-term.</p>
<p>All municipalities are required to arrange co-financing of at least SEK 400 per inhabitant for building of interurban networks. For certain municipalities, this is sufficient to build a comprehensive interurban network. These municipalities are therefore not entitled to aid. A total of 258 municipalities are entitled to aid, however. These municipalities have costs to build an interurban network that are higher than their own stake of SEK 400/inhabitant. The aid varies from a few kronor per inhabitant up to several thousand kronor per inhabitant, depending on local conditions such as length of network, number of conurbations and number of inhabitants.</p>
<p>The municipalities apply for aid to the county administrative boards or regional self-government bodies, which consider applications based on the municipal IT infrastructure plans and other conditions described above.</p>
<p>The distribution model for the aid cannot take into account all local conditions that influence the municipality’s costs for building a network. The county kitty can therefore be used to permit any inequities in the model to be offset. The county kitty can further be used to build important networks which the municipalities do not regard as their priority concern or networks which for other reasons are not realized.</p>
<h2>Administrative aid (Chap. 4)</h2>
<p>In order to draft local IT infrastructure programmes, the municipalities receive administrative aid which is paid as a lump sum. The amount of the aid is dependent on the size of the municipality and varies from SEK 80,000 to SEK 200,000. Altogether about SEK 31 million is distributed to the municipalities in administrative aid.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the county administrative boards or regional self-government bodies receive an administrative grant for the tasks that are assigned to them during the four-year period. More than ten million kronor is to be distributed among the county administrative boards or regional self-government bodies for this.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Swedish Association of Local Authorities receive SEK eight million, distributed over four years, in grants to assist the municipalities with support and advice with their IT infrastructure programmes, tendering information, contract conditions, competence, etc.</p>
<p>A total of SEK 50 million is to be used for administrative aid.</p>
<h2>Trunkway (Chapter 5)</h2>
<p>The Broadband Committee presents a survey of existing, available trunkway. The survey provides shows that there is between 1,800 and 2,700 km of existing, available municipal trunkway in the form of empty tubing.</p>
<h2>IT Infrastructure Commission (Chap. 6)</h2>
<p>The Committee proposes that an IT Infrastructure Commission (DIT) be established and given the task of studying questions that concern the application of the aid and the IT infrastructure in general. The Commission should also be given responsibility for studying competence questions and promoting information and interoperability. It is assumed that the Commission will be active during the period 2001–2004 and will then propose which national authority should subsequently assume responsibility for these matters. It is proposed that the Commission be funded via appropriation 37:1 with approximately SEK five million per year.</p>
<h2>Competence, research and development (Chap. 7)</h2>
<p>In this chapter the Committee calls attention to the need for large investments, mainly in research and development but also in more advanced university education in the field. Otherwise there is a risk that a shortage of competent personnel will create a bottleneck to future growth in the IT infrastructure field. The Committee wishes to see a consortium between the State and the business community to develop services and products. An investment of the equivalent of SEK 100 million per year is necessary if Sweden is to retain and advance its leading position in the field.</p>
<p>The competence need in the municipalities is also elucidated. Both politicians and engineers must be able to obtain a quick education in matters relating to IT infrastructure. Here the Swedish Association of Local Authorities has a function to fill. The grant paid to the Association described above under the section ”Administrative aid” is a part of this.</p>
