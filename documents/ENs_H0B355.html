<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background and the Committee’s remit</h2>
<p>Previous reports</p>
<p>The Committee has previously submitted two interim reports. The first, Constitutional protection for digital cinema and other matters concerning freedom of expression  (SOU 2009:14), laid the groundwork for Government Bill 2009/10:81 and led to a number of constitutional amendments that entered into force on 1 January 2011.</p>
<p>The second interim report, presented in October 2010, was entitled A new fundamental law on freedom of expression? The Freedom of Expression Committee presents three models  (SOU 2010:68). This report took the form of a contribution to debate, aimed at encouraging a discussion on the possible shape of an alternative to the present constitutional regulations in the Freedom of the Press Act (FPA) and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression (FLFE).</p>
<p>The Committee’s remit</p>
<p>The Committee’s terms of reference cover a wide range of issues, with the main task being to try to find a new regulatory model that is independent of technology. The terms of reference instruct the Committee to consider whether to retain technology-dependent constitutional regulation of freedom of the press and of expression and to analyse the potential advantages and disadvantages of technology-independent regulations.</p>
<p>According to the Government, the Committee was to proceed on the assumption that the fundamental principles of freedom of the press and of expression legislation – such as sole responsibility, the jury system and protection of sources – are to remain firmly in place.</p>
<p>The Committee was also instructed to analyse whether other means of distributing opinions to the public apart from the traditional media may need to be protected by the principles of freedom of the press and of expression legislation. At the same time, the Government indicated that an analysis should be made of how to separate off the distributional forms for which the Instrument of Government and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms are considered to provide adequate protection.</p>
<p>If the Committee should conclude that it is not possible to find a new technology-independent regulatory model that provides sufficiently strong protection, the terms of reference instruct us to undertake a general review of the FPA and the FLFE. The purpose of this review would be to make these two fundamental (constitutional) laws as clear and easily applicable as possible, for example by considering whether it is possible to transfer detailed provisions to ordinary laws.</p>
<p>The Committee was also instructed to study whether the protection of individual integrity and privacy should be strengthened in the area under constitutional protection. The remit also included investigating whether the possibilities of ‘offsetting’ legal costs in freedom of the press and freedom of expression cases should increase and whether the position of individuals with respect to media companies should be strengthened in any other way.</p>
<p>Our remit also included considering the possibility of providing increased international legal assistance in the area regulated by the fundamental laws.</p>
<p>The Committee’s terms of reference are attached in annexes 1, 2 and 3.</p>
<p>The Committee’s interim report</p>
<p>The debate report (SOU 2010:68) outlined three models for a new fundamental law on freedom of expression: the responsibility model, the operational model and the purposive model. All three assume that constitutional protection is conditional on the opinion being expressed in a mass medium.</p>
<p>The responsibility model assumes that someone steps forward clearly and takes responsibility for the opinion expressed. This can occur either in the form of a publication authorisation for the mass medium concerned or by publication of a declaration of responsibility.</p>
<p>The operational model offers automatic constitutional protection to a person whose operations consist mainly of the professional production or dissemination of mass media. Others can obtain constitutional protection for their mass media by publishing a declaration of responsibility in the mass medium concerned.</p>
<p>The purposive model instead concentrates on the purpose, the aim, of an expression of opinion. The protection would apply to expressions of opinion with opinion-forming, journalistic, literary or artistic purposes.</p>
<p>In the subsequent debate and the comments made by referral bodies, the models received varied assessments. The responsibility model met with widest approval but was also considered to have clear deficiencies.</p>
<p>The Committee chose to focus its continued work on carving out an alternative from the three models that could be compared with the two existing fundamental laws in the area.</p>
<p>Work on a new fundamental law on freedom of expression</p>
<p>The model produced by the Committee has gone under the working name New Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression  (NFLFE).</p>
<p>The aim has been to make the regulation of freedom of expression as technology-independent as possible.</p>
<p>A fundamental prerequisite for constitutional protection under the NFLFE is that the opinion is expressed in a mass medium . The legislative text defines mass media as “media intended for the dissemination of opinions to the general public”. Unlike in the present regulations, this means that the scope of the regulations is not tied to certain specified mass media or technologies for producing or distributing media or expressions of opinion.</p>
<p>Under the NFLFE, the fundamental law will automatically apply to mass media published by a mass media company . The term ‘mass media company’ refers to associations and individuals whose main operations consist of publishing mass media on a professional basis. Other actors (e.g. non-profit organisations and private persons) will be able to obtain constitutional protection if they possess a publication authorisation  or if the mass medium is provided with a declaration of responsibility .</p>
<p>As in the current regulations, the NFLFE contains various exceptions from constitutional protection. One new feature in the NFLFE is that in certain cases exceptions are made for the treatment of personal data in the mass media. This concerns treatment of personal data for purposes other than those indicated in the provision on purposes in the NFLFE. The exception only applies to mass media published by parties other than mass media companies and is intended to avoid conflicts with the EU Data Protection Directive.</p>
<p>As regards the fundamental principles of legislation on freedom of the press and of expression (such as the prohibition of censorship, protection of sources, sole responsibility and special judicial procedures), in all essential respects they are regulated as in the FPA and the FLFE.</p>
<p>It may also be mentioned that the NFLFE imposes a general time bar of six months from the publication of the expression of opinion for bringing public prosecution. Compared with the regulations under the FLFE, this shortens the statutory limitation period for freedom of expression offences on websites.</p>
<p>The NFLFE is described in section 8.7 and annex 9.</p>
<h2>The Committee’s choices</h2>
<p>The Committee has carefully considered whether the provisions of the NFLFE provide adequate protection for the linchpins of freedom of the press and of expression law. The NFLFE has also been weighed against the FPA and the FLFE to study the potential advantages of a new fundamental law on freedom of expression.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s view, the major problem with the NFLFE is the definition of its scope. At first glance, the concept ‘mass media’, which is a necessary condition for constitutional protection under the NFLFE, may appear to be clearly defined and unproblematic. However, as the Committee shows in its remarks on the NFLFE, there is a grey zone. For example, situations can arise in which packaging is used to spread information and opinions, not primarily to package a product. Given the proposed definition, such packaging is a form of mass media. This makes the scope of application unclear.</p>
<p>In the Committee’s opinion, the concept ‘mass media company’ also involves difficult problems of definition. Where is the line to be drawn in determining how large a part of the operations is required to focus on the publishing of mass media in order for the fundamental law to be automatically applicable? Should the matter be assessed on the basis of turnover or number of employees, or perhaps a combination of the two? The second criterion for defining a mass media company, its professional character, also involves problematic issues when drawing the line between different types of operations.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the scope of the FPA and the FLFE is not completely unambiguous either. However, the Committee considers that the NFLFE will entail greater uncertainties than in the current system.</p>
<p>The problems of definition that we have identified in the NFLFE mean uncertainty not only for parties engaged in mass media operations but also for individuals wishing to submit communications for publication. This uncertainty relates, for example, to the protection of sources, which is generally regarded as one of the central linchpins of the regulations on freedom of the press and of expression.</p>
<p>In this context, the Committee has also addressed the issue of the relevance of EU law to the choice between FPA/FLFE and</p>
<p>NFLFE. The Committee’s assessment is that it is vitally important for Sweden to defend its national regulations in the area of freedom of the press and of expression. Here it is important to underline that freedom of the press and of expression contains core constitutional values where decision-making powers have not been transferred to the EU. Moreover, the treaties governing EU cooperation may be considered to support a claim by Sweden that the fundamental principles enshrined in the FPA and the FLFE are part of our national identity, which it is incumbent on the Union to respect.</p>
<p>The Committee therefore concludes that EU law provides no reason to make far-reaching changes to the protection provided by the Swedish constitution to the freedom of the press and of expression.</p>
<p>In the light of this, the Committee chooses to abide by the FPA and the FLFE. The Committee’s considerations here are described in greater detail in Chapters 8–10.</p>
<h2>Making the FPA and the FLFE easier to apply</h2>
<p>Instead of replacing the current regulations with the NFLFE, the Committee believes that the best way to strengthen and develop the freedom of expression is to improve and clarify the FPA and the FLFE. In accordance with its terms of reference, the Committee has therefore chosen to undertake a general review of the FPA and the FLFE within the framework of the current system. The main aim has been to make the two fundamental laws as clear and easy to apply as possible.</p>
<p>A relatively far-reaching review has been made of the structure and language of the FPA and the FLFE. A number of changes are made to the structure of the FLFE, in part so as to make it possible, in the main, to read the text independently without extensive reference to the FPA. In certain cases provisions have been moved from the fundamental laws to ordinary laws, primarily to the Act with provisions in the areas of the Freedom of the Press Act and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression (1991:1559). Section headings have been added. The text has been brought in line with modern legislative language and made gender neutral.</p>
<p>To give one example of the changes mentioned, the current detailed regulation of judicial procedures has been simplified by transferring various provisions to ordinary law. This includes provisions on the jury.</p>
<h2>Material amendments in the FPA and the FLFE</h2>
<p>A number of questions concerning the material content of the constitutional regulations have been addressed in the course of the work on the FPA and the FLFE.</p>
<p>Conditions for limiting freedom of the press and of expression</p>
<p>The FPA and the FLFE contain a number of provisions stating that certain issues may be regulated by law (‘delegation provisions’). In most cases, the provisions do not indicate how far-reaching the limitations are allowed to be. It can be noted that it is somewhat unclear to what extent the ‘limitation rules’ in Chapter 2, Articles 21–23 of the Instrument of Government apply when the freedom of the press and of expression is limited by virtue of delegation provisions in the FPA and the FLFE. In certain cases reference is made to these provisions, but in others the legislative text does not make it clear what rules apply.</p>
<p>The Committee considers that there is a need to clarify the conditions under which the freedom of the press and of expression laid down in the FPA and the FLFE may be limited by law. This should be done by introducing new provisions in the FPA and the FLFE referring to the limitation rules in the Instrument of Government. In addition, there is a general provision stating that the protection guaranteed by the constitution may never be limited to such an extent as to threaten the purposes of the constitution.</p>
<p>The Committee’s deliberations and proposals in this area are contained in Chapter 12.</p>
<p>Extended obligation to distribute</p>
<p>The FPA and the FLFE include an obligation to distribute, meaning that postal services and other common carriers cannot refuse to distribute written matter and technical recordings, or make distribution subject to special conditions, on grounds of content.</p>
<p>A few years ago, a case in which distribution was refused revealed a loophole in this provision. This occurred when a postal service company refused to distribute unaddressed consignments (bulk mail) on grounds of the content.</p>
<p>In our view, a party authorised to provide postal services should not be able to refuse to distribute unaddressed written matter or technical recordings on grounds of their content.</p>
<p>The proposal is based on the reasoning that only a few companies offer postal services for the distribution of written matter and technical recordings, and only one has nationwide services. This means that a party refused distribution on grounds of the content of the written matter or technical recording would have difficulty communicating their message.</p>
<p>The Committee does not consider that a similar obligation to distribute should be introduced for internet operators and host service providers. The number of providers of services that make such publication possible in various ways is large enough to prevent any refusal to distribute having a decisive negative impact on the freedom of expression.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind the proposal is described in greater detail in Chapter 13.</p>
<p>Changes in the database rule</p>
<p>The ‘database rule’ in Chapter 1, Article 9 of the FLFE is complicated and hard to understand. The application of this rule has also been problematic.</p>
<p>One problem has concerned the automatic constitutional protection of mass media companies. Under the database rule in the FLFE, the fundamental law applies to databases made available by the editorial office of a printed periodical or radio programme. The Committee has considered whether the concept of the editorial office should be abandoned or changed but has concluded that the advantages of such a change do not outweigh the disadvantages.</p>
<p>The second problem of application that the Committee has considered is the issue of the implications of external information providers  being able to influence the contents of a database. Individuals or production companies, for example, may independently update a media company’s website. The Committee proposes that the legislative text should make it clear that constitutional protection is not affected by such updates, as long as they are made on the instructions of the party conducting the operations.</p>
<p>The third problem of application concerns the applicability of the fundamental law to databases containing components that can be directly influenced by recipients, e.g. through non-moderated  user comments . The current legislative text can be taken to mean that the constitutional protection of the entire database lapses if any part of it can be affected by anyone other than the party conducting the operations. We propose an explicit provision stating that the fundamental law shall not apply to the specific parts of the database that can be changed by someone other than the party conducting the operations. The fundamental law will apply in all other respects.</p>
<p>Our proposals concerning the database rule are described in greater detail in Chapter 15.</p>
<p>Archive databases</p>
<p>Many newspaper companies make material from their printed newspapers available to the public in databases. PressText Online and Mediearkivet are two examples of such services.</p>
<p>Until 2003 it was thought that such databases came under the ‘supplement rule’ in Chapter 1, Article 7, second paragraph of the</p>
<p>FPA. The rule put a faithful reproduction of the contents of a newspaper on the same footing as a supplement to the printed periodical, when the reproduction took the form of a radio programme or technical recording. The supplement rule was assumed to also apply when the contents of printed periodicals were made available in databases of the type referred to in Chapter 1, Article 9 of the FLFE. Consequently, archive databases belonging to mass media companies would have enjoyed automatic constitutional protection. However, since a Supreme Court decision of 2003 it has been clear that archive databases belonging to newspaper companies are not covered by the supplement rule but instead come under the database rule in the FLFE. This has created a number of problems.</p>
<p>The Committee considers that special constitutional protection is needed for archive databases belonging to newspaper companies. The responsibility for the contents of such archives should be kept together with the responsibility for the printed periodical. We therefore propose the introduction in the FPA of a new provision to the effect that the party responsible for the original publication in the printed periodical shall bear the responsibility for the material made available in the archive database. This change would mean that the statutory limitation period for such publications in archive databases would be calculated from the time of publication of the printed periodical. Hence, public prosecution would become timebarred six months after the publication of the printed periodical. The Committee has considered introducing a possibility for courts to order the removal of certain contents from such databases.</p>
<p>However, we have concluded that there is no need to introduce such a rule at present.</p>
<p>The proposal is described in greater detail in Chapter 16.</p>
<p>Talking newspapers etc.</p>
<p>The Committee also proposes the introduction of a special rule for talking newspapers made available as technical recordings or radio programmes, or from a database. This will be conditional on the contents reproducing all or parts of the printed periodical and being specially adapted for persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>The statutory limitation period for such reproductions will be calculated from the time at which the printed periodical was published. The responsibility for these reproductions will be kept together with the responsibility for the printed periodical.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind the rule for talking newspapers is given in Chapter 16.</p>
<p>A delegation provision on product information etc.</p>
<p>A new ‘delegation provision’ will be brought into the FPA and the</p>
<p>FLFE concerning requirements to introduce and formulate in a certain way warning texts, declarations of contents and other similar product information occurring in media covered by the fundamental laws. Examples include printed information on packaging and package leaflets. The exception will apply provided that the information is not explicitly designed to influence or shape opinions. Our proposal means that the fundamental laws will not pose any obstacle to issuing legislative provisions on such information.</p>
<p>The proposed provisions will give explicit constitutional support to an exception that already applies today. The advantage seen in giving the exception written form in the fundamental laws is that this will clarify the scope of application, making it easier to understand and apply the regulations. Moreover, it can be assumed that in international negotiations – not least in the EU – the chances of winning acceptance for the Swedish position will increase if it rests on a distinct principle with explicit constitutional support.</p>
<p>The reasons for introducing the delegation provision are contained in Chapter 17.</p>
<p>Questions that the Committee has not had time to consider in detail</p>
<p>For reasons of time, it has been impossible to devote more farreaching analysis or closer consideration to various issues that have come up in the course of the Committee’s work.</p>
<p>Among the issues raised, particular mention may be made of the protection of sources when the source is an employee in private operations financed by public funds. Another issue that has come up is the possibility of extending the provision on agitation against a national or ethnic group to include transgender people and people with disabilities. A third issue has concerned the possibility of taking various coercive measures such as a search of premises and confiscation of material at editorial offices and other places where information may be found that is covered by the protection of sources.</p>
<p>These matters are described in greater detail in Chapter 18.</p>
<h2>Other questions that the Committee has been instructed to consider</h2>
<p>Apart from its main task – to consider the possibility of introducing a technology-independent fundamental law on freedom of the press and of expression – the Committee has also been instructed to consider and present proposals on three issues.</p>
<p>The question of stronger protection of privacy</p>
<p>In accordance with its terms of reference, the Committee has discussed whether a penal provision on the protection of privacy should be introduced in the FPA and the FLFE. Several variants of such a penal provision have been drafted. We have found that the private lives of individuals enjoy limited protection in Swedish domestic legislation and that the protection offered by law is relatively weak by international comparison.</p>
<p>Our assessment of whether or not a penal provision should be introduced in the area protected by the constitution has been determined by two factors: whether it is needed, and whether Sweden can be considered to have an international obligation to do so.</p>
<p>The Committee’s analysis of the need has indicated that in effect, no violations of privacy occur in the area protected by the constitution that could justify a special penal provision. Moreover, we have not found that Sweden’s obligations under the European</p>
<p>Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms are sufficiently clear as to justify, on their own, the introduction of a new freedom of the press and of expression offence. The Committee considers there is a risk that a new penal provision would inhibit the journalistic activities of the media covered by constitutional protection. We have therefore concluded that at present, there is no reason to propose a penal provision on protection of privacy in the fundamental laws. On the other hand, we believe we can confirm that there is a clear need of a general penal provision outside the area protected by the constitution. Our assessment is that there is reason for the Government to consider such a provision.</p>
<p>Our deliberations in this area are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 19.</p>
<p>Position of individuals with respect to the media</p>
<p>The terms of reference require the Committee to consider whether the procedural safeguards available to individuals in the event of defamation in the media, for example, should be strengthened. To this end, the Committee has discussed the rules on public prosecution and rules on legal costs.</p>
<p>We propose a slight extension of the possibility of bringing a public prosecution in the event of defamation.</p>
<p>Defamation differs from most other types of offence in one crucial regard, namely, that the primary assumption in defamation offences is that it is up to the individual concerned to bring proceedings and prosecute his or her claim. Under a special rule in the Swedish Penal Code on assessing whether prosecution proceedings can be initiated, a public prosecution may only be brought if the injured party reports the offence for prosecution and, for special reasons, prosecution is deemed to be warranted in the public interest.</p>
<p>Private prosecution has several disadvantages for the injured party, most significantly that the injured party personally has to take responsibility for the investigation of the offence and the ac-</p>
<p>tual prosecution, as well as risking having to pay the defendant’s legal costs if he or she loses the case.</p>
<p>Public prosecution of defamation offences only occurs in exceptional cases. Since 2000, the Chancellor of Justice has brought a public prosecution for defamation in just one case. Outside the area under constitutional protection, public prosecution is somewhat more widespread.</p>
<p>We consider it reasonable that the public authorities should be responsible for the penal prosecution of defamation offences in rather more cases than at present. This should be achieved by increasing the possibility of bringing a public prosecution for such offences. We therefore propose that ‘special reasons’ should no longer be required for public prosecution and that it should suffice that public prosecution is warranted in the public interest. However, the requirement that the injured party report the offence should be kept.</p>
<p>We also propose a differently formulated provision on the ‘offsetting’ of legal costs in freedom of the press and of expression cases.</p>
<p>The Act with provisions in the areas of the Freedom of the Press Act and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression contains a special legal costs rule for freedom of the press and of expression cases. The rule applies if the injured party has represented himself or herself in a case in which the question of liability has been examined by a jury. In such cases, the court may decide that each party shall bear its own legal costs, irrespective of the outcome of the case.</p>
<p>According to the preparatory materials for the provision, it is intended for use in cases where the court takes a different view of the question of liability than the jury. The question has been raised of whether applying the ‘offsetting’ rule in accordance with the statements in the preparatory materials contravenes the ‘presumption of innocence’ in Article 6.2 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p>
<p>We propose reformulation of the provision so as to change the conditions for offsetting costs. In future, offsetting shall not be allowed for the reason that the court takes a different view of the question of liability than the jury. This change will avoid a conflict arising between the provision and the presumption of innocence. Offsetting will be a possible option following an assessment of</p>
<p>fairness, with one condition being that the injured party is deemed to have had special cause to have his or her case heard.</p>
<p>The Committee’s deliberations and proposals are described in</p>
<p>Chapter 20.</p>
<p>International legal assistance</p>
<p>The Committee’s remit has included considering under what legal conditions Swedish authorities should be able to provide international legal assistance to foreign authorities in areas coming under the special constitutional protection of freedom of the press and of expression.</p>
<p>The question of such legal assistance may arise, for instance, if foreign authorities request Sweden’s help with investigative measures, such as confiscation of documents, in connection with a criminal investigation that is taking place in that country. Given the current interpretation of the fundamental laws, Sweden is unable, in practice, to provide legal assistance when the FPA and the FLFE are applicable.</p>
<p>Having reviewed the development of EU law, particularly in the criminal law area, the Committee concludes that the Swedish position on the issue of international legal assistance should basically be considered consistent with EU law. Despite this, there is reason to open up some possibility of providing legal assistance even in cases where the fundamental laws apply.</p>
<p>The Committee therefore proposes that it should be stated in the fundamental laws that a written document or technical recording produced in this country will not be regarded as having been published in Sweden solely on the grounds that it has been sent to individual recipients abroad. This will increase the possibility of providing international legal assistance. With regard to the ‘protection of correspondents’ offered to providers of information as well as to writers and other sources, it will be clarified that this applies if the information was communicated in Sweden.</p>
<p>A new provision is proposed in the FPA and the FLFE on the question of providing international legal assistance in the constitutional area. This provision will enable such assistance to be provided where measures are concerned that are permitted by the fundamental laws. If an application for legal assistance concerns a crime or damages in connection with a crime, a requirement will apply</p>
<p>that it concern a punishable offence in both countries. The provision will make international legal assistance conditional on the Government’s consent in certain cases. There will be a possibility of issuing more detailed legislative provisions on the examination of applications for legal assistance.</p>
<p>The Committee’s deliberations may be found in Chapter 21.</p>
