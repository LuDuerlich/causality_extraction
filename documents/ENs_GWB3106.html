<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>Our remit has been to undertake a review of how communication between courts of law and citizens TPF FPT  works, particularly with regard to the reception of parties and people giving evidence, the formulation of judgements and decisions and courts’ contacts with the media. Our remit has also included taking account of the qualityenhancement efforts underway in the Swedish courts, in other Nordic countries and in the non-Nordic countries that we considered were of interest. Based on this review, our task has been to consider how communication between the courts and citizens can be further developed. Under the terms of reference of the Inquiry, our proposals are to be designed so that they can provide a basis for continued work in the courts on issues concerning reception, how judgements are written and contacts with the media.</p>
<h2>Public trust and confidence in the courts</h2>
<p>Our main task has been to propose measures that can be expected to strengthen the trust of citizens in the courts. We have therefore chosen to focus somewhat on the function that trust has in society, and particularly as regards the relation between citizens and the courts.</p>
<p>Our survey, together with findings in research related to trust, shows that at present, there are a number of factors that are particularly important for the trust that the general public has for the courts. These can be described simply, briefly and not in their order of importance in the following manner.</p>
<p>• The accessibility of the courts and the court staff for parties and people giving evidence</p>
<p>• The courts’ reception of parties and people giving evidence</p>
<p>• Processing times at the courts</p>
<p>• The transparency of the courts’  decision-making processes</p>
<p>• The formulation of judgements and decisions</p>
<p>• The way in which activities of the courts are portrayed by the media</p>
<p>• The knowledge of the general public about what goes on in the courts</p>
<p>• The conduct of judges</p>
<p>The trust of citizens in the legal system in general and in the courts in particular is at the heart of a democratic state governed by the rule of law and perhaps the most important reason for people actually complying with judgements and decisions. Compared with trust in other public institutions in Sweden, citizens have a great deal of trust in the courts, relatively speaking. In Sweden, trust in the legal system as a whole is relatively widespread compared with the majority of other western democracies.</p>
<p>According to an opinion poll among the general public that we commissioned Statistics Sweden to undertake, six out of ten people in Sweden have a high degree or very high degree of trust in the courts. From this poll and another opinion poll of our own that we conducted among lawyers and prosecutors, it appears that citizens, lawyers and prosecutors primarily lack trust in the ability of the courts to adjudicate cases in a reasonable time. There is even less trust in whether what is reported in the media corresponds to what is actually said and done in the courts.</p>
<p>Basically, trust-creating efforts in the courts are of course a matter of ensuring that adjudication maintains high, even standards. Apart from professional standards, it is, however, also important to ensure that activities in the courts maintain high standards from the point of view of the citizens coming in contact with them. While professional standards, somewhat simplified, can be said to depend on the knowledge and skills of members of staff, the way in which the citizens perceive standards is determined by the attitude, values and approach of these staff members.</p>
<p>Ensuring that parties and people giving evidence are given a positive reception is of key importance with regard to the way in which citizens perceive standards. This is not just a matter of treating parties and people giving evidence with respect and dignity, but also of the courts and the court staff being accessible, so that those who have questions or opinions are able to get in touch with the courts in a simple manner. Good reception also includes giving parties and people giving evidence access to easily available information about how the court works and what is expected of them in their roles.</p>
<p>With regard to the formulation of judgements and decisions, it is important that court lawyers put themselves in the parties’ situation and give some thought to the purpose of their texts and how they will be perceived and understood by those concerned. This approach makes it easier for parties and others who are not wellversed in the law to understand the reasoning of the court, and to be convinced by it.</p>
<p>The majority of people do not, however, come into contact with the courts. It is therefore also important that the courts inform citizens in other ways about the role and task of the courts in society, why the principles of legal security governing their activities are so important, and how they are expressed in the processing of individual cases and matters. The opinion poll conducted by Statistics Sweden among the general public also shows that the more a citizen knows about what goes on in courts, the more trust he or she has in them.</p>
<p>Here, the media have a key role as a communicating link between the courts and citizens. For the media to be able to give an allround and balanced picture of the courts, decision-making processes in courts must, as far as possible, be observable, or, in other words, characterised by transparency. Every judge must also be accessible so as to explain his or her standpoints in individual cases and matters and to stand up in defence of the universal principles of, among other things, independence, impartiality and equal treatment.</p>
<p>The conduct of judges is also very important in other ways when it comes to citizens’ trust in the courts as institutions. If the conduct of judges is inappropriate or takes place in inappropriate contexts, there is, in fact, a danger that citizens’ trust in the courts will decline. To strengthen the ethical awareness of judges, there may be reason, in our opinion, for the judiciary to agree on a common, ethical code of conduct for judges.</p>
<p>Should trust in the court system decline, it could result in people having less inclination to voluntarily participate in court proceedings. This would lead to a more ineffective and cumbersome processing of cases and matters, which in turn would result in longer processing times. Another consequence could be that citizens would increasingly turn to alternative dispute-solution bodies. The ultimate consequence of the onset of a general decline in trust in the legal system is a breakdown in the rule of law.</p>
<h2>Courts must give priority to work on quality enhancement</h2>
<p>We consider that the basis of successful efforts to improve communication between the courts and citizens is that the courts themselves continuously work with these issues in the future. In general terms, this work involves ensuring a change in the attitudes of staff in the courts so that they understand the demands on, and expectations of, the activities of the courts by the people coming into contact with them. Experience shows that it is not possible to achieve such change through individual projects or isolated measures alone. We therefore maintain the importance of systematic,  quality-enhancement work  conducted at all courts, and stress the key role of the head of the court in these efforts.</p>
<p>We propose that the Government instruct the National Courts Administration to draft a modified resource-distribution model, in which account may be taken to the quality-enhancement work conducted by the courts. This would mean a clear expression of will on the part of the Government and its agencies that not only quantity – which is currently the most important criterion for distribution of funds among courts – but also quality be counted when funds are distributed. This would also signal a clear link between the funds allocated and quality-enhancement work, which could be a strong incentive for courts to start conducting work on systematic quality-enhancement issues.</p>
<p>The National Courts Administration must also play a considerably more active role as a methods and resource support for the courts in their quality-enhancement work than is the case today. Support to quality-enhancement work can also be given from one court to another, for example by forming groups of the judiciary who have experience of systematic quality-enhancement work to regionally support other courts wishing to start similar work.</p>
<p>To improve communication between the courts and citizens in the areas that were specifically identified in the terms of reference – the reception of parties and people giving evidence, the formulation of judgements and decisions and contacts between the courts and the media – we see the need for the Swedish courts to draw up consistent and long-term strategies. These strategies will make it easier for the courts to follow up the effects of the various measures that are taken to improve services, in the framework of the systematic quality-enhancement work. The content of the strategies should be drawn up by the courts themselves. The National Courts Administration should have an overall role in the strategy work. Accordingly, the Administration should initiate the courts’ work with the strategies, drive this process forward and keep the work alive. In this connection, one important task for the National Courts Administration, is to, together with the courts, find the way in which the strategies should “be approved” by the courts. This can, for instance, take place in the framework of larger meetings between judges, or in another connection where many judges and other staff of courts come together.</p>
<p>We have thus not seen as our task to try to establish the content of these strategies down to the last detail. To guarantee a wide impact in the courts it is, in our opinion, the courts themselves who has to decide how the reception of parties and people giving evidence, the formulation of judgements and decisions and contacts between the courts and the media should be manifested more closely. We consider, however, that the strategies should be based on a number of different cornerstones and functions. These are presented in the following, together with what should be the points of departure for the work of producing the strategies in each area.</p>
<h2>Measures for improving the reception of parties and people giving evidence</h2>
<p>The strategy that we propose that the Swedish courts draw up concerning the reception of parties and people giving evidence should be based on the following cornerstones.</p>
<p>• There are to be concrete guidelines for what parties and people giving evidence have reason to expect and the demands that can be placed on the staff of courts with regard to the  person-toperson reception.</p>
<p>• All courts should offer the same accessibility with regard to telephone and office hours and contacts by email.</p>
<p>• Information to parties and people giving evidence about what goes on in the court and what is expected of them will be improved and more easily available.</p>
<p>• The reception of people appearing at court is to improve and in the larger courts, there should be special service staff.</p>
<p>• All the staff at courts are to be trained with regard to reception issues.</p>
<p>• The views on, and expectations of, parties and people giving evidence of their reception at courts are to be examined regularly.</p>
<p>• There is to be a reception ombudsman.</p>
<p>Reception is a concept that can be interpreted in several ways. There is an overall distinction between person-to-person reception and institutional reception. Person-to-person reception is about the way in which staff behave in direct contacts with the people coming into contact with, in this case, the courts, while institutional reception focuses on how the court as such is perceived by the people who visit it or otherwise come into contact with it.</p>
<p>Apart from the obvious reason – that everyone who comes into contact with the courts has a justifiable demand to be treated with respect and dignity – it is also important for the courts’ ability to fulfil their public duties that parties and people giving evidence are treated in a positive way. For people at court hearings to be able to give a free, detailed and also more correct account, they need to feel secure and listened to when they are in the situation of being heard. Providing a good reception for parties and people giving evidence is thus ultimately a question of legal security, which is a matter of ensuring that the court obtains the best possible basis for its judgement in cases.</p>
<p>This, in turn, requires that parties and people giving evidence are clear about what is going to happen and what is expected of them at the court. Written information coming from the court must be easy to understand and must not be perceived as unpleasant or threatening. It is also important that the sense of exposure that people may experience as parties or people giving evidence is not exacerbated by it being difficult to get in touch with someone at the court who can answer questions. Positive reception in connection with arrival at the court can contribute to a feeling of calm and security. During the hearing, the party and the person giving evidence must be able to feel that the members of the court are genuinely listening to, and are attentive, to their need for information, a break or other support that can be provided so that they are able to submit a detailed account.</p>
<h2>Measures to improve the formulation of judgements and decisions</h2>
<p>The purpose of the strategy we are advocating with regard to the formulation of judgements and decisions is primarily to encourage discussion at the courts so as to improve readability and judicial argumentation. This includes achieving rational use of the resources available for writing judgements. The strategy should be based on the following cornerstones.</p>
<p>• The Swedish courts are to have regulations on the formal and graphic design of judgements and decisions.</p>
<p>• There are to be recommendations for how judgements and decisions should be formulated with regard to readability and judicial argumentation.</p>
<p>• All court lawyers are to be trained in issues concerning the formulation of judgements and decisions.</p>
<p>• The quality of judgements and decisions, in terms of readability and judicial argumentation, will be regularly examined.</p>
<p>Our studies of judgements and decisions with regard to readability shows that there are quite a number of problems, involving everything from structure and outline to the way in which they are expressed and the vocabulary used. Moreover, judicial argumentation is sometimes insufficient.</p>
<p>The most important cause of such problems in judgements and decisions is probably that court lawyers seldom have the recipient in mind when they write their texts. This may be assumed to be principally due to the traditions in the way in which court lawyers learn how to formulate judgements and decisions. This means that previous judgements and decisions serve as guides and templates, even with regard to issues to do with linguistic formulation. When judges’ views on how judgements and decisions should be formulated are determined by what colleagues have developed over the years, it does not come naturally to them to think about how the text will be perceived and understood by individual parties.</p>
<p>In our opinion, current ideals about how judgements are written need to be changed so as to improve readability and judicial argumentation. In the future, court lawyers must be more aware of plain language efforts when it comes to formulating judgements and decisions. The language policy objective that ‘Public Swedish is to be cultivated, simple and comprehensible’ also applies to the courts (Govt. Bill 2005/06:2, Report 2005/06:KrU4).</p>
<p>We have therefore produced some language reports and other aids that court lawyers could use to check the readability and judicial argumentation of their texts.</p>
<h2>Vigorous measures to improve the courts’ contacts with the media</h2>
<p>The strategy we propose with regard to the courts’ contacts with the media will entail forceful initiatives targeted at particularly important actors and functions. We refer to the following.</p>
<p>• Judges  are primarily to manage contacts with the media concerning the cases and matters for which they are responsible.</p>
<p>• Heads of courts  are to contribute to creating an atmosphere of openness at courts and a willingness to provide information to the media. Together with judges, they are also to plan work at the court so that individual judges can be available when information initiatives are required.</p>
<p>• Media judges  are to be available at the courts where there is a need for such a judge. This media judge is to be responsible, in a variety of ways, for facilitating the court’s contacts with the media.</p>
<p>• The media group  are to be made up of the media judges and are largely to have the same tasks as it has today, among other things acting as a body for the regular exchange of experience with regard to media contacts and for disseminating new knowledge to the courts.</p>
<p>• The National Courts Administration  (where appropriate the Swedish Courts’ Academy for Education) is to have overall responsibility for training judges in media issues and, together with the media group, for drawing up the content of this training. The National Courts Administration is also to inform the spokesperson of the Swedish courts of issues that may require initiatives from the spokesperson.</p>
<p>• A Press Service at the National Courts Administration  is to act as a starting point for journalists and others who have questions about activities in the courts, should establish a press duty desk and should, if required, give individual judges advice and support before they are having contacts with representatives for the media.</p>
<p>• A News Desk at the National Courts Administration  is to monitor the flow of information concerning the courts, both internally and externally.</p>
<p>• A Spokesperson for the Swedish courts  is to be  one person who can represent the courts and provide information about the activities of the courts in the national broadcasting media and through elucidating letters and articles in national newspapers.</p>
<p>One of the most important tasks of the court from the point of view of trust is to ensure that information about courts that reaches citizens via the media is as comprehensive and correct as possible. In our opinion, for the courts to be able to fulfil this task well, it will be necessary for the judiciary to have a considerably more active approach to the media than is the case today, and for information from the courts to be more easily accessible to the media.</p>
<p>What we mean by a more active approach is that judges must be prepared, for example, to publish press releases and hold press conferences. There must also be a preparedness among judges for contacts of their own with journalists, so as to deal with inaccuracies in reporting and to correct misunderstandings. Judges should also be prepared to provide information about the activities of the courts in connection with various discussions and interviews on the radio and in TV or through letters and articles that clarify their work and decisions. In addition, external information should be of a proactive and anticipatory nature.</p>
<p>Ensuring that information from the courts to the media is easily available means that judges must also be able, fairly simply and briefly, to explain complicated legal reasoning to journalists and to provide information in a format, and at times that, to some extent, take into account the conditions under which the media work. Here, this is, among other things, a matter of creating an organisation for media contacts that means that journalists can normally get in touch with some person who can answer different questions.</p>
<h2>Other measures to strengthen trust in the courts – better websites and greater openness</h2>
<p>Apart from those discussed previously, we have chosen to deal with a few additional measures that may be of considerable importance for ensuring public trust and confidence in the courts. In different ways, these measures are intended to increase the accessibility and openness of the courts and enhance citizens’ knowledge about the courts.</p>
<p>As a first priority, we consider that the web should be used more effectively than it is today to make the courts more accessible to parties and to spread information to the general public about the activities of the courts. Using web technology to improve the accessibility for parties is especially important due to the ongoing trend towards fewer and fewer courts in the country. According to the Government’s action plan for e-government, the objective is that by 2010 it will be as simple as possible for as many people as possible to exercise their rights, fulfil their obligations and access public administration services. If the courts lag behind other government agencies in this process, a gap may emerge in the culture of reception that will not be favourable to the courts.</p>
<p>We therefore propose that the Government instruct the National Courts Administration to draw up a plan for how, and when a system of electronic case management could be introduced into the Swedish Courts, which would allow parties to follow the progress of their cases and matters and enable both parties and courts to send documents electronically via the websites of the courts. As an initial step, before the system with electronic case management becomes</p>
<p>a reality, we propose that the Government instruct the National Courts Administration to examine the possibilities of parties gaining access, via the websites, to the same information on their very own cases and matters that is now available in courts’ presentation terminals, and of paying application fees and similar charges via the web.</p>
<p>We also propose that the National Courts Administration should introduce functions on the Administration’s website making it possible for the general public both to access information on forthcoming proceedings in all courts, and to ask questions and receive answers on issues related to the courts. Moreover, we propose that the Administration should introduce new sound and image presentations on its website, enabling the visitor to actively influence the design of the presentation.</p>
<p>In addition, we consider that the National Courts Administration must have the most important information translated into more languages and also develop the presentation terminals in the waiting rooms of the courts in order to ensure that the information on the website is accessible for the public also through them. Finally, we consider that the Administration must create routines to cover the information on different blogs, communities and information pages on the Internet relating to the courts and, when necessary, often perhaps through a media judge, point out or rectify inaccuracies.</p>
<p>With the assistance of the National Courts Administration, the courts should otherwise take measures to improve openness and accessibility for citizens so as to improve their knowledge about the courts. This would involve, for example, making better use of the opportunities presented by visits of school classes to provide information about the activities of the courts, and inviting the general public to open house visits to the courts. It also involves the courts offering to come and talk about activities in the courts in different contexts.</p>
<p>Furthermore the courts should, more frequently than today, try to deliver judgements orally, particularly in situations in which a trial has been watched by a school class or a case has attracted considerable attention and for that reason there have been many spectators.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we do not consider trials broadcast on TV would help strengthen citizens’ trust and confidence in the courts to any noticeable extent. If trials broadcast on TV were permitted, these would probably have to be surrounded by a large number of restrictions which would, in various ways, limit insight into the trial. For this reason, they would normally not be able to portray a compre-</p>
<p>hensive and factual image of a trial. There is also much to indicate that, in connection with productions of trials, broadcasting companies would use the customary production techniques to attract an audience. Limited insight, possibly combined with exaggerated dramaturgy, would hardly give citizens the opportunity to form a correct opinion about what goes on in the courts. There is also a risk that parties and people giving evidence would adapt their behaviour in different ways to the fact that TV media are present in the court room, which would further prevent citizens – and the court – from being able to form a correct opinion about the point at issue of the hearing. We consider that access to the activities of the courts, and knowledge about them, can be better communicated via channels other than trials broadcasted on TV.</p>
