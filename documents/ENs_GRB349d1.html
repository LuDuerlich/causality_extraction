<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction and description (Chapters 1–4)</h2>
<p>In Chapter 2 we describe the work on intercountry adoption and the process in an adoption of this kind in Sweden. In Sweden there is a central authority, The National Board for Intercountry Adoptions (NIA), which inter alia  has the task of authorising associations and exercising supervision over them. In Sweden at present there are six authorised associations. In relation to its population Sweden is a major receiving state, with approximately 1,000 intercountry adoptions per annum and with approximately 43,000 intercountry adoptees in total in the country.</p>
<p>In Chapter 3 we describe adoption work in the ten largest countries of origin with which Sweden has cooperation on adoption. In recent years these countries have mediated approximately 90% of the children who have come to Sweden through an authorised association. The countries depicted are Colombia, India, China, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and Belarus.</p>
<p>Sweden has ratified both the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the 1993 Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (The Hague Convention). The conventions are described briefly in Chapter 4, where the concept of the best interest of the child is also taken up. Our assessment is that it is important that both conventions are active instruments in Sweden’s work on questions of intercountry adoption:</p>
<p>Costs and aid work in connection with intercountry adoption (Chap.5)</p>
<p>Sweden has to adopt a position vis à vis what it is ethically defensible for us to accept in terms of costs and aid work in connection with intercountry adoption.</p>
<p>We propose that the authorised associations should specify details of adoption costs in the foreign country, and that the adoption authority should conduct a feasibility assessment of these costs. The trend must be towards only actual costs connected with the adoption of a child forming the basis for the adoption fee. The associations’ aid work must be clearly demarcated from their adoption work, and must not compromise the integrity of the adoption work.</p>
<p>The government proposes to</p>
<p>• take the initiative in expanding cooperation at government level between different receiving states in order to bring about a common ethical stance on costs and aid work in connection with intercountry adoption,</p>
<p>• in Swedish development cooperation prioritise the development of indigenous alternatives to orphanages, so that children initially may grow up in good conditions in a family in their country of origin, and</p>
<p>• study more closely the programme of the Permanent Bureau.</p>
<p>In order to reduce the risk of children becoming a commodity in the context of adoption, we propose more and clearer conditions of authorisation (see Chap.6).</p>
<p>The Hague Convention</p>
<p>Article 32 of The Hague Convention states: 1. No one shall derive improper financial or other gain from an activity related to an intercountry adoption. 2. Only costs and expenses, including reasonable professional fees of persons involved in the adoption, may be charged or paid. 3. The directors, administrators and employees of bodies involved in an adoption shall not receive remuneration which is unreasonably high in relation to services rendered.</p>
<p>There is a recommendation added to the regulation which implies briefly the following. Receiving states are encouraged to support efforts in countries of origin to improve national child protection services, including programmes for the prevention of abandonment. However, this support should not be offered or sought in a manner which compromises the integrity of the intercountry adoption process, or creates a dependency on income deriving from intercountry adoption. In addition, decisions concerning the placement of children for intercountry adoption should not be influenced by levels of payment or contribution. These should have no bearing on the possibility of a child being made available, nor on the age, health or any characteristic of the child to be adopted.</p>
<p>Sweden’s attitude to The Hague Convention</p>
<p>Since 1997 The Hague Convention has been incorporated into Swedish law. For us it is self evident that Sweden must follow the intentions of the convention even in relation to those countries that are not parties to the convention. This also applies to those recommendations adopted unanimously at the meeting of the Special Commission in 2000.</p>
<p>The text of the convention, with its associated recommendations, is not always clear, and allows room for interpretation, e.g. as regards costs and expenses. It is up to Sweden to adopt a position on how it considers the convention should be interpreted.</p>
<p>As regards adoption, it is first and foremost the best interests of the child that should be taken into consideration, which means that insofar as the child’s best interests are compared with e.g. adults’ longing for a child, then it must always be what is best for the child that is decisive. This “conflict” can arise at two different levels, on the one hand in an individual case, on the other at an overarching level. There are already regulations in law dealing with the individual case. At the more overarching level e.g. when it is a matter of attitudes to financial matters in connection with intercountry adoption, no regulation exists in principle apart from The Hague Convention. Here it is a matter of Sweden having a position on intercountry adoption which really does place children’s best interests foremost, and which agrees with Swedish values in general. It is important that the state take a clear responsibility and does not hand this over to authorised associations and prospective adopters, who have their own interests to look after. It is also important that Sweden tries to bring about cooperation with other receiving states in order to promote a sound development of intercountry adoption work.</p>
<p>Intercountry adoption – a help in the short term</p>
<p>For the individual child intercountry adoption can be the best solution. As a general solution of the difficult situation of vulnerable children, intercountry adoption is merely a short-term help, which does not solve the underlying global problems causing children to be abandoned.</p>
<p>In order to improve the conditions for vulnerable children in the long term, what is required above all are actions promoting a broad improvement in welfare in the countries of origin, and the receiving states should be contributing to a development of this kind through broad measures. The aim must be that children are able to grow up in their biological family or in another family in their country of origin.</p>
<p>As it is not realistic to believe that all children can have that opportunity, not even in the future, work on improving children’s conditions must be pursued with both long term and short-term measures.</p>
<p>If a receiving state such as Sweden is to conduct intercountry adoption work and at the same time be credible in its measures for improving the conditions of vulnerable children, the centre of gravity of the aid measures for children must be help of the kind that in the long term improves social and economic conditions in the countries of origin. This can be considered as reducing the risks of children being abandoned.</p>
<p>Intercountry adoption – an ethical dilemma</p>
<p>There are many childless adults in the world who long for children. There are also many children in the world without families. Many adults want a small healthy child if possible. As there are more childless adults than small healthy children available for adoption, a situation of competition arises in which there is a risk that whoever pays most will get the – from an adult perspective – most “attractive” children, i.e. small healthy children.</p>
<p>Different countries have different cultures for contributing aid for different ends. Some countries have greater openness or tolerance towards paying large sums in order to be able to adopt children. These countries’ willingness to pay and ability to pay in practice creates the norm for the sums it is possible to demand in order for a child to be made available for adoption.</p>
<p>It is quite understandable that the countries of origin receive contributions towards their social work, and that they choose contacts for cooperation who are prepared to contribute large sums to them. It is also understandable that childless adults are prepared to make great financial sacrifices in order to acquire a longed-for child. As long as there are more adults who want to adopt than “suitable” children available for adoption, an adoption market will exist in which financial means have the greatest importance.</p>
<p>The concept of trafficking in children means to most people that adults buy children in order to exploit them in some improper manner. Even if, in the adoption context, the intention is to provide a child with a family, there is an obvious risk that children become pawns in a financial game, driven by adults’ longing for children and difficult financial and social problems in the countries of origin. A financial game of this kind must be characterised as a kind of trafficking in children. The fact that, in certain circumstances, intercountry adoptions can be classified under the term trafficking in children is expressed in The Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child prostitution and Child pornography.</p>
<p>When prospective parents have to pay more for the adoption than what the actual costs amount to, the child tends to become a commodity. Even if what is paid over and above the actual costs is used in a good cause, a contribution of this kind must never be a condition for a child being available for adoption.</p>
<p>As fast as the costs of adoption are forced up in the competition between different receiving states, there is also a risk that in the children’s countries of origin a dependency is created on the income deriving from intercountry adoption work. When it is a question of large sums being paid over and above compensation for the actual costs, it may be that it is financially more advantageous to mediate children for intercountry adoption than for national adoption or placement in foster homes. In such cases intercountry adoptions can prevent positive local development, which is unacceptable. There is also a risk that intercountry adoptions contribute to the retention of structures with an archaic view of women and a view of illegitimate children and children with handicaps which Sweden cannot accept. A development of this kind can under no circumstances be accepted.</p>
<p>It is of the greatest importance that anyone with any connection to intercountry adoptions strives for high ethical standards in adoption work. Intercountry adoption must be placed in a wider context than has been the case, where it has primarily been seen as an alternative way of forming a family. We consider it essential that Sweden adopts a position on which “rules of the game” we can accept, and on how Sweden may act in order to reduce the risks of trafficking in children in connection with intercountry adoption.</p>
<p>Legitimate foreign costs</p>
<p>Running orphanages from which adopted children come, and administration in connection with intercountry adoption implies, of course, considerable costs for the countries of origin. It is therefore only reasonable that the prospective adopters compensate the countries of origin for actual costs incurred in the adoption of the individual child, or an estimated average cost per child.</p>
<p>What must be questioned is whether the prospective adopters should be forced to pay for the general welfare development of the countries of origin. In our opinion it is unreasonable from the viewpoint of Swedish adopters that they out of their own pocket, have to finance a development of welfare in another country. In this way the children risk becoming commodities, and there is a risk that the countries of origin become dependent on incomes from intercountry adoption work, something that is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Aid work</p>
<p>Combining the ultimate goal of the associations’ aid work – which should be that children should be cared for by their biological parents, extended family or in any case by a family in the same country – with the ultimate goal of adoption work – to mediate children for adoption in Sweden – in our view involves clear difficulties. A conflict of aims would always be present in the work.</p>
<p>Nor is it possible to ignore the fact that aid work is a condition for the associations to appear as attractive collaborative partners as regards adoption. The associations’ impression is that associations/countries with a large-scale aid programme often receive considerably more children for adoption than those with a smaller scale operation.</p>
<p>This last fact ties in to what has been said earlier about costs and the trade in children, with the difference that here it is the associations and not the individual parents who through aid work are “paying” to make children available for adoption. In that a large proportion of the aid projects are financed with funds from SIDA (Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency), the Swedish state also shares in “paying” so that adults in Sweden will have the opportunity of having a family.</p>
<p>In our opinion it is of the greatest importance that Sweden considers how we can contribute to improved living standards for vulnerable women and children without compromising the integrity of the adoption work.</p>
<p>Proposals of the inquiry on costs and aid work</p>
<p>A first step in order to get to grips with the problems described is for the adoption authority, in connection with decisions about authorisation for a particular country, to assess whether it is suitable for cooperation to be started or to continue e.g. as regards the cost picture. In order to be able to make an assessment of this kind, it is necessary for the Swedish association to present a detailed statement of accounts of all foreign costs. It is important that the costs are judged to be reasonable in relation to the cost levels in the country of origin. The trend should be towards a gradual reduction in that part of the cost relating to things other than actual costs of the adoption (calculated as an average). If the association cannot provide sufficient relevant and detailed accounts, the authority should state how their accounting could be improved. If the association for various reasons cannot follow the authority’s guidance, this may mean that the intermediation contacts in question will be regarded as unsuitable for cooperation.</p>
<p>In the recommendation to The Hague Convention it is stressed that aid to countries of origin must not compromise the integrity of the adoption work. Our understanding is that aid work carried on by authorized associations must be unconditional. If it really is to be regarded as unconditional, the work cannot be linked to a mediating contact. There must not be the least suspicion that Swedish aid is provided on the condition that children are being mediated for adoption in Sweden.</p>
<p>For work on intercountry adoptions to be kept as pure as possible, the associations cannot be allowed to carry on aid work for an organisation from which children are provided for adoption, or for a person helping the association in its adoption work. This should be evident from the conditions of authorisation in the law (1997:192) on intercountry adoption intermediation. Conducting aid work in a country from which the association mediates children for adoption should not be a problem, on condition that the aid work can be kept strictly separate from the adoption work both financially and personally. The association must not be allowed to have a representative (or contact person) in the foreign country who both helps prospective adopters and administers aid work, as this constitutes a great risk for confusing the association’s completely separate operations of adoption intermediation and aid work.</p>
<p>As, in relation to its size, Sweden is a major receiving state, it will clearly contribute to the development of welfare in the countries of origin in order in this way to improve the conditions of vulnerable children and women. In our understanding it is important for aid activity to have long-term goals and to keep in mind the principle of subsidiarity. In our view it would be desirable if the Swedish government in its development cooperation were also to prioritise clearly that local alternatives replacing orphanages are developed, so that children are first provided with the opportunity of growing up in good circumstances in a family in their country of origin.</p>
<p>Receiving states can aid countries of origin via programme of the Permanent Bureau within The Hague Conference without risking compromising the integrity of adoption work. We consider that the government should look at this programme more closely.</p>
<p>Consequences</p>
<p>The consequence of demanding an open accounting procedure for costs, of not accepting on principle any other than actual costs within the framework of the adoption fee, and of striving for no direct link between adoption and aid work, may be that fewer foreign children will be available for adoption in Sweden than is presently the case. As a result of this, the work of the Swedish authorised associations may decline. Those children who would have been mediated for adoption in Sweden will instead be adopted by families in other countries when there is no shortage of prospective adopters.</p>
<p>Sweden should, in our opinion, lead the way as a nation in reducing the risks of trafficking in children in connection with intercountry adoption. If Sweden wishes to contribute to reducing the risks of a traffic in children in connection with intercountry adoption, the Swedish government and the adoption authority, as well as taking a position on what attitude Sweden itself should adopt on costs and aid work in connection with international adoption, should actively work in international circles to draw attention to these questions, and to encourage the major receiving states jointly to take up these questions with authorities and associations in the children’s countries of origin.</p>
<p>It is our hope that a Swedish position on the matter may stimulate other receiving states to adopt positions as to what costs are ethically defensible in connection with intercountry adoption, and on how aid work can be pursued in a manner that does not compromise the integrity of the adoption work. It is important that Sweden shows clearly that the best interests of the children have priority in connection with intercountry adoption. One stage in this process is for receiving states to aid countries of origin unconditionally in their welfare development, so that the countries of origin to a greater extent have the opportunity of caring for their children within the country.</p>
<h2>Authorisation and supervision (Chap.6)</h2>
<p>We propose more and clearer conditions of authorisation, above all regarding circumstances in the foreign country. From the law on intercountry adoption intermediation it should also be evident that the association has an obligation to mediate for applicants who have consent, an obligation to provide information and documentation, and an obligation in each instance to be able to reimburse all sums paid and to possess the means to wind up the association. From the same law it must be clear that the adoption authority has the right to obtain information, right of access to the associations’ offices and the right to demand redress. The authority should be given increased resources in order to exercise active supervision.</p>
<p>Authorisation should in our opinion be granted in two stages, in which the prerequisites for even acting as an intermediary of intercountry adoptions should be tested first. Thereafter one should test whether the conditions in each individual country are such that cooperation is judged to be suitable.</p>
<p>Authorisation for working with intercountry adoption intermediation in Sweden should only be granted to associations having as their primary aim mediating adoptions. If an association also carries on work other than intercountry adoption intermediation, the other work must not compromise the integrity of the adoption work. The risks of an association working with both adoption intermediation and aid work are discussed in the previous section. Authorisation may moreover only be granted if it is obvious that the association will mediate adoptions in a competent and discerning manner, without thought of gain, and with the best interests of the child as its primary goal. For authorisation it is, what is more, necessary that the association has a board, auditors and statutes implying that it is an open organisation. It is important that the association does not prevent any group of individuals from becoming members.</p>
<p>As regards circumstances in the foreign country there is today no regulation. We propose that a Swedish association be granted authorisation to work with intercountry adoption in another country on condition that the other country has adoption legislation or other reliable regulation based on the basic principles of the best interests of the child as expressed in The Convention on the Rights of the Child and in The Hague Convention. The other country must also have a functioning administration for intercountry adoption work, and damaging competition for children must not arise, nor competition between Swedish associations operating in that country. The Swedish association must account for how its costs in the country are apportioned, and on the basis of the cost picture, and the balance between the Swedish associations and other general circumstances it should be judged suitable for the association to begin or continue adoption work with the other country. A condition for the Swedish associations to be able to render account for a sufficiently detailed cost picture is that the countries of origin are open and provide financial information to the association.</p>
<p>A Swedish association granted authorisation to work in intercountry adoption in another country will be allowed to work in that country only if the competent authority in the other country has given its consent to this.</p>
<p>We also propose that an authorised association should have an obligation to disclose information, an obligation to mediate, and an obligation to provide documentation. The association must moreover in each instance be able to reimburse all adoption fees paid and possess the financial means otherwise to wind up the association.</p>
<p>Clearer and more detailed conditions of authorisation increase the opportunities of the adoption authority to act. In order to be able to exercise active supervision the authority however needs more supervisory tools. We consider that the authority must be given the right to acquire information necessary for supervision, right of access to the associations’ offices and the right to demand redress.</p>
<h2>NIA’s organisation (Chap. 7)</h2>
<p>We propose that NIA be wound up as a board with broad political and civic composition and that the government create a completely new authority with responsibility for intercountry adoption questions. The new authority should have the management structure of a single director agency with a supervisory board.</p>
<p>In the instructions for the new authority the task of facilitating adoption in Sweden of children from abroad should be changed to the task of supervising the Swedish authorised associations’ work in intercountry adoption intermediation and ensuring it is carried on in accordance with the law and the principle of the child’s best interest as this has been expressed in The Convention on the Rights of the Child and in The Hague Convention. The authority should moreover only disburse state grants to associations that actually mediate children.</p>
<p>Our brief includes a review of NIA’s organisation. NIA is a board with broad political and civic composition run by a committee with eleven members nominated by the Swedish parliament. Six of the members are nominated by the parliamentary parties, of which one is chairman of the committee. NIA’s secretariat has nine employees. The government has stated that the management form of a board with broad political and civic composition is appropriate for some activities but should be employed sparingly. Reappraisal of certain existing boards of this kind may be carried out on suitable occasions.</p>
<p>The authority that in future should be responsible for questions of intercountry adoption should in our opinion in principle have the same tasks as NIA today according to its instruction. On the basis of the tasks of the authority we judge however that, from a legal viewpoint, there is no longer any need for the authority to be organised as a board with broad political and civic composition. Nor are there other reasons for retaining its present management form.</p>
<p>Our opinion is that the question of intercountry adoption is best dealt with by its own authority, which has a clear task with responsibility for questions of intercountry adoption and work as a central authority according to The Hague Convention.</p>
<p>International adoption touches on ethically intractable areas, where it is important that Sweden as a nation indicates clear boundaries for what is acceptable from a Swedish perspective. The decisions of the authority in, above all, questions of authorisation could be of a sensitive nature, and the authority works within a complicated field and with many overseas contacts. This should motivate powerful public control over its work. The management form of a board with limited liability would be possible in this context, but it has been criticised for its vagueness on the question of liability.</p>
<p>The exercise of authority should be characterised by clear managerial liability. In relation to the associations and private individuals to whom the authority’s decisions will be directed, it is important that the managerial liability is unequivocal. Against this background we consider that the management form of a single director agency with supervisory board would be suitable for the authority. This would provide the possibility of supervision of the work. At the same time the question of liability would be clearer than at present. The opportunity for supervision can be valuable, as the authority has to deal with questions to do with international cooperation, and in certain cases sensitive questions in which associations and individuals are affected. It is necessary to have clear legislation and a well-balanced supervisory board.</p>
<h2>Research results as a basis for our proposals in Chaps. 8–12</h2>
<p>Marianne Cederblad, Professor Emeritus in child and youth psychiatry has been commissioned by us to make a compilation of important research in the field of adoption. The compilation is to be found in part 2 of this report.</p>
<p>The research shows that the great majority of adoptees do not have any major problems. Adoptees are however 2–3 times over represented in the clinical material in child and youth psychiatry and in social day care. The boys show aggression, defiance, hyperactivity and asocial behaviour, while the girls have more depressive symptoms, thoughts of suicide and attempted suicides. Interview studies do not provide such unambiguous results. Several studies have shown that abuse, malnutrition, neglect, emotional and intellectual deprivation before adoption affect the child’s adjustment even after several years in the adoptive family. It has been shown that the occurrence of such negative experiences, rather than age on arrival in itself, has a strong link to how the adoptee’s life will develop. School problems are often the result of language difficulties, but hyperactivity and attention deficit are also more common among adoptees, which makes schoolwork difficult.</p>
<p>Adoptees may have difficulties in integrating their ideas about their biological family and their experiences of their adoptive family during childhood. It may also be difficult for them for example to identify themselves with two origins and/or cultures. Adoptive parents can facilitate the identification process by involving themselves in the culture of the country of origin etc.</p>
<h2>Parental training before adoption (Chap. 8)</h2>
<p>We propose that it becomes obligatory for the person(s) wishing to adopt to take part in municipal parental training before adoption for consent to be granted. The municipalities should be responsible for providing this training.</p>
<p>Parental training before adoption is presently provided by the authorised associations. In connection with the municipality’s home study into the person(s) wishing to adopt the investigating officer should assure himself that the person(s) investigated has/have sufficient knowledge of children and their needs. The quality of parental training is dependent on the individual circleleader and can therefore vary considerably. The opportunity of participating in parental training varies countrywide, as does the content of the training and its cost.</p>
<p>In a case of intercountry adoption society is participating in the creation of a family. It is therefore also reasonable that society should make demands of the prospective adoptive parents with the aim that the child will have the best possible conditions in its new home.</p>
<p>All adoptees have the right to come to well prepared parents, who have been made aware of intercountry adoption as a phenomenon and what ethical and personal considerations should be taken into account before adoption. From the research findings in this field it appears important that the person(s) wishing to adopt are made aware of the increased risk of various problems in adoptees, so that they are prepared to recognise and cope with different situations, and so that they can seek help at an early stage. From the viewpoint of the best interests of the child we consider that participation in parental training before adoption should be a condition for consent being given.</p>
<p>All prospective adoptive parents have the right to parental training of such a quality that, after training, they will have the possibility of taking a decision on whether adoption is right in their case. It is totally unsuitable that society trusts that actors with their own interests in adoption intermediation are those associations providing the training. It must be ensured that all prospective adoptive parents receive training of a high standard, that this training is of a similar quality across the country, and that it focuses on the special requirements of adopted children. We cannot therefore arrive at any conclusion other than that society has to provide parental training in order to guarantee independence, objectivity and professionalism in the training. In our view the local municipalities should provide training based on materials produced centrally. The municipalities should have the right to make a reasonable charge for participation in the training. Cooperation between municipalities and municipal cooperation with the county council are desirable in order to achieve a certain scale for the work, and to make use of child health care’s knowledge of e.g. attachment.</p>
<h2>Home studies before adoption and decisions on consent (Chap.9)</h2>
<p>We propose that, in order for consent to be granted, the person(s) wishing to adopt should have participated in municipal parental training before adoption, should have satisfactory knowledge and insights into adoptees and their needs, be less than 42 years of age at the time of application, and on the basis of all circumstances should be suitable to adopt. We further propose that the county administrative board should be the body deciding on consent.</p>
<p>The home study of the prospective adopter(s) is carried out by the municipal social services department, and decisions on consent are taken by the social welfare board. This type of matter is rare in most municipalities. Even in municipalities with a larger number of adoption cases, the cases for organisational reasons are often unusual for both investigating officers and decision-makers.</p>
<p>We consider that the municipalities have a great deal to gain by cooperating e.g. on home studies for consent to adopt. By cooperating, a smaller number of investigating officers can work more frequently on this type of investigation. There are also greater opportunities to tailor training on adoption-related matters, reach out to affected groups with this training, and also greater opportunities for an exchange of experiences across the country. A smaller number of investigating officers would provide a more even quality of investigation, and the work would also be carried out more efficiently. County administrative board supervision would also be facilitated.</p>
<p>We consider that a condition for consent being granted is that the person(s) wishing to adopt should possess satisfactory knowledge of and insights into adoptees and their needs. As can be seen in the previous section, the person(s) wishing to adopt should also have participated in municipal parental training on adoption. We consider moreover that, from the child’s perspective, advanced age in the person(s) wishing to adopt can in itself be sufficient grounds for consent not being granted. Against this background we consider that the person wishing to adopt should be less than 42 years of age at the time of the application for consent to be granted. A somewhat higher age can be accepted in special circumstances. Finally we consider that in the law on social services (2001:453) it should be clear that the person(s) wishing to adopt must be suited to adopt. The assessment of suitability should be made taking all circumstances into account.</p>
<p>There is no automatic right for adults to be able to adopt a child. Assessing whether a person(s) wishing to adopt is/are suited to adopt is difficult, and it is easy to assume an adult perspective, especially when there is no particular child to take a view on.</p>
<p>Against the background of the difficulty of assessing whether a person(s) wishing to adopt is/are suited to adopt, we consider that there are reasons for considering which social actor is best suited to take decisions on consent, and how the decision-maker can be provided with the information on adoptees and their particular need in order to be able to take as their starting point the best interests of the child. We list different possible decision-makers. The decision-makers at local level could be the social welfare board, at a regional level the county administrative board and at central level the authority responsible for questions of intercountry adoption.</p>
<p>In order to be able to give priority to the best interests of the child, it is our view that those taking the decision on consent must have a good knowledge of both children’s needs in general and adoptees’ particular needs. In our opinion it is not realistic to demand that the social welfare boards in all of Sweden’s 290 municipalities should possess all the particular knowledge of adoptees that we consider is required in order to take well-founded decisions on consent, as this is a question of a small group of cases. If the decisions instead were to be taken regionally, it is our view that a sufficiently good knowledge base of adoption and adoptees’ needs can be built up without actions requiring large amounts of resources. The risk is reduced of great variations as regards the processing of the cases, and a more unified practise can develop. We propose therefore that the county administrative board should take decisions on granting consent. In order to meet the high requirement of legality it may be suitable that the county administrative boards create special committees with the task of deciding on consent. Such a committee could be composed of various experts in the field, and it may also be suitable that the public interest is represented.</p>
<h2>Support and help after an adoption – post-adoption service (Chap.10)</h2>
<p>Society accepts and legitimises intercountry adoptions. It is important that society meets the needs of adoptees and adoptive parents at as early a stage as possible. Since 1998 the municipalities’ social welfare boards have had special responsibility for adopted children and young people. The support from the welfare board should include a social worker with a good knowledge of the special circumstances of adoptees and of the adoptive family, who can act as a partner in a dialogue and providing support e.g. in relationship problems within the family, difficulties in the parental role and in life crises deriving from the adoption. We consider that everyone who in their profession meets adoptees and adoptive parents should have a general knowledge of adoptees and that those working with support and treatment of adoptees and adoptive parents must have special knowledge of adoptees. It is important that the state participates in the development of this knowledge.</p>
<p>By far the greatest numbers of adoptees live their lives in the same way as those who have grown up in their original family. All adoptees have to come to terms with their adoption, however, and at different stages of their lives there may be a need for support from society in order for them to cope with difficulties of various kinds.</p>
<p>Since 1 January 1998 the municipalities’ social welfare boards have, according to Chapter 5 paragraph 1 of the Law on Social Services, an explicit responsibility for providing help that may be needed after an adoption. Several social workers state that it is not clear what is meant by support and help. In most municipalities there is no structured activity for support and help after an adoption.</p>
<p>The aim of providing support and help is in our opinion that the donor contributes to the recipient’s solution of a problem or to his coping with a situation in a better way. The social welfare board’s support and help may include a social worker with a good knowledge of the special circumstances of adoptees and of the adoptive family, providing tips on different attitudes and suitable literature. The social worker can also be a partner in a dialogue. Examples of situations when support may be needed are in relationship problems within the family, difficulties in the parental role and in life crises deriving from the adoption.</p>
<p>The responsibility of the social welfare board according to Chapter 5, paragraph 1 of the Law on Social Services does not include adult adoptees. As the municipality has the ultimate responsibility for provision of support and help to those in need living within its area, it is suitable to make use of the existing knowledge of adoption within the municipality also as regards adult adoptees.</p>
<p>It is important that everyone who in their profession encounters adoptees should have a general knowledge of adoptees, and that everyone who works with e.g. support or treatment of adoptees also has specific knowledge of adoptees, so that the requirements for support and treatment can be met in time and in a good way.</p>
<p>Even as regards support and help we would wish to stress that municipalities have a great deal to gain by cooperating firstly with each other and secondly with the county council. Through this cooperation a regional support and help operation with specialist knowledge of adoptees can be built up.</p>
<h2>Organisation and execution in the work on adoption-related questions. (Chap. 11)</h2>
<p>We stress that most municipalities have a lot to gain from cooperating firstly with each other and secondly with the county council on adoption-related issues. We propose that municipalities and country councils cooperating on these matters should be able to apply for and be awarded a state incentive grant over several years.</p>
<p>As is evident from the previous section, adoption-related matters rarely arise for most municipalities and for child health care. In order to achieve a certain scale in the municipality’s work on adoption-related questions, most municipalities have a lot to gain by cooperating with each other. Municipal cooperation with the county council in parental training and support and help operations can be profitable for both sides. In regional cooperation on adoption-related matters those people working with these questions can receive the specialist knowledge necessary to meet the needs of adoptees and their families.</p>
<p>By the expression “regional adoption counselling” we mean a regional operation in which municipalities in cooperation provide parental training before adoption, home study before approval, and support and help after an adoption. The expression is not tied to any special form of cooperation. The county might comprise a suitable geographical basis for cooperation on regional adoption counselling between the municipalities comprising the county and the county council child health care. A very important task for adoption counselling is also to actively disseminate knowledge about adoption to various professional groups who come into contact with adoptees and adoptive parents. In order to encourage the establishment of cooperation we propose that the municipalities and county councils cooperating with each other on adoption matters should be able to apply for and be awarded a state incentive grant which should be paid over several years.</p>
<h2>Research and development of knowledge (Chap. 12)</h2>
<p>We propose that a national centre for research and knowledge on intercountry adoption be established. A centre of this kind may with advantage be linked to already existing operations.</p>
<p>Hitherto the state has not prioritised research and knowledge development in the area of adoption. This is unacceptable when this involves the organised movement of children from one country to another. If Sweden is to have intercountry adoption in the future it will be necessary for the state to prioritise these questions.</p>
<p>We propose the establishment of a national centre for research and knowledge on intercountry adoption. The ultimate goal of the centre would be that adoptees receive the best possible conditions during their childhood and youth in their new home country through a better knowledge base. Some important tasks for the centre may be to maintain contact with the field of adoption in order to understand the needs for research, keep up to date with international research, ensure that new findings are made available to those interested in the field of adoption, and to act as a bank of knowledge for the municipalities’ adoption-related work. In order to acquire dignity and legitimacy the centre should be linked to a scientific environment where interdisciplinary research and knowledge development can be pursued, and where a dialogue becomes possible with clinical work. It is important that adoptees themselves can be heard, firstly in prioritising the research projects and secondly in the research itself, so that the situation of adoptees is not only described by adoptive parents and professionals. We provide examples of existing institutions which could house a research and knowledge centre.</p>
<h2>Grants towards the costs of adoption – age limit etc. (Chap.13)</h2>
<p>We propose that the age limit for the grant towards the costs of adoption should not be raised. We propose that in another regulation the government should consider whether it is still motivated that the grant towards the costs of adoption should be paid in private adoptions.</p>
<p>Since 1 January 1989 a state grant has been paid towards the adoption of children from abroad. The grant amounts at present to SEK 40,000 per adopted child, and is paid out when the adoption is complete. Grant is only paid for children not yet ten years of age when the adoptive parents receive the child into their care. Included in our brief is to examine whether the age limit for the grant should be raised. Most adoptions of children older than nine years are private adoptions. In private adoptions the cost picture, against the background of those situations that might arise, is in all likelihood completely different from an adoption through an authorised association. As a result of this we judge that there is no reason to raise the age limit. The few adoptions of children older than nine years of age mediated through authorised associations do not warrant adopting a different position.</p>
<p>Against the background that private adoptions may now only occur if there are special reasons, it is reasonable to assume that the costs of these adoptions are usually lower than for adoption through an authorised association. We propose that the government should consider whether it is still motivated for the grant towards adoption costs to be paid in cases of private adoption.</p>
<h2>Other matters (Chap.14)</h2>
<p>The adoptees’ interest groups constitute an important complement to the work society is responsible for. The groups are mainly run entirely on a non-profit basis. We propose that these groups should be awarded a state grant for their work.</p>
<p>An association mediating an adoption should also, for a reasonable fee, be able to help an adoptee in seeking his origins. Within the framework of its support and help work, the social welfare board should provide support as required for coping with those feelings aroused in connection with an adoptee seeking his origins.</p>
<p>The child’s rights need to be reinforced in adoptions of a child who is known. We propose that the government reviews the deficiencies existing in this kind of adoption.</p>
<p>Different age limits in The law (1962:381) on national insurance and The law (1978:410) on right of parental leave for care of children, etc. imply e.g. that an individual(s) adopting an older child can have the right to child allowance but not to parental leave. We propose that the government reviews the question of whether there should be total conformity between the age limits.</p>
<h2>Consequences (Chap.15)</h2>
<p>Our proposals will require new resources. We estimate that the proposals will generate SEK 15 millions in raising standards and SEK 22 millions in one off subsidy. We submit proposals for possible financing.</p>
