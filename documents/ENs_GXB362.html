<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The assignment</h2>
<p>According to the terms of reference, the inquiry chair shall undertake an inquiry as to whether a tax on fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-gases) should be introduced in Sweden. On the basis of the proposals of the Climate Committee, presented in the report</p>
<p>Svensk klimatpolitik [Swedish Climate Policy] (SOU 2008:24), the Inquiry shall examine, without presuppositions, whether a tax is the most appropriate instrument to reduce emissions of  F-gases.  If the Inquiry finds that a tax is the most appropriate instrument, it should propose a legal form that enables the administrative costs to companies to be kept as low as possible.</p>
<h2>The proposal</h2>
<p>At present, emissions of F-gases are not subject to any economic instrument to reduce use and emissions of F-gases. The Inquiry is now proposing that a tax  be introduced on hydrofluorocarbons (HFC). The tax should be of a general nature without exemptions or reduced tax levels and be charged on HFC which is brought into the country or manufactured here. As a starting point, it is proposed that the tax rate be set at a level corresponding to the reduced carbon dioxide levied on industry not covered by the EU emissions trading scheme. In 2009 this level is 22 öre per kg (21 per cent of the general level, which is 105 öre per kg of carbon dioxide in 2009). The tax rates shall be based on the respective HFC compound’s GWP (Global Warming Potential) and be charged on the actual content of HFC. Accordingly, different HFC compounds will have different tax rates. To keep administration of the tax simple, the Inquiry proposes, however, that standard assessment may be made of the content of HFC in certain goods on import and, in one case, also on export.</p>
<p>If the tax is introduced, the Inquiry estimates a reduction in emissions by 2020 due to the tax of around 0.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents.</p>
<p>The Inquiry further proposes that the tax be complemented by a premium  which is to be paid when HFC is delivered for destruction. This premium should be the same size as the tax, although the premium will be paid regardless of whether tax has previously been paid on the HFC delivered. The Inquiry considers that this supplementary premium may contribute to further emission reductions in addition to those that may be expected due to the tax.</p>
<h2>Background to the proposal</h2>
<p>Through the Kyoto protocol, the industrial countries have undertaken to reduce their emissions of the greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride). Hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF ) are referred to by the common term fluorinated greenhouse gases or F-gases. The F-gases are effective greenhouse gases with a high GWP. The problem with the F-gases is not their use as such but when these gases leak, thus contributing to reinforcing the greenhouse effect.</p>
<p>The total emissions of F-gases in Sweden have increased from around 0.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents in 1990 to around 1.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2007. During this period, emissions of HFC sharply increased, mainly due to HFC replacing substances that were harmful for the ozone layer, for example, CFC (freons) and HCFC, as refrigerant and as propellent gas in aerosol spray cans and in manufacture of extruded polystyrene (XPS). At the same time, emissions of PFC have decreased slightly, while emissions of SF have increased. According to the revised information, produced by the Inquiry, it is estimated that emissions of F-gases in Sweden by 2020 will have decreased to around 0.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents, without a tax. This is mainly due to the applicable EU provisions.</p>
<p>In 2007, HFC accounted for 69 per cent of carbon dioxide equivalents from F-gases in Sweden and is estimated to account for 90 per cent in 2020, without a tax. Emissions of PFC and SF have decreased and are expected to continue to decrease due to measures taken and other instruments. Since there are other instruments that control emissions of PFC and SF and since these gases only account for a minor part of the total F-gas emissions, the Inquiry has found it most appropriate only to tax HFC.</p>
<p>The use of HFC has increased, both due to the changeover from CFC and HCFC and due to the increasing number of heat pumps and air-conditioning systems in use. HFC is used mainly as a refrigerant in refrigerators, freezers and air-conditioning systems as well as in heat pumps. These facilities exist in a number of different activities such as in trade, the real estate sector, restaurants, industry, schools, the health sector, local government facilities, the armed forces and shipping. Another area of use for HFC in Sweden is as a propellent gas for XPS manufacture.</p>
<p>In 2020, it is estimated that 82 per cent of the emissions from HFC derive from its use as a refrigerant. Since use of HCFC as a refrigerant will be prohibited, the area of use for HFC will be expanded. There are alternatives to HFC in the area, such as hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and ammonium. There are also possibilities of changing from HFC with a high GWP to HFC with a lower GWP. The instrument which will affect use is Directive 2006/40/EC relating to emissions from air-conditioning systems in motor vehicles, which will reduce emissions from light motor vehicles. Otherwise, the Inquiry has not found any instruments which can reverse the trend towards increased use. As mentioned above, it is not use as such but emissions which are harmful for the environment. The Regulation 2006/842/EC on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases regulates leakage control etc. This regulation does not entail any greater restriction for Sweden as regards HFC. Sweden had previously a regulation for filling quantities in refrigerating equipments, but this was revoked due to the EC Regulation. Sweden has thus no longer any control of filling quantities, which, inter alia, has led to indirect systems no longer being self-evident for investments in new refrigeration equipments.</p>
<p>In the light of this, the Inquiry considers that an instrument is needed to reduce the use of HFC and thus reduce emissions of F-gases. The Inquiry considers that a tax on HFC steers toward</p>
<p>• continued and increased use of indirect systems when HFC is used as a refrigerant,</p>
<p>• an increased focus on sealed equipments in systems with HFC as a refrigerant,</p>
<p>• HFC with lower GWP in systems with HFC as a refrigerant,</p>
<p>• alternative technology.</p>
<p>The conclusion that a tax would function well as an instrument in this area and is thus suitable is reinforced by the evaluations of the Danish and Norwegian taxes on F-gases. The Norwegian and the Danish tax has had the greatest impact on HFC as a refrigerant in such a way as to increase use of alternative refrigerants, at the same time as both leakage of HFC and the quantity of HFC has decreased in the facilities. The Inquiry has not found any other instrument with the same effect on F-gas emissions in relation to the cost, which is compatible with EC law. The conclusion of the Inquiry is that a tax on HFC is the most appropriate instrument to reduce emissions of F-gases, which is also the basis for recommending the introduction of a tax on HFC.</p>
<p>As a complement to the tax on HFC, the Inquiry proposes the introduction of a premium when delivering HFC for destruction. This premium is to be as high as the tax, although the premium is to be paid regardless of whether tax has been previously paid for the HFC delivered. The Inquiry considers that a destruction premium will lead to reduced emissions of HFC, by increasing the amount of HFC actually delivered for destruction and by possibly hastening phasing-out of older equipment with a high annual leakage of HFC.</p>
<h2>The compatibility of the proposal with EC law</h2>
<p>According to the terms of reference of the Inquiry, the inquiry chair shall report on his overall assessment of the compatibility of the proposal with EC law.</p>
<p>The basis for the work at EU level on reducing emissions of Fgases consists of regulations concerning prohibitions and restrictions on F-gases for certain areas of use. As mentioned above, Directive 2006/40/EC relating to emissions from airconditioning systems in motor vehicles, and the Regulation 2006/842/EC on certain fluorinated greenhouse gases are the controlling provisions. As far as the Inquiry is able to judge, the aforesaid administrative provisions do not contain any impediments to the introduction of a national tax of the kind now proposed by the Inquiry.</p>
<p>In addition to the aforesaid provisions, state aid aspects shall also be taken into account. The rules on state aid are contained in the EC treaty and state that aid provided by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods shall, insofar as it affects trade between Member States, be incompatible with the Common Market. Inter alia, to avoid coming into conflict with the aforesaid rules, the Inquiry has taken pains to draft a generally formulated proposal without exemptions. To avoid exemptions and/or reduced tax levels, the Inquiry is proposing a lower tax level than would otherwise have been the case. The Inquiry considers that the form of the tax covering all HFC compounds and all areas of use complies with the treaty requirements not to favour certain undertakings or certain manufacture and the proposed tax thus does not constitute state aid. It is therefore not necessary for the government to carry out any administratively burdensome consideration of state aid.</p>
<p>To sum up, the inquiry chair considers that the proposal now made are well compatible with the restrictions ensuing from EC law.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposal</h2>
<p>Environmental consequences</p>
<p>The proposal of the Inquiry has positive consequences for the environment. The forecast produced by the Inquiry shows that emissions due to a tax on HFC can be expected to decrease by around 0.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents by 2020. The expected reductions in emissions may be compared with the 2.0 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents that the government (Government Bill 2008/09:162, p. 60) estimate are included in the reduction of greenhouse gases achieved by what are referred to as developed economic instruments.</p>
<p>In addition, the proposed destruction premium can also be expected to reduce emissions of F-gases, partly by HFC being delivered for destruction to a greater extent than at present and partly by a decrease in the average annual leakage due to the early scrapping of older equipment.</p>
<p>Consequences for public finances</p>
<p>The proposal of the Inquiry on a tax on HFC entails increased income for the state. As shown in the table below, the static net income amounts to around SEK 70 million in the year of it entering into force (SEK 140 million on a full-year basis). The net income subsequently decreases as a result of reduced emissions. The steering effect of the tax on emissions is considered to entail reduced net income of around SEK 20 million in 2020, which is the difference between the static and the long-term net effect in 2020. At this time, it is also reasonable to assume that any effects in the form of stocking up of HFC, which can be expected before the tax comes into effect, will have petered out.</p>
<p>In addition to the impact on public finances shown in the table below, the proposal of the Inquiry for a premium when delivering HFC for destruction should be taken into account. The Inquiry suggests that the expenditure for the premium be funded via tax income from the tax on HFC. In the long term, the required expenditure may be assumed to be less than the tax income as long as there are emissions of HFC. Initially, however, it cannot be excluded that premium payments may be higher than tax income, since HFC which has not been subject to tax is also entitled to premium payment. However, in the view of the Inquiry the risk for this should not be exaggerated, inter alia, taking into consideration experiences from the Norwegian system with a similar premium.</p>
<p>Effects on public finances effects 2010-2020, SEK billion</p>
<p>Consequences for the business sector</p>
<p>The price increase on HFC as a result of a tax affects the industries that use HFC. Price increases are intended to lead to reduced use and, ultimately, to reduced emissions through a changeover to better sealed equipments, alternative gases or alternative technology. An unavoidable consequence for the part of the business sector that uses HFC is thus that it will be subject to higher costs due to the tax. This can be justified by a wish to discourage use of HFC and also by the polluter pays principle.</p>
<p>The manufacture of XPS using HFC as propellent gas will be made considerably more expensive, which will lead to deterioration in competitiveness both in the domestic market and internationally. Since the refrigerant in air conditions systems will be taxed, the vehicle industry will also have slightly increased costs. However, the increased costs are negligible when they are placed in relation to vehicle prices. Heat pumps with HFC as a refrigerant will be slightly more expensive, at most four per cent. According to the Inquiry, this will not lead to any major changes in the market for heat pumps. Costs for medical and technical aerosols are also expected to increase slightly. In addition, it can be assumed that HFC will no longer be used in fire-fighting equipment due to the changed cost situation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, administrative costs will increase for the companies that import HFC or products containing HFC. The Inquiry has attempted to keep these to a minimum by the design of its proposal, inter alia, by use of standards for the most common products containing HFC, but also through a simple form of the legislation in other respects.</p>
<p>Other consequences</p>
<p>Other consequences of the proposal, for example, for household and for the autonomy of local government, etc, are considered to be small or negligible and are therefore not listed separately here.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>It should be possible for the proposed tax on HFC, together with the proposed premium, to enter into force on 1 July 2010.</p>
