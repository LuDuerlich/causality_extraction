<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit of the Inquiry</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has been tasked with presenting proposals for how the procedures for value added tax (VAT) on imports may be changed so as to simplify them for companies. The terms of reference are based on the premise that VAT should be reported in a VAT return instead of in a customs declaration as is the case today. The Inquiry is also required to examine and propose other measures for the same purpose that may require less extensive changes. The impact of the proposals on public finances and the business sector is also to be analysed. The Inquiry is also to analyse the proposals’ impact on the operations of Swedish Customs and the Swedish Tax Agency, the impact on procedural rules, criminal procedure and tax collection. Furthermore, the design of information exchange and cooperation between the Swedish Tax Agency and Swedish Customs is very important. The Inquiry is also to consider whether there is reason to abolish customs penalties for VAT on imports.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposal</h2>
<p>Swedish Customs is currently the competent tax authority for VAT on imports. This means that all importers report and pay output VAT on imports to Swedish Customs. Provided that the importer is registered for VAT in Sweden and has a full right of deduction, the VAT is recoverable from the Swedish Tax Agency through a deduction by the importer of the same amount in the VAT return. (About 97 per cent of VAT paid to Swedish Customs is paid by VAT-registered importers, and hence the Swedish Tax Agency refunds almost all this VAT.) However, since the deduction is made after the tax payment date, importers suffer a negative liquidity effect.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that if an importer is registered for VAT in Sweden, the Swedish Tax Agency should be the competent tax authority for VAT on imports. An importer that is registered for VAT in Sweden will then report and pay the VAT to the Swedish Tax Agency instead of to Swedish Customs. If the importer has a full right to deduct VAT, this means that the importer will no longer need to make a VAT payment, since the output and input VAT are reported in the same accounting period and cancel each other out. The Inquiry’s proposal would also lead to a slightly reduced administrative burden for the importers concerned.</p>
<p>Importers who are not registered for VAT, for example individuals and companies engaged in VAT-exempt activities, will continue to report and pay VAT to Swedish Customs. (About three per cent of the VAT paid to Swedish Customs is paid by such importers.)</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that a system be developed for the exchange of information between the Swedish Tax Agency and Swedish Customs. If the Inquiry’s proposal is implemented, Swedish Customs will continue to have access to the data that forms part of the taxation base. The Swedish Tax Agency will therefore need to receive relevant information including the customs value to be able to verify the VAT that is reported. The Inquiry is therefore of the opinion that the implementation of an information exchange system is essential to enabling the proposal to be implemented. It may then be presumed that the Swedish Tax Agency will use the information, and design and implement appropriate control measures. Swedish Customs also needs to receive certain information from the Swedish Tax Agency to be able to assess which of them should be the competent tax authority.</p>
<p>To enable the proposed exchange of information between the agencies, the Inquiry also proposes certain changes to the regulations on public access to information and secrecy.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposal also requires a certain change to the current system of issuing customs bills. The importer should always be informed by Swedish Customs of the customs value it has set for each import, even when an agent is involved. This is because the customs value serves as the basis for the importer’s reporting of VAT on imports to the Swedish Tax Agency. In this connection, the Inquiry’s view is that Swedish Customs should advise the importer that information concerning the customs value has been provided to the Swedish Tax Agency.</p>
<h2>Implications of the Inquiry’s proposal</h2>
<p>The Inquiry assesses that the positive effects of the proposal primarily consist of the liquidity improvement and the reduced interest expenses for VAT-registered companies that import goods. If the proposal is implemented, it is estimated that annual interest expenses for these companies will collectively decrease by approximately SEK 150 million. The Inquiry also considers that their administrative burden would be reduced somewhat if the proposal was implemented, as the proposal would entail, for example, less risk of accrual errors, fewer payments to manage and only one authority to turn to for matters relating to VAT. However, the Inquiry assesses that the administrative relief is minor in relation to the positive liquidity effect.</p>
<p>A disadvantage of the proposal is that it would have a negative impact on public finances. This would arise as a result of the VAT being reported to the state at a later stage, which in turn would result in an interest expense. The liquidity effect is estimated at roughly SEK 5 130 million per year. This would result in increased costs for the public sector of about SEK 50 million gross and about SEK 40 million net.</p>
<p>Moreover, certain changes to the operations of Swedish Customs and the Swedish Tax Agency will be needed if the proposal is implemented. The Swedish Tax Agency will have more duties to perform while Swedish Customs will have one less. According to Swedish Customs’ estimates, the Inquiry’s proposal will lead to a one-off cost of about SEK 5 million and an annual saving of about SEK 1.8 million. This saving is calculated by Swedish Customs to correspond to approximately 2.4 full-year equivalent positions. The Swedish Tax Agency estimates that implementation of the Inquiry’s proposal would entail a one-off cost for the Tax Agency of around SEK 1.8 million and an annual cost of about SEK 2.2 million.</p>
<p>Provided that the proposed information exchange is implemented, the Inquiry is of the opinion that the Swedish Tax Agency will obtain sufficient information to carry out checks of VAT on imports. Under this condition, the proposal should not have a negative impact on tax collection. The proposal also means that the Swedish Tax Agency would gain an overall picture of all reported VAT, which is an advantage from the point of view of control.</p>
<p>If the proposal is implemented and the Swedish Tax Agency becomes the competent tax authority for VAT on imports, the Tax</p>
<p>Offences Act (1971:69) will apply instead of the customs offence provision in Section 8 of the Smuggling of goods (penalties) Act, (2000:1225), also for the output VAT on imports. However, the Inquiry assesses that this change will not have any significant impact on criminal procedure or the ability to prosecute crimes.</p>
<h2>Alternative proposals</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has also analysed four alternative proposals. In three of these proposals, Swedish Customs would continue to be responsible for assessment and collection of VAT on imports. However, the first two proposals would involve changes to the procedure for issuing customs bills, and the third proposal a deferred VAT payment. This would reduce the negative liquidity effects arising for importers who have the right to deduct VAT. The Inquiry concludes, however, that all three of these proposals would lead to a number of undesirable effects since in certain situations importers would obtain a refund for VAT on imports from the Swedish Tax Agency before having to make the corresponding payment to Swedish Customs. Furthermore, a number of other negative effects would arise, including an increased administrative burden, non-uniform regulation, the fact that the reduction in the negative liquidity effect would not apply to all imports by VAT-registered importers, etc. The Inquiry therefore makes the overall assessment that the reduction in the negative liquidity effect that these three proposals entail does not outweigh the disadvantages of the proposals, and hence the proposals should not be implemented.</p>
<p>Under the fourth proposal the Inquiry has analysed, Swedish Customs would continue to be responsible for VAT assessment but responsibility for collection would be transferred to the Swedish Tax Agency. In practice, this means that importers who are registered for VAT in Sweden would no longer have to pay the deductible VAT. This solution would mean that those covered by the new system could be obliged to meet certain requirements, such as obtaining their own credit licence (approval for deferred payment). That could be an advantage as regards collection, but it would also mean that the system would be voluntary (since importers may choose to apply for their own credit licence). Such a system would involve disadvantages, such as a greater administrative burden for companies and for government agencies, because it would be a complicated and non-uniform system. In addition, VAT on imports is often deductible, which reduces the usefulness of requirements such as having to have a credit licence. The division of responsibilities would also lead to other negative consequences. It is therefore the Inquiry’s assessment that this proposal should not be implemented.</p>
<h2>The issue of abolishing customs penalties</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has analysed whether customs penalties on VAT on imports should be abolished in cases where the VAT would have been deductible. However, if the Inquiry’s proposal is implemented, there will be no need to change the regulations on customs penalties, since they would no longer be applicable when the Swedish Tax Agency is the competent tax authority. Instead, the regulations on tax surcharges would be applicable. This means that, in general, no tax surcharges would be levied on deductible VAT on imports. Importers who are not registered for VAT and who therefore report the VAT to Swedish Customs will continue to be covered by the current regulations on customs penalties.</p>
<p>Should the Inquiry’s proposal not be implemented, the Inquiry is of the view that the customs penalties regulations should remain unchanged since there is a risk that the number of errors in connection with reporting of VAT on imports would increase if customs penalties were abolished or reduced to a lower percentage. Incorrect reporting (including unintentional errors) could result in other important information being incorrect. This could be information that is important for calculation of customs, other taxes and fees, for the assessment of applicable restrictions, for certain trade statistics, etc. Increased errors in connection with reporting VAT on imports may also give rise to injustices in terms of liquidity between a taxable person who has correctly reported VAT and a taxable person who has reported too little VAT.</p>
<h2>When can new regulations enter into force?</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the new regulations enter into force on 1 September 2014.</p>
<h2>Financing</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit includes proposing financing for the increased public sector costs amounting to some SEK 40 million that the</p>
<p>Inquiry’s proposal is expected to entail. The Inquiry has not found a suitable financing solution within the area of VAT. However, the Inquiry has found a proposal on financing within the area of excise duties consisting of a one-off index adjustment of pesticide tax and waste tax (landfill tax) in line with the consumer price index. A one- off adjustment of this kind means that the tax is reset in real terms to the level that applied when the tax was most recently changed. Thus, in reality, it is not a matter of a real tax increase compared to when the tax was most recently changed. It is estimated that the proposed index adjustment could mean increased public sector revenues amounting to approximately SEK 40 million.</p>
