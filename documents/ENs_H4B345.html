<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>One of the main tasks of the Inquiry is to propose amendments to commercial law provisions likely to be able to strengthen competitiveness of the Swedish fund industry and modernise Swedish fund regulations. The other two main tasks are to propose measures to improve the provision of information and comparability concerning how fund managers integrate sustainability aspects with their management, and to clarify for investors the difference between actively and passively managed funds.</p>
<h2>New and stricter information requirements</h2>
<p>Information on sustainability aspects in fund management</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that for each mutual fund (värdepappersfond) or alternative investment fund (AIF), the fund company (fondbolag) or the AIF manager is to submit the information necessary to understand the fund’s investments and their consequences with regard to sustainability, i.e. issues such as environment, working conditions, human rights and anti-corruption. Information on the sustainability aspects that have been taken into account in management, and the method or methods used in sustainability efforts, are to be presented in the fund’s information brochure and annual report. The annual report is to also include a report on follow-up of sustainability efforts. All information must be available on the fund company’s and the AIF manager’s websites.</p>
<p>If the manager does not take account of any sustainability aspects in his or her management of a fund, information to this effect must be available on the manager’s website and in the fund’s information brochure and annual report (Chapter 4).</p>
<p>Information concerning the level of activity in fund management</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that in the case of a mutual fund (värdepappersfond) that is not an index fund, the fund company (fondbolag) must report the measure of activity in its annual report or, if such a measure cannot be calculated, describe in some other way the management of the fund. A measure of activity or a description of the level of activity of fund management is to be available on the fund company’s website. The aim is that an investor should be able to make an assessment of the size of the annual fee in relation to the fund’s level of activity or provided description. The duty to provide information is also to apply to management companies (förvaltningsbolag) certified to manage a mutual fund (värdepappersfond). A similar duty to provide information is also to apply to AIF managers who market their alternative investment funds to nonprofessional investors in Sweden. There should be also a provision requiring funds structured on the basis of company law under the proposed new act on investment companies to provide information regarding the level of activity of fund management (Chapter 5).</p>
<h2>A new act on funds under company law</h2>
<p>In Sweden, it is not possible to set up a mutual fund or a special fund (a nationally regulated form of alternative investment fund) on the basis of company law. Abroad, however, this legal status is common. To increase Sweden’s competitiveness in relation to other jurisdictions and their fund legislation, a model with funds under company law should also be introduced in Sweden.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a new act on investment companies that builds on relevant provisions in the Swedish Companies Act and where existing provisions in fund legislation are ‘reused’ (Chapter 6). However, realising the proposal will require amendments to tax legislation. Since, under the Inquiry’s terms of reference, the remit does not cover tax issues, the proposal is presented with the provision that the rules be supplemented with the necessary amendments to the tax rules.</p>
<h2>Further measures to simplify and promote competition</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a number of amendments to fund legislation aimed at simplifying and enhancing the competitiveness of the Swedish fund industry. The Inquiry proposes, for instance, that also fund companies may keep ‘investment savings accounts’, albeit in limited form (Chapter 7), amendments and clarifications of certain investment and marketing provisions and certain capital adequacy regulations (Chapters 8–10). Furthermore, the Inquiry proposes detailed rules concerning the division of funds, corresponding to rules concerning fund mergers. The Inquiry also proposes that it must be possible for a fund to have special share classes adapted to distributors, who under other regulations are not allowed to receive compensation from third parties (Chapter 11).</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the legislative amendments enter into force on 3 January 2018 (Chapter 12).</p>
