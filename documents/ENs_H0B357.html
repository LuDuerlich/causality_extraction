<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background to the Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>The Aliens Act and the Aliens Ordinance deal with matters relating to the right of aliens to enter, stay and work in Sweden. This legislation regulates the legal aspects of migration for all aliens. However, in the area of migration law, the rules that apply to EEA nationals and their family members differ in many respects from those for other aliens.</p>
<p>In terms of legislative technique, this has been resolved in that EEA nationals and their family members, in addition to being covered by a number of provisions generally applicable to all aliens, are also covered by a number of special provisions. These special provisions are neither contained in a special chapter nor grouped together in any other way; instead, they are spread throughout various chapters of the Act and the Ordinance.</p>
<p>Under the terms of reference (ToR 2011:53; see annex 1 ) the Inquiry is to consider how a clearer division can be achieved between the provisions of the Aliens Act and the Aliens Ordinance relating to EEA nationals and their family members and the provisions of the Act and the Ordinance relating to other aliens. In doing so, the Inquiry is to take a position on whether the rules for EEA nationals and their family members should be grouped together in a separate chapter in each piece of legislation or contained in a separate act and a separate ordinance. The Inquiry’s remit therefore involves an editorial review of the Aliens Act and the Aliens Ordinance. It does not involve considering or proposing any material amendments to the legislation.</p>
<p>Regarding the need for an Inquiry, the terms of reference state that the legislative technique used in the current Aliens Act and Aliens Ordinance limits the practitioners’ ability to take stock of the rules that apply to EEA nationals and their family members.</p>
<p>The European Commission has also commented on the current regulations. In its review of Sweden’s implementation of the Free Movement Directive , the Commission has pointed out that the distinction between the provisions applicable to aliens in general and the provisions applicable to EU citizens and their family members is not entirely clear. In this respect, the special provisions on refusal of entry and expulsion in Chapter 8 of the Aliens Act have been the subject of criticism by the Commission.</p>
<h2>Basic structure of the aliens legislation</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has evaluated various legislative solutions. These include the options stated in the terms of reference, i.e. grouping together the rules applicable to EEA nationals and their family members in a separate chapter in the Aliens Act and the Aliens Ordinance or in a separate act and separate ordinance. The Inquiry has also considered a model that would separate out the key rules that apply to EEA nationals and their family members and place them in a separate chapter in each piece of legislation or alternatively in separate legislation. Various versions of this model are found in the aliens legislation of Denmark, Finland and Norway. Finally, the Inquiry has examined the option of maintaining the current basic structure and clarifying the regulations through more restricted systematic and linguistic improvements.</p>
<p>The various legislative solutions have different advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage of placing the provisions applicable to EEA nationals and their family members in a separate act and ordinance is that all the provisions applying to these aliens would be collected in two well-defined statutes. The counter argument is that a division into two sets of rules entails the need for either extensive parallel regulations or a very large number of references in the special regulations to specific provisions in the general regulations. The need for parallel provisions or references is so extensive that the benefits in terms of clarity and accessibility would be completely lost. This solution would therefore risk being perceived as less accessible than the current regulations.</p>
<p>A regulatory solution that would place the provisions in a separate chapter in the Aliens Act and the Aliens Ordinance would have the advantage of the provisions being grouped together in a well-defined chapter. Compared with the alternative of a separate act and ordinance, this option is also advantageous in that it would not entail the same need for references or parallel regulations. A disadvantage of this solution is that the chapter would be very voluminous. To be manageable, it would require a number of levels and sub-levels with headings and sub-headings that deviate from the levels and headings in the Act in general. Another disadvantage of this option is that the structure would clearly stand apart from the general structure of the Act. Moreover, it would be difficult to include all relevant regulations in one chapter in a natural way. Certain rules, for example most of the procedural rules, logically belong in other chapters of the Act.</p>
<p>An advantage of the system used in Danish, Finnish and Norwegian aliens legislation is that the most important rules can be grouped in a well-defined place and that the regulations are easy to grasp. Since this only concerns the central regulations, it is also possible to keep the volume of regulation down. However, this option would mean that the provisions applicable to EEA nationals and their family members would be systematised in a way that clearly deviates from the general structure of the Act. In addition, there is an inherent weakness in only certain provisions being placed in a separate chapter or in a separate act, namely that the division could be perceived as inconsistent. Since the regulations would not be exhaustive, it would have to be accepted that certain provisions contained elsewhere in the Act apply to EEA nationals and their family members.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that a solution based on the current structure of the aliens legislation is preferable. Maintaining the current basic structure has the advantage that the legislation would continue to be built up in a consistent, subject-based manner. Provisions belonging together thematically would be grouped together in a consistent manner, as they are now. The Inquiry considers that the deficiencies in transparency and clarity of the current regulation may be remedied making minor structural changes and presentational improvements in the form of more clearly defined provisions, clearer headings and more easily understandable legislative text.</p>
<h2>Areas requiring changes</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has identified three areas requiring changes:</p>
<p>• The provisions regulating the basic conditions of entry, stay and work in Chapter 2 of the Aliens Act and Chapters 2 and 3 of the Aliens Ordinance.</p>
<p>• The rules on the retention of right of residence in Chapter 3 of the Aliens Ordinance.</p>
<p>• The provisions on refusal of entry and expulsion in Chapter 8 of the Aliens Act.</p>
<h2>Conditions of entry, stay and work</h2>
<p>Chapter 2 of the Aliens Act regulates the basic conditions of entry, stay and work. It contains provisions concerning passport, visa, residence permit and work permit requirements along with exemptions from these requirements.</p>
<p>The legislative technique used in the chapter imposes a general rule and provides for exemptions in certain specified cases. However, the general rule and exemptions are neither stated nor placed in a consistent manner. This makes the regulations unnecessarily complicated and difficult both to grasp and apply. The Inquiry therefore proposes the introduction of a uniform structure where the general rule and exemptions from the general rule are regulated in separate paragraphs. This would make the regulations considerably more user-friendly.</p>
<p>The Aliens Ordinance contains certain exemptions from the passport and visa requirements for EEA nationals and their family members. The exemptions are central to Community law and are also of great practical importance to the free movement of people. The Inquiry therefore proposes that these exemptions be moved to Chapter 2 of the Act. By bringing together the most important exemptions in the Act, the regulations will also be more transparent and accessible.</p>
<h2>Retention of right of residence</h2>
<p>The regulations regarding the right of residence are divided so that the main regulations are contained in the Act, while the detailed provisions on retention of the right of residence, permanent residence and right of residence certificate, etc. are contained in the Ordinance. In the Inquiry’s opinion, the provisions on the retention of the right of residence are significant and of such weight that they should reasonably be found in the Act. It is also expected that application of the provisions would be facilitated by their inclusion in the Act. The Inquiry therefore proposes that the provisions on retention of the right of residence be moved from the Aliens Ordinance to the Aliens Act.</p>
<h2>Refusal of entry and expulsion</h2>
<p>In the Inquiry’s view, of the regulations relating to EEA nationals and their family members, the provisions on refusal of entry and expulsion in Chapter 8 of the Aliens Act are among the most difficult to grasp. The European Commission has also expressed criticism of these provisions. The Commission considers that certain articles of the Free Movement Directive on refusal of entry and expulsion (Articles 27.1, 27.2 and 28.1) have not been properly implemented.</p>
<p>One reason the regulations are perceived as difficult to grasp is that the provisions applying specifically to EEA nationals and their family members are not clearly separated but interspersed among the general rules that apply to all aliens. Also, in many cases, special rules and general provisions have been mixed together in one and the same paragraph, making the regulations even more complicated. In addition, some of these provisions could be formulated in a more explanatory and thorough fashion.</p>
<p>To eliminate these deficiencies, the provisions that apply specifically to EEA nationals and their family members should as far as possible be kept together and separated from the rules that apply to other aliens. The Inquiry therefore proposes that Chapter 8 be reorganised and divided into three main parts. The first part would regulate the conditions of refusal of entry and expulsion of aliens other than EEA nationals and their family members. The second part would contain corresponding regulations for EEA nationals and their family members. The third part would contain certain general provisions of primarily a procedural character that are essentially common to all aliens.</p>
<p>The proposed structure has several advantages compared with the current one. One advantage is that the division into three parts would remove any doubt about which rules apply to EEA nationals and their family members and which apply to other aliens. Another advantage is that the provisions would be easy to find and that, in a given case, the practitioner would not need to take account of the entire chapter, but would only need to apply the provisions contained in two of the three parts. Furthermore, several sections can be simplified. The current structure, where special rules are often mixed with general provisions in one and the same section, can be completely avoided. Under the proposal, sections would be both shorter and much easier to understand. To further facilitate application, the Inquiry also proposes the introduction of clearer headings and more explanatory and easily understandable legislative text whose wording is closer to that of the Free Movement Directive.</p>
<p>Finally, the Inquiry proposes that the meaning of the concepts of refusal of entry and expulsion be changed with respect to EEA nationals and their family members. The concept of refusal of entry should refer to removal that occurs in connection with entry or during the first three months after entry. The concept of expulsion should refer to removal orders imposed after this three-month period or, as is the case today, expulsion on account of criminal offences.</p>
<h2>Impact and entry into force</h2>
<p>Under the proposals, the provisions on free movement of EEA nationals and their family members would be more accessible, making it easier for all who are required to apply the regulations. The proposed change concerning the concepts of refusal of entry and expulsion would have a minimal cost impact on the police authorities and the Swedish Migration Board. Any cost increases can be met within the scope of existing appropriations. The proposals do not otherwise entail any other financial impact for public institutions or individuals.</p>
<p>The legislative amendments could be expected to come into force on 1 July 2013.</p>
