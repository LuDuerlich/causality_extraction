<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The disaster in south-east Asia caused enormous physical and mental suffering, many deaths and extensive material damage. Emergency assistance was initiated on the spot by those themselves afflicted, voluntary forces and local authorities. Travel agencies and insurance companies began their work on the basis of their obligations under law and their contracts in relation to clients and insurance holders. Aid organisations and voluntary organisations came to their assistance. The main issue in the Commission’s evaluation is how Swedish government authorities handled their part of the assistance efforts for Swedes caught up in the disaster. The consequences of deficiencies in the Swedish public administration’s handling of the situation are summarised below. It is a matter of the consequences that could have been avoided in the Commission’s view if preparations had been better or within the framework of given preconditions. In certain cases, this assessment is based on comparisons with other countries, in other cases on the Commission’s considerations and judgements.</p>
<p>Deficiencies identified</p>
<p>The fundamental deficiency in the public administration was that the Government Offices did not have an efficient organisation for handling serious crises. This had consequences in several different areas. During the first few days developments were also characterised by the lack of an emergency organisation and leadership at executive level. Staff were on duty at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs consular and press services and carried out their assignments but too many executives at middle and senior levels were absent. The ability to initiate and maintain good external contacts suffers seriously when senior executives are not in place.</p>
<p>The most direct and obvious consequence of deficiencies in planning and crisis management capability was that different efforts in the region were delayed. Initial efforts by personnel for reconnoitring, staff work and medical care could have been carried out two days earlier than was the case. The consequences of this delay were noticeable in a number of areas.</p>
<p>Disaster medical planning was inadequate for assessing the situation on the spot and initial medical efforts. Resources for this work – personnel, materials, transport capacity – were available but were not utilised at the greatest possible speed which the situation required. The main consequence of delayed medical efforts was the suffering which Swedish citizens were exposed to and which could have been avoided even with the extreme shortage in the afflicted region. Certain errors made could probably have been avoided if Swedish medical teams with qualifications in disaster medicine had reinforced the Thai medical institutions. These medical errors may lead to permanent injuries for those affected. In some cases there was an obvious risk of death which could only be avoided when the person concerned had the capability or contacts to ensure the necessary measures could be taken. It appears highly likely that many Thai citizens received poorer care as a result of the overtaxing of the medical services and the priorities made on the spot, and the possibility that Thai citizens died as a consequence of this cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>Consular management was adapted too slowly to the extreme situation that prevailed following the disaster. Personnel reinforcements were initially insufficient. A lack of empathy with the tourists who in many cases were badly hit is reported from many quarters. The routines for registering missing persons were undeveloped and in some cases led to serious mistakes in spite of a strong reinforcement of personnel and hard work on their part.</p>
<p>Communication with the general public was inefficient. It is understandable that the resources were stretched in such an extreme situation but with better preparation the damage could have been limited.</p>
<p>Public efforts in the logistics and transport area were insufficiently coordinated. As a result several people, both injured and uninjured, arrived home later than need have been the case.</p>
<p>Cooperation with other countries – primarily bilateral cooperation – could have been further developed. Cooperation with NGO actors – volunteers, voluntary organisations, travel</p>
<p>agencies and others concerned – would also have been more effective with better preparation.</p>
<p>A further consequence of importance was that confidence in the Swedish government as the ultimate guarantor of security and safety was damaged. Everyone agrees that the level of ambition cannot be the same in distant countries as in the home country and that the strain on Sweden which had many nationals in the area was particularly great, however, it may still be established that Sweden asserted itself badly in essential respects in comparison with countries with more efficient crisis management. This impact on confidence is difficult to assess but – in broad outline – it extends much further than the group of Swedish citizens directly involved in the disaster, those immediately affected or their relatives.</p>
<p>Causes of the deficiencies</p>
<p>The Government Offices lacked an efficient crisis management organisation</p>
<p>The basic deficiency in the organisation of the public administration was the lack of an efficient crisis management organisation. This explains several shortcomings in the Government Offices and its ministries, the Foreign Service and public authorities with regard to the late awareness of the nature and scale of the disaster, difficulties in assembling information, coordinating analyses and identifying relevant measures both within the Government Offices and in the interplay between ministries and authorities, as well as problems in executing measures effectively.</p>
<p>In the initial phase, no decisions were taken by the Government in matters of importance for crisis management nor was the Government convened. Instead, it was believed that measures taken to manage the crisis within the normal procedures for the Government Offices and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs would suffice, supplemented by temporary groups of State Secretaries and Ministers.</p>
<p>Leadership relations in dealings between the ministries during this crisis were unclear. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs undertook the role of leading ministry since the disaster had occurred abroad and the first information about it reached the</p>
<p>Government Offices through the consular duty officer at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. This did not, however, eliminate uncertainties regarding the division of authority between the ministries. The State Secretary Group considered itself responsible for coordination but cannot be seen as a group for actual crisis management. Decisions were not taken in the Group nor were any records kept of its meetings. This meant that many uncertainties about the division of responsibility remained. Problems in dealing with issues involving more than one ministry are illustrated inter alia by the protracted handling of the efforts of the Swedish Rescue Services Agency in Thailand.</p>
<p>With the loose procedure applied within the Government Offices and the Ministry for Foreign Affairs it was difficult to identify the point at which a consular regime for dealing with the situation should be replaced by more vigorous crisis management. When this took place, only informal signals were sent out in the organisation indicating that financing issues would not be a problem in the context. This matter should have been subject to a formal decision at a cabinet meeting at an early stage, marking the Government’s responsibility and important role.</p>
<p>A temporary organisation based on a vague principle concerning the leading ministry is totally inadequate for managing crises of major proportions. Experience from the tsunami has forcibly overthrown the idea that the task can be fulfilled without a formal organisation for crisis management under the Government.</p>
<p>The Ministries’ after-hours services were inadequate</p>
<p>Warning of the earthquake in the Indian Ocean reached the Ministry for Foreign Affairs through the consular officer on duty and very soon both press officers and the Duty Officer were involved in the matter. This first part of the 24-hour organisation worked well. The next step in the organisation was less efficient. The executives most closely involved at middle and senior levels – the Head of Group for consular assistance, the Head of the Consular Department and the Director-General for Administrative Affairs – were on holiday and took between one and two plus days to arrive at the Ministry – an unacceptable delay. Both the Head of Group and the Head of Department began work on Boxing Day but by telephone from a distance. As a result, management of</p>
<p>efforts at the Ministry was weak for more than a day. Not until the head of a department is physically present can any really effective build-up of activities – in terms of personnel and structure – be secured in the initial phase of a crisis such as this.</p>
<p>Added to this, within the Ministry for Foreign Affairs there appears to have been uncertainty about who is the most senior executive with operative responsibility for crisis efforts of the kind that became necessary – the State Secretary for Foreign Affairs or the Director-General for Administrative Affairs. Most people seem to have considered the State Secretary should obviously have this role, but he had a different perception of his role.</p>
<p>Many of the problems can be explained by the inadequate routines for communicating information in the Ministry. With improved routines for spread of information and analysis, the organisation would have started on its crisis management work more rapidly, even with the incomplete 24-hour service at middle management level. Among other things, active contacts could have been made with other capital cities. The threshold for directly alerting higher levels of the hierarchy of officials must be low regarding information of an emergency nature. The system with what is called the Minister’s Office established as a link between Minister and the State Secretary and between the Ministry management and Heads of Department contains problems. Instead, this office risks becoming a filter.</p>
<p>At the Ministry of Defence, the alarm function worked thanks to initiatives by an individual officer. The Ministry of Defence’s routine of having an officer on duty at home after office hours had been withdrawn in the summer of 2004. There seems to have been no uncertainty as to who had the main operative responsibility in this Ministry.</p>
<p>The national medical and health services were inadequately prepared for efforts abroad</p>
<p>An early and strong Swedish medical effort was justified. The great strain on the Thai medical services lasted for many days and could have been alleviated by Swedish contributions. In this way the physical and mental suffering of both Swedish and Thai citizens could have been reduced. Moreover, earlier and more extensive</p>
<p>efforts were needed in order to plan and effectively implement the evacuation of those injured.</p>
<p>In the event of crises and disasters, it is the duty of the National Board of Health and Welfare to keep the Government informed of developments, the ongoing situation and anticipated further developments. If many Swedes can be expected to arrive home in need of qualified medical care, it may be said to lie within the framework of this duty to obtain information about the number of patients, the situation regarding injuries, etc. The appropriate way to do so is to send an assessment team to the disaster area. If this had been done, the team would probably have undertaken medical tasks there and, in addition, immediately requested reinforcements from home.</p>
<p>The authority responsible at the national level, the National Board of Health and Welfare with its Crisis Management Department, reacted late and, furthermore, was understaffed during the first week after the disaster, despite the fact that personnel were available. The Department could also have been reinforced with experts in disaster medicine from one of the knowledge centres in this area which have been created with the Board’s participation. There was no lack of personnel qualified in disaster medicine and many of those who had participated in such training were prepared to make a contribution in Thailand at short notice. There was even an arrangement for personal contracts for work abroad.</p>
<p>When a crisis is handled by a ministry (in this case the Ministry for Foreign Affairs) which does not have its own medical experts, the mobilisation of resources is protracted. The National Board of Health and Welfare was responsible for coordination in this area but did not take that responsibility until 29 December, more than seventy-two hours after the disaster – an unacceptable delay in the prevailing situation.</p>
<p>The consular system was inadequately prepared for major disasters</p>
<p>The disaster in south-east Asia was of an exceptional nature and to demand a plan adapted to such an extreme event would be unreasonable. At the same time, preparedness in the consular area</p>
<p>did not live up to more modest demands either. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs may be said to have confirmed this assessment in that many changes have been announced and taken in the period following the tsunami.</p>
<p>The hastily organised system for registering missing persons data contained far too many sources of error. The methods used meant there was a danger of serious mistakes, which were also made with grave consequences in some cases. Personnel for registration of personal data should have been mobilised more rapidly, above all at executive level. Personnel from the Consular Department were engaged in individual consular cases instead of leading the registration work which came partly to be performed by personnel with no experience of such tasks. It would have been more expedient to call in reinforcements of personnel from the police, who have the relevant experience. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs did not make appropriate use of the expert support and assistance available at authorities such as the police and the Swedish Tax Authority rapidly enough, partly due to deficiencies in communication between the Ministry and the police.</p>
<p>Planning for reinforcement of personnel in places hit by a crisis was also inadequate. Before the disaster, the Embassy in Bangkok had taken preparatory measures for major accidents and in that respect was probably better equipped than many other embassies. Reinforcements from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Stockholm and from other embassies came too slowly in the first week for it to be possible to gain control over the situation and this applies in both Phuket and Bangkok.</p>
<p>Ambassador Hafström took the first measures in accordance with the applicable rules and crisis plan. Whether his instructions were adequate for securing the management function at the embassy in his absence may be discussed. Management problems also arose in Phuket.</p>
<p>Reports back to the Ministry were unsatisfactory. On the first night after his arrival in Phuket, Ambassador Hafström should not have been satisfied with following the ordinary routines but should have contacted the State Secretary or the Minister for Foreign Affairs directly to inform them of the gravity of the situation, the measures he planned to take and the acute need of personnel reinforcements.</p>
<p>Many of those afflicted and their relatives have described to the Commission what they perceived as a lack of empathy on the part</p>
<p>of the Foreign Service both in the region and back home in Sweden. Consular support in the region was characterised by strict adhesion to the consular framework of rules without regard for the extraordinary situation. In this context it should be mentioned that the new rather stringently formulated Financial Assistance to Swedish Citizens Abroad Act from 2003 was adopted by a unanimous Riksdag. In the Commission’s view, it is clear that this Act came to mark the behaviour of many Foreign Service officials in the first period after the disaster.</p>
<p>Division of responsibility</p>
<p>The Government Offices’ inadequate ability to manage crises</p>
<p>The task of the Government Offices is to process government business and to generally assist the Government and cabinet ministers in their activities. The Prime Minister is head of both the Government Offices and the Prime Minister’s Office. The responsibility for the organisation of the Government Offices, and hence for the existence or absence of a crisis management organisation as well as its structure, in reality rests with the Prime Minister. This responsibility cannot be delegated from the Prime Minister since by nature it embraces all ministries.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, there are no circumstances that could warrant any other assessment of where the responsibility lies. If one chooses to divide responsibility according to the principle of responsibility the result will be the same; he who has responsibility for an activity under normal conditions – in this case the Prime Minister –has responsibility during crises and disasters.</p>
<p>When the tsunami occurred, the Prime Minister, Göran Persson, had been in office for over eight years. The crisis management question had been raised in different contexts, primarily in connection with the report of the Commission on Vulnerability and Security and the bills presented by the Government on the basis of this report. The fact that the Government Offices did not have a crisis management function was not because the matter had not been discussed but was rather a conscious standpoint.</p>
<p>It must also be mentioned that the majority of the bodies to which the matter was referred for consideration were positive to the proposal for a national crisis management organisation. In its</p>
<p>bill, the Government cited constitutional reasons against the proposal. These arguments were noteworthy as arguments against certain elements of the proposal but appear to the Commission to be weak as an impediment to the introduction of a crisis management function based with certain adjustments on the proposal. The Riksdag took a decision in accordance with the Government’s proposal; matters concerning the organisation of the Government Offices are traditionally considered to be an internal matter for the Government, ultimately the Prime Minister. However, in this matter, the parliamentary Committee on Defence had made certain statements in favour of the proposal from the Commission on Vulnerability and Security.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, it was the Prime Minister, Göran Persson, who was generally responsible for the shortcomings of the Government Offices in managing the consequences of the tsunami.</p>
<p>The inadequate after-hours service</p>
<p>Regarding the division of responsibility between the State Secretary for Foreign Affairs and the Director-General for Administrative Affairs mentioned, there is some guidance in the Government Offices’ rules and code of procedure for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Service. Under the Minister, work is coordinated by the State Secretary. The Director-General for Administrative Affairs is responsible under the State Secretary for management of the Foreign Service in administrative terms.</p>
<p>Management of a major operation following a natural disaster is not in common parlance an “administrative” task. There is little scope for any other assessment than that the State Secretary must be regarded as primarily responsible for operations in situations such as this. In the situation prevailing on Boxing Day and the time immediately thereafter, he cannot be said to have fulfilled the expectations accompanying such responsibility.</p>
<p>The Director-General for Administrative Affairs is responsible for emergency planning in the Foreign Service. This responsibility includes on the one hand satisfactory replacement arrangements in the event of his own absence from work and the absence of subordinate executives and, on the other, instructions for duty officers and other subordinate personnel concerning what is to be observed in the case of occurrences of a serious nature. However,</p>
<p>the Director-General cannot be considered to bear sole responsibility for the accessibility of other executives and other emergency functions. There is a management responsibility at a higher level also. The political leadership of the Ministry is responsible for ensuring the stability of the organisation and that its emergency capability is adequate.</p>
<p>It should be added that each executive at the different levels of an organisation has a personal responsibility to be available at the workplace when the task and situation so demand. Heads of department lead and distribute work within their departments. They have a principle’s responsibility for their area of expertise and should – in accordance with the provisions that apply throughout the Government Offices – keep the Minister for Foreign Affairs, other Ministers in the Ministry and executive officers informed of issues of major importance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the code of procedure for the Ministry for Foreign Affairs contains a rule on communication of information. More detailed routines for this are not documented as far as the Commission is aware; they appear to be based on practice.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, the division of responsibility for the inadequate response in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in the first few days after the crisis is as follows:</p>
<p>– The State Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Hans Dahlgren, was responsible for leading the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and thereby the Government Offices’ management of the disaster effort, and hence bears a major share of responsibility for the late response, inter alia by not having with his organisation actively sought information about the disaster and established contacts with other capitals at an early stage. The Swedish Rescue Services Agency’s first efforts could have been both speedier and more purposeful. He should furthermore have sought explanations as to why so many rang the Ministry and enquired about what they had to say. In that this did not take place, those responsible were not aware of the serious situation at an early stage.</p>
<p>– The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Laila Freivalds, is responsible for the fact that the applicable rules concerning the emergency planning organisation and executives’ tasks in this context were inadequate for ensuring good emergency preparedness in the Ministry. Regarding the deficiencies in emergency planning,</p>
<p>the Director-General for Administrative Affairs, Per Thöresson, also bears a considerable share of the responsibility.</p>
<p>– The Head of Ministry is responsible for the inefficient internal communication routines that were in fact applied. She has to ensure the capability of her Minister’s Office since this office is her link to the Foreign Service. The State Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Hans Dahlgren, should be criticised for not informing the Minister for Foreign Affairs during the first 24 hours. The Head of the Consular Department, Jan Nordlander, as principle should be criticised for not directly or indirectly having ensured that the basic information available about the serious situation was communicated to the State Secretary and the Minister.</p>
<p>– Per Thöresson, Jan Nordlander and Christina Palm, Head of Group, should be criticised for having stayed at their residences too long. At least one of them should have immediately interrupted their holiday and gone to the Ministry to lead activities from there. Thöresson should have acted to ensure this.</p>
<p>– The Commission finds it remarkable that the management of the Ministry of Defence had withdrawn the  24-hour service and hence at the time of the tsunami relied on other communication routines or voluntary efforts by officers after office hours.</p>
<p>Medical service organisation</p>
<p>From a civil perspective, demands for a strong and clear medical contribution are justified. It is possible that had a clear regulation of national responsibility for emergencies been in place, possibly supplemented by agreements between the Government and the County Councils, this would have facilitated such a medical effort. However, it must be born in mind that the situation faced could hardly have been the aim of such regulation. The perspective of legislation on emergency situations was national in the first instance. If, on the other hand, a central crisis management body with a cohesive overview had been established, the need for action in the medical area would probably have been identified earlier notwithstanding the absence of applicable legislation in the area.</p>
<p>Even without such legislation and concerted crisis management, there was scope for a much more active approach on the part of the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs. The State Secretary, Mikael Sjöberg, and Minister for Health, Ylva Johansson, must be considered responsible for this passivity. Responsibility for the delayed and initially underdimensioned effort rests with the National Board of Health and Welfare and its Unit of Crisis Preparednes.</p>
<p>The consular system</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Director-General for Administrative Affairs is responsible for emergency planning at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. However, comprehensive issues concerning the dimensioning of consular activities are of a political nature and hence lie within the remit of the State Secretary and Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Commission has the impression from interviews that for a long time consular issues have been given low priority in Ministry for Foreign Affairs operations. Furthermore, in connection with recruitment and training, the Ministry management is responsible for clarifying that the Foreign Service’s tasks include providing support and sympathy.</p>
<p>Measures</p>
<p>The Commission’s remit includes pointing to the need for changes in organisation, routines for interaction, governance, information matters and other routines for crisis management. The purpose of this part of the assignment is to strengthen preparedness and society’s ability to deal with events that affect a large number of Swedes outside this country also. The Commission has chosen to focus in this context on the country’s central crisis management capability.</p>
<p>Points of departure</p>
<p>Sweden in a global context</p>
<p>The formulation in the Instrument of Government stating that the personal, economic and cultural welfare of the individual shall be the fundamental aims of public activity is the starting-point for a discussion of what may be reasonably expected of the public administration in a crisis situation. However, this needs to be concretised.</p>
<p>The conclusions of the Commission imply mainly clarifications, and no significant changes to the basic division of responsibility between the individual citizen, private agents and the state. Even if the responsibility of the private agents and that of the state remain unchanged, the Commission considers that the state, on the basis of citizens´expectations, has a responsibility as the ultimate guarantor of the security and safety of its citizens.</p>
<p>The first reasonable expectation applies to the physical demarcation of the administration’s assignment. The public undertaking in respect of Swedes abroad in the Commission’s view must be given a partly new content as a result of internationalisation. There are about half a million expat Swedes around the world – people who live and work temporarily or on a more permanent basis in other countries. Every month an average of over 200 000 Swedes travel abroad. Against this backdrop, the role of the public administration can no longer be narrowly tied to Swedish territory. The ability to safeguard Swedish citizens and their interests outside the country’s borders must be developed. This in itself does not imply any changes to the fundamental division of responsibility between the individual and the state but is an adaptation to new preconditions.</p>
<p>Secondly, the ability of the public administration to meet a crisis should not be seriously impaired because the crisis takes place during a holiday. If political decision-makers and senior officials define their task in such a way that they are not available at certain times of the day or year, an efficient 24-hour service must be put in place to compensate for this.</p>
<p>Principles for crisis management</p>
<p>The public administration’s management of the consequences of the tsunami shows several weaknesses in the structure of Sweden’s administration: the lack of a central crisis management function, inefficient communication of information also within the ministries, inhibitory boundaries between different sectors and the unclear interface between the Government Offices and public agencies. A new organisation must eliminate these weaknesses.</p>
<p>In official documents concerning total defence and crisis management planning, reference is often made to the principle of responsibility, meaning that the authority that is responsible for an activity in normal circumstances must also have that responsibility in the event of a crisis or war. This principle sounds reasonable but is unclear and even risks impairing an organisation’s crisis management. If it is strongly asserted that the principle of responsibility must govern crisis management, signals to the world around from authorities that are not capable of meeting a crisis on their own will be delayed. The organisation is in danger of ending up in a situation where it manages activities for which it is not qualified. One of the central problems of crisis management is to decide when the point has been reached and the crisis is of such dimensions that there must be a change from normal routines to more expedient ones if the situation is to be successfully managed. It is this capability in the public administration that must be developed. The principle of responsibility and the other principles need to be toned down as guidance for planning in favour of other principles that are more appropriate in the context.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, two new principles are required, a principle of simplicity and a principle of caution. Simplicity is a fundamental requirement of an organisational structure for crisis management. With the conditions that apply in an organisation under extreme stress, it must be clear to each and every one how their own work fits into the overall structure, whither information is to be sent, who has the authority to take decisions and who is responsible for the implementation of decisions taken. In a crisis organisation there must be a clear centre where information is processed and analysed, where decisions are taken and from which directives for the implementation of decisions proceed. The lack of such a crisis management centre was a fundamental deficiency after the tsunami.</p>
<p>The fact that there is a centre with responsibility for processing and analysis of information, for decision-making and directing implementation does not mean that all the know-how and resources should be assembled at this point. All successful crisis management requires networks, both national and international. However, coordination between the different authorities and other organisations included in these networks must be prepared.</p>
<p>In a situation of uncertainty, investing more resources than may be needed may be regarded as an application of the principle of caution which applies as a basic rule for crisis management in several areas connected with health and the environment. If there is good reason to believe efforts may be needed, efforts should also be made. At the everyday level, this principle governs the work of the rescue and fire services in our municipalities.</p>
<p>Central crisis management – tasks and location</p>
<p>Basic requirements and tasks</p>
<p>The threats and risks society faces are complex and hence often span over several sectors. New risks are successively built into society and crises tend to occur with no or at very short previous notice. It may be a question of both major national crises, which may be defined as national concerns, and international crises that affect many Swedes.</p>
<p>The Government has many tasks to deal with in situations of this kind. It must form a correct picture of the situation as a basis for the decisions that are to be made. It needs to identify the threats the situation represents, whether it be a case of natural disasters or consciously inflicted damage. It must identify the measures that need to be taken, which of these require formal government decisions and which may possibly require new legislation that needs to be rapidly processed by the Riksdag. An essential aspect is how the financing of necessary measures is to be guaranteed, so that doubt or discussions about this matter do not unnecessarily delay processing. Important actors at regional and local levels, organisations outside the public sector and the general public need to be informed of the situation and the measures the Government intends to take. Contacts need to be established with other countries in order to coordinate action and avoid conflicts.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that a crisis management unit be established in the Government Offices. The overall task of the crisis management unit will be to assist the Government in its work by acting as its main instrument for strategic leadership of the administration during crises. Thus, the focus is strategic but the remit will also include operative tasks in the initial stages of crises so that no time is lost. Operative tasks of this type may include initiating rescue and emergency medical efforts, ordering transport capacity, preparing informational work and mobilising monitoring resources.</p>
<p>Work in the initial stages will also include starting up work at the relevant ministries. A cabinet group should be formed with at least five members so that it is able to take government decisions where necessary. As soon as the crisis has an overseas dimension the Minister for Foreign Affairs must be included in this group. During the crisis, the ministries involved should have representatives at the level of Director posted to the crisis management unit.</p>
<p>After having taken decisions on initial measures, the crisis management unit will also have an executive function. It must see to it that decisions are implemented and that efforts are coordinated. If crises with international aspects are involved, Ministry for Foreign Affairs resources must be included in the staff of the crisis management unit to prepare the way for planned measures.</p>
<p>At the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, there must be a clear management function for crisis issues. A special post as DirectorGeneral for Crisis Management should be set up – as planned by the Ministry itself. From the operative aspect, the DirectorGeneral for Crisis Management should be directly subordinate to the State Secretary for Foreign Affairs in order to underscore the latter’s overall responsibility at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. He in his turn will be subordinate to the Head of the crisis management unit in the event of a major crisis abroad that befalls many Swedes.</p>
<p>Location of a central board of crisis management</p>
<p>To be able to act efficiently, a central board of crisis management must be able to give instructions to other authorities and ministries. A political mandate is needed to be able to do so; crises in society almost always have political implications. Certain crises require cooperation with other countries. When contacts of this nature are to be established, it should naturally take place at ministerial level and preferably with a crisis management unit at the ministry. In the light of this, the location of a national crisis management function in the Government Offices appears natural. The Prime Minister’s Office already has a coordinating function in the Government Offices. Proximity to the Prime Minister is furthermore of major importance to give the board of crisis management authority in relation to the ministries concerned. This conclusion also applies in the case of any changes to the structure of ministries and authorities.</p>
<p>Staffing</p>
<p>The crisis management unit should have a core group of some six or seven people, highly qualified in the relevant sphere of knowledge and with broad general knowledge. The task of this core group will be to carry out the first analysis of the situation and decide the measures that are most urgently required regarding transport, medical care, rescue operations and so on. Thereafter the group’s task will be to manage the crisis management unit and guarantee continuity and stamina in the acute stage.</p>
<p>The leaders of the crisis group must have direct access to the Prime Minister (or a deputy with a full mandate appointed by the Prime Minister) in order to get the go ahead for the most highly prioritised measures if the crisis is judged to be of a serious nature. Prioritised measures include convening a cabinet meeting without delay where one of the main tasks will be to take decisions on financing the measures that may be required in the short and medium-term.</p>
<p>The crisis management unit will also include a group with responsibility for information search and analysis. Within the framework of the 24-hour organisation, it has the task of alerting the leaders of the crisis management unit who must make an</p>
<p>assessment of the situation on the basis of available information and any additional information that can be rapidly obtained. The assessment of the situation will include both an estimate of the scale of the crisis, its gravity and how urgent is the need for rapid measures.</p>
<p>The group should furthermore have a network of experts with the relevant competence from authorities, organisations or companies, who can be mobilised at short notice for service at the crisis management unit.</p>
<p>Legal regulation</p>
<p>The Commission proposes no amendments to the fundamental legal preconditions. Deliberations are carried on within the framework of the present Instrument of Government. Also in crisis situations, exercise of power must be regulated by law, and for this reason special rules for crisis management should not be based on what is known as the constitutional jus necessitatis.</p>
<p>The Act concerning protection against accidents regulates the rescue services, that is to say the rescue efforts the Government and local governments must take to prevent and limit injuries to people and damage to properties or the environment in connection with accidents or an imminent risk of accidents. Accidents means in this context sudden events that have involved or may be feared to involve damage, whether caused by natural phenomena or by human acts, with or without intent. This protection currently applies within Sweden’s borders. This Act does not apply to health and medical care nor to transportation of patients. Public resources should intervene only if the individual cannot him/herself or with the help of others deal with an accident situation.</p>
<p>Under law there is a possibility of allowing a government authority to take responsibility for extensive municipal rescue efforts. The provision allows the Government scope to take over responsibility itself and appoint a rescue commander.</p>
<p>A rescue commander has far-reaching powers, such as to order compulsory service, requisition equipment and other property such as vehicles, machines or vessels that can be used in the rescue services, irrespective of whether they come from authorities or the private sector.</p>
<p>Since the Act aims to create protection against accidents that befall individuals on Swedish territory, it should be supplemented by an amendment to the effect that power to act in Sweden shall also apply when an accident befalls a large number of Swedes abroad. In cases of this nature, the rescue commander would have the same opportunities to act in Sweden as he or she would have had if it had been an exclusively national rescue mission under the Act.</p>
<p>However, the rescue commander cannot be given the same powers for action abroad in connection with an accident. Regulation of this area is complicated since it is based on the recipient country’s acceptance of Swedish exercise of authority or actual action on its territory. Embassies and other foreign services have certain possibilities under international law to protect their citizens’ interests abroad. In a crisis situation they may bring additional personnel resources into the embassy organisation. It is furthermore always possible to send out groups for assessment or other missions. Apart from that, it is a matter for diplomatic negotiations with the state concerned in each individual case. The Foreign Service therefore has a central role here.</p>
<p>As long as the effort takes place in Sweden, compulsory measures are available. When action due to an accident is taken abroad, the same procedure does not apply as a matter of course. In the Commission’s view contract solutions should be used to achieve the desired result. Personnel who may need to be engaged should have signed a contract in advance so that it is totally clear which people the rescue commander may contact in connection with a rescue mission abroad, on the conditions that thereby follow. In an equivalent way preparations should be made regarding material resources.</p>
<p>The various operative resources are available at public authorities</p>
<p>– inter alia in the rescue services, police and medical services. The Government and its crisis management unit therefore needs to be equipped with extended powers to take decisions on such operative efforts in order to realise coordinated and cohesive leadership in connection with a major crisis. This may take place either through informal contacts between the crisis management unit and the Directors of authorities or through supplementary provisions to the authorities’ ordinances and/or other ordinances.</p>
<p>To ensure a rapid response in connection with a major disaster, the head of the crisis management unit should have the authority</p>
<p>to initiate certain efforts, pending the convening of the Government.</p>
<p>Routine tasks</p>
<p>Emergency planning should include – in addition to plans for mobilisation of the unit – the creation of a set of staff groups who can be sent at very short notice to places within the country and abroad. In the event of operations abroad, coordination is required with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs planned emergency groups, whose competence they can complement in important respects. There is a need for constant updating of information on material resources such as transport capacity and rapidly accessible resources for medical efforts. Contacts with other countries is an essential part of the crisis management unit’s organisational infrastructure. The crisis management unit is to represent Sweden in the international network which is already partly established between crisis management units in certain EU countries. Where such contacts are not established, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs will be the intermediary link. A call centre function is of vital importance as soon as large groups in the community are involved, either directly affected or as relatives.</p>
<p>The crisis management unit should be responsible for practice activities in the Government Offices. However, practice activities are not sufficient to maintain the capacity that may be required in serious crises. Consideration should therefore be given to using the crisis management unit in connections other than purely crisis related situations in order to fully test the organisation when many authorities and NGO actors collaborate. Examples of such events include high-level political events, international sports events and the like.</p>
<p>The crisis management unit can also set emergency preparedness requirements for authorities. The above conclusions will not change even if a radical modification of the authorities’ structure in the emergency preparedness and total defence area should be chosen. The need for a central crisis management function in the Government Offices remains, both to secure the function in itself and to create an efficient opposite party to authorities, setting requirements.</p>
<p>Other measures</p>
<p>The role of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and consular issues</p>
<p>When a disaster occurs abroad, this is immediately a matter for the Swedish foreign mission on the spot. Normally, all contacts between authorities are initially channelled through the Foreign Service. The Foreign Service must strengthen its contacts with travel agencies and insurance companies both in Sweden and abroad. Internal information in the Foreign Service must be improved; above all, in a crisis or disaster situation, the foreign missions concerned must receive information about decisions taken in Stockholm more rapidly.</p>
<p>The consular resources at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs need to be reinforced to meet the substantially increased need of information and assistance that arises in a major crisis situation. Consular work must be given the importance and priority it deserves.</p>
<p>The Ministry for Foreign Affairs is dependent on an efficient duty officer function that alerts the organisation. An executive after-hours service should include the State Secretary and other senior officials. The duty requirements should mean the person in question must be able to be at the Ministry within an hour. In addition, each geographic unit and certain functional units should have their own after-hours service within their areas of responsibility.</p>
<p>The Ministry for Foreign Affairs’ own proposal to set up a standby force should be carried through. Its efforts should be coordinated by the Swedish Rescue Services Agency and other relevant authorities. In the event of a major crisis where the situation is unclear, an important measure for the Ministry should be to immediately send out an experienced officer to make a first assessment and assist the foreign mission on the spot.</p>
<p>The Ministry should continue work on a model for the foreign missions’ emergency plans. Each foreign mission should have prepared a special crisis management group with the participation of an adequate number of people from the Swedish colony in the country. The honorary consulates, which often lie in areas with many tourists and are headed by a person who is well acquainted with the local authorities, the people, the language and the</p>
<p>environs, should also be concretely engaged in the emergency work by the respective embassy.</p>
<p>Today, embassies have relatively limited possibilities of deviating from the applicable provisions on consular assistance. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs should delegate more consular powers to the foreign missions, for example regarding the interpretation of the consular framework of rules. This part of the framework of rules should be supplemented by rules for extraordinary situations that can be activated following a local decision by the embassy.</p>
<p>Registration and identification</p>
<p>The police should have the basic responsibility for registration of missing persons, whether missing at home or abroad. Contacts from the general public to give information or make enquiries about missing persons should be directed to the police, not to the Government Offices. Decisions to mobilise the ID Commission should be taken by the National Police Board. The basis for this decision may come from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs but also from other intelligence sources. As far as individual deaths abroad from natural causes are concerned there need be no major changes.</p>
<p>The technology for identifying the dead is at present developing very rapidly. DNA-based techniques play an increasingly important role, particularly when the remains are badly damaged due to the nature of the disaster and when no dental data is available which is normally the case with children. There is a great deal to be gained by increased speed and better adapted efforts directly after accidents to secure DNA of high quality. Sweden should act at the international level for the development of these techniques and an adaptation of the routines for taking care of the remains of the dead. In addition, legislation relating to bio banks should be adapted so that emergency legislative measures following major accidents will not be necessary in the future.</p>
<p>Rescue services</p>
<p>At the request of the Government, the Swedish Rescue Services Agency is in the process of developing its capacity for missions abroad. The mission includes supporting, in the initial phase of a</p>
<p>crisis and at short notice, the embassy or consulate concerned and Swedish citizens in distress. The envisaged ogranisation includes a task force to be sent to the crisis area in order to reconnoitre and plan the rescue mission, establish a coordination staff and an information centre, and deliver health care and crisis support. In order to make a rapid analys of the situation, an assessment team should first be sent to the area (within six hours of the decision). The assessment team is part of the task force and shall initiate the establishment of a coordination staff in support of the embassy or consulate in the area. The Commission´s impression it that this work is proceeding well and shall continue.</p>
<p>Medical care</p>
<p>The disaster in south-east Asia showed that Swedish medical contributions in one form or another may be warranted outside Swedish territory. A first task of the national crisis organisation is to plan efforts for some of the typical cases that may arise. The task also includes guaranteeing preparedness for rapid action. The requirement of preparedness concerns on the one hand management staff and, on the other, action groups that may be required for reconnaissance and initial medical efforts in affected regions which may be very distant from Sweden.</p>
<p>The operative responsibility should be linked to an identified county council. At this level there is permanent preparedness for rapid action, a broad spectrum of relevant expertise and experience of coordinating resources from more than one county council. It should be possible to use the experience gained from the ongoing task of the National Board of Health and Welfare to investigate the preconditions for medical efforts abroad, irrespective of which form of organisation is chosen.</p>
<p>Logistics and transport</p>
<p>The state cannot build up resources of its own for all crisis situations imaginable; the absolutely biggest share of logistic and transport resources are available in the private transport sector. Either a private solution should be chosen on the basis of customary public procurement or one or possibly several</p>
<p>authorities should be requested to develop a centre of this type. The body responsible may engage the specialist competence needed to fulfil the task by means of contracts with aircraft brokers and other actors in the transport sector.</p>
<p>Information, communication, the media</p>
<p>Publication of information on the Internet, broadband and third generation mobile telephony is a feature that totally changes the preconditions both for the dissemination of information and communication between private individuals and authorities. After the tsunami, there were very soon what are known as blogs and wikis where any Internet user could post information with, for example, names and pictures of those missing. In some cases, this took place in direct response to the fact that it was considered the Ministry for Foreign Affairs was not giving adequate information about missing and injured persons. Pictures can also be sent by modern mobile telephones, which increases the impact of the information communicated.</p>
<p>This new situation requires a reorientation of authorities’ information and communication policy. Information sources other than the traditional ones must be monitored, both as sources for the supply of information and as independent centres from which information is disseminated, changing the premises for opinion formation. The situation calls for both new technology and to some extent new know-how.</p>
<p>Government offices cannot be dependent on the media to form an opinion of a situation. To meet reasonable requirements of autonomy, complementary flows of information are needed and a capacity for actively seeking information not communicated through the traditional media. This requires in its turn an analytical capacity, that is to say area-specific expertise, to decide what supplementary information should be sought and where it should be sought.</p>
<p>The new media situation also signifies changed preconditions for authorities’ choice of information strategy. It may be necessary to follow a more open information strategy than that traditionally applied.</p>
<p>Government coordination with non-governmental actors</p>
<p>The evaluation has shown that non-governmental actors could be used in emergency preparedness to a greater extent than has so far been the case in Sweden. Cooperation with private and other nongovernmental actors may be necessary both for obtaining information and for specific action in an emergency situation. A concrete example is that the Government enter into contracts with, inter alia, tour operators and Swedish companies operating abroad in order to obtain immediate access to information about the Swedes who are in a specific country. The task of making and maintaining such contacts and entering into such contracts should rest with the national crisis management unit’s management. Travel agencies, insurance companies and SOS organisations are also vital cooperation partners for obtaining other information about the ongoing situation and for planning action such as custody and transport home.</p>
<p>Cooperation with voluntary organisations is essential to enable the whole of society’s resources to be utilised in a crisis. Naturally, it is of major importance here too that contacts are established in good time before a crisis in order to ensure efficient coordination of efforts in the emergency situation.</p>
<p>It is also very important to build networks of non-governmental actors abroad. For a small country such as Sweden it is neither possible nor desirable to maintain missions abroad of such dimensions as would guarantee in all cases the resources that might be needed in a crisis. It is therefore an important task for Swedish missions in situ to make contact and establish cooperation with companies, organisations and private individuals.</p>
<p>In major crises, many volunteers – who either happen to be in the place or go there – spontaneously take part in assistance efforts. The use of volunteers in crisis management is largely an unregulated area. It may be assumed that in an emergency situation the authority responsible can employ personnel for project work or in some other way conclude contracts for special services from individuals.</p>
<p>Coordination with other countries</p>
<p>It is not realistic to assume that the EU will be responsible for operations of this type in the foreseeable future. Instead, informal networks between nations appear to be the main complement to national emergency preparedness. In this context, Sweden must be a competent cooperating partner. A crisis management unit of the type recommended is a precondition if other countries’ crisis management units are to have a natural contact point in emergency situations. The proposed crisis management unit must actively establish good contact networks all over the world for informal exchanges of information and possibly to coordinate different efforts.</p>
<p>Certain initiatives have been taken for increased cooperation between the Nordic countries. Among other things, consultations between the Nordic capitals is to be intensified and joint transportation home from crisis areas prepared. Furthermore, the Nordic embassies and consulates will be instructed to jointly plan and, above all, locally practise crisis leadership and management.</p>
<p>Language is a common and important basis on which to build. The Nordic foreign missions should, in the Commission’s view, aim to treat each other’s citizens as their own.</p>
<p>Financial issues</p>
<p>Financial matters pertaining to the country’s crisis management capability have two sides. On the one hand it concerns regulation of the damage and injuries that occur after a major accident or in connection with a crisis of a protracted nature and, on the other, financing of the crisis management that is to improve the ability to deal with crises while they are ongoing.</p>
<p>A fundamental change of cost liability for damage occurring in connection with major accidents abroad is not warranted. It should continue to be the individual who through privately financed insurance bears the main responsibility for his/her own protection and safety. Thus, travel agencies and insurance companies are the actors who must in the first instance take responsibility for emergency efforts covering care, medical care, transportation home, etc. in connection with minor accidents. The role of the public sector is in the event of major accidents and crises to step in</p>
<p>to strengthen society’s total resources to cope with the situation. The division of costs between the public and private sectors in connection with such efforts is difficult to specify in advance by means of a formula and should be subject to discussions between the parties concerned in the same way as was the case after the tsunami.</p>
<p>Whatever the outcome of such discussions, it may be established that the average annual costs for the state will be limited. Special arrangements to cover these costs should scarcely be needed – if the original intentions behind the budgeting margin are respected and reasonable scope reserved under the expenditure ceiling in the budget, this should be fully sufficient.</p>
<p>The cost of maintaining a crisis management unit of the type described above will depend on the level of ambition chosen. An alternative based on a staff of 30 may be estimated to correspond to SEK 50 million a year. To this should be added costs associated with external contracts, which are difficult to estimate. Financing will of course be effected by reconsidering priorities in the policy area Contingency measures against accidents and severe emergencies under expenditure area 6 in the budget. In the coming fiscal years, the appropriation Emergency preparedness in this policy area will be at a level of around SEK 1.8 billion and there should be no difficulty in financing the proposed crisis management through reconsideration of priorities within this appropriation.</p>
<p>Restored confidence</p>
<p>Many who were hit by the tsunami have described the deep disappointment they felt. For exposed Swedish citizens in shock – sometimes separated from their families – meeting a weak Swedish mission in the country of the disaster was a bitter and harrowing experience. The embassy was not the safe place they expected nor did the administration in Stockholm live up to their expectations.</p>
<p>And many officials feel strongly that they did not cope. Others have difficulty in accepting the criticism. They may perceive it to be based on hindsight, wrong or out of proportion. However, development presupposes the ability to reappraise.</p>
<p>The Commission has scrutinised Sweden´s public institutions and the work of leading decision-makers with regard to preparation, vigilance and initial response. Regarding the question</p>
<p>of responsibility, the report raises some points concerning leading politicians and officials. This is necessary in order to restore confidence between citizens and those in power and secure it in the long term, and also in order to enhance our ability to handle crises.</p>
<p>The Commission has submitted a contribution to the development of emergency preparedness. The best way of showing respect for those afflicted is to create an emergency preparedness based on responsibility and the ability to take action.</p>
