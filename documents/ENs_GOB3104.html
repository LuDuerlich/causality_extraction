<p>Non-profit housing in the 21st Century – decision rules for the sale of municipal housing</p>
<p>Initial report of the Government Committee of Inquiry on NonProfit Housing and Social Aspects of Housing Policy</p>
<p>According to its terms of reference the Committee is to assess the need for new legislation for non-profit housing companies and to study certain social issues in housing policy. In this initial report the Committee proposes a special Act on municipal decision rules for the transfer of shares or participations in a municipal housing company and the transfer of housing properties owned by a municipality or by a municipal housing company.</p>
<p>In its further work the Committee will present deliberations and, where appropriate, proposals in the following areas:</p>
<p>Special legislation for municipal housing companies and, in a next step, a single body of legislation for all non-profit housing companies</p>
<p>Financial and other conditions for the transfer of municipal housing stock or municipal housing companies to private non-profit actors</p>
<p>Regulations for the possible pre-emption of municipal housing stock</p>
<p>The municipality’s responsibility for housing policy, including the forms for municipal planning of housing provision</p>
<p>The municipality’s responsibility for social issues in housing policy and the individual’s right to housing</p>
<p>Housing exchange and housing allocation, including the need for a new Act on municipal housing allocation rights</p>
<p>Tax regulations for self-management.</p>
<p>A follow-up of planned and completed sales of municipal housing shows that several municipalities have sold their housing companies during the 1990s and that an increasing number of municipalities have sold or are planning to sell a significant part of their housing stock.</p>
<p>The international study carried out by the Committee shows that several other countries have rules on national government approval of plans to sell non-profit housing. Residents are often given a voice in the consideration of these plans. The surplus from sales remains in the housing sector.</p>
<p>The Committee considers that in the future municipal housing companies should continue to be one of the municipality’s most important instruments in fulfilling its responsibility for housing policy and for social issues in housing policy. It is therefore important that there is a sufficient supply of cost price rented housing that is attractive to all groups in the community. In addition, the use-value rent system assigns these companies a special role in the system for setting rents.</p>
<p>In general, sales of municipal housing companies and of municipal housing are irrevocable. Large sales have impacts on the finances, economic development and general policy both in the municipality and neighbouring municipalities and also at national level. In view of this, there is a risk that future generations and future political majorities will be bound by sales decisions that may with hindsight turn out to have been precipitate.</p>
<p>The Committee therefore takes the view that special decision rules should be introduced for sales of municipal housing. The Committee does not consider that a review by national government of municipal sales decisions is appropriate. Decisions on these sales should instead be taken entirely within the democratic process in the municipalities. The rules for municipal decisions should, however, promote housing policy solutions that attract broad support across the political spectrum.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the municipal council shall decide on the following transfers:</p>
<p>the municipality’s or a municipal company’s transfer of shares or participations in a municipal housing company, if the municipality loses its deciding influence on the company the municipality’s or a municipal company’s transfer of shares or participations in a municipal company, which in turn has the deciding influence on a municipal housing company, if the municipality loses its deciding influence on the housing company</p>
<p>the municipality’s or a municipal housing company’s transfer of more than 10 per cent – but not more than 1000 dwellings</p>
<p>– of the total stock of dwellings owned by the municipality and its municipal housing companies at a specified point in time.</p>
<p>The decision of the municipal council shall be approved by a qualified majority consisting of two thirds of the votes cast. If the municipal council has not decided on a transfer, then the transfer is invalid.</p>
<p>In addition to transfers the proposed rules also cover other measures that result in the municipality losing its deciding influence on the housing company or to a transfer of the ownership of housing properties to other physical or legal persons. The municipal council shall therefore take certain</p>
<p>decisions on liquidation, fusion or share dividends that affect municipal housing companies or municipal housing.</p>
<p>These special decision rules should not apply to the disposal of shares, participations or housing properties that are acquired by the municipality or another municipal housing company in the municipality.</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances the Government or the authority designated by the Government may decide on exemptions from the proposed regulations.</p>
<p>If the municipality no longer has a deciding influence on a housing company ceases, the company’s status as a non-profit company shall be revoked.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the new regulations come into force on 1 July 2001 and replace the present sanction legislation, which expires the end of June 2001, i.e. the Act (SFS 1999:608) on temporary reduction of general government grant in the event of the sale of shares or participations in or dividends from municipal housing companies, etc.</p>
<p>The Committee has also considered two other forms for decisions in municipal councils in addition to the proposed twothirds majority presented here. These other alternatives are that transfers shall be approved by either  two identical decisions of the municipal council separated by an election or  a combination consisting of either a two-thirds majority or, if only a simple majority is achieved in the municipal council, by two identical decisions separated by an election. The Committee takes the view that a decision rule based on a two-thirds majority best meets the aim of supporting municipalities in their efforts to find broad and therefore stable majorities for the running of housing policy. The Committee ranks the combination alternative as the second-best alternative. The alternative only stipulating two identical decisions of the municipal council separated by an election has been ruled out by the Committee, as this alternative makes it impossible to reach decisions without a delay.</p>
<p>The Committee’s assessment is that this proposal will increase the importance of long-term planning of municipal activities. In some municipalities the proposal will prevent the completion of planned sales of municipal housing stock. In these municipalities the proposal will lead to a higher proportion of non-profit housing and, in some cases, also to a higher proportion of rented housing and a smaller proportion of co-operative housing than if the proposal is not implemented. In many municipalities the proposal will not have any actual effects, since there is no political conflict in these municipalities about selling large parts of the municipal housing stock. The decision rules are not an obstacle to effective property management or to broader ownership of the municipal housing company.</p>
<p>The main aim of the Committee’s proposal is to ensure that the municipalities retain a sufficiently large stock of municipal non-profit housing so that a forward-looking housing policy can be put in place that builds on decisions based on solutions attracting support across the political spectrum.</p>
