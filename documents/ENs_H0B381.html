<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>This is the final report on our inquiry into central government regional administration. We begin with an account of the problems we noted at regional level and our assessment of the need for reform. We then describe our proposed solutions in three areas: overall regional administration and its geography, responsibility for regional development, and the activities of county administrative boards.</p>
<h2>What problems does central government currently have at regional level? Lack of an integrated, coordinated approach</h2>
<p>Central government administration in different policy areas has developed based on different starting points and approaches. This has led to increased sectorisation, whereby each government agency has largely been optimised based on the conditions within its own activities. This means that central government regional administration is sprawling, with agencies that are organised in different ways and widely varying regional divisions. Centralisation has increased due to the introduction of singular authorities, which has also weakened the overall position of central government at regional level. This in turn has had a negative impact on the ability of central government to act clearly and uniformly vis-à-vis citizens, businesses and municipalities at regional level. The present model of responsibility for regional development, with three different systems, has exacerbated the lack of clarity at regional level.</p>
<h2>Lack of an overall operational objective and of confidence in the county administrative boards</h2>
<p>The mandate of the county administrative boards is, and should be, broad. The problem as we have seen it is that the overall operational objective of the county administrative boards has not been formulated sufficiently clearly. This has meant that many changes to their activities have been made on the margins without anyone asking what the starting point for the county administrative boards’ activities should be. What is the purpose of these government agencies?</p>
<p>The lack of an overall operational objective has led to a divided mandate that the agencies currently have difficulty fulfilling.</p>
<p>Alongside the fact that the Government has not formulated any solid operational objective, we have also found indications in the current regulation and governance of the county administrative boards’ activities that the Government does not have complete confidence in its own agencies. Examples of this include the current funding model, whereby a large proportion of the county administrative boards’ funds come via national agencies, and the fact that national agencies can appeal against county administrative board decisions. This could be interpreted as the Government having greater confidence in the national agencies than in the county administrative boards. The funding model makes it difficult for the county administrative boards to effectively plan and carry out their activities. The national agencies’ right of appeal makes it more difficult for the county administrative boards to work cross-sectorally and to coordinate different public interests based on an integrated central government approach.</p>
<h2>Insufficient volume of activities spread over too many county administrative boards</h2>
<p>Their very broad mandate means that many country administrative boards today have an insufficient volume of activities within a large number of areas. Several areas of activity are so small that they occupy substantially less than a yearly equivalent of one person at individual country administrative boards. Having a small number of cases counteracts effective and legally secure examination. Having restricted scope also leads to difficulties maintaining levels of expertise. The fact that there are currently 21 county administrative boards leads to difficulties achieving uniformity in processing of business, supervision, etc. In the course of the inquiry we have seen that the variations between county administrative boards are sometimes considerable, which has a negative impact on predictability and equal treatment in the application of the law. Opportunities for streamlining are also negatively affected by the present structure, in which there is limited possibility to redistribute tasks and coordinate overarching activities between county administrative boards.</p>
<h2>Structural reform needed – now</h2>
<p>In our view, central government must fundamentally reform its activities at regional level, even if it is not of current interest to merge any county councils. A reform is absolutely necessary for the county administrative boards, which are the foundation of the central government regional administration. The quality, effectiveness and efficiency of current county administrative board activities are increasingly being called into question. If nothing is done to break this trend, it will not be possible for the county administrative boards to continue.</p>
<p>For the administration overall, it is a matter of maintaining confidence in central government at regional level. Central government regional administration must be coordinated, maintain a high level of expertise and carry out its tasks effectively and efficiently.</p>
<h2>Seven central government regional areas</h2>
<p>We consider that the activities of some central government agencies are so strongly connected that the efficiency of the overall central government administration can be increased by them sharing geographical groupings. We have looked at this issue for all of the central government agencies that are organised regionally, and in our assessment, the following agencies should have the same regional boundaries: the Swedish Transport Administration, the Swedish mapping, cadastral and land registration authority, the Swedish Police, the Swedish Security Service, the Swedish Work Environment Authority, the Swedish Schools Inspectorate and the new inspectorate for health and social care.</p>
<p>The geographical boundaries for the structural fund programmes should also follow the boundary divisions shown on the map below. The regional organisation of the Swedish Armed Forces and the Swedish National Electrical Safety Board should be designed so that the proposed boundaries are not broken.</p>
<p>In our assessment, there are significant gains to be made from having a common geographical structure for the central government regional administration. The organisational adjustments resulting from our proposal would be small for most of the agencies concerned.</p>
<h2>Responsibility for regional development – a task for the county councils</h2>
<p>The current model of three different organisations with responsibility for regional development causes confusion. We therefore propose that the possibility to form local government cooperative bodies should cease on 31 December 2013. All local government cooperative bodies should be dismantled by 31 December 2018.</p>
<p>We propose that the county councils in all of the counties concerned should be given the opportunity to take over responsibility for regional development through an application procedure, if there is support for this among the municipalities in the county. In our view, it is an advantage if the change in the division of responsibilities takes place in connection with an election. This means that the responsibility for regional development should be transferred to the county councils no earlier than 1 January 2015.</p>
<p>In any counties where there is a lack of political support for the county council taking responsibility for regional development issues, central government, through the county administrative board, should take over responsibility for them from 1 January 2019.</p>
<h2>New, robust county administrative boards Tasks for an integrated central government approach</h2>
<p>The main difference between county administrative boards and other agencies is that they are central government agencies at regional level that take decisions encompassing several areas of society. This makes the county administrative boards unique, and helps ensure that central government acts more uniformly at regional level and bridges different sectoral perspectives. To strengthen the county administrative boards in this role, we propose that the possibility for the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and other central government agencies to appeal against certain county administrative board decisions be removed.</p>
<p>We have examined the county administrative boards’ current and possible future tasks in light of a number of principles, and have concluded that the agencies should have tasks in the following areas of activity:  Community planning and cultural environment  Civil contingencies  Nature conservation and environmental protection  Agriculture, forestry and rural affairs  Other activities  Regional  follow-up and evaluation</p>
<p>In our review we found that there are links between the work of the Swedish Forest Agency and the county administrative boards in several areas. Both agencies also have forest owners as a target group. In order to achieve greater clarity and efficiency, we propose that regional activities of the Swedish Forest Agency be moved to the county administrative boards.</p>
<p>We also propose that a number of activities – for which the county administrative boards are currently responsible but that, in our view, lack a regional dimension – be moved to national agencies. Examples include the payment of government wage guarantees, certain citizennship issues and lottery issues.</p>
<p>The future tasks do not involve any substantial change compared with the current tasks. However, an analysis has been carried out of the tasks that should set the tone within the county administrative boards, namely community planning, civil contingencies and regional follow-up and evaluation. In our assessment, it is not possible for any other central government agency to carry out the tasks in these areas of activity. This is because, alongside the need for geographical proximity, they extend over several sectors of society and need to be tackled using an integrated central government approach. This fundamental task provides an operational objective for the county administrative boards and means that they take on a specialist function with respect to overall central government assessments and coordination between different sectors and stakeholders at regional level.</p>
<h2>New and more practical geographical boundaries with eleven county administrative boards</h2>
<p>We propose that the new county administrative boards be larger and considerably fewer in number. In our view, this will completely transform the county administrative boards’ ability to conduct efficient activities with a high level of legal certainty and expertise. At the same time, central government will be better able to govern activities.</p>
<p>The table below shows our proposal for the boundaries and seats of the eleven future county administrative boards.</p>
<h2>More efficient activities via changes in governance, scale and funding</h2>
<p>We consider it important that the county administrative boards become more alike in certain relevant respects. This will help realise the potential noted by the inquiry for streamlining and development of activities. We also consider that greater comparability will improve the possibility to follow up and govern activities. We therefore propose that responsibility for leading and coordinating the administration of the county administrative boards and for coordinating follow-up and operational development should be divided between the three largest county administrative boards.</p>
<p>We can observe that the scale of the county administrative boards’ activities has, like the tasks, only been examined peripherally. No overall assessment has been made of the existing resources in relation to the tasks. Our review shows that a smaller number of county administrative boards offers opportunities for streamlining. We estimate that this could save just under SEK 400 million. At the same time, our review of each area of activity has exposed shortcomings that, in certain cases, we consider stem from a lack of resources. This is particularly true of community planning, civil contingencies and nature conservation and environmental protection.</p>
<p>We propose that the major part of the funds freed up by merging county administrative boards be fed back into activities, to address the shortcomings we have noted and ensure that tasks in the relevant areas of activity can be carried out in a legally secure, effective and efficient manner. The funds should also enable the county administrative boards to play a more active role in community planning.</p>
<p>The current system, whereby the county administrative boards receive a large part of their funding via national agencies, creates major problems for both central government governance and follow-up of the county administrative boards, and for the county administrative boards’ internal planning and use of resources. We therefore propose that some of these funds go direct to the county administrative boards to be allocated as they see fit.</p>
<h2>Central government administration and geographical boundaries</h2>
<p> Central government regional agencies that need to collaborate should have the same geographical boundaries.  The Swedish Transport Administration, the Swedish mapping, cadastral and land registration authority, the Swedish Police, the Swedish Security Service, the Swedish Work Environment Authority, the Swedish Schools Inspectorate and the new inspectorate for health and social care should follow the proposal for central government geographical boundaries.  For the next programme period, the geographical boundaries of the structural fund areas should correspond to these boundaries. The agency structure in this area should also be reviewed ahead of the new programme period.  Small adjustments should be made to the regional boundaries of the Swedish Armed Forces and Swedish National Electrical Safety Board.  The new government regional boundaries should apply from 1 January 2015.  The Swedish Public Employment Service should have clear functions within its organisation for regional collaboration and a regional division of activities that largely corresponds to the county administrative boards’ future geographical areas of responsibility.  Regional activities currently carried out by the Swedish Forest Agency should be moved to the county administrative boards.  The possibility for the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and other central government agencies to appeal against county administrative board decisions under the Swedish Environmental Code and associated ordinances should be abolished.</p>
<h2>Responsibility for regional development</h2>
<p> Responsibility for regional development should, as a rule, be a task for the county councils.  The local government cooperative bodies should be abolished. In cases where the county council does not take over responsibility, the county administrative board should be responsible for these issues.  The county councils that take on this responsibility should receive around 95 per cent of the current central government funds. The remainder should go to the relevant county administrative board.</p>
<h2>The new county administrative boards</h2>
<p> The fundamental task of the county administrative boards should be activities that, alongside the need for geographical proximity, extend over several sectors of society and need to be dealt with using an integrated central government approach.</p>
<p> In order to clarify and refine the tasks of the county administrative boards, it is proposed that a number of minor areas of activity be moved to national agencies.</p>
<p> The term ‘water authority’ should be abolished.</p>
<p> The county administrative boards’ tasks with respect to coordinating other central government agencies’ regional growth initiatives should cease.</p>
<p> There should be eleven county administrative boards, each covering one or more counties. A proposal is presented for the geographical boundaries and seats of the county administrative boards.</p>
<p> The county administrative boards should all have a similar overall organisational structure. Every county administrative board should have a business council and a council on municipal issues.</p>
<p> Every county administrative board should use the administrative services available through the National Government Service Centre. Responsibility for leading and coordinating administration and for coordinating  follow-up and operational development should be divided between the three largest county administrative boards.</p>
<p> When recruiting County Governors and Deputy County Governors, overall management skills should be taken into account and the timing of appointments coordinated.</p>
<p> The county administrative boards should examine, in a uniform manner, whether practical tasks would be carried out more efficiently if services were procured externally.</p>
<p> The major part of the funds freed up by reducing the number of county administrative boards should be used to fund the overall need for additional resources in operational activities.</p>
<p> A new funding model for the county administrative boards will be introduced.</p>
<p> An organising committee should be appointed to set up the new county administrative boards.</p>
<p> The new central government structure – in both geographical and organisational terms – should enter into force on 1 January 2015.</p>
