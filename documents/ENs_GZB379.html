<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Delegation for Occupational Health Services has conducted activities aimed at improving knowledge and quality in occupational health services. This was accomplished through experience exchanges, organised by the Delegation, between higher education institutions, the social partners, public authorities and the occupational health services industry. In addition, infrastructure is now in place for higher education and research in and about occupational health services. The occupational health services area is set up as a new research domain, with its own professorships. Master’s programmes (both one-year and two-year) focusing on work environments, health and occupational health services have been launched at several universities. Skills development schemes have been carried out for the industry, and tools have been developed to help in their own renewal efforts. However, not enough time has elapsed to evaluate the effects of these measures, but the Delegation considers that they provide good opportunities for improving knowledge and quality in occupational health services regarding both industry knowledge and activities. It is nonetheless important to follow and evaluate the quality and utilisation of occupational health services in light of the above mentioned measures.</p>
<p>The newly launched university programmes form an extensive structure, and a coordinating actor is necessary to ensure investments in them. The social partners also need a platform to follow future quality development in occupational health services. In its reasoning concerning this, the Delegation highlights various alternatives that could play a role in this context.</p>
<p>The development of the planned pilot project with residency training in occupational and environmental medicine did not receive the expected support on the part of occupational health services that the preparatory work had indicated. The project has been taken over by the Occupational and Environmental Medicine Clinic in</p>
<p>Lund to safeguard the experiences and results acquired so far. It is the Delegation’s assessment that in principle, it should be possible to continue building on the model developed in the pilot project provided that the occupational health services are interested in this specialist training and that the division of responsibility between the state, county councils and occupational health service is clarified, most suitably through further examination.</p>
