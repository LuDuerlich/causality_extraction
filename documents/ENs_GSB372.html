<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Swedish Government decided on 11 December 2003 to appoint an inquiry to consider and propose a suitable way of organising official seed testing in Sweden. The fundamental task of the inquiry is to consider which elements of seed testing must or should remain a matter for the state and which can be managed by other actors, e.g. market enterprises. The inquiry is to take into account the regulatory systems that are of importance for this activity and analyse developments in the seed market.</p>
<p>Under EU regulations, seed may not be marketed before it has received official certification. Certification is a final decision on approval of a specific seed lot. The basis for the decision is provided by the results of a chain of several different tests. The most important tests are field inspections of seed-producing crops, test cultivation of seed, seed sampling and laboratory analysis of seed samples. In some cases, these tests are services that can be offered on a market.</p>
<h2>Who is entitled to conduct tests?</h2>
<p>Under EU regulations, official measures in the area of seed testing may be carried out by state bodies but also by non-state actors and natural persons. The latter must, however, in the view of the inquiry, occupy an independent position vis-à-vis seed companies.</p>
<p>In recent years a pilot scheme has been conducted in the EU, allowing seed testing run by seed companies. It is now proposed to make this system permanent. In the self-testing system, field inspections, sampling and laboratory analysis of seed are carried out by the seed companies themselves or by companies connected with the seed industry. EU regulations permit self-testing for all seed-borne plant types, but not for potatoes. In Sweden, however, self-testing is only permitted for cereal seed of the lowest generation (normally category C or C2). Testing measures must be subject to official supervision. This means that a number of official check samples stipulated by the EU must be made of testing measures carried out in the self-testing system. Official measures, for which self-testing is not permitted, include test cultivation, certification, official supervision (of self-testing measures) and testing measures for potatoes.</p>
<h2>Who performs the tests?</h2>
<p>The measures required in connection with certification, along with certain closely related measures associated with the certification system, are now dealt with by a number of state agencies, but also by non-state actors approved by the Swedish Board of Agriculture.</p>
<p>The Swedish Board of Agriculture has overall responsibility for the implementation of agricultural policy. The Board issues regulations specifying the requirements to be met by seed production and seed in Sweden, on the basis of EU rules, and supervises compliance with the regulations. The Board also participates in international EU work on the design of the regulatory systems.</p>
<p>The Swedish Seed Testing and Certification Institute (SUK) is a government agency and the official Swedish certification body for seed. SUK carries out all the measures required to enable a decision on certification to be delivered. SUK conducts most of its activities in Svalöv, Skåne, in premises and on land (for test cultivation, etc.) leased from Svalöf Weibull AB. SUK participates in international work within ISTA and the OECD. The main purpose of its work with ISTA is to develop and refine sampling and analysis methods for seed-borne plant types.</p>
<p>The National Plant Variety Board (SVN) is a government agency organised as a committee of permanent experts, which is responsible for decisions on the inclusion of new varieties in the Swedish variety list and decisions on plant variety rights. It conducts its activities in Solna, near Stockholm. For a new variety to be approved, the sampling procedure must show it to be distinct, uniform and stable and to have value for cultivation and use. The Board does not have resources of its own for such testing. The testing is done by SUK on commission from SVN.</p>
<p>Under a special decision by the Swedish Board of Agriculture, official certification of seed for certain categories of seed-borne plant types may also be conducted by Frökontrollen Mellansverige AB (FMAB), which is an independent non-state company, owned by Örebro County Agricultural Society.</p>
<p>Testing measures in the self-testing system can be carried out by seed companies independently. In practice, much of this work is done by AnalyCen Nordic AB, an analysis company owned by the Swedish Farmers’ Supply and Crop Marketing Association.</p>
<h2>Overall assessment</h2>
<p>What makes the regulations concerning sale of seed special is that producers are not allowed independent responsibility for quality control of their products, except in areas covered by the selftesting system. In many other markets, including markets for products that can be hazardous to life and health, producers have independent responsibility for quality control and mark their products with the CE label, for example. In all essentials, this label has the same function and significance as a seed certificate. This is the case for electrical products and various types of machinery, such as lathes, power saws and other motorised tools. Previously there was mandatory prior testing by the state in other areas too, such as electrical materials, with SEMKO issuing S labels for products that had been tested and found to comply with existing requirements.</p>
<p>The original reasons for official seed controls were to ensure good harvests at a time when crop failure could lead to famine and to eliminate rogue traders from the industry. It has not been possible to establish the precise motives now underlying the regulations. In light of the development of agriculture and associated industries in terms of their technology, knowledge and organisation, and taking into account the significance of modern</p>
<p>information systems, increasing international trade and cooperation on regulations, standards and methods, the inquiry is of the opinion that the institution of seed control in its present form and scope is out of date. This applies in the first instance to Community requirements concerning state or independent monitoring of compliance with detailed quality requirements for seed (germination capacity, etc.), particularly where these are of no direct relevance to plant protection. One important conclusion is that Sweden has very limited scope to change the division of responsibilities between the state and companies in the seed market. Against this backdrop, international work aimed at liberalising the international rules is a measure of strategic importance for enabling the involvement of the state in seed testing to diminish.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the inquiry, the way state involvement is organised – with three different agencies conducting closely related and partially overlapping activities – is outdated and not particularly appropriate. Much has happened that affects the work of these agencies. EU membership has brought new demands for international work. New issues, such as issues relating to genetically modified organisms, make demanding requirements in terms of new expertise. It is more difficult to maintain an up-to- date and high level of know-how and skills at small agencies than at larger agencies. It is also easier for large agencies to meet changes in the services demanded of it, by moving resources between different areas of activity.</p>
<p>On closer analysis, two domains are apparent in the system of regulations. The first consists of tasks that must, or, in view of Swedish conditions, must in practice be managed by the state. These include test cultivation, official supervision by means of check samples and all testing of seed potatoes. The second, which we may term the free domain, in principle encompasses the testing measures that can be undertaken by seed companies, e.g. sampling, voluntary analyses and certification analyses within the self-testing system. From a commercial perspective, the most important service is the seed analysis done in seed laboratories.</p>
<p>There are no formal obstacles to a purely market solution for testing measures in the free domain. This can easily be accomplished by quite simply prohibiting the state from being an actor in this domain. This would lead to as great a streamlining of state activities as is formally possible for the time being.</p>
<p>A measure of this kind would in all likelihood lead to a company in the sphere of the Swedish Farmers’ Supply and Crop Marketing Association obtaining substantial power over two markets, the seed market and the analysis market, which, moreover, are interdependent. An additional factor is that a certain volume of cases for analysis is needed in order to maintain know-how and skills at the state laboratory, which must continue to be the official reference laboratory. Representatives of the small seed companies have stated with a fair degree of unanimity that in general, selftesting is too expensive and too much of an administrative burden for them and that the state seed control system in its present form and scope serves to guarantee that small companies also have access to analysis services on reasonable terms.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, the inquiry considers that the state should continue to be an actor in the free part of the market for seed analysis. This is not an optimal solution from the point of view of competition. It should therefore be combined with certain measures that may improve conditions for competition.</p>
<p>One general point of departure is that state activities must be conducted bearing in mind the mechanisms that steer competition. Official responsibilities in the vegetables area should be transferred to the Swedish Board of Agriculture. SUK and SVN should be closed down. The information systems for seed testing should be opened up to external actors and designed so as not to produce network effects that may be detrimental to competition. The Swedish provisions place greater limitations on companies’ opportunities to engage in self-testing than is required by EU rules. Such obstacles to the growth of the analysis market should be eliminated. Self-testing should therefore be applied as far as permitted by EU rules. The principles for reporting by the state of its activities as a public body and its contract services in the seed area should be reviewed. Developments in the seed market and elsewhere should be evaluated after some time. In combination, the measures should lead to better conditions for competition and make it possible to streamline state seed testing responsibilities as other actors enter the market.</p>
