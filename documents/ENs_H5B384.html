<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>What is the inquiry about?</h2>
<p>Individuals seeking asylum in Sweden whose application is rejected are, as a general rule, also issued with a decision requiring them to return to their country of citizenship or to a country in which they have previously resided. However, there may be circumstances preventing the decision from being enforced. In certain cases, such circumstances may justify the applicants being granted a residence permit in Sweden.</p>
<p>This inquiry deals with two separate issues: – residence permits on the basis of practical impediments to enforcing  refusal-of-entry or expulsion orders, and – residence permits as a result of a  refusal-of-entry or expulsion order having expired (becoming statute-barred), normally after four years.</p>
<p>Under the Aliens Act, practical impediments to enforcement must be considered by the authorities and courts in decisions concerning refusal-of-entry or expulsion (see, for example, Chapter 8, Section 7 of the Aliens Act). The Swedish Migration Agency must consider these impediments even if they emerge after  a removal order has become final and non-appealable if there is reason to assume that the intended country of return will not accept the person (see Chapter 12, Section 18, first paragraph, point 2 of the Aliens Act). A refusal-ofentry or expulsion order becomes statute-barred, i.e. expires, normally four years after the decision became final and non-appealable (see Chapter 12, Section 22, first paragraph). If a new application is filed, a residence permit may subsequently be granted provided that the statutory limitation period has expired without the removal order being enforced due to reasons beyond the individual’s control. If a residence permit is not  granted as a result of statutory limitation, all the grounds cited in the residence permit application are to be re-examined.</p>
<p>As set out above, existing legislation provides scope for granting residence permits on the basis of practical impediments to enforcement or statutory limitation. Despite this, a number of people remain in Sweden for long periods of time after receiving a refusalof-entry or expulsion order without being granted a residence permit. Some of these people are stranded in a legal no-man’s-land. They are trapped in a ‘Catch 22’ situation that is virtually impossible to find a way out of. This problem is the starting point of this Inquiry, whose aims include examining the problems associated with practical impediments to enforcement beyond the control of the individual and proposing solutions to prevent people from ending up or remaining in this situation.</p>
<h2>What was the Inquiry Chair’s remit?</h2>
<p>The Inquiry Chair’s remit was to:</p>
<p>• examine the application of the law regarding the possibility for the Swedish Migration Agency and the courts to consider practical impediments to enforcement, both during the asylum process and after a  refusal-of-entry or expulsion decision has been taken but has been unenforceable;</p>
<p>• study the effects of the Migration Court of Appeal’s decision MIG 2009:13 regarding the possibility of granting a residence permit after a  refusal-of-entry or expulsion order becomes statutebarred; and</p>
<p>• present relevant proposals that aim to prevent people who have applied for asylum from ending up or remaining in a situation where their  refusal-of-entry or expulsion order cannot be enforced for practical reasons beyond their control.</p>
<h2>What does practical impediments to enforcement “beyond the control of the individual” mean?</h2>
<p>A key question for the Inquiry was the implication of a “removal order being unenforceable due to reasons beyond the control of the individual” (practical impediments to enforcement), reasons that under the Aliens Act can constitute the basis for granting a residence permit in Sweden. Practical impediments to enforcement means that a person who has received a refusal-of-entry or expulsion order, or who may receive one, cannot travel to the intended country of return. The reasons for this vary. It may be practicably impossible to travel there. The country may be unwilling to accept the person. It may be difficult for the individual or the authorities to provide proof of citizenship or the right to stay in the country in question.</p>
<p>The underlying reasons that certain individuals are not accepted by the intended country of return or are unable to travel there vary depending on the situation in different countries and international circumstances at different points in time. An obvious example of a practicably impossible trip is that of Palestinians who cannot travel to Gaza because the border crossing between Gaza and Egypt is closed and the possibility of transit through Egypt is very limited. This means that people from Gaza are now being granted a temporary residence permit on the basis of practical impediments to enforcement.</p>
<p>One group that has encountered difficulties regarding travel to the intended country of return are stateless Bidoons from Kuwait, because Kuwait does not recognise them as citizens. Whether or not the people in question have identification documents and proof of having lived in Kuwait for extended periods, they are not granted an entry permit. Moreover, the State of Kuwait is not obliged by international law to grant them entry because they are not considered citizens. Lack of citizenship, i.e. statelessness, is an important factor in practical impediments to enforcement. Similarly, a person does not have the right to enter a country if they are not a citizen of that country, unless they are seeking protection from war or other human rights violations under the right of asylum.</p>
<p>In addition to statelessness, the interests of the country of return or the possibility of travel for the individual, practical impediments to enforcement may also relate to the strength of the institutions in the relevant country of return. Practical impediments in the return process may also arise, for example, if the embassies are understaffed. This may mean that questions from the individual or the authorities concerning identification documents go unanswered, or that booking an interview with the embassy takes an unreasonably long time or may not even always be probable. It may also be the case that issuance of travel documents is conditional on the individual having original identification documents, and the individual has no such documents. In some individual cases, the problem may be that the validity of travel documents issued is so short or that their geographical validity is limited, which means that travel is not possible.</p>
<p>The Swedish authorities’ guidance to the individual in an enforcement case and whether this is followed, and the availability of relevant country information are also important factors that will affect whether practical barriers to enforcement are deemed to exist in individual cases.</p>
<h2>What does the research say and how are practical impediments to enforcement dealt with in other countries?</h2>
<p>In international research, the term ‘legally stranded migrants’ is used to denote the phenomenon that people seeking protection but not deemed to be in need of protection are caught in a situation where they receive repeated unenforceable removal orders. ‘Stranded migrants’ is an umbrella term used in discussions on circular irregular migration, human smuggling, visa regulations and the situation of migrants in need of consular assistance. Researcher Stefanie Grant has proposed the following definition of ‘legally stranded’:</p>
<p>In practice, migrants become legally stranded when they are caught between removal from the State in which they are physically present, inability to return to their State of nationality or former residence, and refusal by any other State to grant entry. (Grant 2007, p. 30)</p>
<p>In earlier studies of how different European countries deal with legally stranded migrants, we have identified a general difficulty in distinguishing which previous asylum seekers cannot return, regardless of their own intentions. Despite this, when new policies are developed to deal with practical impediments to enforcement, one of the main focal points is the individual’s role and responsibility in the enforcement process. In recent years, European countries have tried to increase the incentives for asylum seekers deemed not to be in need of protection to return of their own accord. At the same time, the legal categories, such as ‘tolerated status’, ‘temporary right to remain’ and ‘deferred enforcement’, that states have adopted are a more or less explicit recognition that practical impediments to enforcement cannot be eliminated. However, few people are granted a residence permit on the basis of the existence of such impediments.</p>
<p>We have found no support in the international overview that repeated examinations of temporary permits result in more people actually travelling to the intended country of return. Nor can we draw any general conclusions based on previous studies or regulations in other countries regarding effective methods to bring about return. However, limiting  access to rights after an application has been rejected, particularly with regard to housing, may increase the chance of authorities losing contact with the people in question. Several actors in Sweden, including the Swedish Police Authority, think that this might be the consequence of an amendment to the Reception of Asylum Seekers and Others Act (1994:137) that entered into force on 1 July 2016. In the longer term, this can make the process of return more difficult. This amendment is related to our inquiry, as the situation of some persons whose removal order is unenforceable has been considerably worsened because of it. However, this inquiry has not been tasked with examining the consequences of this amendment.</p>
<p>All in all, our international overview shows that the situation of having received a removal order and at the same time being ‘nonreturnable’ is a legal contradiction that appears to be a dilemma for states and undoubtedly also for the people who become legally stranded.</p>
<h2>What are the Inquiry’s proposals and why are they presented? Proposal 1: The Aliens Act should clearly state that practical impediments to enforcement must be considered in the initial case and that a residence permit may be granted on this basis.</h2>
<p>We propose that practical impediments to enforcement be specifically stated in the provisions on consideration of impediments to enforcement in order to clarify the types of impediments that must be considered in an initial case. In the provision on residence permits on the basis of exceptionally or particularly distressing circumstances (Chapter 5, Section 6 of the Aliens Act), we propose that the legislator state that such circumstances must  always be deemed to exist in the presence of a lasting practical impediment in the case. We also propose training and skills enhancement activities for Swedish Migration Agency officers and court lawyers dealing with migration law.</p>
<p>The background to this proposal is that the possibility of granting a residence permit on the basis of practical impediments to enforcement is unclear in the current Aliens Act. Our inquiry has identified difficulties for legal practitioners to reconcile the obligation to consider practical impediments to enforcement in the initial case with the Migration Court of Appeal’s guidance on the matter. The high standard of proof that is applied means that the individual, under current practice, bears the responsibility of obtaining acceptable evidence even in situations of great difficulty. This leads to both limited assessments of practical impediments to enforcement in the initial case and very limited possibilities of being granted a residence permit on this basis. Our assessment is that no conditions currently exist to ensure that refusal-of-entry or expulsion decisions are not taken when it is already clear before a decision that a removal order will be unenforceable.</p>
<p>Proposal 2: The concept of practical impediments to enforcement  should be introduced in the provision that allows the Swedish Migration Agency to grant a residence permit following a final and non-appealable removal order.</p>
<p>We propose that the concept of  practical impediments to enforcement be introduced into the provision in the Aliens Act on impediments to enforcement following a final and  non-appealable  removal order (Chapter 12, Section 18, first paragraph, point 2 of the Aliens Act). This would make clear that new circumstances giving reason to assume that such impediments exist can be the basis for a residence permit. The meaning of practical impediments to enforcement may go beyond there being reason to assume that the intended country of return is not willing to accept the person (the current wording). As mentioned above, practical impediments to enforcement may also include the fact that it is not possible to travel to the country. The reasons for this vary. It is very difficult today for some individuals to provide evidence of the country of return’s unwillingness. Quality assurance assessments should be conducted at the Swedish Migration Agency to examine the impact of internal guidelines on, among other things, its responsibility for applying the provision and practical impediments to enforcement following a final and  non-appealable  decision. If necessary, a quality assurance assessment should be followed by skills enhancement activities. We also propose further training and skills enhancement activities for Swedish Migration Agency officers. When appropriate, external trainers should be involved in these activities.</p>
<p>The background to this proposal is that the provision in the Aliens Act allowing a residence permit to be granted on the basis of practical impediments to enforcement coming to light is, in our assessment, partially misleading. By expressly stating that practical impediments to enforcement have the effect that a residence permit may be granted (instead of the current wording that “the intended country of return will not be willing to accept ...”), the application of the provision will be broadened to include all the practical difficulties that may constitute an impediment to enforcement. This will also create consistency in the Act (cf. our proposed amendments to Chapter 5 Section 6, Chapter 8 Sections 7 and 15, and Chapter 8 a Section 4 of the Aliens Act). It may also be assumed that the explicit introduction of “practical impediments to enforcement” in the Aliens Act may lead to the question of how these are to be assessed generally receiving greater attention, even following a final and non-appealable removal order.</p>
<p>Our analysis has found that the individual bears considerable responsibility for proving  that practical impediments to enforcement exist in their case, even when obtaining proof may be very difficult (for example, for a stateless person or when citizenship needs to be established in states with weak institutions). In the decisions we have examined, we found no direct guidance from the Swedish Migration Agency to the individual on what they can do to assist in the enforcement. We have also found a lack of clarity in the guidance from the Swedish Migration Agency to the Swedish Police Authority during the enforcement process. These circumstances, together with limited examination of practical impediments to enforcement following a final and non-appealable removal order, are likely to lead to any such impediments going unaddressed. This is of particular concern due to the common reference in initial cases that impediments to enforcement are only considered possible to assess once a refusal-of-entry or expulsion order has become final and non-appealable.</p>
<h2>Proposal 3: A new provision should be introduced explicitly stating that if a removal order has expired, a residence permit may be granted if the individual’s own actions are not</h2>
<p>the decisive  reason for the removal order being unenforceable.</p>
<p>A new provision should be introduced explicitly stating that if a removal order has expired, a residence permit may be granted if the individual’s own actions are not the decisive reason for the removal order being unenforceable.</p>
<p>The background to this proposal is the absence in the current regulations of a clear provision on the possibility of granting a residence permit after a removal order becomes statute-barred. Our examination of the application of the law shows that the general rule  on granting a residence permit as a result of the statutory limitation period having expired has become an exception  now that some of the Migration Court of Appeal’s decisions have had an effect. More specifically, the lower courts’ interpretation of decision MIG 2009:13 (a decision to be examined under the terms of reference) has led to a shift in practice without any legislative amendments having taken place. We have noted arguments for deviating from the main rule in the application of the law that are often about the individual not playing an active role in the enforcement process, or that the case has been handed over to the police. In past practice, consideration was given to the individual’s actions during the period between a final and non-appealable removal order and statutory limitation together with  the measures authorities had taken to enable enforcement to take place. This happens to an insignificant extent today. We believe that the passivity or activity of the authorities must also be given due weight when assessing whether to deviate from the main rule, not just the individual’s actions. A main concern of the regulations on statutory limitation must be that they should help to spare people from having to live for a very long time under threat of removal due to decisions that cannot be enforced. At the same time, the regulations should not give the impression that an individual who is in hiding from the authorities long enough will be granted a residence permit. It should therefore be clearly stated for a residence permit to be granted the individual’s actions must not be the decisive  reason for the statutory limitation period having expired.</p>
<h2>Proposal 4: An inquiry should be appointed on the legal status of stateless people and a statelessness determination procedure.</h2>
<p>The legal status of stateless people and the possibility of intro- ducing a statelessness determination procedure in Sweden should be examined. The terms of reference for an inquiry on this issue should include presenting proposals for how Article 1 of the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons can be in- corporated into Swedish law, presenting proposals for the design of a statelessness determination procedure, and analysing what scope could be created in aliens legislation for granting residence permits on the basis of statelessness.</p>
<p>The background to this proposal is the conclusion from our analysis that the lack of a clear definition of statelessness in Swedish law – combined with statelessness as a discernible and recurring circumstance in our own analysis of practical impediments to en- forcement and residence permits as a result of statutory limitation</p>
<p>– is an argument for an inquiry on the introduction of a state-</p>
<p>lessness determination procedure. As the present inquiry on practical impediments to enforcement has not been tasked with studying the issue of statelessness, this has not been done. However, our study has found that statelessness is a key circumstance in cases that put the spotlight on assessments of practical impediments to enforce- ment or residence permits as a result of statutory limitation. The UNHCR’s ongoing work on the statelessness issue and current international research confirms this. We therefore consider that it is important to examine the issue of statelessness particularly with a view to preventing asylum seekers ending up in a situation where their refusal-of-entry or expulsion order cannot be enforced for reasons beyond their control. Since statelessness is an international issue, international cooperation should be sought. A future inquiry should be based on international research on the issue. Ultimately, an inquiry on statelessness that brings about the introduction of a statelessness determination procedure should also be a step for the Government towards better fulfilling its obligations under the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons.</p>
