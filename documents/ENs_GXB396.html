<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The assignment</h2>
<p>The assignment has been to make proposals on the design of rules to enable a transfer of certain social insurance expenditure to motor third party insurance (motor insurance). A number of conditions have been stipulated for these proposals. It has also been part of the assignment to estimate certain external costs for motor insurance and for individual road-users.</p>
<p>It has also been part of the assignment to report on the cost and administrative consequences that the proposals have for individuals, businesses and insurers, The Swedish Social Insurance Agency (Försäkringskassan) and the state otherwise.</p>
<h2>Increased cost responsibility for motor insurance</h2>
<p>The main idea underlying the assignment of the Commission is that liability for compensating the loss of income resulting from road traffic accidents should be concentrated to the private motor insurance companies. The terms of reference of the Commission contain several arguments in favour of such an arrangement, which is considered, over the course of time, to produce substantial welfare gains in the form of greater road safety, improved rehabilitation and reduced injury costs.</p>
<p>The basic goal of the intended reform is to reduce the number and cost of road accidents. The idea is that a more concentrated cost responsibility would lead the actors to behave in a more rational way. For example, a greater differentiation in premiums, based on traffic behaviour could lead individuals to reduce their premiums by safe driving. The motor insurance companies would also be more highly motivated to work for the rehabilitation of injured persons since motor insurance would bear a much larger proportion of the costs for loss of income.</p>
<h2>What compensation payments should motor insurance take over cost responsibility for?</h2>
<p>A relatively small part of the loss of income incurred by a person injured in a road traffic accident (traffic accident victim) is currently compensated for by private motor insurance. Normally, the major part of a traffic accident victim’s loss of income is compensated for by sick pay and sickness benefit, occupational injury insurance and group insurance schemes. The relatively limited importance of road accident compensation from private motor insurance in respect of loss of income is a consequence of tort law co-ordination principles.</p>
<p>According to the terms of reference of the Commission, all compensation for loss of income arising from road accidents should be paid by private motor insurance. Liability for sickness benefits under the National Insurance Act (1962:381) should be transferred to private motor insurance without any considerations of appropriateness.</p>
<p>As regards other benefits and compensation for loss of income that constitute co-ordination benefits under the Tort Liability Act, the starting point is that they should also be transferred, although according to its terms of reference, the Commission should consider whether it would be appropriate from the point of view of reasons of principle, administrative or other reasons, to exempt some of these benefits and compensation from being transferred.</p>
<h2>Occupational injury insurance</h2>
<p>Occupational injury insurance also provides compensation for other injuries occurred apart from loss of income. This concerns cost in certain cases for health care outside Sweden, dental care and special aids. The insurance scheme also provides benefits for survivors (Chapter 5). All of these different benefits are outside the assignment of the Commission to transfer costs for loss of income to motor insurance. In relevant cases, Försäkringskassan may process claims for such compensation to survivors even if the injury has been incurred due to a road traffic accident. Other benefits are of such a kind that they are also compensated for by motor insurance and the Commission has concluded that they should not be paid from occupational injury insurance in the event of a road traffic accident. The deliberations of the Commission on this point are as follows.</p>
<p>Occupational injury insurance differs from other social insurance schemes by being based on tort law principles. There are therefore considerable similarities with motor insurance. The evidential requirements for causal connection are, in principle, based on the same rules of evidence. Other reasoning on related matters such as “existing condition” and competing causes of injury are very similar. There is a social approach in both occupational injury insurance and motor insurance.</p>
<p>In the event of changes in occupational injury insurance, Sweden’s undertakings according to the 1964 ILO Convention (121) on employment injury benefits should be taken into account. The Convention contains, inter alia, provisions on the minimum benefits that should be paid according to legislation in the ratifying state. The Commission has found that the ILO Convention is not an obstacle for occupational injuries to be fully compensated in another statutory compensation system. A transfer of the costs for occupational injuries in road accidents should not therefore be incompatible with the undertakings according to the Convention.</p>
<p>As regards the amount of benefits depending on whether an injury is an occupational injury or a road traffic injury, a transfer of liability for costs for occupational injury insurance should not encounter any particular problems. Occupational injury insurance is based – within the level eligible for benefit of 7.5 price base amounts – like motor insurance on the tort law principle of 100 per cent compensation for loss of income. The possibilities of taking into account future increases in income when determining annuity are generally greater in motor insurance than in occupational injury insurance. This difference is therefore not either an argument against a transfer.</p>
<p>The possibility of adjustment of compensation provided for in the Road Traffic Injuries Act which does not have any direct equivalent in the Occupational Injury Act ( LAF) may in a few cases lead to a slightly lower benefit in the new system. The Commission, which deals with the issue of adjustment in chapter 8, does not find reason to propose any special rules for these special cases.</p>
<p>In the current system, a traffic accident victim who has also incurred an occupational injury, receives benefit from both Försäkringskassan and the motor insurance company. The rules on occupational injury annuity often mean that a long period of time elapses between the time the injury occurred and a decision on compensation. The insurance company’s claims adjustment cannot be completed until the complete compensation picture has been clarified. If occupational injury insurance is not transferred to the new system, this would continue to be the case.</p>
<p>Processing of road traffic injuries which are also occupational injuries in two systems is not only associated with these efficiency problems. It also entails deficient cost-effectiveness. The injuries are often difficult to investigate medically. A considerable reduction may be anticipated in the total administrative costs for a particular injury if these injuries were instead only to be processed by the motor insurance company.</p>
<p>Processing of cases by both Försäkringskassan and the insurance companies also means that dispute resolution may take place in two different parallel processes. This entails overuse of court resources. If claims adjustment of the loss of income of the claimant took place entirely in the insurance companies, dispute resolution would accordingly also be more efficient without a loss of legal security.</p>
<p>Overall, the Commission considers that there is no obstacle to transferring cost liability from occupational injury insurance to motor insurance in the cases in question. On the contrary, the Commission considers, taking into consideration the aspects now dealt with, that a transfer of this kind would have clear benefits from the point of view of efficiency and economy compared with the present system.</p>
<h2>Sick pay</h2>
<p>The provisions on sick pay are contained in the Sick Pay Act (1991:1047). Sick pay is by definition not a social insurance benefit. The Sick Pay Act is of a civil law character and regulates relations between the employer and employee. Sick pay is defined in the Act as the right of an employee to retain wage and other employment benefits when ill. The sick pay period is fourteen days of a sickness case.</p>
<p>The part of the compensation to those injured in road accidents which currently consists of sick pay is a minor undertaking in this context. The view expressed in the terms of reference of the Commission that a large financial total liability for the insurance companies would provide an incentive to engage in efficient rehabilitation of road traffic accident victims and also to work to prevent accidents, is therefore of limited significance as regards sick pay.</p>
<p>Instead, there are reasons to assume that the basic purpose of the sick pay system – that the employers should be given increased responsibility for the working environment and health of the employees – could not be maintained for road traffic accident victims if the motor insurance companies instead took over responsibility for payment of benefit from the beginning of the sickness period.</p>
<p>Consideration should also be given to the aspect that the sick pay system, from the point of view of payment, is efficient and simple, since it entails that sick pay is paid together with the ordinary wage. There is furthermore reason to fear that if the insurance companies took over responsibility for payment of benefit from the very start that this would lead to delayed payments and loss of payments, not least due to delayed claims and information problems. The employers’ payment of sick pay also provides the insurance companies with a well-needed respite during claims adjustment.</p>
<p>To sum up, the Commission considers that administrative reasons and reasons of suitability argue against motor insurance taking over cost responsibility for statutory sick pay.</p>
<h2>Group insurance schemes</h2>
<p>The group insurance and individual health insurance schemes that are co-ordinated in accordance with Chapter 5, section 3, of the Tort Liability Act make up a considerable part of the total compensation undertaking in particular in the case of permanent reduction of work capacity. If it is regarded as important to transfer as large an amount of costs as possible to motor insurance, this circumstance would make it of particular interest to transfer cost responsibility for these benefits to motor insurance.</p>
<p>Takeover of cost responsibility for the part of loss of income covered by these benefits is, however, considerably more complicated than is the case for other deduction benefits.</p>
<p>The sickness benefits in different collective agreements are currently determined in such a way that they are paid when the employee receives sickness benefit. According to the wording of the current agreements, this may be presumed to mean that no benefit will be paid in a system where road injury compensation is paid instead of sickness benefit. Motor insurance will thus automatically have the entire responsibility for loss of income.</p>
<h2>Method of transfer</h2>
<p>The Commission has considered two main methods for how responsibility for compensation for the loss of income arising from traffic injuries which are now compensated for through sickness benefit and occupational injury allowance can be transferred to motor insurance.</p>
<p>According to the Commission’s terms of reference, as a starting point in the choice of method, special importance shall be placed on avoiding a deterioration of cover for those affected by traffic injuries. The rules proposed by the Commission shall also be designed in such a way that application of the regulatory framework in individual cases is characterised by objectivity, good service, uniform application, and legal security at the same time as keeping down administrative costs. High demands must also be made that the system can be readily overviewed and is easy to understand for the individual.</p>
<p>One method means that the claim would be dealt with exclusively by the motor insurance company. There is no possibility of having Försäkringskassan consider the issue of greater degree of reduction of work capacity or the amount of compensation (unless the illness has other causes than the road accident). This method may be described as an excluding method. The injuries arising from a traffic injury are not covered by national insurance.</p>
<p>The second method entails that the injury is primarily dealt with by the motor insurance company. There is then no obstacle to Försäkringskassan considering whether the injury entails greater work incapacity or if compensation can be greater from national insurance. This method is a co-ordination method. There may be a secondary assessment of all injuries within the framework of national insurance, from which supplementary payment may be made.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that a basic method should be chosen. The two methods considered both have advantages and disadvantages. In general terms, it can be said that an excluding method is most in line with the main purpose of the reform, namely that motor insurance should assume overall responsibility for the loss of income of the traffic accident victim. This also takes into account that the new system, when applying one method, may be expected to be more efficient, both from the perspective of the individual and administration. A co-ordination method guarantees that a parallel assessment of the injured person’s right to compensation is made by Försäkringskassan. This means that there should not be a risk of a lower compensation in the new system, compared with the current system. However, this risk only comes to the fore in a few situations. However, in the co-ordination method, there is a clear risk that the new system will not be as efficient. It is not likely that the inherent efficiency problems with the co-ordination method can be resolved by special regulations. However, the possible risk for deterioration of the individual’s right to compensation in a few cases can be eliminated by special statutory provision. The Commission considers that an excluding method is preferable as a basis for the new system for compensation for loss of income in a traffic accident.</p>
<p>For those injured in traffic accidents, the recommended method would mean that the insurance company would have a similar role as Försäkringskassan today. This means that traffic-related sickness case would be reported to the insurance company, in relevant cases after the end of the sick pay period.</p>
<p>The issue of entitlement to compensation is not complicated in the majority of road traffic injury cases in which the matter of compensation for loss of income is raised. However, certain issues may be unclear in a number of cases. One of the most important tasks is therefore to secure payment of compensation even when there is some uncertainty concerning, inter alia, medical causal connections. With a view to counteracting a restrictive approach by the insurance companies to payment of compensation in such cases, the Commission proposes that the insurance company should be entitled to be reimbursement from Försäkringskassan of benefit paid corresponding to 80 per cent of the income basis used for calculation of road traffic injury compensation for the portion that does not exceed seven and a half price base amounts, if it is finally decided that the injury which has led to road traffic injury compensation has not been caused by a traffic accident.</p>
<p>In order to clarify the financial allocation of responsibility between the motor insurance and national insurance, reimbursement should also take place in the opposite direction in cases where Försäkringskassan has paid benefit and it later proves, through, for example, a court judgment, that the individual was entitled to road traffic compensation. The Commission therefore proposes that an insurance company shall pay Försäkringskassan the amount that the authority has paid in benefit under the National Insurance Act or the Occupational Injuries Act if it is subsequently established that the loss of income on which the benefit was passed arose due to a traffic accident.</p>
<p>In those parts of the social insurance that replace loss of income, there are certain guaranteed benefit levels. This applies to sickness compensation and activity compensation in the form of guarantee allowance and certain guaranteed annuity bases and the state personal injury cover.</p>
<p>Compensation for loss of income which is calculated according to the rules of the Tort Liability Act only covers actual loss. There are accordingly no guaranteed minimum levels.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that guaranteed compensation levels should remain a central government commitment. It is therefore proposed that it should be possible to pay sickness compensation and activity compensation in the form of guarantee allowance to a traffic accident victim who lacks motor insurance for the loss of income, or whose benefit is less than the guarantee level for guarantee allowance. However, the Commission considers that persons participating in training to which special risks are attached for occupational injury or who at any rate are participating in occupational training when the injury is incurred should not be covered by the occupational injury insurance’s rules on special income protection in the event of a traffic injury.</p>
<p>In certain cases, a person in the new system will receive at the same time road accident injury compensation for loss of income and benefit from health insurance or occupational injury insurance. This is the case when the traffic injury only leads to a partial loss of income and the insured person at the same time has an illness or occupational injury due to other causes that reduces work capacity.</p>
<p>The differences in the criteria for entitlement to compensation in the different insurance systems may lead to certain problems in the new system. When the whole loss of income is to be compensated for through motor insurance, the insurance company will not use the proportions based on reduction of work capacity that are used today when benefit from health insurance is used as a basis. The Commission finds, however, that this problem is not so serious that a special regulation is required.</p>
<p>If a person falls ill again in a traffic-related illness after the traffic injury has been finally settled, traffic accident compensation will be paid if a significant change is considered to have occurred. In the view of the Commission, a person who falls ill again with a traffic injury should therefore be entitled to receive sickness benefit until the insurance company takes over responsibility for payment despite the illness being traffic-related. However, Försäkringskassan may demand reimbursement of benefit paid for the period that traffic injury compensation should have been paid.</p>
<h2>Adjustment of road injury benefit</h2>
<p>One of the tasks of the Motor Insurance Commission has been to consider whether the adjustment rules of the Road Traffic Injuries Act should be amended when injuries arising from road accidents are removed from the national insurance scheme.</p>
<p>The Road Traffic Injuries Act contains rules on adjustment of road traffic injury compensation due to the co-responsibility of the injured person. Adjustment in the event of personal injury can take place, if the injured person has deliberately or through gross negligence contributed to the injury occurring. Compensation may also be adjusted if a driver is guilty of drunken driving or aggravated drunken driving if the driver has contributed to the injury occurring through negligence in this connection.</p>
<p>Adjustment shall be made after a consideration of reasonableness. This adjustment should not be permitted to hazard the social security of the injured person and his or her family.</p>
<p>There is not guidance from case law as to how adjustment is to take place. Within the insurance industry, principles have been worked out for adjustment. With regard to compensation for loss of income, a special guarantee rule, the ‘90 per cent rule’ was created, which means that benefit should always be paid so that it amounts to, together with the injured person’s income and benefits from the national scheme, to at least 90 per cent of the income that an injured person would have had had he or she not been injured, up to 7.5 price base amounts, regardless of the extent of adjustment applied to other components of compensation. This rule was changed to an 80 per cent rule in December 2008.</p>
<p>According to the rules of occupational injury insurance policies, loss of income is fully compensated. If the adjustment rules in the Road Traffic Injuries Act were applied to road traffic injuries which are occupational injuries, the compensation will accordingly be lower than according to the current rules if there are no possibilities for reduction of occupational injury annuity.</p>
<p>In the new system, Försäkringskassan will not pay any benefit for loss of income for traffic injuries. Payment from motor insurance for loss of income is thus of crucial importance for the subsistence of the road traffic injury victim.</p>
<h2>Reconsideration of entitlement to benefit</h2>
<p>When sickness and activity compensation replaced disability pension and temporary disability pension on 1 January 2003, rules were introduced on reconsideration of the medical condition of those affected by injury, the need of rehabilitation and work capacity. This change meant that the reconsideration should take place throughout the period that the injured person receives benefit from the social insurance system. The Tort Liability Act contains provisions that entail that an established annuity may be reconsidered if the circumstances on which benefit was based have changed significantly. When an expanded motor insurance is to take over responsibility for compensating the entire loss of income, there is reason to consider whether the prerequisites for reconsidering established compensation for loss of income according to the Road Traffic Injuries Act need to be changed. In these considerations, the starting point shall be that rehabilitation and return to work shall, of course, be encouraged, although without departing from the compensation principles of the Road Traffic Injuries Act.</p>
<p>The rules on Försäkringskassan’s subsequent checks and reconsideration have a different character from the rules of the Tort Liability Act. Försäkringskassan’s decisions on sickness benefit and sickness compensation entail exercise of public authority. The provisions of the Tort Liability Act are, however, in the sphere of civil law. Entitlement to damages and traffic injury compensation are determined by a mutually binding agreement or by a judgment.</p>
<p>There is not less need for a reconsideration authority in the new system. The fact that motor insurance shall compensate for the whole of loss of income is on the contrary an argument of considerable force for changed circumstances being able to lead to an adjustment of a set annuity. Nothing has either emerged which indicates that the prerequisites for reconsideration should be changed. In the future, it should accordingly be the case that the issue of compensation can be reconsidered, if the conditions on which compensation was based under Chapter 5 of the Tort Liability Act have substantially changed.</p>
<p>At present, the insurance companies refrain almost completely from making use of the possibility of reconsidering annuities to the disadvantage of the injured person. There is no procedure for capturing cases to be reconsidered. With increased costs, it may be assumed that the insurance companies will have greater interest in reconsideration to avoid the injured person being overcompensated. Methods will then also be developed to focus on obtaining knowledge of the changed circumstances of the injured person.</p>
<p>Information from the Tax Agency on taxed income are public and available to all, thus also to insurance companies. Furthermore, the companies can obtain information, for example, through tips from other people and through websites where the injured person appears in some capacity. However, the motor insurance companies do not have access to information from public authorities and health care facilities which Försäkringskassan can demand to obtain a basis for its assessment. It is probably not normally possible for the company to use the power of attorney which the injured person provides the company with during claims adjustment to enable it to obtain information about the injured person’s medical and financial circumstances after final settlement.</p>
<p>The idea has been raised on the part of the insurance industry that an obligation should be introduced for an injured person who receives traffic injury compensation for loss of income in the form of an annuity to notify the insurance company if conditions change in such a way that a reconsideration according to Chapter 5, section 5, of the Tort Liability Act, exist. Taking into consideration, the difficulty of finding a suitable sanction for this obligation, the Commission has not made any recommendation for an arrangement of this kind.</p>
<h2>Rehabilitation</h2>
<p>One of the main reasons for the Motor Insurance Commission’s assignment is that many road traffic accident victims have difficulty in obtaining access to the rehabilitation needed. With a view to strengthening the rehabilitation process, the Commission shall therefore consider an expansion of the responsibility of motor insurance for the rehabilitation of those injured in road traffic accidents.</p>
<p>At present, traffic accident victims have no statutory right to receive rehabilitation. He or she is instead dependent on various actors performing their obligations according to different regulatory frameworks. These actors include the health service, employers, The Employment Office and municipal social services.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the main responsibility for different forms of rehabilitation initiatives should not be changed. This means that the health service will continue to be responsible for medical treatment and medical rehabilitation. Within the workrelated rehabilitation, the employer is responsible for workplacefocused measures and the Employment Office for labour-market focused measures. The municipality is responsible for social measures. However, the fact that the main responsibility is still borne by the respective actor does not mean that the motor insurance companies are prevented from financing rehabilitation measures, wholly or partly. This possibility exists per se already today, although the financial driving forces are not so great since Försäkringskassan pays the major part of the loss of income of the traffic accident victim. In claims adjustment in the expanded system, it is, however, natural for the motor insurance company to compare the cost for any rehabilitation measure with the cost for the traffic incident victim’s loss of income due to the traffic accident. A comparison of this kind will probably mean that the companies will finance rehabilitation measures to a considerably greater extent than today.</p>
<p>As regards the co-ordination of rehabilitation, Försäkringskassan shall not be responsible for this if the motor insurance company has deemed that the insured person’s work capacity has wholly ceased due to the traffic accident. If the insured’s work incapacity is only partly caused by traffic, Försäkringskassan shall co-ordinate rehabilitation, if the work incapacity is at least 50 per cent caused by other causes than the traffic accident. In such cases, Försäkringskassan shall work together with the motor insurance company. Försäkringskassan may, if the insured person permits, assign parts of its responsibility for co-ordination to the motor insurance company.</p>
<p>The responsibility of motor insurance for co-ordinating the rehabilitation of the traffic accident victim should not be regulated by law but be governed by the financial driving forces.</p>
<h2>Loss of pension or pension entitlement?</h2>
<p>The compensation currently paid for loss of income due to a traffic injury does not confer entitlement to pension. It is calculated on the basis of the gross loss between the income base and the coordination benefits and paid with a deduction for preliminary withholding tax. The loss of pension incurred by the traffic accident victim arising from the fact that the compensation for the traffic injury is not pensionable is estimated and paid after pension age in the form of an annuity or in the form of a lump sum at the time of claims adjustment for smaller losses.</p>
<p>According to the Commission’s guidelines, the investigator shall recommend rules, which, within the framework of the pension agreement, mean that compensation for loss of income in an expanded motor insurance will be pensionable as well as considering which additional social security contributions should be paid.</p>
<h2>Pension entitlement</h2>
<p>There is nothing to indicate that the traffic accident victim is generally overor under-compensated in general with the current claims adjustment practice with regard to loss of pension. The regulation of loss of pension is, however, both time-consuming and complicated. While calculation tools are available, extensive work is still required to obtain all the relevant information for the calculation.</p>
<p>A clear benefit in letting traffic injury compensation for loss of income become pensionable is that it will then produce the full correct pension that the income would otherwise have led to. The current calculation methods can entail some risk that the loss of pension will deviate from what should really have been the correct pension.</p>
<p>If the traffic injury compensation is not pensionable in a system with expanded responsibility either, a large number of persons with permanent injuries who are at an early stage or in the middle of their active working years will only have an extremely limited national basic pension. This may have undesirable consequences. One such is that a larger number of people than today will be referred to guarantee pension. Another consequence is that the pension system will not receive contributions to the same extent as at present.</p>
<h2>Contributions</h2>
<p>A prerequisite for an income being pensionable in the autonomous national pension system is for the old age pension contribution to be paid into the system corresponding to the pension entitlement that the income gives rise to.</p>
<p>The circumstance that the motor insurance companies will pay the old age pension contribution means that the companies in certain cases will have to pay more for the injured person’s national pension than what they do today in compensation for loss of pension under the rules of the Tort Liability Act. This is due, among other things, to the contribution also being paid on parts of wage that exceed the upper limit for pensionable income. Administrative and systematic reasons entail, however, that no exemption should be made for the insurance companies as regards payment of contributions above the ceiling.</p>
<p>Other social security contributions are the health insurance contribution, the parental insurance contribution, the survivor’s pension contribution, the labour market contribution and the occupational injury contribution. Since traffic injury compensation according to the proposal of the investigator will not confer entitlement to sickness benefit and no unemployment injury benefit or unemployment benefit can be calculated on it, the Commission cannot see any acceptable reasons of principle for any other employers’ contributions besides that proposed being payable on traffic injury compensation.</p>
<p>If traffic injury compensation for loss of income is to be pensionable, the benefit will be included in the list of pensionable benefits specified in Chapter 2 of the Income-based Old Age Pension Act (1998:674). According to the National Old Age Pension Contribution Act, contributions shall be paid on those benefits specified in the aforesaid chapters.</p>
<p>If traffic injury compensation is made pensionable, the tax reduction applicable for the contribution will provide full compensation for the national pension contribution. In the view of the Commission, there is therefore no reason to exempt traffic injury compensation from the obligation to pay the national insurance contribution in the new system.</p>
<h2>Processing matters</h2>
<p>When the motor insurance has full responsibility for compensating for the loss of income of traffic accident victims, the conditions for the motor insurance companies’ processing of traffic accident claims will change. The task of being responsible for payment from the first krona after the end of any sick pay period differs considerably from the current task of motor insurance which is responsible only for complementary compensation.</p>
<p>When an insurance company is solely liable for compensation, it will be an important question how quickly the company can obtain knowledge about the insurance claim so that claims adjustment can be initiated.</p>
<p>In the proposed system, it must be ensured that the injured person does not suffer any loss of rights due to the arrangement of the application procedure or due to lack of clarity as to who the claim is to be submitted to.</p>
<p>The current claim procedure means that the injury claim is submitted to the motor insurance company which had insured the vehicle in which the injured person was conveyed at the time of the road accident. Injured persons who were outside a vehicle liable to have motor third party motor insurance can report the claim the insurance company of any of the vehicles involved.</p>
<p>In the current system, a sickness case is reported to the employer, if the latter is to pay sick pay, and otherwise to Försäkringskassan. At the end of the sick pay period, the employer shall notify the sickness case to Försäkringskassan if the sickness case continues.</p>
<p>An employee shall also in the future report to the employer if he or she is affected by illness due to a traffic injury which entails work incapacity. After the end of the sick pay period, it is, however, no longer Försäkringskassan which is to pay any continued loss of income but the responsible insurance company.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore proposes that if a sickness case due to a traffic injury gives entitlement to sick pay, the injured person’s employer shall report the sickness case to a motor insurance company instead of to Försäkringskassan if the case continues after the end of the sick pay period.</p>
<p>The employer will however be liable to report the injury to the insurance company only if it is evident from the information provided by the employee or from other circumstances that the sickness case is due to a traffic accident.</p>
<p>If Försäkringskassan receives a sick report and there is reason to believe that the insured has incurred the illness due to traffic, Försäkringskassan shall send over the documents to a motor insurance company unless the insured opposes this.</p>
<p>To make it easier for employers and Försäkringskassan to assess whether a claim should be reported to an insurance company, a box is being added to the form ”Läkarutlåtande – hälsotillstånd” (FKF 3200) (Doctor’s opinion – state of health) used by doctors for sick notes, which the certifying doctor must tick if it is a traffic accident. With the aid of notes in the acute record, the doctor should in most cases be able to take a position on whether it is a traffic accident which has caused the complaint and any work incapacity.</p>
<p>In cases where it is not clear to an employer or Försäkringskassan which insurance company is responsible for the injury, a report should be made to the Swedish Motor Insurers.</p>
<p>The insurance company shall be responsible for compensation only if the loss of income is due to a traffic injury. It may be difficult in particular cases to investigate whether this condition applies. An important task is to ensure that such investigation difficulties do not delay payment of compensation even if it is not clear to what extent there is a causal connection between the traffic accident and the established lack of work capacity per se.</p>
<p>The Commission notes that there is overall no reason to anticipate that compensation will be paid later to the injured in the new system with regard to injuries with a clear connection between the injury and the traffic accident as well as injuries that do not require more detailed investigation of the financial circumstances.</p>
<p>As regards investigation by the insurance companies during the initial phase, a number of the Commission’s proposals – including the ability of the insurance companies in certain cases to demand reimbursement of benefit from Försäkringskassan – aim to eliminate the risk of greater restrictiveness in uncertain cases.</p>
<p>Insurance medicine issues of various kinds arise both in Försäkringskassan’s processing of sickness insurance and occupational illness cases and with the settlement of personal injuries by insurance companies.</p>
<p>Criticism has been raised over the years against the system of insurance doctors at Försäkringskassan and medical advisors associated with the insurance companies.</p>
<p>A discussion in this issue is whether it would be possible to establish a body of medical advisors who were independent in relation to the individual insurance companies.</p>
<p>The Commission has been informed that work is in process within the insurance industry of establishing a body of the abovementioned kind. This work is being actively pursued and is far advanced. However, no final proposal has been adopted for this. Bearing in mind the process underway, the Commission considers that no proposal should be made in this context on the forms for insurance medical assessments.</p>
<h2>Secrecy-related issues, etc.</h2>
<p>In the new system where the insurance companies bear the primarily responsibility for compensating the loss of income of traffic accident victims, it is particularly important that the companies have access to relevant information on the injured person’s medical and financial circumstances. It is also desirable for information to be provided in an effective way. This also requires exchange of information in the cases when compensation is to be paid at the same time according to the Road Traffic Injuries Act and other systems of compensation, for example when full work incapacity due to illness depends only partly on a traffic accident. The companies must also be able to collaborate with Försäkringskassan, the health service and also other actors.</p>
<p>Limited access to documentation can lead to compensation not being correct or that the companies consider that there is no correlation and there refusing compensation. For the individual, the consequences in such cases can both be a deterioration in insurance cover and longer processing times. For this reason, consideration should be given to whether the secrecy rules should be amended, for example, by there being introduced a statutory obligation for the health service and other authorities to provide information to the motor insurance companies on the state of health or other personal circumstances of an individual. A balance must then be struck between two justified interests, namely on the one hand the requirement for smooth processing and a correct basis for decisions and on the other hand protection for the personal data of the individual.</p>
<p>Very strong reasons are required to deviate from the basic systematic approach and the underlying objectives in the sphere of secrecy and to introduce a statutory obligation for the health service and other authorities to provide information to civil law bodies such as motor insurance companies. The reasons for this obligation to provide information are, in the view of the Commission, not sufficiently strong. The companies moreover have the possibility of obtaining corresponding confidential information with the aid of a power of attorney from the individual. If the individual refuses to provide the power of attorney, the consequence may be that he or she is deprived of compensation with reference to the general tort law principle that the injured has the burden of proof for his or her claims.</p>
<p>According to information from the motor insurance companies, it is no great problem for the companies to obtain a power of attorney, which is often unlimited, from the traffic accident victim. This procedure is used regularly to obtain information from the health service, other authorities and the employer. The Commission thus considers that the ability of the companies to obtain the necessary information will not be worse in the new system, even without these statutory changes. The procedure with the power of attorney may possibly entail that claims adjustment takes longer in some cases but this disadvantage shall be viewed in relation to the individual’s protection for his or her personal integrity. The Commission considers in the light of this that the motor insurance companies should not have access to information about the individual’s state of health or other personal circumstances through a statutory obligation for the health service and other authorities.</p>
<p>Another important issue in this context is how information can be obtained and processed.</p>
<p>An authority is not obliged to provide a recording for automatic processing in another form than a print-out to a greater extent than legally provided for. This provision does not prohibit authorities from making available public documents in an electronic form. Other provisions, for example, register statutes, can, however, prevent such disclosure.</p>
<p>The possibility of direct access to authorities’ registers which contain sensitive information is greatly restricted. There are no examples of such possibilities for other than authorities and the registered person.</p>
<p>Obtaining information on a medium for automated processing is possible through statutory regulation. It is then rather a matter of whether the purpose of the processing of the data is acceptable.</p>
<h2>Dispute resolution</h2>
<p>There are currently major differences between social insurance and motor insurance as regards administration and dispute resolution. The issue of the right to benefit from social insurance is determined by the decision of an authority, Försäkringskassan. Court consideration of the right to benefit takes place through such a decision to the disadvantage of the insured being appealed against to a general administrative court. While claim adjustment at an insurance company in conjunction with a traffic injury takes place in accordance with the rules on compensation in the Road Traffic Injuries Act and the Tort Liability Act, it constitutes a private activity which lacks the formal legal security protection that the actions of an authority are subject to. The possibility of court consideration in the event of disagreement with the insurance company is considerably less accessible, not least for reasons of cost, than that offered in administrative cases.</p>
<p>The Commission has investigated whether the dispute resolution institution in motor insurance disputes needs to be improved in order for the ability of the individual to have a dispute on compensation in the event of work capacity considered in an acceptable manner not being deteriorating in relation to the current situation.</p>
<p>It can be noted that it is difficult to compare the corrective functions of the administrative procedure with the dispute resolution mechanisms of motor insurance. The Commission none the less draws the conclusion that the there will not be any deterioration for the individual in any real sense due to maintaining the present arrangement for dispute resolution in the new compensation system.</p>
<h2>The Road Traffic Injuries Commission</h2>
<p>The Commission does not consider that the taking over of the social insurance system’s costs for the loss of income of traffic accident victims by the motor insurance per se motivates a changed principal for the Road Traffic Injuries Commission. If this is notwithstanding this considered as important, a proposal to this effect should be preceded by a special investigation.</p>
<p>The Commission does not wish to recommend any changes in the composition of the Road Traffic Injuries Commission. The Road Traffic Injuries Commission seems in all essentials to have a composition that serves its purpose.</p>
<p>Neither is a different role proposed for the Road Traffic Injuries Commission. However, one change that would seem to be necessary to avoid an increase in the number of cases due to the reform is to increase the threshold amount for when the Road Traffic Injuries Commission’s opinion shall be obtained.</p>
<p>It is not possible to foresee whether the new arrangement may lead to an increased burden on the Road Traffic Injuries Commission due to traffic accident victims requesting consideration by this Commission to a greater extent than at present of matters during ongoing claims adjustment. However, there may be reason to return to this issue at a later date and possibly to propose measures if the burden on the Road Traffic Injuries Commission becomes too great.</p>
<h2>Attorney costs</h2>
<p>A view has been expressed that certain insurance companies have become more restrictive in providing compensation for the attorney costs for traffic injury victims during claims adjustment. The insurance industry has in different contexts denied that this is the case. Demands have been made for the right to compensation for attorney costs during claims adjustment to be regulated by statute.</p>
<p>In the view of the Commission, it is difficult to have any clear picture of whether the insurance companies in general or particular companies have actually changed their practice to becoming more restrictive with regard to compensating attorney costs during claims adjustment.</p>
<p>The Commission does not consider that it is appropriate to regulate the right to compensation for attorney costs by statute since this is in the first place to be regarded as an issue relating to terms of insurance.</p>
<h2>Government-owned vehicles</h2>
<p>The government and its authorities own a large number of vehicles although the state is not obliged to have motor insurance. Instead, the state defrays the cost of the traffic injury compensation which would have been paid had the insurance existed.</p>
<p>When compensation for loss of income due to traffic injuries is to be compensated for in its entirety from a motor insurance, the question arises of whether the state should compensate the whole loss of income in a corresponding way in those cases when the state meets the cost of traffic injury compensation.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that government-owned vehicles should be covered by the new system with an expanded liability for the loss of income of traffic accident victims. If this does not happen, it would entail consequences that can be called into question.</p>
<p>An arrangement where the state’s responsibility for traffic injury compensation does not cover the whole compensation for loss of income, while, on the other hand, private motor insurance does, can be questioned from the point of view of competition. Government authorities that engage in activity involving the use of vehicles would namely then have lower costs for their vehicles than any competing private businesses.</p>
<p>Distortions can also occur in regress situations. When the Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency has paid traffic injury compensation and the Agency is going to demand the amount paid back from an insurance company which shall finally defray the compensation, the demand only covers a small part of the total loss of income. However, a private insurance company, in the corresponding situation, where the state shall finally defray the compensation, can demand the total loss of income from the Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency, which the company has paid in compensation. This distortion does not arise if the traffic injury compensation that the state is to pay also covers the total loss of income.</p>
<p>The State Personal Injury Insurance Act (1977:265) contains rules on a guaranteed annuity basis for conscripts and others. The Commission considers that these groups should continue to be entitled to compensation in accordance with the Road Traffic Injuries Act.</p>
<h2>Uninsured motor vehicles</h2>
<p>According to its terms of reference, the Commission shall clarify the situation, in particular for uninsured vehicle owners and propose the changes considered necessary to avoid an increase in the number of uninsured vehicle owners. The background may reasonably be assumed to be the following. If the loss of income of the traffic accident victim shall be paid for in its entirety by motor insurance, the costs of the insurance will increase. This in turn may be assumed to mean that the premiums for the insurance will be increased and that certain car owners will try to avoid such an increase in costs. It can be feared that an increase in premium will be an incentive for certain car owners to avoid keeping their vehicle insured but none the less use it in traffic.</p>
<p>As regards deregistered vehicles, the Swedish Motor Insurers has already noted in its cases that the uninsured vehicles that cause injuries are to an increasing extent deregistered. For a person who wishes to use an uninsured vehicle on the road, the current rules work rather as an incentive to keep the vehicle deregistered rather than registered. If an uninsured vehicle is registered when it is involved in a traffic accident, the owner will have to pay the motor insurance charge for the period that the vehicle has been uninsured. However, if the vehicle is deregistered, the motor insurance charge cannot be charged to the owner and he will thus be treated more leniently. The risk of a deregistered vehicle being detected on the road is not great. It cannot be seen from the road traffic register that a vehicle is used despite being deregistered. However, it can be seen in the road traffic register that a registered vehicle is uninsured and a demand can be made on the owner to pay the motor insurance charge.</p>
<p>There are mainly two approaches if it is wished to counteract that vehicle owners use deregistered vehicles on the road. The possibility of deregistration can be restricted or removed. Good possibilities can also be created of detecting vehicles that are driven despite being deregistered, which should be combined with effective sanctions against breaches.</p>
<p>The Commission does not consider that the possibility of deregistering vehicles should be restricted.</p>
<p>The Commission does not regard it as a viable approach – alongside the investigation work that is taking place elsewhere – to try to find other practical usable methods to detect deregistered vehicles than those that already exist.</p>
<p>In the view of the Commission, it is unfortunate that the current regulation of the motor insurance charge leads to the person using a deregistered vehicle on the road not only having great possibilities of avoiding detection but also not risking to have to pay the charge for the period that the vehicle has been deregistered. This is particularly the case when there are often grounds to suspect that a person who has been found on one occasion to be using a deregistered vehicle in breach of regulations has neglected his or her insurance obligation on other occasions.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that a rule be introduced to the effect that the person who is found to be using a deregistered vehicle on the road without having motor insurance for the vehicle shall be obliged to pay the motor insurance charge. The charge shall be paid retroactively for the period that the vehicle has been deregistered. To avoid inequitable results, however, the time should be restricted to twelve months. A rule of this kind should be complemented with a possibility for the person liable to insurance avoiding the retroactive responsibility wholly or partly by showing that the vehicle was only used on a single occasion or for a limited period of time. The provision in section 34, fourth paragraph, of the Road Traffic Injuries Act on the motor insurance charge can be reduced if it is shown to be appropriate.</p>
<h2>External costs</h2>
<p>The Commission has had the task of estimating the external social costs that road users as a collective cause when driving. This thus concerns costs which are not part of the injuries ensuing from road accidents that are covered by motor insurance or the individual and which are thus external for the individual.</p>
<p>With the aid of a study of road traffic accidents in 2005, the Commission has estimated the external costs at SEK 2.2 billion at 2005 prices.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposals A qualitative assessment of the reform’s effects</h2>
<p>The reform for which the Commission is making proposals transfers responsibility from one insurance system to another. The part of compensation for income loss that social insurance bears today will be transferred to motor insurance.</p>
<p>Both social insurance and motor insurance insure against risk. Funding of social insurance through employers’ social security contributions leads, however, to social insurance being considerably more redistributive than motor insurance. Social insurance is funded by a contribution on gross wages. No differentiations are made otherwise. Motor insurance is funded through premiums paid by owners of vehicles subject to motor insurance. These premiums are differentiated, inter alia, on the basis of statistically established differences in risk for individuals and vehicles. A transfer of responsibility from social insurance to motor insurance is thus a transfer from the collective of individuals paying employers’ social security contribution to the collective of owners of vehicles liable to motor insurance.</p>
<p>The transfer which the Commission is making proposals for can be expected to influence behaviour both of road users and insurance companies. Discussions are taking place in the insurance industry on a more individualised setting of premiums. In the view of the Commission, there are, however, considerable problems attached to a more individualised and behaviour-governed setting of premiums, relating both to data collection and integrity. However, it is probable that the reform will encourage a development towards more behaviour-governed premiums.</p>
<p>The incentives to rehabilitate a person who has been injured in a traffic accident may vary depending on the allocation of responsibility between different actors as regards compensation for loss of income. Responsibility is currently allocated among a number of different payers (employers and insurances). This means that the financial benefits of investing in a person’s rehabilitation for return to work are shared among several insurance schemes. A reform that leads to a more integrated responsibility for motor insurance would change these conditions in such a way that integrated responsibility would provide a better incentive for rehabilitation.</p>
<p>The reform probably also leads to a reduction in the overall administrative work and thus a reduction in the overall administrative costs.</p>
<h2>Average increase in premium</h2>
<p>The Commission makes the assessment that the average increase in premium for motor insurance in the private market would be around 70 per cent. The Commission estimates that the premium would have to be raised by just over 110 per cent for governmentowned vehicles.</p>
<h2>The cost development of social insurance</h2>
<p>Social insurance retains cost responsibility for traffic accidents that took place prior to the reform.</p>
<p>As a result of the duration of claim cases, the reduction in costs for social insurance will be a lengthy process. The calculations carried out by the Commission show that social insurance will have costs for compensation of income loss to those injured in traffic in the years prior to the reform almost 40 years after the reform.</p>
<p>In the assessment of the Commission, Försäkringskassan will have costs for compensation of around SEK 7.2 billion in 2010. In 2050 around SEK 900 million will remain in nominal terms at an annual inflation rate of 2 per cent. In real terms, this corresponds to around SEK 400 million in 2010’s prices.</p>
<h2>Tax on the motor insurance premium</h2>
<p>The Commission has made calculations to make possible a modification of the tax on the motor insurance premium introduced in 2007. In addition, the Commission has produced a calculation example showing how high premium tax would have to be to include the external costs in taxation.</p>
<p>Based on the assessment that the reform would lead to an average increase in premium of 70 per cent we have, with supplements in assessments of how large tax revenues are desired as a result of the modification of the tax already introduced and the external costs previously calculated, estimated that the new tax rate, taking into consideration the larger tax base, would need to be around 40 per cent of the premium. To the extent that the external costs would not be included, the tax rate would be around 25 per cent.</p>
<h2>Increased price base amount</h2>
<p>The increased premium will affect the price level in the economy. Price increases can lead to a one-off adaptation of the price base amount that governs different parts of the tax and grant system.</p>
<p>The Commission has with a micro-simulation model FASIT, developed by Statistics Sweden, simulated the effects that a higher level of the price base amount would have on different parts of the system. The Commission’s calculations show that CPI would rise to a level justifying an increase of the price base amount by SEK 100. In the calculations, we have therefore tested a price base amount which is SEK 100 higher than the amount estimate by the National Institute of Economic Research for 2011.</p>
<p>The result of the calculation is that the public sector overall will receive less income and increased expenditure of just under SEK 300 million on an annual basis. Of this amount, SEK 100 million is accounted for by decreased tax revenue. Half of this is reduced local government tax due to increased basic deduction and the other half the result of increased in-work tax deduction which is therefore borne by the state. The costs of sickness and activity compensation will increase by SEK 100 million and guarantee pension by SEK 90 million.</p>
<h2>The impact on the transport sector</h2>
<p>The increased premiums will lead to increased costs for all those with a vehicle liable to motor insurance. This applies to private individuals and businesses. The transport sector (taxi, hauliers, goods transport) are the industries affected most.</p>
<p>With a view to clarifying how much the transport sector is affected, the Commission has carried out calculations with the aid of data on all companies classified as transport companies. This concerns a total of around 23 000 businesses, where information about the result and vehicle possession is included. This data has made it possible to test how large the relative cost increases will be for businesses as a result of the proposed reform.</p>
<p>The median of the aggregate relative change in cost has in the calculations been computed at 0.43 per cent. Smaller businesses will have a higher increase. There is also a tendency for the taxi industry to have a slightly higher increase than other sectors.</p>
<p>Altogether, the reform entails that the transport sector will have small increases in costs which will probably lead to marginal price increases, one or two or a few per cent. Smaller businesses can have a marginal weakening of result.</p>
<h2>Impact on households</h2>
<p>The Commission has made computations of how the premium level will affect households with a view to clarifying the economic effects. Statistics Sweden’s micro-simulation model FASIT has been used in this connection. The model has been supplemented with information on car ownership and with information about how premiums are distributed in the initial situation.</p>
<p>For the analysis we have created the concept ”remaining scope for consumption” which is the household’s disposable income after reduction for the motor insurance premium for cars. We also introduce a concept, ”economic standard”, which is defined as the household’s disposable income adjusted for the number of dependants, for the sake of comparability.</p>
<p>The result of the analysis is that there is a certain tendency for households with a low economic standard in kronor to lose more of their available scope for consumption than other households. However, there is no correlation between financial standard and relative change in the remaining scope for consumption.</p>
<p>When households are divided into deciles, thus into ten equally large groups according to standard, it also appears that the households in the highest deciles lose most. The median household in the highest decile loses more than SEK 3 000. The percentage change in the remaining scope for consumption varies between a small increase and at most a one per cent loss. If we only take into consideration households with a car, the relative loss is largest for households with a low economic standard.</p>
<p>Households in more sparsely-populated parts of the country lose more since car ownership is greater and the economic standard is lower.</p>
<h2>Pension contributions</h2>
<p>The Commission proposes that compensation for loss of income from motor insurance should be pensionable. This leads evidently to an increase in payment of pension contributions. The Commission reports computations of the estimated payments during the years 2010–2050. By way of contrast, a report is made for the same period of computed in-payments of pension contributions if the rules are not changed.</p>
<p>When compensation from motor insurance is made pensionable this will lead to reduced tax revenue for the state. This is based on the pension contribution paid by the individual giving rise to a tax deduction corresponding to the contribution.</p>
<p>In the long run, the increased in-payment will also lead to increased disbursements from the pension system.</p>
<h2>Total saving in the economy</h2>
<p>The reform will have an impact on total saving in the economy. In broad outline, two offsetting effects can be expected. Saving increases as a result of the increased provisions required by motor insurance. Saving can decrease slightly due to the higher price of the motor insurance premium.</p>
<p>The overall effect in the long term is probably increased saving in the economy.</p>
<h2>Changes in behaviour</h2>
<p>The reform will probably lead to changed behaviour both on the part of the insurance companies and by road users.</p>
<p>With the aid of statistical analysis, the Commission has studied social and economic conditions for the individuals in possession of uninsured vehicles. This analysis indicates that it is primarily social conditions that explain the occurrence of uninsured vehicles. The Commission therefore does not expect that the number of uninsured vehicles to increase significantly due to the reform.</p>
<p>The Commission also makes the assessment that the reform, through higher premiums, can lead to a development towards more individualised premium setting, perhaps even more based on the individual’s conduct in traffic. This development should have a favourable impact on road safety.</p>
<p>Through the reform, which leads to an integrated responsibility for motor insurance, as regards compensation for loss of income, the motor insurance companies will have a considerably better incentive than at present to work for the return to work of traffic accident victims.</p>
<h2>Other consequences</h2>
<p>As regards other consequences, the Commission states initially that the public commitment decreases. The proposals have no consequences for municipal self-government. Undesirable behavi- our, for example in the form of ownership through a front may increase. There will be some increase in costs for public activities which depend on vehicles. In particular, smaller companies in the transport sector will have minor increases in their costs. It is</p>
<p>probable that premiums will increase more for men than for women. The reform may have some negative impact on inte- gration to the extent that work or ownership of companies in the transport sector is an important source of income for newly- arrived immigrants. The proposals have no consequences for personal integrity.</p>
