<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes amendments to the Act concerning the Ethical Review of Research Involving Humans (2003:460), the Ethical Review Act. To clarify the scope of this Act, some changes are made to the basic definitions of “research” and “research principal”. The Inquiry recommends removing the “student exemption” for degree projects carried out within the framework of higher education at basic or advanced level. Such projects should thus undergo ethical review if they fall within the purview of the Act. However, under the</p>
<p>Inquiry’s proposal, a student project should be reviewed in terms of research ethics by a specific body at the higher education institution (HEI) before ethical approval is sought from an ethical review board.</p>
<p>The Inquiry recommends specifying in the Ethical Review Act what the research principal is responsible for, and how this responsibility is divided in cases where two or more research principals participate in a single project. A research principal’s management must have overall responsibility for ensuring that routines and instructions on ethical testing of research involving humans are applied in the work.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s report proposes clarification and extension of the Central Ethical Review Board’s supervisory responsibility.</p>
<p>Certain changes in criminal liability, pursuant to the Ethical Review Act, are also proposed. The maximum sentence for wilfully breaking the law is raised to two years’ imprisonment, which means that the period of limitation will be five years instead of two as it is now. Criminal liability for breaches resulting from gross negligence is also recommended, but with a lower range of punishment.</p>
<p>Under the Inquiry’s proposal, retrospective ethical review should be possible in some cases. This applies where a research activity referred to in Sections 3–5 of the Ethical Review Act relates to health and medical services and it would threaten the patient’s life or health to await the ethical review.</p>
<p>Making knowledge of the Ethical Review Act a compulsory component of research education at HEIs is also proposed.</p>
<p>The Inquiry recommends expanding and clarifying the provision in Chapter 5, Section 3 of the Health and Medical Services Act (2017:30) concerning ethical review of certain diagnostic and treatment methods.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, the new rules will enter into force on 1 January 2019.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>In the Ethical Review Act, research refers to experimental or theoretical scientific work to obtain new knowledge, and to development work on a scientific basis, but not to work performed within the framework of higher education at basic or advanced level.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s assignment was to review the definition of research and assess whether the purview of the Ethical Review Act is unequivocal and comprehensive enough to afford satisfactory protection for individuals participating in research (“research subjects”). The Inquiry’s remit has included proposing a way of ensuring that research that originates in health and medical services, but later forms the basis of scientific projects, undergoes ethical review before these studies are commenced. The Inquiry was also assigned to assess whether the definition of the term “research” in the Ethical Review Act should be extended to include projects carried out within the framework of higher education at basic or advanced level.</p>
<p>The term “research” refers here to experimental or theoretical scientific work and scientific studies conducted by means of observation, if the work or studies take place to obtain new knowledge, and also to development work on a scientific basis. This definition clarifies the fact that the Ethical Review Act does not apply only to research involving experiments. Observational studies of various kinds should also fall within the purview of the Act. Here, “observational studies” refers to studies in which relationships among various variables are examined without the researcher influencing the process.</p>
<p>Such research can be carried out using various types of methods, such as observation, interviews, questionnaire surveys or compilation of personal data from various registers.</p>
<p>Under current regulations, the Ethical Review Act does not apply to work carried out within the framework of higher education at basic or advanced level (the student exemption). The Inquiry notes that student projects can sometimes meet the requisites laid down in the Ethical Review Act, and that to be allowed to proceed, if they had been carried out in other contexts, they would have required approval following ethical review. The starting point should be to maintain the protection for the human research subjects, regardless of who does the work. The Inquiry therefore judges that the exemption for projects carried out within the framework of higher education at basic or advanced level should be removed.</p>
<p>This proposal means that student projects that constitute research and fall within the purview of the Act must undergo ethical review. According to the Inquiry’s assessment, this procedure may involve an increased number of matters for the regional boards to deal with, and student projects “displacing” other research projects. The Inquiry therefore recommends that in cases where research is to be conducted solely by one or more students within the framework of higher education at basic or advanced level, and where the work is to be conducted at state HEIs, the work should be examined from a research ethical perspective by a specific body at the HEI before ethical approval is sought. This body’s examination may not supersede the review by a regional ethical review board, but help to ensure that only research projects that may be suitably conducted by students are passed on for a formal review under the Ethical Review Act.</p>
<p>Same secrecy provisions should apply to information on individuals personal or economic circumstances in in the specific body as in operations concerning ethical review and supervision according to the Ethical Review Act. Chapter 24, Section 3 of the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400) should apply also to examination according to the Ethical Review Act.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s contacts with representatives of health and medical services, and of research, some have stated that the uncertainty that exists in some cases regarding the Ethical Review Act’s definition of “research” and the demarcation between research and related activities is, in many cases, not due to unclear points in the Act. The difficulty of determining what research requires approval is, instead, caused by the generally low level of knowledge about the Ethical Review Act, or by ethical review questions not being given sufficient attention. Accordingly, the Inquiry’s assessment is that there should be greater overall awareness of the Ethical Review Act and knowledge of when it is to be applied. The Inquiry therefore recommends adding to the conditions for obtaining a PhD degree a requirement that the PhD student must demonstrate knowledge of relevant statutes concerning ethical review of research involving humans.</p>
<h2>Research principal</h2>
<p>Applications for ethical review of research must be submitted by the research principals concerned. Under the Ethical Review Act, a research principal is a central government agency, or a natural or legal person, in whose activities the research is conducted (Sections 2 and 23).</p>
<p>Under the Inquiry’s terms of reference, it may be unclear in individual cases who bears responsibility as research principal. When research is carried out by employees of more than one principal simultaneously it may, for example, be unclear which activities the research is conducted in, and thus who is the research principal. The</p>
<p>Inquiry’s remit includes reviewing the definition of ‘research principal’ in the Ethical Review Act.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the premise should continue to be that the research principal is the agency or person in whose activities the research is conducted. If a single research project is carried out in the activity under the aegis of more than one principal, each of them is responsible for the part of the research (the research actions) carried out within the principal’s own activities.</p>
<p>A modification of the definition of “research principal” is proposed, so that research principal refers to one or more central government agencies, or natural or legal persons, in whose activities the research is conducted. In this way, it is stressed that research is often conducted in cooperation among two or more principals.</p>
<p>The Inquiry further recommends defining the research principal’s responsibilities explicitly in two provisions of the Ethical Review Act. The first provision states initially that the research principal is responsible for ensuring that research referred to in Sections 3–5 that is conducted under the research principal’s aegis does not proceed without approval under Section 6. It then states that the research principal is responsible, regarding the above-mentioned research, for ensuring its compliance with conditions imposed in connection with approval following ethical review. The Inquiry’s proposal means that representatives of a research principal who disregards this responsibility may incur criminal liability pursuant to Section 38 of the Ethical Review Act. Responsibility lies primarily with the management of the legal person, but can be delegated. For valid delegation, it must be clear who, in various respects, is responsible for compliance with the Ethical Review Act provisions. Another requirement is that the person to whom responsibility has been delegated must have the necessary powers to deal with the task. If no clear delegation has taken place, responsibility remains at the level immediately above.</p>
<p>The second provision states that the research principal is responsible for applying for ethical review of research that is carried out under the principal’s aegis. This provision also regulates the division of responsibilities when two or more research principals participate in a single research project. In such cases, the research principals must jointly appoint a research principal to bear primary responsibility for the project. The research principal appointed is responsible for submitting a joint application for ethical review of the research project in its entirety, and for informing the other research principals of the Ethical Review Board’s decision.</p>
<h2>Central Ethical Review Board’s supervision</h2>
<p>The Central Ethical Review Board supervises compliance with the Ethical Review Act and regulations issued pursuant to the Act. However, this does not apply to the extent that this supervision falls within another public agency’s area of responsibility (Section 34 of the Ethical Review Act). In the legislative history of the Ethical Review Act, it is stated that the research in need of supervision under the Act is the research not covered by the supervisory responsibility already borne by (currently) the Swedish Health and Social Care Inspectorate (IVO), the Swedish Medical Products Agency and the Swedish Data Protection Authority. The research remaining to be supervised includes medical and psychological basic research conducted under the aegis of a principal other than a care provider, for example in connection with the departments of medicine at the HEIs (Govt. Bill 2002/03:50, pp. 163 and 206). Accordingly, there is a smaller area remaining to be supervised.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s terms of reference state that the limitation on the Central Ethical Review Board’s supervisory responsibilities described in the legislative history of the Ethical Review Act have meant that supervision of research conducted within the framework of, for example, health and medical services is assumed to be performed by agencies other than the Board. The Board has developed a practice whereby certain supervisory matters are transferred to other agencies. Furthermore, the Inquiry on supervision of personal data privacy (SOU 2016:65) notes that the dividing line, in terms of responsibility for supervision, between the Data Protection Authority and the Central Ethical Review Board has, to some extent, been perceived as unclear. In some cases, the Inquiry finds, this has meant that neither of these agencies have considered themselves able to carry out supervision (report of the Inquiry cited above, pp. 194 and 195).</p>
<p>The Inquiry was assigned to submit proposals that clarify the</p>
<p>Central Ethical Review Board’s supervisory responsibility.</p>
<p>The survey carried out by this Inquiry, too, shows that the Central Ethical Review Board and the Data Protection Authority do not agree on where to draw the line between the two agencies’ supervisory responsibilities regarding research involving processing of personal data. It has not emerged that there are demarcation problems regarding the Central Ethical Review Board’s supervisory responsibility in relation to that of IVO or the Medical Products Agency.</p>
<p>This Inquiry’s assessment is that the Central Ethical Review</p>
<p>Board should supervise compliance with the Ethical Review Act and regulations issued pursuant to this Act, regardless of the activities to be reviewed. The approach considered most effective is to concentrate in a single agency responsibility for all issues relating to interpretation and application of the Ethical Review Act. This also means a clear division of responsibilities so that all supervision of compliance with the Ethical Review Act, and with regulations issued under the Act, is exercised by the Central Ethical Review Board.</p>
<p>The fundamental questions for the Central Ethical Review Board should be whether activities in question constitute “research” under the Ethical Review Act and, if so, whether the research is of the kind covered by the law’s ethical review requirements. If the answer to these questions is in the affirmative, the activities fall within the Board’s supervisory remit. The fact that these activities are also subject to another supervisory agency’s responsibility does not prevent the Central Ethical Review Board from reviewing an activity on the basis of the Ethical Review Act’s provisions.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that an explicit statement on the scope of the Central Ethical Review Board’s supervisory responsibility be inserted in Section 34 of the Ethical Review Act. This provision states that the Board supervises compliance with the rule that the research specified in Sections 3–5 of the Ethical Review Act may not be conducted without approval pursuant to Sections 6 and 6a. It also supervises compliance with the Ethical Review Act; regulations issued pursuant to this Act; and conditions announced in connection with approval following ethical review. In addition, the Inquiry also recommends repealing the provision whereby the Central Ethical Review Board does not exercise supervision in so far as this supervision falls within another agency’s area of responsibility.</p>
<p>Under the Central Ethical Review Board’s supervision, issues may arise that fall within another agency’s area of responsibility. The</p>
<p>Board may then need to consult, or refer the issues on a consultation basis to, another agency. The Inquiry takes the view that cooperation between the agencies, through consultation and referral, is already an option pursuant to the provisions of the Swedish Administrative Procedure Act and that there is no need for further regulation in this regard.</p>
<h2>Overview of penal provisions in the Ethical Review Act</h2>
<p>A person who deliberately violates the provisions of Section 6 of the Ethical Review Act whereby research may be conducted only if it has been approved in an ethical review, or who violates a condition issued pursuant to an approval, is to be sentenced to a fine or imprisonment for no more than six months. Criminal responsibility is not imposed in petty cases, or if the offence is punishable under a provision in another statute (Section 38).</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s terms of reference state that research carried out without approval may include research methods that entail risk of injury to a research subject or of encroachment on someone’s privacy. Particularly vulnerable patients may be exposed to very high health risks by research being conducted without approval. It is therefore questionable whether the range of punishment for violations of the Ethical Review Act provides sufficient scope for balanced consideration of the gravity of the most reprehensible acts.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit has included reviewing the range of punishment for breaches of the Ethical Review Act.</p>
<p>Under current regulations, there is criminal liability for a person who violates Section 6, or in other words the person performing the actual research (practical research work) without prior approval. As stated above, the Inquiry proposes that representatives of a research principal who disregards the responsibility stated in Section 23 may incur criminal liability pursuant to Section 38 of the Ethical Review Act. Criminal liability for the research principal does not exclude the possibility that the individual researcher who performs the research may also be punished. This may happen if, for example, the researcher contravenes the research principal’s instructions or otherwise, wilfully or through gross negligence, conducts research in violation of the Ethical Review Act.</p>
<p>The Inquiry notes that breaches of the Ethical Review Act may take very different forms, and that their penal value may vary widely. The current penal latitude does not reflect existing differences, and does not cover the more serious cases. The Inquiry proposes that the maximum sentence for wilful offences be increased to two years’ imprisonment. The purpose of this is for the range of punishment to allow scope for a proportional penalty for serious contraventions of the Ethical Review Act as well. Circumstances that raise the penal value are, for example, that research has been conducted over a long period or repeatedly without ethical permission, or that a large number of human research subjects have been involved. It may also be a matter of research conducted without ethical permission and resulting in the research subjects’ exposure to major risks of detriment – physical, psychological or in terms of personal integrity.</p>
<p>The Inquiry recommends introducing criminal liability for gross negligence as well. The range of punishment is then fines or imprisonment for at most six months. Criminal liability may be imposed for reckless disregard of statutory law if, for example, a representative of the research principal entirely fails to gain control of what goes on at a workplace or gravely neglects the supervision of the organisation.</p>
<p>In petty cases, as to date, no criminal responsibility is imposed. The Inquiry proposes that the penal provision in the Ethical</p>
<p>Review Act should no longer be subsidiary in relation to penal provisions in other statutes. This means that criminal liability under the Ethical Review Act can be imposed when an action fully or partially meets the necessary condition for another offence as well.</p>
<h2>Activities in boundary area between clinical research and healthcare</h2>
<p>In the Swedish Health and Medical Services Act (2017:30), “health and medical services” refers to measures to prevent, examine and treat diseases and injuries by medical means. Health and medical services must be provided in such a way as to meet the requirements for good care. Under the Swedish Patient Safety Act (2010:659), health professionals must perform their work in accordance with science and proven experience. A patient must be given expert, considerate healthcare that meets these requirements. The Swedish Patient Act (2014:821), too, states that the patient must benefit from specialist, caring health and medical services of high quality that correspond to science and proven experience.</p>
<p>Under the Inquiry’s terms of reference, the requirement that care measures must be based on science and proven experience does not exclude the application of some clinical development efforts in the care services. The terms of reference state that it is not always entirely clear how the existing regulations apply to activities in the boundary area between health and clinical research. The Inquiry was to clarify the rules that apply, and should apply, to the clinical development taking place in the boundary area between healthcare and clinical research. The Inquiry was also to propose how closer cooperation can be achieved between the agencies working in the areas of healthcare and clinical research and the agencies that exercise supervision over the sector.</p>
<p>The Inquiry notes that the main rule, simply expressed, is that health and medical services are to be conducted in accordance with science and proven experience and that the only statutory exception to this principle is necessity (jus necessitatis), which is expressed in the Penal Code. However, it is unclear how far this is applicable in the healthcare sector. The principle that the work must be conducted on the basis of science and proven experience does not apply to clinical research. This research may be conducted only if it has been approved in an ethical review. It may thus be noted that there is no “grey area”, in a strictly legal sense, between healthcare and clinical research. In cases where a treatment, method or other measure that is unsupported by science or proven experience is implemented or undertaken in the health and medical services it can, if it meets the requisites laid down in the Ethical Review Act, be defined as research according to the act. Such activities require ethical approval to be allowed to proceed. Nonetheless, this does not rule out the possibility that it may also involve health or medical services.</p>
<p>As soon as a measure is taken that lacks support in science and proven experience, it must be deemed to be research, and the provisions of the Ethical Review Act become applicable. This approach is the best guarantee for individuals’ health and privacy. Research may be approved under the Ethical Review Act only if the risks it may entail for the health, safety and personal privacy of human research subjects are outweighed by its scientific value. People’s welfare must be given precedence over the needs of society and science. The application of an unproven method in the healthcare sector must take place within the framework of a research project that has to undergo ethical review before it can start.</p>
<p>The Inquiry notes that in health and medical services, situations may arise where there is no established method but measures must nonetheless be taken immediately or relatively promptly. There is not always scope for formulating a research project and applying for ethical review. For such situations, there should be scope for the ethical review to take place retrospectively instead. This makes it feasible to take emergency or urgent measures without neglecting the requirement of ethical review.</p>
<p>If the situation is so acute that a measure must be taken immediately, the starting point should be that the application for ethical review must be drawn up and submitted as soon as possible after the measure has been taken. In situations where there is enough time to submit an application, but not to wait for a decision from the ethical review board, the urgent action should be taken before a decision on the ethical issue has been made.</p>
<p>The Inquiry recommends inserting in the Ethical Review Act a provision stating that a research measure referred to in the Ethical Review Act may, if it is associated with healthcare and if it would seriously threaten the patient’s life or health to await the ethical review, be implemented although it has not been ethically reviewed. In such cases, the ethical review must be done retrospectively. If the ethical review has not been applied for, it should be done promptly after the measure has been taken.</p>
<p>Sections 13–22 of the Ethical Review Act contain specific provisions regarding information given to, and consent obtained from, the human research subject. The provisions should also apply to research that undergoes retrospective ethical review, unless it is impeded by the emergency nature of the measure or for some other reason.</p>
<p>The option of a retrospective review does not apply in clinical drug trials.</p>
<p>It should not, in the Inquiry’s judgement, be possible for conduct of research connected with healthcare provided to ward off a danger that acutely and severely threatens a person’s life or health to result in criminal responsibility under the Ethical Review Act. An incorrect assessment of how urgent a situation is should also, in the great majority of cases, fall outside the punishable category of offences.</p>
<h2>Ethical review of new methods in healthcare</h2>
<p>Under Chapter 5, Section 3 of the Health and Medical Services Act, before a new diagnostic or treatment method that may have a bearing on human dignity and privacy begins to be applied in healthcare, the care provider must ensure that the method has been assessed from individual and socioethical aspects. The purpose is to ensure that the ethical aspects of new diagnostic and treatment methods are assessed before these methods are put into practice in health and medical services .  The Inquiry was assigned to propose how Chapter 5, Section 3 of the Health and Medical Services Act, which has not had the intended impact in practice, can be clarified.</p>
<p>The Inquiry recommends expanding and clarifying the provision in Chapter 5, Section 3 of the Act. The provision should be amended in such a way that the word “new” is removed. Instead, it is stated that the assessment should be made before a diagnostic or treatment method that may have a bearing on human dignity and privacy begins to be applied in a care provider’s activities. Here, the purpose is to clarify that the crux is whether the diagnostic or treatment method has been used previously in the current care provider’s activities or not, and an assessment should be made even if the method is, in general, not new.</p>
<p>According to the Inquiry’s proposal, the assessment should be carried out by a specific body. This means that the assessment must be done in consultation among individuals who have the necessary expertise to ensure that the assessment meets the legal requirements. Moreover, the body must have its own place in the care provider’s organisation and may not be put together ad hoc when needed.</p>
<p>The Act should specify what is meant by the statement that a diagnostic or treatment method may have a bearing on human dignity and privacy. An assessment is called for regarding methods that touch on existential issues. Examples are reproduction technology and foetal diagnostics; methods derived from biotechnology, such as genetic investigations and analyses, gene therapy and stem-cell research; and methods that may affect brain function. The provision is not exhaustive: an assessment may also relate to other methods concerning similar ethical issues, including those that may come to the fore in the future as new research findings emerge.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a provision that specifies what is meant by an“assessment” under Section 3. This assessment includes identifying those the method concerns, directly or indirectly; defining precisely what consequences various alternative methods have; describing the interests of those affected in the short and long term; highlighting conflicts of interest and attempting to resolve them according to stated ethical principles; and analysing the rights and obligations, in various situations, of the stakeholders involved. The assessment and the reasons for it should be documented, which means there must be some form of documentation showing that an assessment was carried out, and how this was done. The intention is not to extend the assessment requirement beyond what already applies, but to clarify which minimum requirements are imposed on the quality and scope of the ethical assessment.</p>
<p>In cases where the care provider judges that the method should undergo an in-depth analysis or be assessed at national level, the Inquiry recommends allowing the care provider to defer the question to a public agency with overarching national responsibility. The Government should decide which agency is to bear this responsibility.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional regulations</h2>
<p>The date proposed for the entry into force of these amendments is 1 January 2019. The changes in the Ethical Review Act should, however, not apply to research starting before the entry into force of the act.</p>
