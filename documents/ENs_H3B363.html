<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The task of the Inquiry has been to analyse the need for legislative amendments to ensure that Sweden lives up to the obligations of criminal law provisions to prevent and combat terrorism under United Nations Security Council Resolution 2178 (2014).</p>
<p>The task has also included determining whether Sweden’s criminal law provisions to prevent and combat the financing of terrorism meet the obligations set out by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).</p>
<p>The remit has also included presenting proposals for any necessary legislative amendments.</p>
<h2>Background information to the remit</h2>
<p>The resolution was adopted by the United Nations Security Council on 24 September 2014, in accordance with Chapter VII of the UN Charter. The decision thereby taken by the Security Council is legally binding for all Member States.</p>
<p>The resolution reaffirms that terrorism in all forms is a threat to international peace and security. Further, grave concern is expressed over the acute and growing threat posed by individuals who travel to a State other than their States of residence for the purpose of participating in terrorist acts or terrorist training, including in connection with armed conflict. According to the resolution, they contribute to the intensity, duration and intractability of conflicts. The individuals may also pose a serious threat to their States of origin, the States they transit and the States to which they travel.</p>
<p>Paragraph 6 of the resolution contains obligations for Sweden to make punishable travel or attempt to travel for the purpose of perpetration, planning, or preparation of, participation in terrorist acts, or the providing or receiving of terrorist training. Criminal liability will apply to travel by Swedish citizens or from Sweden to a State other than their States of residence or nationality (paragraph 6 a). Such travel will hereinafter be referred to as terrorist travel. Further, the resolution requires that wilful organisation or other facilitation, including acts of recruitment, of terrorist travel be made punishable if committed by Swedish citizens or in Sweden (paragraph 6 c). Finally, the wilful provision or collection, directly or indirectly, of funds by Swedish citizens or in Sweden with the intention that the funds should be used, or in the knowledge that they are to be used, to finance terrorist travel, will be made punishable (paragraph 6 b).</p>
<p>In addition, in view of its membership of FATF, Sweden has an obligation to criminalise the financing of terrorism. In Sweden, criminal law provisions on the financing of terrorism are found in the Act on Criminal Responsibility for the Financing of Particularly Serious Crime in Certain Cases (2002:444), the Financing Act for short. In an evaluation conducted by the FATF in 2006, Swedish legislation in the field was generally considered to be compatible with the organisation’s recommendations. However, the fact that criminal responsibility does not expressly include wilful collection or provision of funds or other property with the intention that they should be used (regardless of the purpose) by a terrorist organisation or an individual terrorist has been considered a shortcoming in relation to the obligations set out in Recommendation 5.</p>
<h2>The need for legislative amendments in light of the resolution and FATF’s Recommendation 5</h2>
<p>Resolution</p>
<p>Swedish law does not have any penal provisions that directly target travel which, according to the obligations under the resolution, should constitute a criminal offence. On the other hand, nonindependent types of crime, mainly preparation and conspiracy to commit terrorist offences, may to some extent apply to acts that are punishable under the resolution.</p>
<p>A person who receives money with the intention of financing travel that constitutes a step or a prerequisite for carrying out a terrorist offence, such as travel to the crime scene, may in some cases be sentenced to preparation to commit a terrorist offence under Chapter 23, Section 2, first paragraph of the Penal Code. However, this does not apply to travel with the intention to plan or prepare a terrorist offence or provide or receive terrorism training.</p>
<p>Responsibility for conspiracy may also be relevant in some cases under Chapter 23, Section 2, second paragraph of the Penal Code. Conspiracy requires that someone, in collusion with another, decides to commit a crime, offers to execute it or seeks to incite another to do so. However, for criminal liability to apply, at least two individuals must be involved, which is not always the case with regard to terrorist travel. Neither is it possible to apply the conspiracy provision in cases of travel with the intention to plan or prepare a terrorist offence or for travel with the intention to provide or receive terrorist training.</p>
<p>Organisation and other facilitation of terrorist travel might almost be considered as a form of participation in such travel. Under the general participation provisions in Chapter 23, Section 4 of the Penal Code, a person who promotes travel, i.e. takes measures to facilitate or at least that are intended to facilitate travel, may also be sentenced for the crime, provided the travel as such is punishable as an independent offence or as an attempt, preparation or conspiracy to commit a criminal offence. Criminal responsibility for such acts therefore depends on whether the travel is punishable.</p>
<p>Finally, as regards the resolution’s obligation that financing of terrorist travel is to constitute a criminal offence, this is in part fulfilled through the provision on financing of particularly serious crimes in Section 3 in the Financing Act. While this provision requires that the financing is intended for particularly serious crime, which terrorist travel as such does not constitute, those who collect or receive money or other property with the intention of financing travel that constitutes a step or a prerequisite for carrying out such a criminal offence may in some cases still be subject to sentencing. However, this only applies to financing of travel with the intention to commit or participate in particularly serious crime, not travel with the intention to prepare or plan such criminal offences, or provide or receive training. Under corresponding limited conditions, terrorist travel financing can constitute preparation to commit terrorist offences.</p>
<p>In summary, acts that should be punishable according to the resolution should to some extent already be punishable. However, legislative measures are needed for Swedish law to fully conform to the obligations under the resolution.</p>
<p>FATF’s Recommendation 5</p>
<p>The recommendation sets forth obligations to criminalise the financing of terrorist acts, individual terrorists and terrorist organisations. According to the recommendation, the prohibition of financing of individual terrorists and terrorist organisations should apply, regardless of the purpose of the financing.</p>
<p>The Financing Act confines the punishable area to financing with the intention that the property should be used, or in the knowledge that it is intended to be used, for the purpose of committing a particularly serious crime. Hence, criminal liability requires that the act be committed at least in the knowledge that the property is intended to be used to commit such a crime.</p>
<p>Legislative measures are needed for Swedish law to fulfil the obligation under the recommendation that, regardless of their purpose, financing of individual terrorists and terrorist organisations is to be punishable.</p>
<h2>A new penal provision for receiving training for particularly serious crimes</h2>
<p>Section 5 (2010:299) of the Act on Criminal Responsibility for Public Provocation, Recruitment and Training concerning Terrorist Offences and other Particularly Serious Crimes, Recruitment Act for short, makes punishable offences by a person who trains others, with the intent to commit particularly serious crimes, by providing instruction in the making or use of explosives, weapons or noxious or hazardous substances that are particularly likely to be used in particularly serious crimes, or in other methods or techniques that are particularly intended for such purpose. However, there is no corresponding penal provision for those receiving such training.</p>
<p>Receiving terrorist training is a punishable offence in most Nordic countries. The additional protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism, negotiated in spring 2015, sets forth a requirement that Member States criminalise this act. The resolution’s requirement that travel for the purpose of providing or receiving terrorist training should be punishable also implies that receiving training as such should be punishable. The Swedish Security Service has also expressed the view that such criminalisation could be important in its crime prevention work. There is therefore reason to define as a criminal offence the receiving of training for the purpose of committing particularly serious crime.</p>
<p>To this end, we propose the addition of a new penal provision to the Recruitment Act that covers individuals who receive such instructions for particularly serious crime, the provision of which is currently punishable, if the instructions are received with the intention of using them for such crime. The instructions shall also be provided for the specific purpose of promoting particularly serious crime. Criminal liability requires that pupil and teacher have some form of contact with each other. This means that criminal liability does not include ‘independent learning’, for instance when a person absorbs information freely accessible on the internet. Nor does criminal liability include training provided by a legitimate operation, such as military service or a shooting club, even if the pupil intends to use the training to commit particularly serious crime.</p>
<p>The proposed scale of penalties is imprisonment for at most two years. If the crime is serious, a sentence of imprisonment for at least six months and at most six years may be imposed.</p>
<h2>New penal provisions for terrorist travel</h2>
<p>For Swedish law to fulfil the obligations set forth in the resolution, the introduction is proposed of a new penal provision for terrorist travel in the Recruitment Act. Under the provision, it will be possible to sentence individuals who travel to a State other than their State of nationality with the intention of committing or preparing particularly serious crime or providing or receiving training for particularly serious crime. This means that the travel as such becomes punishable, provided it is undertaken for one of the stated intentions. The offence is brought to completion once travel commences, which means that the traveller need not have left the country or their place of residence. The scale of penalties for the offence is imprisonment for at most two years.</p>
<p>Travel to their states of nationality does not impose criminal liability; the provision would otherwise conflict with the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Instrument of Government.</p>
<p>There is no proposal to criminalise attempts as such at terrorist travel. This is not necessary, since the offence is committed once travel commences.</p>
<p>The proposal for a new penal provision for terrorist travel means that those who organise, facilitate or recruit for the purpose of terrorist travel may be sentenced for participation in such an offence under the general participation provisions in Chapter 23, Section 4 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>It is proposed that a new penal provision be introduced in the Financing Act to also make the financing of terrorist travel punishable. A person who collects, provides or receives funds or other property with the intention that the property should be used, or in the knowledge that it is intended to be used for the purpose of such travel, may be sentenced to imprisonment for at most two years.</p>
<h2>A new penal provision for financing of terrorism</h2>
<p>For Swedish law to live up to its commitments in relation to FATF, it is proposed that a new penal provision for terrorist financing be introduced in the Financing Act. The current financing offence contained in Section 3 will be supplemented by also subjecting to penalty those who collect, provide or receive funds or other property in the knowledge that it is intended for a person or group of people who commit, attempt to commit, prepare, or participate in particularly serious crime. Criminal responsibility in these cases does not require that the funds or property are intended to be used for particularly serious crime, which is a requirement under current financing offences. Instead, the punishable area is confined by the recipient of the financing.</p>
<p>Exceptions from the punishable area are made in petty cases, which are acts that do not appear to be punishable.</p>
<p>The proposed scale of penalties for ordinary offences is imprisonment for at most two years.</p>
<h2>Greater scope for secret coercive measures</h2>
<p>The report contains proposals for several new penal provisions. It is proposed that receiving training for particularly serious crime, terrorist travel, financing of such travel and financing of a person or group of people who commit, attempt to commit, prepare or participate in particularly serious crime should constitute criminal offences. The ultimate aim of the proposed criminalisation is to prevent terrorist offences or other particularly serious crime from taking place. The offences will thereby lie within the Swedish Security Service’s sphere of responsibility and may fall into the category of crime that is a particular threat to society that can threaten critical public functions. There are obvious similarities with the offences, such as recruitment for and financing of particularly serious crimes, for which there is currently scope for using secret coercive measures within the framework of preliminary investigations, although the scale of penalties does not provide for this. Possibilities to resort to secret coercive measures should be the same as for the criminal offences being proposed.</p>
<p>It is therefore proposed that secret covert interception and surveillance of electronic communications and covert camera surveillance should be allowed to be used for preliminary investigations for all such criminal offences. The exemption from duty of notification in Chapter 27, Section 33 of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure should also apply.</p>
<p>For the proposed criminal offences of receiving training for particularly serious crime and financing of a person or group of people who commit, attempt to commit, prepare or participate in such offences, it is further proposed if they are considered to be gross offences, that it should be possible to use, as set forth in the Act on Measures to Prevent Certain Particularly Serious Crimes (2007:979), secret coercive measures for preventive purposes even if a preliminary investigation has not been opened. The Act on Acquiring Information about Electronic Communication in the Law Enforcements Agencies Intelligence Activities should also be applicable to these crimes.</p>
