<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The report contains a proposal for a law governing the incorporation of Commission Directive 80/723/EEC of June 25, 1980 on the transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings as well as on financial transparancy within certain undertakings, amended most recently through Directive 2000/52/EC, the so-called Transparency Directive.</p>
<p>One of the implications of the proposal is that undertakings that carry on reserved operations, i.e. protected against competition, alongside other commercial operations, are required to produce separate accounts for these two areas. Also included in the law are the directive's older provisions that financial relations between public authorities and public undertakings should be shown clearly in so-called open accounts. The law also contains instructions regarding information to be sent to the Commission each year regarding public manufacturing undertakings.</p>
<p>According to the proposal, both the open accounts and the separate accounts should be reviewed by the undertakings auditor or another expert. The Swedish Competition Authority shall monitor the undertakingÂ´s compliance with the new rules. The Competition Authority shall have the authority to require additional details concerning the open accounts and the separate accounts, as well as such additional financial information about undertakings, which the European Commission could require when applying competition rules.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the new law takes legal effect on, and is applied from, July 1, 2004.</p>
