<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Terms of Reference for the Committee</h2>
<p>According to the Terms of Reference, the Committee shall analyse certain issues relating to the efficiency of the current system of rules to combat violations of the competition legislation’s prohibition of collaboration between undertakings to restrain competition (anticompetitive co-operation) and abuse of dominant position. The Committee shall propose the changes to the system of rules that are considered justified.</p>
<p>The task of the Committee includes considering the need of and the preconditions for rules relating to</p>
<p>• reduction of the competition damage penalty (konkurrenskadeavgift also sometimes referred to as an administrative fine) for undertakings that reveal restraints to competition,</p>
<p>• reinforcement of secrecy protection for information concerning cartel collaboration or other restraints to competition and concerning the person who provided the information about such circumstances,</p>
<p>• limitation to or impediments for joint board representation in competing undertakings, and</p>
<p>• the right of the winning party to indemnity for litigation costs.</p>
<p>The assignment also includes investigating</p>
<p>• whether existing rules for the information obligation and secrecy satisfy the need of a purposeful exchange of information between the Swedish Competition Authority (Konkurrensverket) and competition authorities in other countries for efficient competition compliance work,</p>
<p>• whether it is necessary and is suitable that the Swedish Competition Authority gathers information on behalf of a foreign competition authority,</p>
<p>• whether experiences in the application of the law or other circumstances now give cause for another position to be adopted than hitherto on matters concerning the criminalisation of prohibition rules in the Competition Act and also as regards dissolution of concentrations of undertakings, and</p>
<p>• whether the current rules provide small enterprises that are exposed for competition restraints by other undertakings sufficient opportunities to eliminate such violation.</p>
<p>The Committee shall deal with issues arising taking into account the EC law aspects.</p>
<p>The Committee, on 20 June 2001, submitted a separate Memorandum to Minister Ulrika Messing concerning investigation secrecy, see Appendix 2.</p>
<p>The report now submitted deals with issues concerning reduction of the competition damage penalty, the criminalisation of violations of the competition legislation, secrecy protection for information providers (so-called whistle blowers), exchange of information between the Competition Authority and competition authorities in other countries and also the gathering of information on behalf of foreign competition authorities.</p>
<p>The remaining issues will be dealt with in the final report of the Committee.</p>
<h2>Structure of the report</h2>
<p>Chapter 2  contains an outline description of the relevant substantive and procedural provisions of EC Law, Swedish law and the laws of other Member States in the EU, the USA and Canada. Chapter 3  deals with the issue of reduction and waiver of the competition damage penalty. The current Swedish legislation on the matter is compared with the corresponding system of rules in the USA and Canada and also with that applicable in other countries within the EEA area. The section of the Chapter dealing with deliberations includes a discussion of the purpose and functions of programmes for reduction or a waiver of sanctions, and also concerning the principles that should apply for any Swedish system. In this section the Committee also adopts a position on whether rules should be introduced concerning reduction or a waiver of the competition damage penalty, what a programme for reduction or a waiver should contain and also what rules of procedure should apply.</p>
<p>In Chapter 4  the Committee deals with the issue of whether violations of the competition legislation should be criminalised. Arguments for and against criminalisation are discussed in this Chapter.</p>
<p>The issue of whether a secrecy rule should be introduced to protect informants and persons providing information is included in Chapter 5.  Furthermore, Chapter 5 also deals with issues concerning exchange of information and collaboration between the Competition Authority and the competition authorities in other countries.</p>
<p>In Chapter 6  the Committee raises the issue of litigation costs. Issues related to the entering into force of the proposed amendments are presented in Chapter 7.</p>
<p>The consequences of the Committee’s proposals are reported in</p>
<p>Chapter 8.</p>
<p>The commentary on the statutory wording is contained in Chapter 9.</p>
<h2>The deliberations and proposals of the Committee</h2>
<p>The Committee has analysed, from various viewpoints, the preconditions for the introduction of a programme for reduction or waiver of the competition damage penalty . There are programmes of a corresponding kind ( leniency, amnesty, immunity ) in, among other countries, the USA and Canada, but are also applied by the EC Commission and also in Great Britain and Germany. The issue of introducing a corresponding programme is also being discussed in other countries within the EEA area. These programmes are directed at participants in unlawful cartels who expose the cartel to the competition authority being allowed to avoid a sanction for their participation in the cartel or to have the sanction reduced. The intention is that the members of the cartel should therefore be given an incitement to expose the cartel. The effect would be that it will be easier for the competition authorities to investigate cartels. The programmes are also intended to counteract the initial formation of cartels.</p>
<p>The programmes that are applied in the USA and Canada have been described by representatives of the competition authorities in these countries as very successful. The competition legislation in the USA and Canada is part of criminal law. The situation in the USA and Canada is thereby not completely comparable with the situation in Sweden. However, the EC Commission, which also applies competition rules that correspond to a large extent with the Swedish competition legislation, has also described its programme as successful.</p>
<p>In the view of the Committee, a programme for reduction or a waiver of the competition damage penalty may be of benefit in the fight against unlawful cartels. The development within the EU and its Member States also suggests that Sweden should introduce rules concerning this. The objections, which have been advanced against such a programme primarily referring to the rule of law, are not so strong that they justify a dismissive approach. The Committee therefore proposes rules concerning first waiver, second reduction of the competition damage penalty. As a model, the Committee has mainly considered the programmes in the USA and Canada. In this connection, the Committee has noted that the EU Commission has recently put forward a proposal for the revision of EU rules that are closely related to the North American programmes.</p>
<p>The competition damage penalty shall, according to the proposal of the Committee, be allowed to be waived as regards an undertaking that has violated a prohibition contained in Section 6 of the Competition Act if the undertaking reports the violation to the Competition Authority before any undertaking that has participated in the violation has done so and before the Authority has obtained a sufficient basis to intervene against the violation. The undertaking should also provide the Competition Authority with all information concerning the violation to which the undertaking had access. Furthermore, preconditions for waiver should also be that the undertaking fully collaborates with the Competition Authority during the investigation of the violation and as soon as possible after making its report ceases to participate in the violation. However, the competition damage penalty shall not be allowed to be waived if the undertaking has played the leading role in the violation and a waiver seems therefore manifestly unreasonable. Besides the proposed rules regarding waiver, the Committee proposes a statutory amendment whereby the competition damage penalty should be allowed to be reduced if an undertaking has, to a material extent, facilitated the investigation not only – as according to current law – regarding its own violation but also regarding the participation of others implicated in the violation. It should be possible to apply this rule to members of the cartel who have not been first to reveal the cartel and who therefore cannot have the competition damage penalty waived. The aim is that all members of the cartel should nevertheless have an incitement to collaborate in the Competition Authority’s investigation.</p>
<p>In the view of the Committee, there are several arguments against violations of the competition legislation being criminalised . The current sanction – the competition damage penalty – has only been used in a limited number of cases. Consequently, experience does not provide an information base for the conclusion that the sanction is ineffective or insufficient. It also appears to be doubtful whether criminal penalties would be an efficient means of counteracting violations, not least in view of the resources that are needed for investigation and prosecution. There are also great difficulties presented in designing a penal provision in a way that is acceptable from the viewpoint of the rule of law. Having regard to this, criminalisation does not appear to be an accessible way to make the sanctions against conduct impeding competition more stringent. It may also be claimed that to introduce penal liability for violations of a competition law prohibition that is already subject to a sanction in the form of the competition damage penalty would not really satisfy the principle ne bis in idem (the same act may not be punished twice). It may also be feared that the EU collaboration would be complicated as regards Sweden, if we were to introduce penal sanctions in Swedish competition law. In many cases it would quite simply become impossible to impose a sentence of imprisonment for serious violations. Finally, in the opinion of the Committee, it would be inappropriate to introduce penal sanctions in parallel with such a programme for a reduction and waiver of competition damage penalty as proposed by the Committee. In summary, the Committee considers that there is no reason to deviate from the assessments that were made when the current Act was passed. The Committee thus proposes that violations of the prohibition are not made subject to criminal penalties.</p>
<p>The need of  secrecy protection for informants and providers of information appears to be particularly manifest in two situations. In one situation, the informant or information provider is the representative of a competitor or some undertaking, for example a customer, that has a business relationship with the undertaking(s) to which the information relates. However, there may be a risk that the undertaking represented by the information provider would be exposed to the risk of economic reprisals, if the information is disclosed. The information provider may also be harmed personally in economic or other respects. The other situation applies to an employee who provides information about his/her own undertaking. In such a case the information provider may be adversely affected by both financial loss and unpleasantness of another kind. Information that an informant or other person provides in conjunction with investigations by the Competition Authority may to some extent be subject to the existing secrecy provisions and should in certain cases possibly be subject to the provisions for investigation secrecy in the proposal that the</p>
<p>Committee has previously submitted to the Government. However, the Secrecy Act does not contain any provision that is applicable in competition matters and which is particularly aimed at protecting the identity of an information provider or information from such person. Secrecy protection of a corresponding kind exists in other fields where compulsory intervention comes into question and an informant is at risk of being exposed to reprisals as a consequence of his/her report. There are also provisions concerning protection of individuals in conjunction with preliminary investigations in criminal matters. The Committee thus considers in conclusion that the need of secrecy protection for information providers is great, at the same time as an undertaking’s interest of insight into the matter is satisfied through the existing rules on party insight, i.e. access to information. The Committee therefore proposes a provision concerning secrecy with the Competition Authority in matters relating to investigations of violations of Sections 6 and 19 of the Competition Act or of Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty for a report or another statement by an individual, if it may be assumed that the individual will suffer loss or be disadvantaged if the information is revealed.</p>
<p>The exchange of information between national competition authorities promotes efficient competition compliance work. Having regard to current negotiations within the EU, the Committee does not consider itself able to submit any proposal regarding exchange of information within the framework of the EU collaboration. A precondition for effective exchange of information with another country outside the EU collaboration would probably be that there is an agreement concerning the exchange with the country in question. Such an agreement does not require any amendment of general Swedish secrecy provisions.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the Competition Authority is given an opportunity to support the competition authorities of other countries with the gathering of information and conduct of investigations.</p>
<p>However, this power should be limited to the countries with which Sweden has concluded binding agreements on the matter. In order that the Authority should be given permission to implement investigations at an undertaking, so-called dawn raids, it should also be required that the competition rules of the other State have been violated in a manner corresponding to a violation of the provisions contained in Section 6 or 19 of the Competition Act or the provisions contained in Article 81 or 82 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that an opportunity is introduced into the Competition Act for individual parties to obtain indemnity for litigation costs  in such competition matters where the Judicial Matters (Procedure) Act is applied and where the Competition Authority is the other party. The right to indemnity shall be limited to such matters that relate to intervention on the part of the Competition Authority. The proposal means that the litigation costs rules that apply for criminal cases should be applied.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the statutory amendments enter into force on 1 July 2002.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposal</h2>
<p>The Committee considers that the proposals will not have any substantial economic consequences. A programme for a reduction or waiver of the competition damage penalty may be expected to increase the efficiency of the work of the Competition Authority with exposing unlawful cartels and in this way achieve a positive effect on the national economy and for the consumer. The proposed provision concerning secrecy protection for informants and information providers would probably involve more persons being willing to provide information to the Competition Authority in conjunction with investigations of violations of the competition legislation and may consequently contribute to the investigations of the Authority becoming more efficient.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the Committee, the proposals do not involve any immediate need for increased resources for the Competition Authorities or on the part of any other authorities.</p>
<p>The proposal of the Committee concerning enhanced opportunities for individuals to receive indemnity of litigation costs will probably result in costs to the community for litigation costs increasing a little. How great this increase of costs will be depends upon both the extent to which the courts will change the decision of the Competition Authority in the kinds of matters that the proposal relates to and also the nature of the matters that arise. According to the opinion of the Committee, it is not possible to estimate the increase of costs, but nothing suggests that it would involve any substantial amounts.</p>
