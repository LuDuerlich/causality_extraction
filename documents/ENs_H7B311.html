<p>The main remit of the Inquiry was to:</p>
<p>• analyse how aviation’s use of sustainable biofuels with low lifecycle emissions can be promoted to help the transition to a fossilfree energy system and reduced climate impact;</p>
<p>• propose, if necessary, how the policy instrument or instruments best suited to reducing flight emissions through the use of sustainable biofuels should be designed;</p>
<p>• highlight which policy instruments can best promote the longterm and  large-scale production of biofuels for flights in Sweden; and</p>
<p>• assess what blending ratio of  bio-jet fuel is reasonable to achieve in the short and the long term, considering supply and price of such fuel, and demand in other sectors.</p>
<p>The remit does not cover taxes. The Inquiry’s full remit is described in annex I. Below is a description first of the Inquiry’s proposals and their consequences. Then a background summary is given.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s main proposal is a greenhouse gas emissions reduction obligation for jet fuel</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has presented a number of proposals that are described in Chapter 9 and 10: 1. The  All-Party Committee on Environmental Objectives should be tasked with establishing goals for decreased emissions from aviation. 2. Introduction of a greenhouse gas emissions reduction obligation for jet fuel used to fuel aircraft in Sweden. 3. The possibility of procuring  bio-jet fuel should be introduced in the central government framework agreements. 4. The Swedish Armed Forces should procure  bio-jet fuel for the government aircraft. 5. The Swedish Armed Forces and The Swedish Defence Materiel Administration should be tasked with analysing the preconditions for domestic production and use of  bio-jet fuel for the Swedish Armed Forces. 6. The Swedish Energy Agency should be tasked with analysing whether investment or operating aid should be developed for production facilities with new technology that is too costly to be able to compete with the greenhouse gas emissions reduction obligation (‘the reduction obligation’) in place. 7. The Swedish Consumer Agency should be tasked with producing a climate declaration for  long-distance travel. 8. An inquiry should be appointed to look into night train traffic as an alternative to flights.</p>
<h2>The reduction obligation sets requirements for fuel suppliers to reduce their emissions through use of bio-jet fuel</h2>
<p>A reduction obligation would mean fuel suppliers reducing their greenhouse gas emissions from jet fuel by blending it with biofuels. Emissions are calculated based on a lifecycle perspective. The system uses a standard value for lifecycle emissions from fossil jet fuel. However, lifecycle emissions for biofuels are calculated according to the method outlined in the Renewable Energy Directive and are thus different for different types of raw materials and manufacturing processes. The volume ratio for biofuels that is needed to meet the reduction obligation therefore depends on the greenhouse gas emissions from a lifecycle perspective from the biofuels used. Lower lifecycle emissions mean that a lower volume ratio is required, and vice versa. The purpose of opting for a reduction obligation is that, compared with a blending obligation, it favours fuels with lower lifecycle emissions.</p>
<p>If the reduction obligation is not met, fuel suppliers will have to pay a ‘reduction obligation fee’, which we propose should be SEK 6 per kilogram of CO equivalents. The fee is intended to be significantly higher than the cost of blending bio-jet fuel.</p>
<p>The reduction level will increase from the equivalent of approximately 1 volume per cent in 2021 to the equivalent of approximately</p>
<p>The Inquiry has presented proposals for reduction levels for the years 2021–2030. Regulating reduction levels up to 2030 provides better conditions for producers to invest and shows a clear direction. It is not the cost of blending that has primarily limited how high the obligation levels can be, but supply of bio-jet fuel with high climate benefits. The Inquiry has chosen to increase reduction levels more significantly as of 2025 as supply of bio-jet fuel is expected to be greater then thanks to growing production capacity. The Inquiry has also assumed that the lifecycle emissions for the biofuels used will decrease over time, which will result in higher reduction levels. Reduction levels, presumed lifecycle emissions and estimated volume ratios are presented in table 1.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s own estimates.</p>
<p>Fossil-free flights by 2045 should be the target</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes no reduction levels for the years after 2030 but considers that the target should be 100 per cent renewable fuels with low lifecycle emissions by 2045. With a clear target for 2045, both politics and business are steered in that direction. This, in turn, can lead to the creation of markets for new solutions, such as electric flights for short distances or electrofuels. How quickly these will be developed is currently unclear, and no major effects can be expected before 2030, but such solutions would make it easier to achieve the target of fossil-free flights by 2045. Electrification and continued energy efficiency measures reduce the total amount of energy in liquid fuels and can, in combination with the use of electrofuels, reduce the need for biofuels to achieve the target by 2045.</p>
<h2>Impact of the proposed reduction obligation for jet fuel</h2>
<p>Below is a description of the overall impact on the climate, travel and the cost of meeting the obligation. The estimates are based on a number of assumptions (see annex 2). The Inquiry has carried out a sensitivity analysis of the results by varying certain assumptions; see Section 11.8.</p>
<h2>Climate benefits mainly down to fuel shift</h2>
<p>The reduction obligation does not set any ceiling for total fossil emissions; instead, it regulates that they must be reduced per energy unit. In other words, total emissions can continue to increase if there is a sufficiently strong increase in total fuel use. However, emissions with a reduction obligation will always be lower than they would have been if all fuel had been fossil fuel. Decisive factors for how climate impact from aviation develops are currently the pace of energy efficiency measures and growth in passenger numbers. Blending of biofuels will be one additional such factor with the reduction obligation. A reduction obligation also increases the cost of fuel, providing incentives for energy efficiency measures and curbing traffic growth through higher ticket prices.</p>
<p>The impact on climate emissions from flights can be described for three different categories: Emissions from fuel combustion,  where only the fossil carbon content in the fuel is counted (known as ‘combustion emissions’). Upstream emissions  to produce fuel, i.e. emissions to grow or extract the raw material, processing emissions during production, and transport of the fuel. Non-CO2   climate impacts  that constitute an additional climate impact due to emissions at high altitudes (see Chapter 5). Figure 1 illustrates the total climate impact from combustion emissions, upstream emissions and nonCO climate impacts. Upstream emissions are – with the assumptions made by the Inquiry – roughly the same for fossil jet fuel and bio-jet fuel during the first years of the system and then roughly half as much for bio-jet fuel. For fossil bio-jet fuel, upstream emissions are not expected to reduce by 2030. Non-CO   climate impacts cannot be expected to vary between the different fuel types. However, there is potential to modify fuels in order to reduce non-CO   climate impacts. This can apply to both biofuels and fossil fuels.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s own estimates.</p>
<p>The reduction obligation gives rise to two different effects on the climate impact from flights:</p>
<p>• fossil jet fuel is replaced with  bio-jet fuel (fuel shift),</p>
<p>• altered travel patterns in the form of reduced flying and a certain amount of transfer to other modes of transport.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s estimates show that the climate benefits of the reduction obligation are mainly down to fuel shift and to a lesser extent down to reduced travel due to an increase in costs. In a reference scenario without a reduction obligation, emissions from flights fuelled in Sweden are estimated to increase by 6 per cent by 2030 compared with the 2017 emissions level. With a reduction obligation, emissions would instead decrease by 24 per cent by 2030 compared with the 2017 emissions level. The reduction obligation therefore breaks a trend, and emissions would decrease instead of increasing. -1,4 -1,2 -1,0 -0,8 -0,6 -0,4 -0,2 0,0</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s own estimates.</p>
<h2>How will travel be affected?</h2>
<p>Swedavia’s long-term traffic forecast indicates annual passenger growth of approximately 2.1 per cent over the next three decades. This constitutes the Inquiry’s reference scenario. Even if, due to price increases, the reduction obligation leads to reduced demand for flights compared with a reference scenario, the total number of departing passengers is estimated to increase by 27 per cent between 2017 and 2030 (see figure 3). The number of departing passengers in 2030 is estimated to amount to 29.65 million compared with 23.37 million in 2017. This can be compared with the reference scenario, which forecasts 30.35 million departing passengers in 2030. The difference is therefore approximately 700 000 passengers in 2030. Both domestic and international flights are expected to increase even with the reduction obligation in place. The reduction obligation curbs the pace of increase.</p>

<h2>What volume/amount of energy of bio-jet fuel is required to meet the obligation, and what will it cost?</h2>
<p>The cost of meeting the obligation would initially be low and then rise, as a greater level of blending would be required. However, the cost increase would be curbed as biofuels are expected to become cheaper as supply increases and technology improves, and energy efficiency measures will continue, reducing the need for fuel. Table 2 shows the Inquiry’s assumptions concerning price per litre for biojet fuel and the estimated results for total volume of bio-jet fuel to achieve the reduction obligation levels, total amount of energy and total additional cost of blending. For the sake of comparison, approximately 2 TWh for domestic flights and 11 TWh for international flights are currently used. The use of biofuels for the road traffic sector was approximately 19 TWh in 2017.</p>
<h2>How much more expensive will flight tickets be?</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has assumed that the additional cost of bio-jet fuel will burden the consumer. The table below shows the cost increase for fuel for different types of flight. The actual price increase can vary depending on the airlines’ pricing. For international travel, the cost will only be incurred once per return trip, as the reduction obligation only applies to fuel used to fill up aircraft in Sweden. For domestic flights, the cost given will be incurred twice for a return trip.</p>
<h2>Background – Use of bio-jet fuel can increase over time if powerful policy instruments are introduced but supply is limited It is permitted to blend in up to 50 per cent bio-jet fuel</h2>
<p>All jet fuel must be certified according to a global standard. The current standard permits blending of up to 50 volume per cent biojet fuel. Several different methods of producing bio-jet fuel are possible, but it has to be a technique that produces a fuel with the same chemical structure as fossil jet fuel. At present, HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) produced from vegetable and animal oils and fats are the most common, but there are good prospects of producing bio-jet fuel from the residues of the forestry and paper industries, for example. All facilities that produce bio-jet fuel will also produce biofuels for the road transport sector.</p>
<h2>Higher price for bio-jet fuel requires policy instruments</h2>
<p>The major costs of producing bio-jet fuel are the raw material cost and the investment cost for the facility. The lowest production cost is estimated to be approximately SEK 8–10 per litre, but this varies considerably depending on choice of technique and raw material. This can be compared with the price of fossil jet fuel, which is approximately SEK 6 per litre. The first facilities for techniques that are not currently commercial will be more expensive, as the costs are expected to decrease along a learning curve.</p>
<p>The price of bio-jet fuel is set on the basis of supply and demand in a global market, and it can be considerably higher than the production cost, even taking into account a certain profit margin. The market is in its infancy even globally, and the current very low production capacity is expected to increase considerably by 2030. The Inquiry estimates a price of approximately SEK 18 per litre by 2021, SEK 14 per litre by 2025, and SEK 12 per litre by 2030. Consumers’ willingness to pay the additional cost for bio-jet fuel is not considered to be sufficient for aviation to convert to the use of renewable fuels. This is why policy instruments are necessary to promote the increased use of bio-jet fuels.</p>
<h2>There are good prospects for producing bio-jet fuels in Sweden</h2>
<p>Sweden has a good supply of biomass for the production of biofuels, particularly lignocellulose from forestry, agriculture and the pulp industry. For a long time now, the Swedish Energy Agency has been supporting research and innovation in the area of biofuels, and there are plenty of technical solutions. However, concerning technology that has not yet been commercialised, it is reasonable to assume that it can take up to ten years from a pilot facility being built to there being commercial production in the market. This can be a great deal faster for technology that has already been demonstrated on a large scale or that is in commercial use, especially if there are existing facilities and infrastructure that can be used. This is the case in Sweden, above all for existing oil refineries.</p>
<h2>Biofuels can only be one piece in the puzzle of reducing climate impact</h2>
<p>The use of biofuels can only be one of several measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector. The Swedish Transport Administration is working on a four-step principle, in which point one is to primarily opt for measures that can affect the need for transport or travel, and the choice of mode of transport. This principle is important as the use of biofuels can result in a burden on the environment. Electrification and efficiency measures can further limit the need for biofuels to achieve the climate objectives and thus reduce potential conflicts of interest with other environmental objectives. The forecasts for the need for biofuels for the road traffic sector are considerably higher than their expected use in the aviation sector. If supply of sustainable biofuels turns out to be limited, an increased pace of measures for electrification in the road traffic sector may be needed, in combination with the above- mentioned initiatives under the four-step principle.</p>
