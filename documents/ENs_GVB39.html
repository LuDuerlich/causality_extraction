<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The terms of reference of the inquiry were – on the basis of a broad perspective of promoting Sweden – to review State support for Swedish courses at university level in other countries. By Swedish courses we mean both teaching the Swedish language and teaching about Sweden.</p>
<p>Swedish courses are currently available at approximately 200 universities and other higher education institutions, in over 40 countries. Apart from Finland, where Swedish is one of the national languages, the largest number of institutions offering Swedish courses are in Germany and the US, with 25–30 institutions each. Sweden must make use of this expression of interest in its language. Supporting Swedish courses is a way of promoting Swedish interests. A prerequisite, however, is that a country’s education system offers a foundation on which Swedish contributions can build.</p>
<p>It is important for Sweden’s relations with other countries that there are people in these countries who understand or have a command of the Swedish language. But there is also a more general cultural reason for supporting Swedish courses: Making the Swedish language visible and strengthening its position in other countries contributes to an understanding of the values, traditions and social patterns that characterise Swedish society.</p>
<p>We regard support for Swedish courses for non-Swedes to be part of the general promotion of Sweden. The Swedish Institute (SI) should continue to have overall responsibility for this support. From a broad perspective of promoting Sweden, it is important that Swedish courses provided in schools and in non-academic adult education be included. We propose a survey of these types of Swedish courses.</p>
<p>We propose the following objective of support for Swedish courses: To support activities that give people in other countries</p>
<p>knowledge and skills in the Swedish language and which spread information about Swedish culture and Swedish society. In addition, a separate objective should apply to support in Finland: On the basis of Finland’s historical and cultural ties with Sweden, to increase awareness in Finnish-speaking environments about the significance of the Swedish language to Finnish cooperation with Sweden and with other Nordic countries.</p>
<p>Swedish interests must be more clearly defined and asserted in relation to foreign universities. SI’s decisions on financial support should be preceded by negotiations with each university about the terms of funding.</p>
<p>At present, promotion of Sweden is largely governed by economic considerations. When it comes to supporting Swedish courses, however, priorities must be based on a broader set of criteria. The political, social and cultural aspects of the relations between Sweden and the country in question should also be taken into account. On the basis of the current situation, the following countries – listed per region without ranking – should be given priority:</p>
<p>EU member and candidate countries, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland,</p>
<p>Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Serbia, USA, Canada and Mexico,</p>
<p>Japan, China and South Korea, and Australia.</p>
<p>All universities offering Swedish courses of acceptable quality should receive basic services from the SI in the form of information and invitations to conferences etc. Direct support should, however, be concentrated on a number of prioritised universities. Priority between universities should be based on three criteria:</p>
<p>• Breadth of teaching and of the base of recruitment</p>
<p>From the point of view of promoting Sweden it is an advantage if the teaching covers not only the language but also different aspects of Swedish society and culture. Also advantageous is if students with specialities other than philology can include Swedish studies in their degrees.</p>
<p>• Research and postgraduate studies</p>
<p>Institutions with research and postgraduate studies often have greater breadth and stability in their activities. Connection with research is important for making advanced studies in Swedish possible, and hence for developing domestic teachers in Swedish in the country concerned.</p>
<p>• Conditions for outreach activities</p>
<p>Institutions with Swedish courses can carry out activities that promote Sweden in ways others than through education. It should be possible to link such institutions more closely to the broader work of promoting Sweden by providing special support. This could be especially important in the field of promoting Swedish literature.</p>
<p>In the context of guidelines given by Government, it should be the task of SI to decide on the extent and character of the support given to individual universities. Apart from granting financial support, SI should assist universities in recruiting Swedish teachers and other specialists.</p>
<p>It should be possible to engage university lecturers provided through SI in promotional activities outside their teaching duties. Lecturers who in today’s system are given more extensive expense contributions by SI should instead be salaried and employed by the Institute, thus gaining access to the social benefits that apply to Government employees. For other lecturers it should be possible for SI to finance insurances to the same end. SI must be allocated more funds to cover costs related to these changes.</p>
<p>Swedish lecturers provided to universities abroad through SI should be placed on an equal footing with such Government employees and development assistance workers, who are regarded as residents in Sweden even while serving abroad, thus retaining their links with the Swedish social security system. A legislative amendment to this effect should be taken up in an impending review of the social insurance system.</p>
<p>One or two Swedish higher education institutions in the field of Swedish as a foreign language should fill a supportive and advisory role in relation to teachers of Swedish at universities abroad. Also in other ways the links between institutions offering Swedish</p>
<p>courses abroad and the Swedish higher education system should be strengthened.</p>
<p>As a basis for its decisions, SI needs assessments of two kinds: The Swedish embassies concerned should assess the importance of various cities from the point of view of promoting Sweden. For the assessment of the quality of universities and their Swedish courses, SI should have an advisory committee recruited primarily from Swedish universities.</p>
<p>Swedish embassies and consulates must regard Swedish courses as part of the promotion of Sweden, and increase their commitment to and their cooperation with the institutions concerned. This should be emphasised by means of a supplement to the Ordinance Concerning the Duties of the Foreign Service.</p>
<p>Sweden’s investment in support of its own language abroad is modest in comparison with equivalent investments made by Sweden’s Nordic neighbours and the Netherlands. There are strong reasons to give priority to this field in the continued development of promotion of Sweden.</p>
