<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Using the law to support digitalisation of public administration</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit has focused on the legal considerations for public administration that is digitally interoperable . The remit included surveying and analysing the extent to which there is legislation that unnecessarily obstructs digital transformation and interoperability in public administration.</p>
<p>The remit also included presenting proposals for the legislative amendments  considered to offer the greatest potential to support continued digitalisation of public administration. We also present certain other measures  aimed at creating better conditions for handling legal challenges resulting from the digitalisation of public administration.</p>
<p>We present proposed amendments to Chapter 4 of the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400)  aimed at making it easier for public authorities to maintain a good structure for public access to information  in certain automated procedures, while safeguarding the principle of public access to official documents and strengthening legal certainty. This means ensuring the ability to provide insight  into certain automated procedures when algorithms or computer programmes are used in connection with selection or decision-making processes. The Inquiry also presents proposals that promote the possibilities for public administration to collect  decision-making  data  by means other than directly from individuals, at the same time as public administration safeguards good order regarding decision-making data collected or read from digital sources.</p>
<p>We also present proposals for continued organised work to ensure legally certain procedures when public administration uses AI</p>
<p>systems with machine learning algorithms, while promoting both innovation and interoperability.</p>
<p>In our report, we further propose introducing new and adapted regulations on digital communication  in the Administrative Procedure Act (2017:900). The aim is to strengthen requirements on public administration to meet the public’s expectations of digital accessibility, at the same time as clear rules on how this communication is expected to take place strengthen confidence in digital procedures. The proposals contain a new general rule stipulating that public authorities will be required to provide and, in an appropriate manner, allocate one or more digital reception functions  to which documents can be delivered. Certain exceptions to the general rule are proposed to guarantee a good balance between the interests of e.g. efficiency and security. Additional adjustments are also proposed when it comes to communication by public administration in order to create confidence in public administration’s digital procedures concerning adjustment of rules on the date of arrival  for documents sent digitally to a public administration body and on notifications . To strengthen the legal conditions for the provision of digital services where cases can be opened, we have also proposed tasking a public authority with drafting general advice or other support material  regarding the design of such services. We also propose a new general rule stating that public administration communications to individuals must be digital .</p>
<p>Digital administration must be legally certain as well as being secure in other aspects. Therefore, in addition to the proposals presented above, the Inquiry also presents some proposals aimed at creating a stable legal basis for the continued development of a digital administration that is interoperable both internally and in relation to private actors. We propose that the Government appoint an inquiry to examine the need to strengthen regulations on information security  for public administration as a whole. We also propose a new act on confidentiality when outsourcing to private suppliers  who handle public authority information solely for technical processing or storage purposes. In addition, we propose a new provision that overrides secrecy  in Chapter 10 of the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act  to allow public authorities to provide certain classified information to private or public suppliers in connection with outsourcing of technical processing or storage. Furthermore, we propose strengthening the conditions for handling legal challenges resulting from digitalisation</p>
<p>by means of the Government tasking certain public authorities with providing increased support in authorities’ IT agreement processes  and with regard to personal data processor agreements.</p>
<p>Measures and positions from both the Riksdag and the Government indicate that even greater focus will now be given to digitalisation work carried out by public administration. Our remit also included presenting proposals on how all actors in public administration can collaborate on the need for new or amended legislation to promote digitalisation. We propose that the Government appoint a legal preparatory body  that, over the next few years, is tasked with regularly providing preparatory material for adapting current legislation on digitalisation of case processing in public administration, supported by digital information exchanges and new forms of digital information supply.</p>
<p>In addition, the Inquiry was tasked with providing proposals on possible designs for augmented reporting of the entire public administration’s regular work on IT and digitalisation. In this part of its remit, the Inquiry proposes that, in the Official Statistics Ordinance (2001:100), an obligation be imposed on public administration to provide information on IT costs .</p>
