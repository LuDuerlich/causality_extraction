<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Alternative dispute resolution can be defined as comprising methods for resolving legal disputes in ways other than through traditional legal proceedings and judgments. In Sweden, such methods are available primarily outside the courts, e.g. in the Swedish National Board for Consumer Complaints, in arbitration tribunals, and in various organizations that offer mediation. There is, however, the opportunity to have a special mediator appointed within the frame of the procedure in a civil case. The Inquiry has had the tasks of examining the conditions for and considering the design of an alternative district-court procedure in actions amenable to outof-court settlements, and of taking a stance on whether actions should be taken to bring about increased utilization of mediation in the courts.</p>
<p>One point of departure for the work of the Inquiry has been that the traditional form of court proceedings shall remain available to everybody. The proposed alternatives shall be regarded as a complement to commonplace judicial review, and shall therefore not restrict the opportunity of disputing parties to have their dispute decided in a traditional manner. Rather, the aim of the alternative options is to increase the range of conflict-resolution mechanisms so as to be able to offer solutions that are better tailored to the parties and the nature of the disputes. Making it possible for more disputes to be handled by alternative and simpler resolution methods may also lead to the liberation of resources for the better handling of disputes that are treated in a traditional manner.</p>
<h2>Settlement and mediation</h2>
<p>A settlement means that the parties to a dispute come to an agreement, and accept that agreement as a resolution of the dispute. That a case can be resolved through a conciliatory settlement has advantages both for the parties and for society at large. The Inquiry therefore proposes that the Court’s duty, in the first instance, to work for reconciliation shall be somewhat sharpened. According to the proposal, the Court shall make efforts to obtain a settlement between the parties if this is not inappropriate in light of the nature of the case and other circumstances. There should be concrete grounds that speak against a settlement if the Court is to refrain from raising the issue of conciliation. The Inquiry further proposes that the opportunity of courts of appeal to work for conciliation is confirmed in law. A court of appeal should, however, not have any explicit obligation to work for such a settlement.</p>
<p>In light of the clear advantages that accompany a settlement, all parties should have access to the best possible tools for reaching a conciliatory solution within the frame of court proceedings. Conciliatory activities are currently undertaken primarily by the judge administering the case. The aptitude and commitment of judges with regard to settlement negotiations do, however, vary, and the parties have no opportunity to influence which judge will administer their case. If, instead, conciliatory work takes place through mediation, there are greater guarantees that all parties will be able to pursue settlement negotiations under the guidance of a person with the requisite interest and aptitude. The Inquiry proposes therefore that mediation, in principle, shall be the first option to be considered with regard to the issue of conciliatory procedure. In all actions amenable to settlement, the Court shall consider whether mediation should be offered to the parties. Such an offer should come at an early stage in case proceedings, generally immediately after the defence plea has been made. It is at this stage that, in procedural terms, the advantages of a settlement are greatest. It shall, however, be entirely voluntary for the parties to go through mediation. In instances where mediation does not come about, the Court shall, as previously, work for settlement within the frame of administration of the case.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that access to mediators shall be increased by each court appointing a number of judges at the court who, alongside their regular tasks, are enabled to act as mediators. The appointed judges shall receive training in the arena, which will ensure that every court will be able to offer quality mediation to the parties. The proposal also entails that mediation will be cost-free to the parties, since a mediator who is a judge will mediate within the frame of his employment. It shall remain possible for mediation to take place with the aid of an external mediator, but in such case the parties will have to pay for the remuneration of the mediator.</p>
<p>Mediation shall be regulated in a specific Act on Mediation in Ordinary Courts. When the Court rules for mediation, it shall at the same time set a deadline for when the mediation shall at the latest be completed. The assigned time period may not exceed two months. The mediator shall be responsible for the mediation being conducted according to purpose and quickly. Forms for the proceedings are determined by the mediator in consultation with the parties. The points of departure for the work of the mediator should be to attempt to map the interests and needs of the parties, and to determine the problems they wish to resolve. In light of this, the mediator should help the parties themselves to find a solution to their dispute. The mediator, however, must also be able to adopt a more value-laden approach, expressing his or her own proposals for conflict resolution.</p>
<p>A mediation meeting shall, as has previously applied, not be held in public. Information supplied to the mediator shall, according to our proposal, be covered by confidentiality law, to the extent that the communicating party insists that it is held secret.</p>
<p>If mediation is concluded without a settlement being reached, administration of the case continues as usual. Any judge who has mediated in the case, by contrast with the judge who is working on conciliation within the frame of administration of the case, may not decide the case if attempts at settlement fail. The mediator too must, however, act impartially, so as to maintain the confidence of the parties.</p>
<p>It shall also be possible to offer mediation to the parties in the Court of Appeal. At the appeal stage, mediation should come into question primarily when it is requested by the parties, or when there is a reason that makes it specifically appropriate.</p>
<h2>Optional dispute proceedings</h2>
<p>Parties who fail to reach an agreement wish, in many cases, to have their dispute resolved in court. The Inquiry proposes two court proceedings that parties to actions amenable to out-of-court settlement shall be able to choose in preference to the usual judicial process. Above all, the options must be quicker and cheaper than the traditional dispute-resolution process. The Inquiry considers that the proceedings can be introduced in parallel.</p>
<p>Quick proceedings</p>
<p>According to its remit, the Inquiry has had the task of proposing district-court proceedings that would be administered by a single judge and that would emanate in an implementable, non-appealable judgment that would have legal force. The proceedings are to be characterized by voluntariness, rapidity, influence of the parties, and flexibility.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the proceedings shall be designated as a “quick judicial procedure” and governed by an Act independent of Sweden’s Code of Judicial Procedure. In this way, it would be made clear that it is an alternative to the traditional process. With regard to issues not covered by the specific Act, the provisions of the Code of Judicial Procedure would apply, to the extent that they do not conflict with the aims and fundamental principles of a quick judicial procedure. It is envisaged that the proceedings would be used by parties who wish quickly to see an implementable and final resolution of their dispute without risking anything but their own litigation costs. In designing the proceedings, the Inquiry has taken as its point of departure that the parties who choose them may be expected to prioritize speed over other factors. Accordingly, relatively strict demands are imposed on the parties actively to participate in a quick judicial procedure. There is a time limit even for the Court. The case should be completed within three months unless, following consultation with the parties, the Court decides otherwise.</p>
<p>The procedure is primarily designed for disputes where private individuals or small or medium sized enterprises, with limited financial resources, are involved. However, the Inquiry envisages that the procedure may be of interest even to other parties.</p>
<p>It shall be voluntary for the parties to engage in a quick judicial procedure. Parties who are in a contractual relationship with each other shall be able to reach advance agreement that any disputes resulting from their contract will be resolved through the quick procedure. It shall also be possible to gain the defendant’s consent after the plaintiff has taken legal action with a request for a quick judicial procedure.</p>
<p>The quick procedure shall be flexible, and adapted to the parties and the nature of the dispute. The Code of Judicial Procedure’s principles concerning oral proceedings, immediacy and concentration are replaced by the demand for speed and concentration throughout the proceedings. There shall be no division between preparatory and main hearings. The parties shall have the opportunity to express their wishes with regard to administration of the procedure, but the Court will have full authority to decide over administrative issues so as to ensure that the procedure is both expedient and rapid. It shall be possible to combine oral and written testimony. If witnesses are to be interviewed, or if any party so requests, meetings can be held. Otherwise, the Court may rule on the case entirely on the basis of written documentation.</p>
<p>Usually, the judge will hold a telephone conference with the parties or their legal representatives after submission of the defense. The procedure to be followed shall be discussed during the telephone conference, and thereafter a schedule laid down. The schedule shall specify the timing of the processes that will arise. It shall also set a time for when the parties finally determine their claims and the items of evidence to which they wish to refer. The schedule shall be distributed to the partiers, and can thereby act as a substitute for traditional orders or injunctions. Any party who does not follow the schedule runs the risk of sanctions. Exchange of written documentation shall be restricted so that the parties are allowed to present two documents with regard to the matter.</p>
<p>The parties shall have responsibility that the evidence referred to can be presented. If witnesses are called, the parties must ensure that they turn up on the occasion of interview. It shall also be possible, rather than holding an interview, for written witness statements to be obtained. If any such statement is referred to, it should be retained so that is possible to interview the witness in question with regard to supplementary issues or any that require clarification. On its own account, the Court may not introduce evidence into the case.</p>
<p>Any one party, according to the main rule, shall not have the right to compensation for costs incurred in a case that is resolved through the quick procedure. It shall, however, be possible for the parties to come to agreement over an alternative distribution of the costs, e.g. in a way that the party regarded as the loser shall pay the expenses of the counter-party. Any party found guilty of negligence in the process shall also be obliged to pay a part of the counter-party’s costs.</p>
<p>It shall also be possible for the parties to undergo mediation in the course of an ongoing quick procedure. Further, it shall be possible for the parties to make a transition from regular proceedings to quick proceedings, and vice-versa, if they so wish, and if the Court finds it appropriate.</p>
<p>There is no possible appeal against the judgments and decisions of a quick judicial procedure. On the other hand, it is possible to apply for a new trial or to make a formal complaint against a miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p>Advance decision</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s other proposal for an alternative form of dispute resolution deviates from its remit in that the decision in the proceedings will not have legal force. By such means, the Inquiry has regarded it as possible for proceedings to be even quicker and less formalized than implied by the rules concerning a quick procedure.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the proceedings, which have been inspired by the short procedure in the Netherlands, are regulated in an independent Act concerning advance decisions in cases of dispute. The parties shall, by turning to the District Court with an application for an advance decision, be able, within a few weeks, to obtain a resolution to their dispute based on an experienced judge’s preliminary judgment of how the outcome of that dispute might be expected to be if regular legal proceedings had taken place. The parties may choose to accept the advance decision as final, or treat it as a basis for a discussion on settlement. Thereby, they can avoid the time and costs of a regular legal procedure. Since confidence in the judge’s competence and experience may be regarded as of decisive importance for the parties’ acceptance of an advance decision as a final solution to the dispute, an advance decision may only be issued by a specially appointed, experienced judge.</p>
<p>For an advance decision to be issued, it is required that the parties are in agreement over it, and that the Court deems it appropriate to make such an advance decision with regard to the dispute. The material presented to the judge must be sufficiently limited that it can be presented to the Court at a meeting that is allowed to last for at most two hours.</p>
<p>When an application for an advance decision has been received, it shall be sent to the counter-party, who will then be invited to state whether he or she wishes to participate in the proceedings. At the same time, the counter-party is informed about the timing of the meeting with regard to the dispute. If the counter-party does not consent, no advance decision can be made. In such case, the application is rejected and the meeting cancelled.</p>
<p>If the counter-party does wish to participate, he or she shall specify a position in relation to the plaintiff’s claim, and demonstrate the evidence to which he or she wishes to refer. It is for the Court to determine which evidence the parties may present. If too much is presented, it may be that an advance decision is impossible. Usually, witnesses will not be interviewed. It shall, however, be possible to refer to witness reports.</p>
<p>Any oral meeting shall be held within a few weeks of receipt of the application. In light of the circumstances, the Court will decide the nature of the meeting, which must be held within a few weeks of receipt of the application, and which may last for no longer than one or, at most, two hours. If time is not regarded as sufficient, the dispute will generally be regarded as too extensive for an advance decision to be made.</p>
<p>An advance decision must be made within a week of the day of the meeting. The grounds for the advance decision must be documented in detail. The Court will determine whether the advance decision may be implemented if one party requests implementation and it is regarded as appropriate. With regard to suitability, the Court shall determine the extent of the risk that the advance decision might be amended in any subsequent legal process, and any consequences implementation of the decision might be expected to have for the parties. Implementation shall take place at the earliest three weeks after an advance decision has been made. Any party who wishes to prevent implementation has the opportunity to initiate an action in a regular manner, and seek an injunction against the advance decision. If the parties come to a settlement during the</p>
<p>ongoing proceedings to obtain an advance decision, then the Court will be able to order that the conciliatory agreement be effected.</p>
<p>The proceedings must be voluntary throughout. Up to the time that the meeting has been concluded, either one of the parties is able to withdraw from the procedure without any further consequences. It shall not be possible to obtain compensation for litigation costs during this procedure.</p>
<p>It shall not be possible to appeal against an advance decision or the rejection of one. On the other hand, an advance decision must not prevent any party from later initiating regular legal proceedings with regard to the same dispute.</p>
