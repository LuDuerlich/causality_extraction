<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Special Controls of Aliens Act (1991:572) entered into force on 1 July 1991. It is based on terrorist provisions incorporated in Sweden legislation in 1973. When the Act was introduced it had just over 25 sections. Since then it has undergone quite a number of changes and now contains almost 50 sections. The Act also contains a large number of references to provisions in the Aliens Act (2005:716) and the Code of Judicial Procedure. The regulatory framework is both unclear and inaccessible. So, there is a great need for amendments and clarifications. Even though only a small number of cases and matters are processed each year under the Special Controls of Aliens Act, they are of great importance for Sweden’s security.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit has been to make a systematic review of the Special Controls of Aliens Act. The purpose has been to create an appropriate, effective and clearly arranged regulation that is, at the same time, consistent with well-functioning protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. The remit has also included investigating certain specifically identified questions, including the scope of the act and the time limits for enforcement detention. The Inquiry was also to analyse and take a position on certain amendments and clarifications proposed by the Swedish Security Service of provisions in the Aliens Act and the Aliens Ordinance (2006:97). This concerned matters including alien’s passports, residence and work permits and what authority should be the enforcing authority. The Inquiry’s remit has also included making an assessment of how the control of persons who are a security threat can be strengthened by, for instance, using electronic tagging.</p>
<h2>A completely new law</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes replacing the Special Controls of Aliens Act with a new law, the act on special controls of certain aliens. Like the present Act, the new law would apply instead of the Aliens Act to aliens who are a high-level security threat. The new law has been designed to meet the special challenges involved in processing aliens matters regarding persons who are a serious threat to Sweden’s security. For this reason, the new law is much more independent in relation to both the Aliens Act and EU law. As a result, there are considerably fewer references to sections of the Aliens Act. The Inquiry stresses that careful consideration will continue to be needed before the new law is adapted to amendments made in other parts of alien’s legislation.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes supplementing the new law with a new ordinance, the ordinance on special controls of certain aliens.</p>
<h2>Expulsion and enforcement</h2>
<p>The new law will make it possible to expel an alien if there is reason to believe that they will commit an act that is punishable under the recently proposed terrorist offences act (2021:000). The requirement for expulsion on this ground is lower than in the present Act. In addition, the reference to the terrorist offences act is made general so that not only terrorist offences are covered. So, in the future, the risk that an alien may commit other terrorism-related offences, e.g. financing of or recruitment to terrorism, can also lead to expulsion. If more acts are made punishable in the terrorist offences act in the future, they will therefore also automatically be able to lead to expulsion.</p>
<p>An alien may also be expelled if they can be a serious threat to Sweden’s security in some other way than on account of the risk of terrorism-related acts.</p>
<p>The Swedish Security Service will also continue to initiate an expulsion matter at the Swedish Migration Agency, which decides in the first instance whether the alien will be expelled. In the same way as at present, the Agency’s decision will be appealable to the Government. The Swedish Security Service will enforce all expulsion orders under the new law but can commission the Swedish Police Authority to handle the practical procedure.</p>
<p>An expulsion order always has to contain a ban on the alien reentering Sweden. The starting point is that there should be no time limit on the re-entry ban but time-limited bans can be ordered. An alien who is expelled under the new law will be able to make a declaration that they accept the order. Their declaration of acceptance then also covers the re-entry ban.</p>
<p>If an alien has been expelled, but there is an impediment to enforcement under Chapter 12, Sections 1–3 a of the Aliens Act or the expulsion order should not be enforced for some other special reason, the decision-making authority shall order that the expulsion order must not be enforced for the time being (stay of enforcement). In the future the Agency will only be able to grant the alien a temporary residence permit (which can then be valid for at most one year) if there are special reasons. When the permit has expired, the Swedish Migration Agency will no longer re-examine the expulsion order but will only examine the question of enforcement.</p>
<p>It will be possible for an alien who has been expelled to make an application to the Government to have the expulsion order set aside. The expulsion order will have been enforced by that time, which means that the alien will be outside Sweden. An application may be made no earlier than after ten years.</p>
<h2>Detention and supervision</h2>
<p>The conditions for placing an alien in detention are clarified. An alien may be placed in detention either if it is probable that the alien will be expelled or if there already is an expulsion order and detention is needed to prepare and carry out the enforcement of the order. For an alien who has attained 18 years, there is also the requirement that there is reason to expect that the alien will otherwise abscond, stay in hiding or otherwise impede enforcement or conduct criminal activities in Sweden or that the alien’s identity is unclear. For a child to be placed in detention the requirement is instead that there is a considerable risk that the child will otherwise abscond, stay in hiding or otherwise impede enforcement or conduct criminal activities in Sweden. The Migration Court of Appeal will no longer decide on detention. Instead, the Swedish Migration Agency, the Government or the Swedish Security Service is the competent authority depending on how far the processing of the matter has advanced.</p>
<p>The period for which an alien may be held in detention is changed both by making it clear that detention always has to run for as short a time as possible and by considerably extending the time limits for enforcement detention and expanding the possibilities of extension. In the future, it will be possible to hold an alien who has attained 18 years for up to one year in enforcement detention. In special circumstances that period may be extended to a maximum of three years. The period for when a detention order has to be re-examined is extended, to four weeks for probable cause detention and three months for enforcement. For as long as the alien is being held in detention, the order has to be re-examined continuously within the same time periods. Detention orders will be enforced by the Swedish Security Service. However, the Service will be given the possibility of turning to the Swedish Police Authority for assistance in handling the practical procedure.</p>
<p>A ban is introduced on placing children being held in detention in prison-like facilities. An alien who has not attained 18 years shall instead be placed in the Swedish Migration Agency’s detention premises. A child who is being held in detention under the new law may be separated from other detainees if this is necessary to maintain order or security in the premises.</p>
<p>The rules about supervision are also clarified, partly through provisions stating what supervision entails. It should be possible for a supervision order to include a ban on an alien leaving a certain area, their area of stay. This is not possible today. If the supervision order entails an obligation for the alien to report or to surrender their passport or some other identity document, this obligation has to be met at the Swedish Police Authority. The Swedish Security Service is given the possibility of deciding on restrictions or temporary relaxations of a supervision order if circumstances have changed. The possibilities of appealing a supervision order will be the same as for detention orders, and this is a new point.</p>
<h2>Coercive investigative measures and other coercive measures</h2>
<p>Under the new law it will be possible to use coercive investigative measures irrespective of whether the alien has been expelled since they may commit a terrorism-related act or because they are a serious threat to Sweden’s security in some other way. This is an expansion in relation to the present position. In addition to the coercive investigative measures that the Swedish Security Service already has access to at present, the Service will be able, under the new law, to apply for permission for covert camera surveillance. The Swedish Security Service will also be given the right in certain cases to examine and copy the content of electronic communication equipment encountered. It will also be possible for the Swedish Security Service to apply for permission for covert surveillance of electronic communication in order to locate an alien who has not complied with their reporting obligation. So, the Swedish Security Service will continue to be able to request permission for covert interception and covert surveillance of electronic communication and postal control. The requirement for the use of covert coercive investigative measures is reduced from exceptional to special reasons.</p>
<p>In an order imposing a reporting obligation it will be possible, in the future, to prohibit an alien from leaving a defined area of stay. In urgent cases the Swedish Security Service are given the possibility of making interim reporting obligation orders when the Service lifts a detention order. If circumstances change, the Swedish Security Service will be able to decide on restrictions in and temporary relaxations of a reporting obligation order. The Service will also be able to lift a reporting obligation order or a general decision that coercive investigative measures may be used against the alien. The Swedish Security Service will be able to apply for an amendment to the disadvantage of the alien of a reporting obligation order or the use of coercive investigative measures.</p>
<p>The possibilities of using coercive investigative measures to facilitate the enforcement of expulsion orders are also increased.</p>
<h2>Legal safeguards in the use of coercive investigative measures</h2>
<p>The starting point is that the legal safeguards in the Code of Judicial Procedure will also apply to coercive investigative measures under the new law. As is the case today, the Swedish Security Service will represent the public institutions in the processing by a general court of questions of coercive investigative measures.</p>
<p>The provisions on the examination of material from the use of coercive investigative measures is retained but made clearer. The parts of recordings and notes from covert interception and surveillance of electronic communication and from covert camera surveillance that are of importance for the control of the alien will be retained for as long as is needed for that purpose. If the information may be used for any other purpose, it will have to be retained for as long as is needed for that purpose. Otherwise, recordings and notes must be destroyed as soon as possible. The regulation of the use of superfluous information from covert coercive investigative measures will be general. It will also be possible to use superfluous information for purposes other than opening a preliminary investigation or preventing crime, unless provisions in other legislation prevent this use. The Swedish Security Service will decide on the use of superfluous information.</p>
<p>The parliamentary control of the application of the new law will be the same as of the present Act. The Swedish Commission on Security and Integrity Protection will conduct supervision of the Swedish Security Service’s handling of coercive investigative measures under the new law. The Commission will also be required to control, at the request of an individual, whether the use was compliant with statute.</p>
<h2>Processing</h2>
<p>An explicit provision requiring that cases and matters under the new law are processed promptly is introduced. Measures concerning detention, supervision, coercive investigative measures and other coercive measures must always – according to an explicit rule to that effect – be proportionate. The obligation to give written reasons for a decision is expanded to cover more decisions than at present. A provision requiring that orders on supervision and reporting obligations must always be notified to the alien is introduced.</p>
<p>The possibilities for an alien to present their views orally are expanded in several respects. As the main rule, the Swedish Migration Agency will not be able to determine an expulsion matter without prior oral processing. If a detention order has not been preceded by oral processing, that processing shall be conducted as soon as possible after the detention order has been enforced. Each re-examination of a detention order will have to be preceded by an oral hearing. That also applies as the main rule in the re-examination of supervision orders. The possibility for a government minister to order an oral hearing and instruct the Migration Court of Appeal to hold it will also apply to supervision matters processed by the Government. The forms for and content of oral processing and an oral hearing are clarified.</p>
<p>Public counsel will be appointed to the same extent as at present, but the requirements regarding counsel are tightened. The main rule will be that only a member of the Swedish Bar Association who is suitable for the appointment may be a public counsel.</p>
<h2>Criminal liability</h2>
<p>Breaching a re-entry ban or a reporting obligation will continue to be a criminal offence. It will remain possible to punish a person who helps an alien who has a re-entry ban to return to Sweden or who prevents or attempts to prevent enforcement of an expulsion order for doing so. To underline the importance of the penal provisions, the maximum penalty for an alien who returns in contravention of a re-entry ban and for a person who helps such an alien to return is raised to imprisonment for two years. Correspondingly, the maximum penalty for a person who does not follow a reporting obligation order is increased. A person who breaches a ban on leaving a certain area, issued in conjunction with a reporting obligation, can also be sentenced to imprisonment for at most of two years. Fines will no longer be included in the scale of penalties for a person who helps an expelled alien to return to Sweden or who prevents or attempts to prevent enforcement of an expulsion order. The offences are of the type where the sanction should normally be imprisonment.</p>
<h2>Amendments to the Aliens Act and the Aliens Ordinance</h2>
<p>The Swedish Migration Agency will be able to withdraw an alien’s passport if there is reason to do so in view of Sweden’s security or public security. In future it will be possible for matters concerning the granting or withdrawal of alien’s passports to be security cases under Chapter 1, Section 7 of the Aliens Act. Decisions taken by the Swedish Migration Agency in such a question may be appealed to a migration court. The Swedish Security Service is given a greater possibility of appealing the Agency’s decision. This applies to decisions concerning alien’s passports and supervision in security cases. An alien in a security case – or in a case under the new law – will no longer be required to hold a passport to stay in Sweden.</p>
<p>A new explicit rule is introduced providing that an alien may be refused a residence permit on the ground of family ties under Chapter 5, Section 3 a of the Aliens Act if there are reasons to do so in view of Sweden’s security or public security. In certain cases, it will be possible to withdraw the residence permit of an alien if there is reason to believe that the alien will conduct activities linked to terrorism. The same applies when there is reason to believe that the alien will conduct state controlled industrial espionage in Sweden or another Nordic country. The period for withdrawal in these cases – and when there is a risk of sabotage, espionage or unlawful intelligence activities – will be increased to five years. If there are exceptional reasons a residence permit may be withdrawn on such a ground after the expiry of that period.</p>
<p>The law clarifies that it is the Swedish Police Authority that will enforce expulsion orders on account of a criminal offence even in security cases. However, the Swedish Police Authority will be given the right to transfer enforcement of such an order to the Swedish Security Service at its request. In certain other specific cases the Swedish Police Authority may also transfer a matter to the Swedish Security Service for enforcement.</p>
<h2>Electronic surveillance should not be introduced</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has carefully considered the question of whether electronic surveillance of aliens should be introduced in the light of the experience of such surveillance and the advantages that such surveillance could provide. In the view of the Inquiry, a system of electronic surveillance should not be introduced to control aliens who have been expelled because they are a serious security threat but who remain in Sweden despite this.</p>
<p>The reasons for not introducing such a system are strong. They are of both a legal and a technical and practical nature. Electronic surveillance can only provide information about where the alien is, not what they plan to do. There are several international examples where electronic tagging has not prevented individuals from committing terrorist attacks. Moreover, location information can already be obtained today through covert surveillance of electronic communication. The proposal of increased possibilities of using covert coercive investigative measures gives the Swedish Security Service more effective tools to prevent and avert crime than electronic surveillance can provide. The control of the aliens concerned is also reinforced through the proposal to make it possible to combine a reporting obligation with a ban on the alien leaving their normal area of stay. Moreover, electronic tagging can be expected to be very costly.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s conclusion is that the limited benefit that electronic surveillance could provide does not counterbalance the other disadvantages and the considerable encroachment on their integrity that being under constant electronic surveillance would involve for the alien. However, the Inquiry presents an outline of how surveillance of this kind could be designed.</p>
<h2>Impacts</h2>
<p>The processing of cases and matters concerning aliens who are highlevel security threats generally requires more resources than other alien matters. This applies especially to the Swedish Security Service, which investigates the conditions for and applies for expulsion. The Swedish Security Service is also responsible for the control of aliens who have been expelled because they are security threats but whose expulsion orders have not been enforced. These cases and matters also require a particularly great deal of work for the Swedish Migration Agency, the Migration Court of Appeal, the Government and the Government Offices. The broader scope of the new law means that more aliens may be expelled. This means there will be more cases and matters for the authorities concerned to deal with. More resources will also be required to control the aliens who have been expelled but who remain in Sweden despite this. However, the increase in control possibilities both through new coercive investigative measures and since coercive investigative measures can be used in more cases makes the work of the Swedish Security Service more effective. More aliens than today may also – given the broader scope of the act – be placed in detention. The fact that an alien can be prohibited from leaving a certain area also means that the control of that alien will improve. In certain respects, the proposals mean that the workload on authorities will decrease. This applies, for instance, to the Migration Court of Appeal, which will no longer make decisions on detention and supervision. Since detention orders will not need to be re-examined as often, this will reduce the workload of the Swedish Migration Agency, the Swedish Security Service and the Government. However, longer detention periods mean that there may be more re-examinations in the individual case. Public counsel may be engaged to a slightly greater extent, partly because of the broader scope of the act, but this still involves a limited number of cases and matters.</p>
<p>The proposed amendments to the Aliens Act mean that more matters may be security cases. There may also be more matters concerning the withdrawal of residence permits and more appeals in such questions. There may also be slightly more appeals concerning alien’s passports and supervision.</p>
<p>In no instance are the potential cost increases for these authorities judged to be greater than can be financed within the limit of current appropriations. However, in the case of the Swedish Security Service, resources may need to be reallocated internally.</p>
<p>Since aliens who may have the intention and ability to attack Sweden’s security will be removed or placed under harder control, the Swedish Security Service will be better provided to protect the country. The tougher reporting obligation and the fact that the Swedish Security Service will have access to more coercive investigative measures and that coercive investigative measures can be used in more situations strengthens the control of the aliens who have been expelled but whose expulsion orders it has not been possible to enforce. This is assessed as positive for crime prevention work.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions</h2>
<p>The new law should enter into force as soon as possible. Since the scope of the new law is partly based on the implementation of the proposed terrorist offences act the new law should not enter into force earlier than on the date when the terrorist offences act enters into force, which is proposed to be 1 July 2021. The other legislative proposals should enter into force at the same time as the new law.</p>
<p>If a detention order under the present Act has been enforced before the entry into force of the new law, the older provisions will be applied in the first re-examination of the detention order after entry into force. If the alien continues to be held in detention, a reexamination thereafter will be carried out under the new rules. No other transitional provisions are needed.</p>
