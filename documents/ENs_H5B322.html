<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The main task of the Inquiry has been to analyse and propose policy instruments to promote increased utilization and re-use of products in order to prevent waste. The policy instruments must provide incentives to producers and consumers alike to promote trade in used products and stimulate their repair and upgrade. First and foremost, the Inquiry must focus on products intended for the consumer market. These proposals are presented in part II of this report.</p>
<p>The Government’s overarching aim of appointing the Inquiry was to achieve a more resource-efficient and circular economy. The Inquiry has therefore chosen to describe what a circular economy involves and how Sweden can more forcefully steer in that direction. Broad national cooperation on a circular economy could become an effective strategy for both sustainability and Swedish competitiveness. These sections are contained in part I of the report.</p>
<h2>Part I: Circular economy for sustainability and competitiveness Sustainable economy</h2>
<p>The rise of the industrial society was followed by a long period of strong economic growth. It has been characterised by a linear economy which, in simple terms, is based on extracting natural resources, producing, consuming and then getting rid of the waste. This is sometimes referred to as the ‘take-make-dispose’ economy.</p>
<p>At the same time, this economic success has caused growing costs that are not visible in the economy. These ‘negative externalities’ can no longer be considered as minor side effects, but rather have led to a situation today in which the entire global society is living close to the limits of the planet’s means. Ongoing climate change is the clearest example of the unsustainability of the linear economy. But the climate is only one part of a greater challenge. Most of the negative environmental externalities we observe are due to the use of materials other than fossil energy.</p>
<p>The main problem with the linear economy is not that limited raw materials run out, but rather that the materials we use, sooner or later, get mixed up and spread around, lose their economic value, become difficult to utilise and, in many cases, end up as environmental toxins that are harmful to people and nature. The natural resources that are most clearly threatened are the Earth’s ‘green output’, the life-sustaining systems that are the basis of all the ecosystem services a functioning society builds upon.</p>
<p>A circular economy can be seen as a metaphor for an economy that operates within the Earth’s means. It is an economy where waste, in principle, is not created, but rather resources can be retained in society’s ecocycle or returned to nature in a sustainable way. This is illustrated in the graphic. (See Swedish summary.) In the circular economy, we talk about users  rather than consumers and value cycles  rather than value chains.</p>
<h2>Global competitiveness</h2>
<p>By the middle of this century, the global population is expected to increase to some 10 billion people and the global economy to be around three times larger than that of today. Already by 2030, approximately a further 3 billion people are expected to leave poverty and join the global middle class. This enormous increase in consumption will place even greater strain on natural resources and ecosystems. It is in this world that Swedish business and Sweden as a small export-dependent country must be competitive. The global markets will require smart, circular solutions.</p>
<p>A circular economy involves the more effective use of natural resources, which also enables reduced costs. Studies of the potential for a circular economy in Europe indicate possible gains for Europe’s citizens that are comparable to the gains calculated when the plans for the European Single Market were formulated in the 1980s. The</p>
<p>OECD and others describe how the circular economy can provide significant gains both for the economy and the business sector.</p>
<p>Technological developments contribute to strong and growing opportunities for the circular economy in the 21st century. This is mainly due to two technological revolutions in recent times.</p>
<p>The first is digitalisation, which affects the entire development of society and provides entirely new opportunities to monitor, measure and control materials in individual products or material cycles in society. Many services can be rendered material-free or virtual, as has been done in the case of music, books or meetings. Digital platforms for the rental of homes or premises or for sharing vehicles enable underexploited assets in the economy to be utilised.</p>
<p>The other revolution concerns the fact that renewable energy, mainly renewable electricity production, is becoming competitive without subsidies in more and more markets around the world. Thus, the circular economy can also be driven by circular, renewable energy.</p>
<p>For a circular economy, it is vital that dangerous substances do not enter the ecocycle. Achieving toxin-free materials should therefore be part of the efforts to achieve a circular economy.</p>
<p>There is a large toolbox to develop circular business models today that in many cases have the chance of becoming more competitive than the traditional models. But at the same time there are many barriers to the transition to a circular economy. Laws and regulations, institutions, taxes and subsidies, habits and patterns of thinking have been formed over a long period of time in the linear economy. The transition is also going to take a long time and require regular review and many more changes than those contained in this limited Inquiry. At the same time, it involves great potential for innovation of future sustainable business models, businesses and societies.</p>
<h2>Circular economy high on the global agenda</h2>
<p>In 2015, the European Commission presented a package of proposed measures for transition to a circular economy that were discussed in the Parliament and EU Member States. The Netherlands, Finland and Germany are examples of EU countries that have a strategic agenda for increased circular economy and increased resource efficiency.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, Japan raised this theme with its 3R Initiative (reduce, re-use, recycle) in the then G8 cooperation among the world’s largest economies. The country is pursuing regional 3R cooperation in Asia and is further developing its work nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>China’s current five-year plan contains the circular economy as a main theme and the Chinese government describes it as the country’s growth model for continuing to create economic prosperity while gaining control over the unmistakable negative environmental externalities.</p>
<p>The OECD includes the transition to a circular economy in the megatrends that affect science, technology and innovation, and is initiating new studies to describe the connection between the economy and the use of resources.</p>
<p>The common denominator in all of the leading international examples that the Inquiry has been able to study, and that are appearing to have an increasingly strong impact, is that they are being pursued as much from an industrial and economic policy perspective as from an environmental policy perspective.</p>
<h2>Sweden – early and active, but not leading</h2>
<p>Today, there are many initiatives and examples of cooperation in Sweden with a bearing on resource efficiency and the circular economy. They involve everything from major industrial companies to non-profit organisations and, not least, a number of research and innovation programmes. Most of the basic principles were politically formulated in the ‘Government Bill on the ecocycle’ in 1993. The underpinning theme of the Swedish Presidency of the EU in 2009 was the eco-efficient economy – creating more economic benefit with less resource use and fewer negative environmental externalities. The current Government has identified a circular bio-based economy as one of five ‘strategic areas of cooperation’.</p>
<p>But despite this, Sweden is not considered to be one of the leading countries in the development of a circular economy. Clearly stated ambitions and goals and a strategic context are lacking, which weakens the impact of all the ongoing individual activities.</p>
<h2>Proposal: Appoint a time-limited delegation for the circular economy</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Government should raise the transition to a circular economy to strategic level in close collaboration between central government, the business sector, regions, municipalities, the research sector and civil society. The collaboration should aim to strengthen both Swedish competitiveness and global sustainability and be designed as a part of industrial policy and Sweden’s implementation of the UN’s 2030 Agenda.</p>
<p>This calls for broadly supported and ambitious objectives, visible leadership from the highest level and a common framework for ongoing and future initiatives.</p>
<p>To initiate the work and drive the collaboration, a time-limited delegation for the circular economy should be appointed that is directly responsible to the Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation containing high-level representation from the world of politics and business, as well as others actors. The forms of concrete collaboration should be developed jointly. The delegation’s remit should include: initiating and running the process needed to launch a broad and active national cooperation, including proposals for objectives, priorities and action plans, being the contact point for all key stakeholders: government, industry, academia, regional and local level and civil society. maintaining an overview of, and facilitating effective collaboration between, all initiatives related to circular economy. In particular, the delegation can strengthen the link between innovation and policy development. providing a knowledge center for Sweden and being responsible for international intelligence, contributing to the discussion of an appropriate strategic management by objectives for Sweden's sustainability efforts and how the continued work on circular economy should be organized after the delegation has completed its work.</p>
<p>The aim should be to simplify and clarify central government control, strengthen the promotion perspective in sustainability transition and more satisfactorily unite environmental and industrial policy.</p>
<p>Product design will be a central area for promoting more circular business models. Since Sweden is a small part of a global economy and also part of the European Single Market, many concrete regulatory changes must be pursued in the EU or internationally, rather than decided nationally.</p>
<h2>Assessment: Tax shift for the circular economy</h2>
<p>There has long been broad political support in Sweden for increasing the contribution of environmental taxes and fees in favour of reducing taxes on labour. Despite this, this development has stagnated and it is now estimated that Sweden has one of the lowest proportions of environmentally related taxes among EU Member States.</p>
<p>The Inquiry discusses the possible causes of this and highlights possible routes towards more comprehensive tax shifting that could provide scope for significant labour tax reductions and thus an increased service content in consumption.</p>
<h2>Part II: Policy instruments for increased utilization and re-use of consumer products</h2>
<p>Of every SEK 100 that households spend on consumer products and reparation of those products, only SEK 0,80 goes to repairs. Spendings on rental and purchase of second-hand consumer products are also very small. These figures portray a throw-away economy rather than a circular economy. New and advanced policy instruments are needed to change this trend.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has studied what obstacles exist to the increased utilization and re-use of products. The most important obstacle is price relations. It is often more expensive to have a product repaired than to buy an identical, new one. Renting products and finding help to sell second-hand products is also relatively expensive.</p>
<p>Other examples of obstacles are that repairs, the renting of products and the trade in second-hand products are time-consuming for consumers, the markets for second-hand goods and repair services are held back by rules adapted to waste, and circular design has had little impact on the manufacture of new products. In addition, demand is limited due to consumers’ preference for new things and models.</p>
<p>When considering new or amended policy instruments for addressing these obstacles, the Inquiry applied selection criteria on the basis of its terms of reference, other ongoing or completed inquiries, and the broad impact of and concrete feasibility of the proposed measures.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s concrete proposals are described below.</p>
<h2>Proposal: Increase access to car pools</h2>
<p>Most privately owned cars remain parked more than 90 per cent of the time. Car pools are a way of increasing the degree of car use and thus reducing the need for parking spaces and production of new cars. Many municipalities would like to promote car pools, but as there is no definition of what a car pool is and no legal basis for favouring them, municipalities have not been able to do so.</p>
<p>To increase access to car pools, the Inquiry has drawn up a proposal for statutory criteria for what is to be considered a publicly available car pool vehicle that can then be used as a basis for central government or local promotion measures. Car pools should be given the opportunity to apply to the Swedish Transport Agency for vehicles meeting the criteria to be registered as publicly available car pool vehicles in the Vehicle and Driving Licence Registry. In addition, the municipalities should be given the opportunity to reserve street space as car pool parking space, through local traffic regulations.</p>
<p>The effects of this proposal are expected to be a reduced need for new production of cars, a reduced need for parking space and lower emissions from car journeys. This will facilitate housing construction and planning for sustainable cities. The administrative costs are expected to be relatively limited.</p>
<h2>Proposal: Introduce tax deductions for rental goods, secondhand goods and repairs (hyber)</h2>
<p>The tax deductions for repairs that were previously introduced within the system of tax deductions for household work (RUT) and for building repairs and maintenance (ROT), as well as reduced VAT for certain repairs, have attracted a great deal of attention internationally. The Inquiry proposes that the next step should be taken to encourage households to repair, rent and sell on consumer products: a ‘hyber’ deduction.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, households would receive a tax reduction (as with the ROT and RUT deductions) when they repair or rent consumer products or buy services to sell second-hand products. We propose that the tax reduction amount to 50 per cent of the labour cost of these services. This tax reduction would reduce the tax wedge for households that buy ‘hyber’ services.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has chosen a model with low administrative costs thanks to the use of a standard rate when calculating the size of the tax reduction. To combat abuse of the tax reduction, the Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Tax Agency be given greater possibilities for checking that the services carried out really are those intended for the tax reduction.</p>
<p>The proposal, known as the ‘hyber deduction’, is expected to result in some 10 000 new jobs, of which a considerable proportion would be expected to go to people born abroad. The proposal would therefore have positive effects for the labour market, integration and the environment.</p>
<p>The proposal would result in central government tax revenue being approximately SEK 0-1.8 billion lower per year, partly depending on what proportion of new jobs that goes to people that are currently unemployed.</p>
<h2>Proposal: Make it easier for households to avoid waste</h2>
<p>Municipalities have an important role to play in reducing levels of household waste. The Swedish Environmental Code states that the municipality’s measures for preventing waste should be described in the municipality’s waste plan. However, the obligation on the part of the municipality to describe measures to prevent waste is not linked to any explicit obligation to prevent household waste in the municipality.</p>
<p>We propose that the role of the municipality in preventing waste be made clearer. Clearer responsibility could create a higher level of ambition and lead to more strategic work on these issues. Municipalities should be given the obligation to inform inhabitants about how they can take measures to prevent waste, and to take measures themselves to make it easier for households to reduce their waste by enabling the collection of recyclable products. Finally, we propose that the municipalities be given the possibility of financing certain measures to prevent household waste with the help of refuse collection fees.</p>
<p>The costs for the municipalities are expected to amount to between SEK 75 million and SEK 150 million per year. The municipalities can opt to finance this expense through an increase in the refuse collection fee.</p>
<h2>Proposal: Prevent waste in central government and municipal activities</h2>
<p>Municipalities and government agencies have a particular responsibility for preventing waste in their activities – to set an example to private individuals and companies, and as users of tax revenues. In its role as procurer, public administration also has the opportunity to steer markets towards toxin-free, low-waste and circular products, services and business models. However, the progress made in terms of efforts to prevent waste in their activities varies considerably between municipalities and government agencies.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the municipalities’ obligation to prevent waste in their activities be made clearer by making the rules that govern municipalities’ waste plans more precise. The waste plan should contain information about waste prevention in the municipality’s own activities and about how the municipality is working to reducing the levels of household waste.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Inquiry proposes that government agencies be given an obligation to prevent waste in their activities, within the framework of their environmental management system.</p>
<p>The Inquiry believes that the Government should consider giving temporary financial support to municipalities for strategic work to prevent waste in the municipalities’ activities, and instructing the National Agency for Public Procurement to develop measures and criteria for circular procurement.</p>
<p>The proposals are expected to result in increased costs for more employees in the municipalities in the region of up to SEK 200 million. The proposals have the potential to reduce the government agencies and municipalities’ purchases and costs by approximately SEK 2 billion per year, which is expected to result in a reduction in climate emissions of 45 000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year.</p>
<h2>Proposal: Strengthen the right to complain about substandard products</h2>
<p>Sweden should work towards rules that govern more sustainable product design. As part of this, the Government should work to move the burden of proof in consumer law by extending the period in which the seller has to prove that no defect existed at the time of delivery, from the current six months to two years. Not until two years have passed, therefore, should the burden move to the consumer to show that the flaw was present at the time of delivery. The Inquiry considers that such an amendment would strengthen consumer protection and could steer product design in a more sustainable direction.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that Sweden should work towards the rules being determined at EU level. If EU negotiations do not produce the desired results, Sweden should make use of the possibility of going further with national regulations than the EU’s minimum rules.</p>
<h2>Proposal: Strengthen confidence and increase legal rights within second-hand trade and sharing</h2>
<p>The Government should work to strengthen confidence and legal rights in the trade of second-hand products and the sharing of products. Examples of measures the Government should consider include: reviewing the Swedish Consumer Agency’s remit concerning trade between private individuals; investigating the need for certification systems or codes of conduct for second-hand trade, particularly in the area of secondhand electronic goods, and, if such a need exists, developing these systems or codes of conduct; instructing relevant agencies to produce guidance documents describing when re-use should generally be avoided for environmental or security reasons; and instructing relevant supervisory authorities to together look into how the EU’s product safety regulations should be interpreted with regard to trade in second-hand products.</p>
<h2>The proposals as a whole</h2>
<p>If the whole package of measures is implemented, we consider that the proposals will reinforce each other. For example, the tax deduction for repairs, renting, sharing and second-hand sales will only really have the impact of changing the system when combined with measures to stimulate product design and circular business models.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals would have an impact across the board and would not only strongly enhance waste prevention work, in line with the inquiry’s remit; they would also send out the clear signal that Sweden is starting to steer towards a sustainable circular economy.</p>
