<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In this report we describe our work and our proposals for free choice in the area of social services. The report begins with a description of how the free choice systems have been developed and their importance for users. We then describe our survey of existing providers and our comparison of quality, costs and efficiency between the municipalities that apply the Act on free choice systems and those that do not. We also shed light on the link between dividends, compensation systems and quality, as well as issues concerning quality assurance and economic monitoring. The report concludes with our proposals concerning the extent of free choice and how users can be supported when choosing a provider.</p>
<h2>Development of free choice systems and their importance for users</h2>
<p>The Act on free choice systems entered into force fairly recently, on 1 January 2009. It is therefore not surprising that there is little data to measure the importance of the system for users. This lack of data means that the conclusions we can draw should only be seen as indications of the effects the introduction of the Act on free choice systems has had.</p>
<p>In October 2013, 181 of the country’s 290 municipalities had introduced or decided to introduce free choice systems within one or several service areas. This can be compared with the situation before the Act on free choice systems entered into force, when some 40 municipalities offered various forms of customer choice. The area in which it is most common to establish free choice systems is home-help service.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for introducing the Act on free choice systems was that a variety of providers would mean that services would be better adapted to users’ needs. Our study shows that the number of providers has risen sharply and that over 70 per cent offer services with specific profiles – language being the most common profile.</p>
<p>The surveys conducted indicate that users are satisfied with and appreciate the possibility to choose. A majority of users in the survey we conducted believe that the free choice systems in home-help service in the municipalities in question should remain in place. In our user survey, 45 per cent of the users stated that they had chosen their provider. The users who had made an active choice were more satisfied with their home-help than those who had not.</p>
<p>The fact that more users do not make an active choice could be because they find it difficult to choose and to distinguish between the various providers. The timing of one’s choice – which in many cases coincides with illness or an accident – is probably also significant when it comes to the ability of users to make an active choice. However, the users that do make a choice do not consider the choice to be difficult. The fact that many users do not move to a new provider may have to do with the fact that they are satisfied and do not see any need to choose a new provider.</p>
<p>Concerning the impact of the free choice systems on quality, the Inquiry’s study does not reveal any difference in customer satisfaction between the municipalities studied that do apply the Act on free choice systems and those that do not.</p>
<h2>All municipalities should offer users freedom of choice in home-help service and users should be supported when making their choice</h2>
<p>Our view, which is partly based on our own survey, is that users appreciate having the possibility to choose a provider of home-help service and that the possibility to choose should not be dependent on which municipality you live in. We therefore propose an amendment to the Social Services Act that would oblige all of Sweden’s municipalities to create the conditions for users to choose between various providers of home-help service. To be able to take into account the municipalities’ different circumstances, our proposal involves municipalities deciding for themselves the extent to which home-help service is to be covered by the municipality’s free choice solution. In addition, the municipalities would determine whether free choice should be offered under the Act on free choice systems, the Public Procurement Act or a combination of these acts.</p>
<p>One of the prerequisites for users being able to take advantage of the benefits of free choice is that they make an active choice. Our view is that those who are responsible for providing information should be able to guide users in their choice. We propose that the National Board of Health and Welfare be instructed to produce guidelines to support staff in their work to inform and guide users when choosing a provider. The National Board of Health and Welfare should also produce guidelines on how information can be communicated to users with reduced decision-making capacity.</p>
<h2>Costs, quality and efficiency in home-help service</h2>
<p>We have compared costs, quality and efficiency between 65 municipalities that apply the Act on free choice systems and 69 municipalities that do not.</p>
<p>We cannot see any differences between the two groups of municipalities that can be attributed to the Act on free choice systems in terms of quality or efficiency. In terms of the costs, we note that the rise in costs has been lower in the municipalities that apply the Act on free choice systems than in those that do not.</p>
<h2>Link between quality and value transfers to owners</h2>
<p>We also have analyzed the link between quality and value transfers to the owners of 14 companies who are part of two municipality’s free choice systems regarding home-help services. As a result of the limited number of companies and methodological problems when carrying out the analysis, this analysis should be seen as one possible way of illustrating the link between value transfers and quality. In our view it is not possible to draw any general conclusions from the results.</p>
<p>In the companies studied, it is not possible to ascertain any clear link between the users judgment of quality and value transfers to the company owners.</p>
<h2>Information that is easily accessible and quality-assured</h2>
<p>• The National Board of Health and Welfare should be tasked with developing and administering guidelines on how information in free choice systems can be communicated to people with reduced  decision-making capacity.</p>
<p>• The National Board of Health and Welfare should also be tasked with developing and administering guidelines to support staff who inform users about provider choice.</p>
<p>• A total of SEK 4 million should be allocated to finance the two sets of guidelines.</p>
<h2>Greater freedom of choice</h2>
<p>• A new provision should be introduced to the Social Services Act to the effect that all municipalities are to create the conditions for users to choose their  home-help service provider.</p>
<p>• Municipalities should determine themselves which parts of homehelp service are to be included in the free choice system.</p>
<p>• Municipalities should also determine the method of procurement to be used to achieve freedom of choice.</p>
<p>• The municipalities that have not examined the issue of freedom of choice or that have examined the issue and subsequently decided not to introduce the system should be able to apply for incentive grants to implement free choice systems. A total of SEK 45 million should be set aside for this purpose. The grants should be distributed by the National Board of Health and Welfare upon application.</p>
<p>• In order for municipalities to be able to examine whether it is appropriate to procure special housing under the Act on free choice systems, SEK 10 million should be allocated for incentive grants. The grants should be distributed by the National Board of Health and Welfare upon application.</p>
