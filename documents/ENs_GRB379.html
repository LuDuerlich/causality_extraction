<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>Injury is the most common cause of death among children and young people. Conditions in their living environments and one-off trigger factors play a significant role in why and how injuries occur. Research shows that there are several trigger factors that are significant contributory causes of injury among children. These include their experiences in school, for example, harassment from other pupils or feelings about poor school performance. The effects of these factors have to date not been examined in Sweden.</p>
<p>To be able to document how trigger factors affect injury risk it is not sufficient to have access to information from patient records and other data. Children's own accounts of what happened at the time of injury, how it happened and what happened before the injury are necessary. Information on the situation of children in their school environment and other aspects of their living environments should also be collected.</p>
<p>This type of interview study has been undertaken at Astrid Lindgrens Children's Hospital for two academic years. This hospital's reception area comprises the entire county of Stockholm. The project is based on interviews with injured children aged ten years and over who have been kept in hospital at least one night or who have been called for a return appointment. Just over 600 children gave voluntary interviews during the 2000/2001 and 2001/2002 academic years. The questionnaire responses of the injured children's parents were used in this report to show the degree to which they were satisfied with their children's schools and their views on their children's school situation.</p>
<p>The report is a summary of the results of the study compiled to date. The study is primarily aimed at increasing knowledge about the trigger effect of the above-mentioned school experiences in relation to injury risk for children. With its over 600 interviewed children between the ages of 10 and 15 years and with its detailed descriptions of how each injury occurred and of the school situation of the child, the study is one of the few surveys available</p>
<p>of this size. It gives an insight into the injury patterns of the interviewed children, the circumstances of injury and the school environment. The material collected is based on the children's own accounts.</p>
<p>The results presented in the report are based on the following questions:</p>
<p>• What is characteristic of children's injuries?</p>
<p>• What injury patterns emerge in connection with games and sport?</p>
<p>• To what extent is harassment at school a trigger factor for injuries among children?</p>
<p>• What are the particular characteristics of injuries caused by violence?</p>
<p>• What is the situation of children at school?</p>
<p>In addition to these specific questions, two other aspects have been taken into consideration throughout the study: differences between boys and girls and between younger and older children. The children's ages vary from between 10 and 15 years and two age groups have been considered: 10–12 and 13–15 years.</p>
<p>The report shows that injuries occur more often outside than during school time, that is, before and after school and on schoolfree days. School-related injuries occur primarily during lesson time (particularly during physical education lessons) but also during the breaks.</p>
<p>As expected, injuries are more common among boys than among girls; approximately two out of three injured children are boys. The proportion of injuries increases between the ages of 10 and 13 and is subsequently relatively constant.</p>
<p>Most injuries occur as a result of falls at the same level or from heights (just over 40 and around 25 per cent respectively). Almost one in three injuries was caused by collisions/blows/clashes with another person or object (29 per cent). Falls from heights occur somewhat more often among girls and younger children and collision/blows/clashes among boys and older children.</p>
<p>In other respects, there are no marked differences between boys and girls, or between 10–12 year olds and 13–15 year olds with regard to, for example, the external factors surrounding the injury, injured body parts or type of injury. However there are differences in terms of the kind of activity during which the injury occurred.</p>
<p>This is evident when considering the injuries occurring during games and sports (three out of four injuries), where five typical injury patterns have emerged: riding accidents; football and other team and contact sport accidents; gymnastics accidents; accidents while skateboarding or in other activities involving speed; other injuries during games. While 90 per cent of riding accidents involved girls, boys were over-represented in most other injury patterns apart from gymnastics accidents where the gender distribution was more equal. Furthermore riding accidents and accidents occurring during team and contact sports were more common among older children, while the three other patterns were more common among the youngest children.</p>
<p>The study shows that harassment by other pupils is not only a common phenomenon in the school environment of many injured 10–15 year-olds, but is also a factor that affects their safety, directly or indirectly. Harassment acts directly as a causal mechanism behind intentional physical injury and indirectly as a trigger factor in other cases of injury, most of which were unintentional. In the latter case, the results show that the effect of the trigger factor is shortterm, i.e., that 15 minutes after the child has been harassed. The risk of physical injury is then more than 4 ½ times higher (relative risk = 4.6) than during periods in which the child was not harassed. This increased risk varies, though not significantly, with the gender or age of the child.</p>
<p>The most probable underlying mechanism that triggers physical injuries is that of perceptual deficits (i.e., in peripheral vision) and related response changes occasioned by stressful situations as a result of harassment.</p>
<p>The study also shows that there is a quantitative and qualitative difference in the way in which one-off victims and those who are often victims (so-called bullied children) are harassed by other pupils. This difference is connected with the age of the child and can be seen among girls but not among boys.</p>
<p>From another angle, the result shows that just over one-third of the injuries were registered as interaction injuries, i.e. that a second party was directly involved. These most often occurred during games or sports with school mates, something that children normally spend their time doing. In any event it is interesting to note that some injuries occurred in situations in which the other person(s) involved did not intend to cause a serious injury but was definitely able to do so (for example, through the child getting hit</p>
<p>by a hockey stick, or being kicked and stepped on the arm after colliding with another player).</p>
<p>Injuries also occur during what children themselves call “joke fights”. While playing with a friend, and during the joke fight, something happened that caused the child to be injured (for example losing one's balance or receiving a bump).</p>
<p>Last but not least, 24 injuries were caused by actions of violence, where there was a clear intent to injure the victim. In this connection, another important finding of the study is that children who end up in hospital after an intentional injury during the school term probably know the perpetrator(s). In these cases, it is not uncommon for the perpetrator(s) to come from the same school and it is likely that children who have been beaten have been victims of harassment from the same perpetrator(s) in different ways before the episode that led to hospitalisation. These victims are almost exclusively boys, as are the perpetrators, who are often older.</p>
<p>From a more general perspective, this study represents an attempt to understand the individual mechanisms underlying the occurrence of injuries in childhood, a research area that has not been studied particularly thoroughly. Sweden has come a long way when it comes to building safety into the child's environment (socalled passive prevention). However we need to learn more about how children experience their environment, what influences their activities, and what can distract their attention and in different ways undermine their safety. The study of trigger factors for injuries is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that the interviews with children were undertaken as early as possible after the injury occurred. This implies that the results are highly reliable but may have meant that some children were in quite a serious condition when they were interviewed.Despite their medical condition, all the interviewed children have agreed to give an account of what happened and discuss some aspects of their school lives with their interviewer. Many people will find it valuable to be able to learn about the experiences of injured children and to reflect on injury-prevention directed at children and perhaps also on the working climate of children at school.</p>
