<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit of the inquiry</h2>
<p>Under the Inquiry’s terms of reference its remit has been to present proposals for the implementation in Swedish law of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, i.e. Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council.</p>
<p>The remit has included the presentation of proposals for the legislative amendments considered necessary and other measures that may be warranted by the Directive. In addition, the Inquiry has been free to present the other proposals that its work may lead to. The terms of reference place particular emphasis on the importance of gearing implementation of the directive as far as possible to current legislation in the area of market law.</p>
<h2>Current legislation</h2>
<p>The Marketing Act (1995:450) contains the fundamental regulations concerning advertising and other marketing in Swedish law. This Act entered into force on 1 January 1996, replacing the 1975 Marketing Act, and aims to promote the interests of consumers and business in connection with the marketing of products and to prevent marketing that is unfair to consumers and traders.</p>
<p>The Act builds on two general clauses on unfair marketing practices (Section 4, first paragraph) and on the duty to provide information (Section 4, second paragraph), which are supplemented with a catalogue of specific rules concerning identification of advertising, misleading advertising, comparative advertising, unsolicited products, misleading invoices, sales promotion offers, guarantees, unsolicited advertising and other matters (Sections 513 d). In addition, Sections 17 and 18 contain special provisions prohibiting the marketing of unfit products.</p>
<p>The Marketing Act already implements in full or in part a number of EC Directives, including Council Directive 84/450/EEC of 10 September 1984 concerning misleading and comparative advertising.</p>
<p>There are supplementary provisions on marketing and requirements concerning the provision of information in a number of other statutes. Many of these implement Community legislation in full or in part. They include the Package Tours Act (1992:1672), the Tobacco Act (1993:581), the Alcohol Act (1994:1783), the Act on Consumer Protection in Timeshare Contracts (1997:218), the Price Information Act (2004:347) and the Distance and Doorstep Selling Act (2005:59).</p>
<h2>The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive</h2>
<p>The purpose of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive is to contribute to the proper functioning of the internal market and to achieve a high level of consumer protection. This is to be realised through the full harmonisation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of Member States on unfair commercial practices harming consumers’ economic interests.</p>
<p>During a six-year transitional period Member States may apply national provisions within the field approximated by the Directive that are more far-reaching than the provisions of the Directive and that implement directives containing minimum harmonisation clauses. Such national provisions must be essential and proportional. The Commission must be notified about any national provisions.</p>
<p>The central provision of the Directive is a general clause setting out a general prohibition of unfair commercial practices (Articles 5.1–5.2). The general clause is supplemented with provisions on misleading and aggressive commercial practices (Articles 6–9). The basic criteria for when a commercial practice shall be deemed to be unfair are that it must be contrary to the requirements of professional diligence and that it is likely to lead to an average consumer making a different commercial decision from what he would otherwise have made.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Directive contains an Annex listing some 30 commercial practices that are considered unfair in all circumstances.</p>
<h2>A new Marketing Act</h2>
<p>The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive and the current Marketing Act are built up according to the same basic model, with a general clause supplemented by more specific prohibitions. However, full implementation of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive requires a large number of amendments and additions to the Marketing Act. These amendments and additions are so sweeping and comprehensive that the Inquiry proposes replacing the present Act with a completely new Marketing Act. The proposed new Act builds on and has the same structure as the 1995 Marketing Act.</p>
<h2>Scope</h2>
<p>The Marketing Act is applicable when traders market or seek to acquire products as part of their business, irrespective of whether the marketing is directed at consumers or traders. In the Act marketing means advertising and other measures taken in the course of business that are intended to promote sales and availability of products. This means that the marketing concept does not cover measures after agreements have been entered into. The Act primarily has the economic interests of consumers and traders in view. However, non-economic interests of consumers and traders such as the protection of health and safety are among the interests protected by the Act.</p>
<p>The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive is applicable to unfair commercial practices that harm the collective economic interests of consumers. The concept commercial practice includes a trader’s acts, omissions or other measures before, during or after the sale or delivery of products. The scope of the Directive is thus both narrower and broader than the scope of the Marketing Act at the same time.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the new Marketing Act shall be applicable to marketing in the accepted sense of the concept and to the use of other commercial practices, i.e. even to commercial practices after an agreement has been entered into, such as misleading conduct concerning complaint and limitation periods. According to the Inquiry’s proposal the new Act will also be applicable to measures directed at both consumers and traders. This means that the Act will implement both the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive and the 1984 Directive on misleading and comparative advertising.</p>
<h2>A general clause on unfair commercial practices</h2>
<p>The Marketing Act contains a general clause on unfair marketing. The general clause provides that marketing must comply with good marketing practice and be fair to consumers and traders in other respects. Good marketing practice means good commercial practice and other established standards aimed at protecting consumers and traders in the marketing of products.</p>
<p>According to the general clause in the Directive, a commercial practice is unfair if it is contrary to the requirements of professional diligence and it is likely to result in an average consumer making a different commercial decision from what he would otherwise have made. Professional diligence is defined in the Directive as the standard of special skill and care that a trader may reasonably be expected to exercise towards consumers, commensurate with honest market practice and/or the general principle of good faith in the trader’s field of activity.</p>
<p>The Inquiry makes the assessment that the general clause in the Directive corresponds in all essential respects to the general clause in the present Act and therefore proposes transferring it in largely unaltered form to the new Act. However, it is proposed that the expression good marketing practice be replaced by good market practice.</p>
<h2>The trader’s duty to provide information</h2>
<p>The present Marketing Act also contains a general clause on the duty to provide information, which means that a trader has a duty in his marketing to provide information that is of particular importance from the consumer perspective. The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive does not contain a corresponding duty. However, Article 7 contains provisions on misleading omissions to the effect that a trader must not omit information of material importance for consumers. This refers to information that an average consumer needs in order to take an informed transactional decision and whose omission is likely to cause the consumer to take a decision that he would not otherwise have taken.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the provisions of the Directive on misleading information be implemented through a positive duty to provide information of material importance for consumers in the meaning of the Directive. In the case of “invitations to purchase” certain information specified in the Directive about the price and characteristics of the product is deemed to be material information of importance for consumers if the information is not already apparent from the context. Information that must be given under Community law shall also be regarded as of material importance for consumers.</p>
<h2>Prohibition of misleading commercial practices</h2>
<p>In addition to the provisions on misleading omissions the Directive also contains provisions on misleading actions (article 6). These largely correspond to the position under the present Marketing Act and the 1984 Directive on misleading and comparative advertising. The Inquiry also proposes including a prohibition on the use by a trader of misleading statements and other representations in the new Act.</p>
<h2>The catalogue rules</h2>
<p>In the assessment of the Inquiry the provisions on misleading packaging sizes, the use of certain expressions like bankruptcy sale, clearance sale, bargain sale, etc. misleading invoices, unsolicited products and sales promotion offers are consistent with the Unfair</p>
<p>Commercial Practices Directive. The Inquiry therefore proposes that corresponding provisions be included in the new Act. A general requirement is that the practice must be likely to influence the consumer’s or trader’s transactional decision.</p>
<p>The provisions on comparative advertising are also largely transferred to the new Act.</p>
<p>However, in the case of the marketing of “unfit products” the Inquiry has concluded that the practical need of the provisions is so limited that there is not sufficient reason to retain them.</p>
<h2>Aggressive commercial practices</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes, like the Directive, that the new Act should contain a special prohibition on the use by traders of aggressive commercial practices. A commercial practice is aggressive if it is likely to restrict an average consumer’s or trader’s freedom of choice or conduct with regard to the product through harassment, coercion, physical violence, threats or other undue influence and thereby lead to the consumer or trader taking a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise.</p>
<h2>Other prohibited commercial practices</h2>
<p>Annex 1 to the Directive contains a list of some 30 misleading and aggressive commercial practices that shall be considered unfair in all circumstances. The Inquiry proposes that the list in Annex 1 be included in an annex to the new Act and that the Act provide that the practices specified in the annex shall always be considered unfair.</p>
<h2>Penalties</h2>
<p>In the current system a trader whose marketing violates good marketing practice or is unfair to consumers in some other way can be prohibited from continuing with the marketing. Such a prohibition can also be directed at others who have participated in the marketing. Moreover, a trader can be ordered to provide information, if the trader omits to provide information of particular importance from the consumer perspective in his marketing. An order or prohibition shall normally be combined with a conditional financial penalty.</p>
<p>In addition, a trader who intentionally or through negligence breaches the catalogue provisions of the Marketing Act can be required to pay a special fee to the state, a market disruption fee, ranging from SEK 5 000 to SEK 5 000 000.</p>
<p>Like the 1984 Directive on misleading and comparative advertising, the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive requires Member States to ensure that there are penalties for infringements of implementing legislation. The Inquiry makes the assessment that the present system of penalties fully satisfies the requirements of the Directive and proposes that the present system of penalties be retained intact in all essential respects.</p>
<h2>Implications of the Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>In the initial phase the proposed legislation will mainly require action by the Swedish Consumer Agency and the Consumer Ombudsman. Initially this will generate resource needs, which it should, however, be possible to accommodate by adjusting priorities within the activities of these agencies.</p>
<p>Harmonised legislation in the field of market law will have positive effects for business and make it easier for companies, not least small businesses, to market their products in the internal market.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s assessment is that, in other respects, the proposal will not have any implications for central government finances or any other noteworthy effects.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>According to the Directive implementing legislation must be adopted and published in Member States no later than 12 June 2007. The legislation must enter into force no later than 12 December 2007. The Inquiry’s assessment is that proposals for the necessary legislation must be presented to the Riksdag in the spring of 2007 and that this will enable the legislation to enter into force within the prescribed period, i.e. before 12 December 2007.</p>
