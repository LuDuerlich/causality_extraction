<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Our remit</h2>
<p>We have been tasked with examining and submitting proposals for changes to the functions of the Swedish Police Authority (hereafter ‘the police’) with regard to animal management. The aim is to streamline operations to enable the police to concentrate more on their core responsibilities of maintaining public order and safety and combating crime. In this report we have therefore examined whether police functions regarding animal management can be transferred to another principal and, if so, how. A specific part of the remit focuses on the economics of transferring the functions to another principal.</p>
<h2>What responsibilities do the police have for animal management?</h2>
<p>Our work has been based on the premise that police functions regarding animal management should either require the special training that police officers receive and the authority to use force or coercion to perform them, or that – from a broad management perspective – they would be performed most effectively and efficiently by the police. Based on this premise, our assessment is that police functions relating to animals should be confined to the following three core areas: police officer to use force and coercion.</p>
<p>In our view, the police should not be responsible for transporting, sheltering, selling or giving away animals, or having seized animals put down. Neither should the police follow up cases of poor animal management, issue injunctions or deal with administrative animalrelated matters. However, this must be balanced against other, opposing interests. In our opinion, the ambition to provide better conditions for core police functions must not be so far-reaching as to adversely affect the management and performance of these functions. In other words, they should be able to be performed at least as well or better by another principal.</p>
<h2>Most police functions under the Animal Welfare Act to be transferred to the county administrative boards</h2>
<p>At present, the police have a number of functions under the Animal Welfare Act (1988:534). For example, the police execute the decisions of the county administrative boards regarding seizing mistreated animals, which in practice means that the police have to transport, provide a veterinary examination, shelter, sell, give away and have animals put down. Today, the police also administer the costs related to animals that have been seized.</p>
<p>In our opinion, most of these functions should be transferred to the county administrative boards. We therefore propose that the police no longer execute the decisions of the county administrative boards involving the seizure of animals; instead, the county administrative boards should execute these decisions. The county administrative boards should also execute their decisions to sell, give away or have seized animals put down. They should also be responsible for most of the administration of the costs for sheltering animals and other costs that may arise when an animal has been seized.</p>
<p>However, in our assessment, certain other animal welfare functions should remain with the police. For instance, the police should continue to provide the county administrative boards with necessary assistance in the exercise of official supervision and enforcement of decisions under the Animal Welfare Act. The need for this kind of assistance arises, for example, when county administrative board staff are met with violence or the threat of violence in the exercise of their public authority, or it is feared that such may occur. The police should also be able to continue their responsibility, primarily during nights and weekends, for making and executing decisions concerning the seizure of animals subjected to suffering. As is the case today, such decisions should be reported promptly to the county administrative board, which should promptly determine whether they should continue to apply. We propose that when the county administrative board sustains the police’s decisions, it should promptly take over responsibility for their continued enforcement.</p>
<h2>Most police responsibilities under the Act on supervision of dogs and cats to be transferred to the county administrative boards</h2>
<p>The police currently have a number of functions concerning dogs and cats under the Act on supervision of dogs and cats (2007:1150). These include administrative matters concerning leash requirements and muzzles, issuing injunctions on marking and registration of dogs and decisions to seize dogs that cause injury or significant disturbance. If a dog is seized, it is the responsibility of the police to transport, shelter, examine, sell or give away the dog, or have it put down. The police also administer the costs related to dogs that have been seized.</p>
<p>The Inquiry Chair notes that under the general regulations of the Police Act, officers are required to intervene in cases where aggressive dogs are a danger to their surroundings. On this basis, the Inquiry Chair’s assessment is that police functions under the specific regulations of the Act on supervision of dogs and cats should be confined to apply primarily to what is required to enable police officers – in an emergency situation – to effectively avert any danger caused by dogs. However, the Inquiry Chair takes the view that most of the functions under this Act are not related to this but primarily to dealing with administrative matters and taking various practical measures that have no direct relation to core police activities. The Inquiry Chair therefore proposes that such functions be transferred to the county administrative boards. Most of the administration of the enforcement costs for seizing animals should also be transferred to the county administrative boards.</p>
<p>We propose that certain other functions under the Act on supervision of dogs and cats should remain wholly or in part with the police. If the issue of seizing a dog arises during a police intervention, the police should be able to seize the animal. It is also proposed that the police should be responsible for providing the county administrative boards with the necessary assistance to enable them to enforce decisions under the Act on supervision of dogs and cats. Certain issues concerning permission for municipal hunters and other holders of hunting rights to put cats down in built-up areas should also remain with the police.</p>
<h2>The police should retain their responsibilities related to hunting</h2>
<p>Today, the police deal with animals in various situations to do with hunting and game management. In practice, it is primarily a matter of receiving information about road accidents involving wildlife and taking action to enable the animal to be found and put down. In view of the effective cooperation that already exists between the police, other government agencies and NGOs on hunting issues, the Inquiry considers that the police should retain their existing responsibilities in this area.</p>
<h2>How should the proposals be financed?</h2>
<p>The proposals would lead to cost increases for the county administrative boards, which will be given more responsibilities, and cost reductions for the Police Authority, whose responsibilities will be reduced. We estimate that the cost increases for county administrative boards will amount to approximately SEK 60 million per year. At the same time, the county administrative boards are expected to receive approximately SEK 15 million in revenues per year in repayments from animal owners for advanced direct enforcement costs and from being entitled to the funds accruing from the sale of seized animals. We propose that the net cost increase for the county administrative boards be financed through the transfer of SEK 45 million from the Police Authority’s administrative appropriations to the administration appropriations for the county administrative boards etc.</p>
<h2>When should the changes be implemented?</h2>
<p>We propose that the new legal regulations enter into force on 1 January 2017. Older provisions will apply, for instance, if an animal is seized before the entry into force.</p>
