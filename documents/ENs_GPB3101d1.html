<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>For a long time the Sami have lived in northern Scandinavia and on the Kola Peninsula. Hunting, fishing and gathering were their means of support in former times. Of the animals hunted, the reindeer was an important one. In the course of time the traditional occupation of the Sami changed and became one of working with and following a coherent herd between various pastures.</p>
<p>The Sami's historical use of the land has given rise to a particular right to make use of property: the reindeer management right. The reindeer management right means that a person who is a Sami is entitled to make use of land and water in a particular fashion for the maintenance of himself and his reindeer. The reindeer management right is applicable to the Sami population and is based on prescription from time immemorial. Among other things, rights to reindeer pasture, hunting and fishing are included in the reindeer management right. There is an elaboration on the more detailed purport of the reindeer management right in chapter 2.</p>
<p>In accordance with the fourth part of section 2 of chapter 1 of the constitution, the Sami enjoy constitutional protection by virtue of being an ethnic minority. The Swedish Parliament has stated that the Sami in Sweden are an ethnic minority that enjoys a particular status by virtue of being the aboriginal population of their own country (prop. 1976/77:80, bet. 1976/77:KrU43, rskr. 1976/77:289).</p>
<p>In 1993 the Swedish Parliament inaugurated a special state authority, the Sami Parliament (Sametinget). The 31 members of the Sami Parliament are elected by the Sami population. On October 19th 2000, the government decided to appoint a special investigator to review the organisation of the Sami Parliament, the Sami Parliament Act (1993:327) and the regulation (1993:327) providing instructions for the Sami Parliament (dir. 2000:70).</p>
<h2>The task</h2>
<p>Our task was to submit proposals for a new reindeer management policy that would provide the basis for an ecologically, economically and culturally viable reindeer management. Moreover, we are to suggest, among other things, how reindeer management should be organised in the future, evaluate which tasks the authorities should be given in the future and investigate the relationship between reindeer management and other forms of livelihood that make use of the land area.</p>
<h2>Our starting-point</h2>
<p>In order to achieve our goal of creating the conditions necessary for a reindeer management that is culturally, economically and ecologically viable in the long term, we have formulated certain intermediate aims concerning the work on our proposals. In order for the aim to be achieved, we consider that the proposals must</p>
<p>• clarify the purport and regulation of the civil right, the reindeer management right, on which the Sami villages base their use of land and water.</p>
<p>• clarify the regulation of the relationship between the reindeer management right and the right of ownership so that the collaboration that has to take place on the local level is based on clear rules regarding the mutual consideration that users of the land are obliged to show to each other.</p>
<p>• increase the influence of the members of the Sami villages in their own organisations.</p>
<p>• give the Sami villages and the Sami Parliament an increased influence over the administration of reindeer management and the grants and compensations that apply to reindeer management and</p>
<p>• give all Sami the possibility of becoming members in the Sami village from which they can trace their origins and give the Sami villages the possibility of deciding for themselves the conditions that apply for exercising membership in a Sami village.</p>
<p>Our proposals for increased influence for the Sami villages presume that the inquiry into the organisation of the Sami Parliament leads to clarification concerning the Sami Parliament, both as an authority and as an institution elected by the people.</p>
<h2>The aims of a new reindeer management policy (chapter 4)</h2>
<p>Our task has thus been to submit proposals for a reindeer management policy that provides the basis for reindeer management that is culturally, economically and ecologically viable in the long term. We therefore propose three aims for the reindeer management policy. These aims concern culture, economics and the environment. These three aims are mutually interdependent and none of them can be said to take precedence over the others.</p>
<p>Cultural aim</p>
<p>The efforts of the Sami to maintain and develop reindeer management and other traditional Sami enterprises as a basis for Sami culture, are to be encouraged.</p>
<p>An important consequence of this aim is that it is the priorities of the Sami themselves, within the framework that is at their disposal, that are to be decisive with respect to how the state is to formulate various measures of encouragement.</p>
<p>Sweden has made international commitments that can be viewed as a framework for a cultural aim. By means of these, Sweden has undertaken to foster the prerequisites that are necessary in order for persons belonging to an ethnic minority to maintain and develop their culture and preserve the principal components of their identity, namely religion, language, traditions and cultural heritage. In this context culture has been deemed also to include the traditional use of land by minority groups, for example.</p>
<p>Economic aim</p>
<p>As far as possible, the Sami are to have the prerequisites in order to develop and maintain a Sami industry based on reindeer management.</p>
<p>As with any other industry, we have presumed that it is the entrepreneurs themselves who are to develop the industry by means of their own decisions. For this aim as well it is important premise that the Sami should, as far as possible, make the decisions concerning their own affairs.</p>
<p>Environmental aim</p>
<p>Enterprises that make use of the support of the reindeer management right shall be conducted in a manner that shows consideration towards the long-term productive ability of the natural resources biological diversity its value for the outdoor life.</p>
<p>Reindeer management is of great significance for the maintenance of natural and cultural environmental values in the mountains. At the same time, reindeer management can also have a negative effect on the environment. In our opinion the formulation of an environmental aim for reindeer management should take this background into account.</p>
<p>Our premise is that the responsibility for the state of their industry should rest with the Sami themselves. We therefore consider that an environmental aim should apply to all enterprises that are conducted with the support of the reindeer management right. Such an aim should be formulated so that the general aims of the environmental policy are achieved. At the same time this should not counteract the importance of these resources for Sami industry and culture.</p>
<h2>The administration of the reindeer management right (chapter 5)</h2>
<p>With the support of the reindeer management right the Sami conduct reindeer management, hunting and fishing within the reindeer management area. The reindeer management area comprises approximately one third of the territory of Sweden in the counties of Norrbotten, Västerbotten, Jämtland, Västernorrland, Gävleborg and Dalarna.</p>
<p>In order to make use of the reindeer management right, a person who is a Sami must be a member of a Sami village. What constitutes membership is determined by the reindeer management act. The Sami village is a legal entity in itself and there are particular regulations concerning how it is to be organised. However, it is the individual members who conduct reindeer management, operating in the form of a private firm, for example.</p>
<p>Each Sami village is linked to a specific part of the reindeer management area, the village area. According to the reindeer management act, it is the county administrative board that makes the decisions concerning the division in the village area.</p>
<p>Reindeer management may be conducted throughout the year in the Sami territories of Norrbotten and Västerbotten counties, partly above the limit of cultivation, partly below this limit on land where forest reindeer management is traditionally conducted in the spring, summer or autumn on land belonging to the state or that belonged to the state on the last day of June 1992 (Crown Lands) or constitutes reindeer pasture on reindeer mountains in Jämtland county within those areas in Jämtland and Dalarna counties that belonged to the state on the last day of June 1992 and that were specifically made available for reindeer pasture.</p>
<p>Reindeer management may be carried out from October to April in other parts of the Sami territories below the cultivation limit, within such areas outside the Sami territories and reindeer mountain pastures where reindeer management has traditionally been conducted during certain times of the year.</p>
<p>We propose that the Sami Parliament, instead of the county administration boards, should make decisions concerning divisions in the village areas. As a rule, before the Sami Parliament makes such decisions, a meeting should be held with the Sami villages affected. However, it is not necessary to hold such a meeting if the Sami villages are in agreement and if the division is suitable for its purpose. The property owners affected should be given the opportunity to express their opinions concerning the planned division.</p>
<p>Our proposal concerning new rules with respect to divisions within village areas does not mean that previous decisions with respect to divisions automatically cease to apply.</p>
<p>The Sami village</p>
<p>We consider that even in the future there should be obligatory rules concerning a Sami village. This means that the law should contain a provision to the effect that there should be a Sami village within a particular area for the administration of the reindeer management right.</p>
<p>The background to this proposal is that we presume that the reindeer management right is primarily a collective right. It belongs to the Sami population and is exercised today by members of a Sami village. We have found that a legal regulation that there should be a Sami village within a particular area in order to administer the reindeer management right, is the most expedient solution.</p>
<p>We propose that as far as possible the rules for the Sami village should be the same as those for economic associations. This means, among other things, that the Sami village shall be solely responsible for its debts. The members shall no longer be personally liable for the debts of the Sami village. Special rules for the Sami village are required when it comes to matters concerning the founding and dissolution of the Sami village and questions of membership.The prohibition against Sami villages conducting any other kind of enterprise than reindeer management is to be abolished.</p>
<p>We propose that the Sami village is to accept as members all Sami who can trace their ancestry from the Sami village. The requirement that a member is to be a Sami does not apply to the spouse of a member. If there is disagreement, the Sami Parliament must be able to decide the matter of whether an applicant is a Sami or originates from a Sami village. As a general rule, every member who is of age should have one vote, when voting takes place. If at least one member demands it, each member shall have one vote for every reindeer he or she owns when it comes to matters concerning reindeer management, hunting and fishing.</p>
<p>Special act concerning the reindeer management right</p>
<p>Among other things our task has meant that we have carried out a complete review of the legislation concerning reindeer management. We propose that the reindeer management act should be replaced by two acts: the reindeer management right act and the conduct of reindeer management act.</p>
<p>There are regulations in the reindeer management right act, the nature of which primarily pertains to civil law. These are regulations that describe how the reindeer management right may be exercised in practice, the area where it applies, who is to administer it and what the relationship is between the reindeer management right, the right of ownership and other particular rights to real estate.</p>
<p>At the present time, both the civil law circumstances and how reindeer management is to be conducted are regulated in the reindeer management act. As a result it can happen that the reindeer management right is not always perceived as a particular right to real estate. The purpose of proposing two acts is to make it clear that it is partly a question of a particular right to real estate and partly an enterprise undertaken with the support of this right.</p>
<h2>Consideration and collaboration between Sami villages and other users of land (chapter 6)</h2>
<p>The Sami villages conduct reindeer management based on natural pasture within the reindeer management area. Many other types of land use take place within the same area. In order to create good prerequisites for a reindeer management that is culturally, ecologically and economically viable in the long term, consideration must be taken of the need that the Sami villages have of land for reindeer management based on natural pasture and of the increased collaboration between the Sami villages and other users of land. Such collaboration must be based on mutual respect and consideration for mutual rights and needs to use the land for various purposes.</p>
<p>Nowadays, as in former times, disruption of the Sami villages' reindeer management occurs and conflicts concerning the use of land by the Sami villages and by others arise in several places.</p>
<p>In many cases the conflicts that arise nowadays are due to lack of clarity, not only concerning what the Sami villages' reindeer management right constitutes and how it is related to ownership rights, but also to where the reindeer management right applies.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for the conflicts concerning hunting and fishing in the reindeer management area is also due to the fact that there is a lack of clarity concerning the extent of the hunting and fishing rights that are a part of the reindeer management right and how this right of hunting and fishing is related to the hunting and fishing rights of landowners and the state.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that there is both consideration for the need of the Sami villages for reindeer management based on natural pasture and an increased collaboration between the Sami villages and other users of land, we propose the following:</p>
<p>• a clearer regulation of the reindeer management right and how it relates to the right of ownership</p>
<p>• a clearer regulation of the consideration that must be shown by those engaged in reindeer management towards other interests</p>
<p>• a clearer regulation of the consideration that must be shown by forestry towards reindeer management</p>
<p>• increased knowledge on the part of other users of land concerning the requirements for reindeer husbandry based on natural pasture and how various types of competing use of land affects these requirements, as well as increased knowledge on the part of those managing reindeer with respect to the requirements of other users of land within the reindeer management area and how this is affected by reindeer management</p>
<p>• support for local collaboration between Sami villages and other users of land concerning the use of land. Arbitration and the resolution of conflicts in certain cases.</p>
<p>• increased participation by the Sami villages and the Sami Parliament in the  decision-making process when new use of land is planned.</p>
<p>• an investigation into the extent of each and every hunting and fishing right on both  privately-owned and state land within the reindeer management area, with particular attention being paid both to land that is set aside for the use of the Sami and which in the applicable legislation is interpreted as crown land above the limit of cultivation, and to reindeer pasture mountains.</p>
<p>On state land within the reindeer husbandry area, i. e. land that is administered by the state, we propose that consideration towards the use of land by the Sami villages for reindeer management, as well as other use of the land by the Sami, is particularly emphasised in the administration of the land. There should be ongoing consultation with the Sami villages with respect to the administration of the state land. It should be more clearly indicated that the crown land above the limit of cultivation and on the reindeer pasture mountains is primarily intended for the reindeer management of the Sami villages and other use of the land by the Sami. The National Property Board and the county administrative boards will administer this land in the future as well, but the protection of the land for the use of the Sami villages and the possibility for the Sami villages to participate in the administration of the land should be clarified. The forest Sami villages would be granted the same right to compensation for granting of usufruct within their allthe-year-round land as the right to compensation currently enjoyed by the mountain Sami villages on their all-the-year-round land according to section 34 of the reindeer management act.</p>
<h2>Reindeer management (chapter 7)</h2>
<p>We propose that the regulations that are linked to the manner in which reindeer management is conducted should be regulated by a special act. The reason for this is apparent in the preceding text where we describe the reindeer husbandry right act. The basis for our proposed legislation has been our intention to simplify the system of regulations in accordance with modern principles of administration and to ensure that the right to make decisions is delegated as far as possible.</p>
<p>Supervision of the administration of pasture resources</p>
<p>We propose that the Sami villages should account for the status of their pasture lands. On the basis, among other things, of these reports, field studies, studies of slaughter statistics and notifications of wandering reindeer and reindeer herds that have mingled, the Sami Parliament should exercise supervision to ensure that the administration of the reindeer pasture by the Sami villages lives up to the environmental aims. The Sami Parliament should also establish the maximum number of reindeer allowed for every Sami village as an additional aspect of the supervision exercised. Together with those concerned, the Sami Parliament should continually evaluate whether the established maximum number of reindeer permitted is relevant.</p>
<p>Concession reindeer management</p>
<p>Concession reindeer management is conducted below the Sami territory border in the Kalix and Torne river valleys. Reindeer management may only be conducted all the year round once the county administrative board has given one or several Sami permission (a concession) to have both their own reindeer and those belonging to the landowner in the area (managed reindeer) within a particular area. As well as the holder of the concession, the owner of the managed reindeer also participates in the reindeer management to some extent. It is the owner of the managed reindeer who, together with the holder of the concession, makes the decisions concerning how the reindeer management is to be conducted.</p>
<p>Landowners are the most common category of owners of managed reindeer. In order for a landowner to be an owner of managed reindeer, he has to own an agricultural property in the concession area and be a resident of the property or at least resident within that part of</p>
<p>Norrbotten county where the management of concession reindeer is permitted.</p>
<p>We consider that because of its cultural significance and the fact that it contributes towards employment in the area, concession reindeer management should remain. We propose that there should no longer be an obligation to conduct concession reindeer management in the Sami village format. This is the result of our proposed new regulations for the Sami village based on the administration of the reindeer management right.The relationship between the owners of managed reindeer and the holders of concessions should instead be regulated by conditions in the concession.</p>
<p>We propose that the possibility of having managed reindeer should be extended somewhat. This means that the person who owns an agricultural property in the area but is resident somewhere else in Norrbotten county should be able to have managed reindeer. The county administrative board should be given an opportunity, if there are particular reasons for doing so, to grant exemptions from the rule that the holder of the concession should enjoy a maximum of thirty managed reindeer per household.</p>
<p>We do not consider that the proposals in the inquiry concerning Muonio Sami village should be implemented.</p>
<p>Reindeer markings</p>
<p>Traditionally, the method employed in reindeer management to distinguish between the reindeer of various owners has been marks cut in the ears of the reindeer. The reindeer owners compare the reindeer markings to the certificate of registration of title, and the dexterity used in marking is part of their professional skill.</p>
<p>The appearance of the reindeer markings, the time when the marks are made and so forth are regulated in detail in the reindeer management act and the regulations pertaining to it. The reindeer markings are registered according to decisions made by the county administrative board.</p>
<p>We propose that there should always be a legal obligation to mark reindeer. The Sami Parliament should have a register of reindeer markings.The registration should protect the owner of the marking against markings that may be confused with it.</p>
<p>Other regulations concerning reindeer markings and the marking of reindeer are to be notified in ordinances or in the regulations of the Sami Parliament.</p>
<h2>Grants and compensation etc (chapter 8)</h2>
<p>We have surveyed the grants and compensation that are given to reindeer management and the Sami culture. We shall return to this in chapter 8. A summary of the result may be seen in table 8.1.</p>
<p>With the overriding aims as a basis, we propose four national aims for the grants given to reindeer management. The grants shall</p>
<p>• encourage the Sami's own efforts to develop their industry</p>
<p>• encourage an optimal use of pasture</p>
<p>• improve the financial outcome of reindeer management and</p>
<p>• foster a sustainable development of the mountains and the reindeer management area in general, acknowledging the environmental values of the countryside and culture.</p>
<p>We propose that the Sami Parliament is given the task of working out the grants given to reindeer management within the framework of the national aims for them. Moreover we propose that the responsibility for administering the funds directed towards reindeer management should be transferred from the Board of Agriculture to the Sami Parliament.</p>
<h2>The state reindeer management administration (chapter 9)</h2>
<p>Governance of the aims and results of state activities are the basis of our proposals. We have found that many tasks that are allocated to the authorities at the present time need no longer to be, and the tasks can be managed by the Sami themselves. The administration of the tasks remaining to the authorities can be simplified and a better coordination of issues concerning the Sami can be achieved.</p>
<p>We propose that the government institute a special unit within the Cabinet Office and the Ministries for all Sami issues, with one minister responsible, and that most of the tasks remaining to the authorities concerning reindeer management that are currently administered by the Board of Agriculture should be transferred to the Sami Parliament. The Sami Parliament should also be the central administrative authority (the sector authority) for issues concerning reindeer management. In addition we propose that the Sami Parliament should be responsible for the supervision needed to ensure that reindeer husbandry shows the consideration for the environment and the other matters of public interest that are prescribed in the law concerning the conduct of reindeer management.</p>
<p>We propose that the board for the Sami Fund should be disbanded and that the fund should be transferred to the Sami Parliament.</p>
<p>The county administrative boards for Norrbotten, Västerbotten and Jämtland counties should be given the responsibility for issues concerning the disposal of land in their respective areas and that the tasks for the reindeer management delegations should be clarified in the instructions for the county administrative boards.</p>
<p>As for the administrative issues concerning forestry and reindeer management, we propose that the issues remain with the County Forestry Boards and that the government finds ways of enabling the Sami to influence the decision-making process. Since our premise is that the Sami should be ensured of an influence in state decisions concerning reindeer management as a matter of public interest, we propose that the government considers appointing a Sami member of state decision-making bodies such as the board of the National Board of Forestry, the forest management boards, the National Environmental Protection Agency, the state property board, etc.</p>
<h2>Costs (chapter 11)</h2>
<p>In the long term our proposals primarily constitute a redistribution of available funds. In some cases our proposals mean that additional resources should be allocated by means of additional appropriations over and above the state budget. We propose a number of temporary contributions designed to ease the implementation of new legislation, primarily within the Sami villages, and to increase collaboration and minimise the conflicts between reindeer management and other users of the land. These temporary contributions are estimated to cost nine million Kronor per year for a three-year period. In addition we propose measures that entail in some cases the payment of compensation to reindeer management and forestry interests respectively. The cost of these measures, together with a certain increase in administration within the forest management organisation, is estimated to be 3.6 million Kronor per year. The funds should be acquired by means of a redistribution within the framework of expenditure area 23: agriculture and forestry, fisheries and related industries.</p>
