<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Swedish School Commission (Skolkommissionen) is tasked with submitting proposals that aim to improve learning outcomes, the quality of teaching and equity in Swedish schools (dir. 2015:35). In its interim report, the Commission set out proposals for national targets and a long-term plan with areas for improvement (SOU 2016:38). This final report contains concrete proposals within the areas for improvement identified in the interim report and a schedule for their implementation, as well as for the necessary amendments to statutes.</p>
<p>According to international studies, learning outcomes in Swedish compulsory schools have been declining for several decades. It is heartening that both PISA 2015 and TIMSS 2015 show improved learning outcomes in mathematics and that PISA 2015 also shows improvement in reading comprehension, thus indicating that the downward trend has been broken. In TIMSS Advanced 2015, results in mathematics were improved compared with those in 2008, but the deterioration in physics seen between 1995 and 2008 continues. Unfortunately, the results of the latest international studies show a continued negative trend when it comes to the equity of compulsory schools. The results suggest that pupils’ family background has gained a greater significance in terms of learning outcomes.</p>
<p>Previous PISA studies have shown that it is entirely possible for a country to achieve good learning outcomes at the same time as maintaining a high degree of equity. There is also evidence to suggest that there is causality, i.e. that equity in terms of there being only small differences between the knowledge of different groups of pupils leads to higher national learning outcomes. The Commission’s proposals in this report are aiming specifically at this combination of improvements.</p>
<h2>The Swedish school system is marked by serious systemic weaknesses</h2>
<p>The Swedish school system is marked by serious systemic weaknesses. This has impaired the chances of delivering high-quality teaching. The latter is vital if pupils are to be able to achieve good learning outcomes. According to the Commission, these systemic weaknesses, which are described and analysed in more detail in the interim report, consist primarily of the following deficiencies.</p>
<p>• Inadequate capacity and accountability among many education providers</p>
<p>• Shortcomings in resource allocation</p>
<p>• Inadequate skills supply to the teaching and school leadership professions and inadequate conditions for professional development</p>
<p>• Shortcomings in results information that hamper quality management</p>
<p>• School segregation that leads to differences in quality between schools</p>
<p>• Problems with the learning environment</p>
<p>• National governance of schools that is fragmented and has been inconsistent over time.</p>
<p>The shortcomings identified by the Commission have resulted in a weakened and partly fragmented school system in which there is a low degree of cooperation, collaboration and collective efforts to improve between different schools and education providers. The same weaknesses have also been noted in the OECD’s review of the Swedish school system. This applies especially to capacity deficiencies, resource allocation, the attractiveness of the teaching profession, cooperation and weaknesses in the evaluation system.</p>
<p>Although the situation is serious, Swedish schools also have strengths that must be stressed. The school system is comprehensive, extending from preschool to adult education. Pupils and legal guardians have the opportunity to choose between publicly funded, fee-free schools run by a range of providers. Relationships between pupils and teachers are good and the vast majority of pupils are happy at school. Swedish pupils perform well in, for example, English, social studies and democratic skills.</p>
<p>It is important that Swedish schools strengths are preserved and built on in future efforts to improve outcomes and equity. According to the Commission, central government has a central role to support and strengthen education providers in their important duty, at the same time as central government develops a more coherent and purposeful system of governance. It is also important to involve teachers and school leaders in future efforts to develop and strengthen the school system. The influence these professions have on the development of schools has to be strengthened, as does the professional autonomy of teachers and school heads. A long-term perspective and durability in national schools policy are other essential prerequisites for success. The assessments and proposals the Commission is submitting form an overall strategy for the school system as a whole in terms of the forms of school encompassed by the remit: preschool class, compulsory school and upper secondary school.</p>
<h2>The Commission’s proposals and strategic assessments</h2>
<p>In this report, the Commission is submitting concrete proposals for, laying the foundations for or expressing support for future processes within a range of areas for improvement as follows. These proposals combine to form an overall strategy for a robust school system with the power to develop and a high degree of equity.</p>
<h2>Strengthening education providers through central government support and collaboration A central school authority with a presence at the regional level in order to strengthen and support education providers</h2>
<p>All education providers must have sufficient capacity for their remit. Education providers will be strengthened through central government support and collaboration at the regional level. This includes dialogue concerning outcomes and supportive school inspections, systematic quality management, regional skills supply, targeted support to schools that are faced with major challenges, collaboration and sharing experiences, planning of upper secondary school and central government regulation of school heads’ responsibility to work actively to ensure compliance with national regulations.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the provisions in the Education Act concerning central government rectification measures be amended so that it is made clear that such measures should become pertinent in situations equivalent to a withdrawal of approval for a private school authority. It is to be possible for central government rectification measures to become pertinent if an order from the supervisory authority is not complied with and the issue is serious.</p>
<p>The Commission’s assessment is that the proposed amendments have the potential to make the application of sanctions more equitable within the supervision of municipal and private education providers.</p>
<h2>Basic premises of government agency oversight</h2>
<p>The Commission believes that the central government school agencies’ duties should be reprioritised so that resources are freed up for evidence-based development support and promotional efforts that are able to make an effective contribution to increased teaching quality. Central governance needs to be made clearer. The role of supervision should be to assert pupils’ rights and basic central government requirements for education providers from a citizens’ perspective. Government agency oversight should be implemented promptly.</p>
<h2>Skills supply to the school system Future initiatives to increase the number of qualified teachers and school leaders</h2>
<p>Further initiatives are required in order to ensure that the Swedish school system has access to qualified teachers and school leaders. It is important that the action taken contributes to long-term maintenance of or improvements in quality. The capacity building required is achieved not through temporary, short-term solutions, but through a long-term strengthening of the system. The strengthening of capacity and improvement in quality the Commission deems necessary will require resources and targeted initiatives.</p>
<p>In addition to investments in the regular teacher training programmes, it is vital to create access to study programmes that provide eligibility or supplement qualifications. It is also vital to create better access to study programmes that contribute to expanding teachers’ qualifications, as well as good terms and conditions for participants.</p>
<p>School heads must be given good conditions in which to undertake their duties. Position-specific training programmes for school heads are a significant aspect of this. It is vital that education providers safeguard the time school heads need to acquire the necessary training.</p>
<p>It is very important that action is taken to make it attractive for qualified teachers to want to work as teachers and to make it easier for qualified teachers who have left the profession to return.</p>
<h2>Strengthened teacher training</h2>
<p>It is important to ensure that the higher education institutions are allocated sufficient resources to run teacher training programmes of a high quality. An increased allocation of financial resources per student is one prerequisite for ensuring that the requirement for teacher-led teaching time, methodology lessons, practical exercises of various types, practical training and group discussions is met.</p>
<p>The injections of additional resources the Government has decided on should be followed up and evaluated. Additional funds may be required so that it is possible to provide high-quality teacher training at the volumes required.</p>
<p>Assessment of suitability for admission to teacher training programmes may be considered, on condition that the results of ongoing research activities support this. The question of whether to introduce higher admissions requirements needs to be investigated separately.</p>
<p>Student teachers’ preparedness for their future professional practice can be reinforced through teacher training programmes focusing more extensively on practical skills and school placements. For example, this involves providing opportunities for student teachers to develop their teaching and leadership skills in the classroom under the supervision of experienced and skilled teachers.</p>
<p>The theoretical and practical elements of teacher training need to be tied more closely together in terms of both the school placement and institutionally based parts of these programmes.</p>
<p>A strong partnership between higher education institutions and education providers is necessary if school placements are to be of a good quality. An infrastructure within the field of schools, similar to that which is guaranteed through the ALF agreement within the field of healthcare, could form a new foundation for knowledge development as a support for the improvement to the quality of teacher training programmes, for example with regard to school placements.</p>
<p>It is vital that the proportion of teachers with third-cycle educations increases within teacher training programmes in order to make these programmes more strongly evidence based.</p>
<p>The question of whether central government should invest in the establishment of what are known as centres of excellence or strong educational environments for teacher training should be investigated. Such an investment may contribute to both reinforcing quality and an increase in the status of the field of teacher training.</p>
<h2>Strengthened research capacity in order to meet the needs of schools and teacher training programmes</h2>
<p>The development of practice-centred research can take place through the higher education institutions developing environments that integrate research and teacher training and by these environments collaborating actively and closely with education providers and with schools that are interested taking an active part in research and development.</p>
<p>One way to bring evidence-based knowledge and that gained through experience is for schools to be developed into centres where practice-centres research and development is conducted. It is important for it to be made possible for schools’ lecturers and other teachers to collaborate with higher education institutions as part of their jobs by participating in and also leading research, as well as through participation in supervisor training, work placements and other development efforts.</p>
<p>General research capacity needs to be reinforced in order to enable it to meet the needs of the school system and teacher training programmes. This encompasses a long-term investment in building up a body of basic research that supports the creation of practicecentred research.</p>
<p>The way research is disseminated must be improved so that relevant research can be made more available to school leaders, teachers and other professionals working in schools. This will contribute to the development of schools and teaching. This encompasses the question of what access teachers and school leaders have to higher education institutions’ libraries.</p>
<h2>Teachers’ and school leaders’ professional development</h2>
<p>The Commission proposes that a national function for teachers’ and school leaders’ development be established. The question of how this function is to be organised and led should be managed within the scope of the government agency oversight of the schools area as proposed by the Commission. It is proposed that an interim working group begin preparing for the work of this function until such time as this inquiry has been set up.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that a national professional programme for teachers and school leaders be established. The overall aim of this programme will be to promote teachers’ and school leaders’ professional development and school development in order to create general conditions for capacity building in the school system and improved teaching.</p>
<p>A structure for capacity building at the systemic and school level and for teachers’ and school leaders’ professional development is created through this programme. The programme achieves a clear, transparent and equitable system for development during a teacher’s career, for supplying school leaders and for school leaders’ career progression.</p>
<p>The programme is to be regulated nationally. Teachers, school leaders, education providers and teacher educators are to be involved in the development and administration of the programme through the national function for teachers’ and school leaders’ development. The format of the content is to be determined locally on the basis of the needs that have been identified.</p>
<p>A number of qualification levels that clearly and transparently define progression on the basis of descriptions of what teachers and school leaders should know and do are to be established within this programme. In addition, the programme should encompass various development pathways in order to make further specialization possible. Progression through the programme is to be based on specific qualification and is to have a clear link to skills development.</p>
<p>How teachers’ and school leaders’ salaries are set shall also continue to be a matter for the social partners. The Commission is basing this on the requirements that exist to incentivise development and the taking on of greater responsibilities within the regular salary setting process.</p>
<h2>The core duties teaching and school leadership</h2>
<p>The Commission argues that it is vital for the Government to give a high priority to work to develop and digitalise national tests and to develop assessment support and knowledge evaluations. The aim of this is to make it possible for teachers to work more efficiently and to increase the equity and legal certainty for pupils.</p>
<p>It is important that schools are organised in a way that allows school heads to prioritise educational leadership and to support their teachers.</p>
<p>Allowing registered teachers to focus on teaching and freeing them from administrative and other tasks to the extent possible is also of major significance.</p>
<p>Education providers should take into account the administrative burden for teachers and school heads and be restrictive in terms of weighing them down with targets, instructions and reporting requirements in addition to those listed in national governance documents.</p>
<p>It is also important that other opportunities offered by digitalisation to make teachers’ work more efficient are taken advantage of.</p>
<h2>Increased national responsibility for school funding Following a further inquiry, a minimum level is to be set for teaching and school health and welfare services</h2>
<p>The Commission’s assessment is that funds are currently being allocated to schools with too little consideration being given to socioeconomic differences in the pupil population. Nor are there any guarantees that the education providers are devoting sufficient resources overall.</p>
<p>The Commission’s assessment is that it is important to direct resources for teaching in preschool class and compulsory school, as well as resources for School health and welfare services.</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that the central government stipulate a minimum level for each school authority’s resources for teaching and School health and welfare services. This inquiry is vital and should therefore be set up as soon as possible. It is vital to continue analysing the causes of differences between the resources education providers devote to teaching and school health and welfare services and to determine the extent to which these differences are due to varying conditions, varying ambitions or differences in terms of how efficiently the schooling is delivered. Once such an analysis is complete, the prerequisites are in place to develop the basis on which central government directs resources.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission proposes that the Government investigate the feasibility of a sector grant or other forms of national school funding. A sector grant involves central government allocating funds to the whole of or large parts of municipalities’ school operations. For example, a sector grant can be issued for teaching and school health and welfare services or for the whole school. It can be beneficial to analyse the feasibility of a sector grant within the scope of the same inquiry that is also dealing with the issue of minimum levels, but with a different schedule. The issue of minimum levels should be investigated first. It is necessary for an inquiry into a sector grant to address the rules for funding the school operations of both municipal and private education providers.</p>
<h2>A conditional central government grant to education providers</h2>
<p>The Commission proposes a conditional central government grant to education providers for teaching and school health and welfare services. This grant is based on socio-economic conditions and is to be phased in over three years. The grant applies to preschool class and compulsory school.</p>
<p>The Commission’s opinion is that SEK 6 billion is a balanced level for the purpose of making high-quality teaching and compensatory initiatives for equitable education possible. One condition for this central government grant is that the education providers agree not to reduce their own funding for teaching and school health and welfare services during the period in which they are in receipt of the grant.</p>
<p>Statistics Sweden is tasked with drawing up an annual socio-economic index on which the allocation of the central government grant is based.</p>
<p>The central government grant can be partly financed through certain targeted grants being discontinued.</p>
<h2>Education providers’ allocation to school units</h2>
<p>The Commission proposes that Statistics Sweden be tasked with drawing up annual index values for each school unit. These index values are to serve as a guide for municipal or private education providers’ allocation of funds to school units. The index values will provide education providers with a stronger support in order to assist in the allocation of resources with respect to pupils’ varying requirements for compensatory initiatives.</p>
<h2>Inquiry into the funding, size and location of upper secondary schools</h2>
<p>The Commission believes that stronger national responsibility for the funding, size and location of upper secondary schools in a regional perspective is necessary.</p>
<p>The issue of planning and size of programmes and schools is central to the utilisation of resources in upper secondary schools. Many municipalities are not able to offer their pupils a complete range of upper secondary school programmes. All around the country, there are municipal alliances and other forms of cooperation that make it possible to offer pupils a comprehensive range of programmes within a reasonable distance. However, these are not coordinated in an optimal way.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Government set up an inquiry for the purpose of drawing up a regional model for the funding and governance of upper secondary schools on the basis of stronger national responsibility.</p>
<h2>Guaranteed teaching time</h2>
<p>The Commission would like to highlight the fact that the time devoted to teaching is a factor in pupils’ knowledge development. In international comparisons, pupils in Swedish compulsory schools receive fewer hours of teaching than those in many other countries. Teaching time should be extended over the long term.</p>
<p>Teaching time has to be utilised effectively. The extent of truancy, late arrivals and unruly behaviour in the study environment must be reduced.</p>
<p>It has to be ensured in practice that each pupil receives the minimum guaranteed teaching time. Reporting and inspections need to be improved. Inspections will be made easier in compulsory schools by the introduction of a timetable broken down into stages. In upper secondary school, where the problem of lost teaching time is greater, more stringency is required. The Upper Secondary Education Inquiry’s proposal for the monitoring and reporting of teaching time should be implemented.</p>
<h2>A good environment for learning and development</h2>
<p>A good school environment is beneficial to all pupils’ learning, promotes well-being and has a positive impact on health. Factors such as classroom environment and school climate, the relationship between teacher and pupil and between pupils has a significant impact on children and adolescents’ learning and development. Teaching that is adapted to the varying needs and prerequisites of pupils and a good learning environment is beneficial to all pupils’ learning and wellbeing. This applies to those pupils who are in need of support and adaptation, those pupils who find it easier to live up to the knowledge requirements and the high achieving pupils who need additional stimulation.</p>
<h2>Initiatives for a secure learning environment that promotes peaceful study</h2>
<p>The issue of security and a peaceful study environment in schools is important in order to provide both pupils and staff with the right to a good working environment and to create a good learning environment. This underlines the link between security and a peaceful study environment, schools’ broad efforts to promote democracy and values and schools’ educational remit.</p>
<p>There are problems with the learning environment in many of the country’s schools. Many pupils do not feel secure and state that they are afraid of other pupils in school and that they feel their rights are being violated by other pupils and by teachers. It also appears that many pupils feel the study environment is not sufficiently peaceful and that other pupils are disruptive to lessons.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that school heads’ responsibility with respect to security and a peaceful study environment be set out clearly in the curriculum for compulsory school, preschool class and leisure-time centres and the curriculum for upper secondary school. The curricula are also to be supplemented so that they note that pupils are to show respect and consideration for teachers and other pupils, as well as emphasising the importance of pupils taking responsibility for their learning and contributing to a good school environment through their own effort and participation.</p>
<p>It is vital that the application of disciplinary measures in the classroom is evaluated. If this evaluation indicates there are problems in this respect, an amendment to the regulations should be conducted in order to ensure that there is sufficient legislation in this area.</p>
<p>There is a great need to both build up and disseminate knowledge in terms of working practices, methods and structures that are effective means of preventing problems pertaining to insecurity and unsettled study environments. It is of great importance that student teachers are given the opportunity to develop their classroom leadership skills under the supervision of experiences and capable supervisors.</p>
<h2>Increase support and stimulation</h2>
<p>The Swedish school system is characterised by the notions of inclusion and the right of all pupils to education. However, there are many indications that the system is not successful in terms of providing the support and stimulation that gives all children and pupils the opportunity to develop to the greatest possible extent on the basis of their own circumstances. Teaching is often directed at an average level, which means that it misses those pupils who need greater stimulation and challenges at the same time as those pupils who require additional adaptations and support do not receive them.</p>
<p>It is vital that pupils who are in need of additional adaptations and specific support are detected at an early stage and that action is taken. Advanced special education activities and initiatives for pupils who are at risk of having difficulties in school are an important aspect of the task of creating an equitable school system. There needs to be follow-up and evaluation in order to generate evidence concerning which programmes and initiatives are effective in terms of additional adaptations and specific support.</p>
<p>The proposal concerning obligatory identification and a guarantee that action is taken in the preschool class that will give pupils the right to additional adaptations, specific support and action programmes (SOU 2016:59) is one step in the right direction in terms of detecting those pupils in need of additional adaptations and specific support at an early stage. In this context, the Commission would like to emphasise the importance of what can be characterised as individual prevention, i.e. preventive individually adapted initiatives. The basic premise of these should be primarily to prevent difficulties in school, rather than having to take action at a later stage of a pupil’s schooling in order to repair the damage.</p>
<p>Documentation of pupils’ knowledge and support requirements is one prerequisite for enabling the correct action to be taken, and for allowing transitions between school years and, where applicable, between school forms to function well.</p>
<p>Pupils have varying circumstances and needs. It is the responsibility of the school to provide an education that is equitable and is, to the greatest possible extent, accessible to all pupils. The Commission’s proposals and assessments concerning stronger funding, skills development and better structures for early interventions and clearer documentation should contribute to enabling all pupils to receive the assistance they require in ordinary schools. For those pupils who have especially significant problems, another route may be required in the form of resource schools.</p>
<p>It is important that pupils who need more stimulation and challenges in their school work are given these and that teachers also adapt their teaching on the basis of the needs and circumstances of high achieving and gifted pupils’ needs and circumstances.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to underline the importance of the accumulation and dissemination of knowledge about working practices and methods of adapting teaching to the varying needs and circumstances of different pupils. This applies to both those pupils who are in need of additional adaptations and specific support and to those who are gifted and high achieving. Sweden can take inspiration from other countries that are actively working with these groups of pupils without relinquishing the ambition of an inclusive school system.</p>
<p>The knowledge and experience there is nationally and internationally in terms of promoting the knowledge development of different groups of pupils needs to be compiled, disseminated and made available to school heads, teachers and other groups of school staff.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that an inquiry be set up in order to develop, similarly to many other education systems, a coherent national system for research-based methods and working practices pertaining to initiative for pupils in need of specific support. Experiences both domestically and internationally are to be collected and studied as part of this work.</p>
<h2>Stronger and more accessible school health and welfare services</h2>
<p>Good health is an important prerequisite for coping with school. It is part of the general work of school health and welfare services to promote pupils’ learning, development and health, to prevent illhealth and learning difficulties and to contribute to create environments that promote learning development and health. School health and welfare services’ individually focused efforts involve providing support for pupils’ development towards educational goals; removing barriers to learning, development and health; detecting and investigation at the school head’s behest causes of learning problems; detecting and investigating causes of ill-health and contributing with measures and adaptation for each individual pupil in need of special support.</p>
<p>Access to school health and welfare services is insufficient in many schools and schools’ preventive and health promotion efforts all too infrequently involve a clear strategy and systematic development work. School health and welfare services do not completely meet the needs of pupils, e.g. with regard to supporting the improvement and maintenance of mental health. The work is often marked by a focus on dealing with problems, with health promotion and preventive efforts taking a back seat. Interventions are often implemented too late.</p>
<p>It is vital that school health and welfare services have the prerequisites they need to comply with the intentions of the legislator in terms of general preventive interventions, and for detecting at an early stage those pupils who need additional individually adapted support and providing them with the interventions they need within a reasonable time.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that schools’ duty to promote pupil’s health and well-being be set out clearly in the curriculum for compulsory school, preschool class and after-school recreation centres and the curriculum for upper secondary school. The question of how school health and welfare services can be made more purposeful, accessible and equitable should be investigated. The responsibility and cooperation of the government agencies concerned with respect to the field of school health and welfare services should be made clearer and should be encompassed by the government agency oversight proposed by the Commission.</p>
<p>The accumulation and dissemination of knowledge concerning working practices and methods in the field of school health and welfare services needs to be improved. This relates partly to how schools’ general health promotion efforts can be structured in order to have an impact and be an integrated aspect of school activities and partly to drawing up an evidence-based programme for preventing mental ill-health.</p>
<h2>Active school choice and reduced school segregation</h2>
<p>The Commission is of the opinion that deficient equity is a serious problem in the Swedish school system. More specifically, this problem involves a lack of quality in the teaching in certain schools or school classes and shortcomings in the performance of the compensatory assignment. The international picture is that there is covariance between small differences in results in one country and high average results. It is also important that pupils with different backgrounds meet in schools. In addition, the problem of a lack of equity appears to be increasing, judging by the results of international measurements. The ambition must be for all schools to be good schools and for no legal guardian or pupils to need to not choose a certain school because it is perceived to be less good.</p>
<p>The compensatory assignment is made more difficult in segregated environments. There is also a major risk that less is expected of pupils in these school environments. It is also more difficult to recruit experienced teachers and school heads to schools in socioeconomically vulnerable areas.</p>
<h2>Broad social composition</h2>
<p>The Commission proposes that it be stipulated in the Swedish Education Act that education providers have to work actively to ensure that the social composition of pupils in their school units is broad. The school head’s responsibility for working to ensure there is a broad social composition of classes within their school unit is to be written into the curricula.</p>
<p>This proposal creates the conditions in which education providers and school heads will be able to improve equity in the long term. This proposal may also have greater significance if stronger demands are raised in the public debate and politics for action in the area of residential planning or social planning in general in order to tackle segregation.</p>
<h2>Active school choice</h2>
<p>The Commission proposes a new provision concerning active school choice. The placement of pupils in preschool classes and compulsory schools with a municipal authority is to be done on the basis of an application from the pupil’s legal guardians. Even if no application is made, the home municipality is obliged under the Instrument of Government and the Education Act to offer a school place that is within a reasonable distance of the pupil’s home.</p>
<h2>Altered rules concerning placement in school units with municipal authorities</h2>
<p>The Commission proposes a new provision concerning placement in municipal school units that involves municipalities being given an opportunity to set aside the proximity principal when deciding on school placements from year 7, provided that the number of applicants to any given school exceeds the number of places. In such cases, the proximity principle may be replaced by a selection process that aims to promote a broad social composition and that involves taking into account the pupil’s registered address or a lottery. However, a pupil who for specific reasons requires a place in a school that is reasonably close to their home shall always have the right to such a place. Furthermore, the current provision concerning the right to remain in the school unit in which you began is not to be changed.</p>
<h2>Inquiry into the proximity principle</h2>
<p>The Commission’s proposal creates the conditions for reducing school segregation. However, it is also the Commission’s understanding that the current format of the proximity principle places restrictions on the effectiveness of municipalities’ work to ensure a broad social composition in schools and classes. Consequently, the proximity principle also restricts municipalities’ chances of reducing school segregation. There is currently room for manoeuvre within the scope of the Education Act in terms of how the proximity principle is applied. Legal practice implies that the proximity principle means relative, not absolute proximity. This means that a pupil has the right to a place at a school close to their home, but not always the school that is closest. However, there is also great uncertainty about the more detailed implications of the Education Act’s proximity principle for the rights of pupils and thus also what restriction this placed on the municipality’s chances of organising its school system in a manner that aims to reduce school segregation. The Commission is therefore of the opinion that an inquiry should be set up with the task of reviewing how the proximity principle for placements in municipal schools can be changed. The aim of this being to make it possible to give municipalities greater flexibility in terms of how they organise their school system and thus giving them a more effective tool with which to tackle segregation.</p>
<h2>Change in the rules for admission of pupils at independent schools</h2>
<p>The Commission is of the opinion that the principal rule that independent schools are open for all is to remain. Waiting lists are no longer to be used as selection criteria when there are more applicants than places in a school unit. It will be possible to use a lottery as a selection criterion. The decision concerning approval shall state which selection criteria the school authority is to use when the number of applicants exceeds the number of places at a school unit.</p>
<p>Replacing waiting lists with a lottery system as above means that those pupils who have come to Sweden recently have the same chance as other pupils of obtaining a place at a school where the number of applicants exceeds the number of places. This proposal also neutralises an informational advantage that results in some legal guardians placing their child on a waiting list for an independent school many years prior to the start of school. Accordingly, the proposal gives greater legitimacy to the proposal concerning active school choice.</p>
<h2>Inquiry into a common admissions system</h2>
<p>The Government should set up an inquiry with the aim of producing a common system for municipal and private education providers for the admission of pupils to school units in preschool class and compulsory school.</p>
<p>The proposals for altered selection rules submitted by the Commission may provide new arguments in favour of a common admissions system. The Commission’s assessment is also that the question of the feasibility of limiting the number of occasions during schooling when school choice is allowed should be investigated. It is important to have good planning conditions in order to make efficient use of resources. Currently, children can change schools an unlimited number of times throughout the year. According to the Commission, this results in a substantial amount of financial, premises and staff resources not being utilised fully.</p>
<h2>Curriculum development and evaluation systems Continuous curriculum development</h2>
<p>The development of syllabuses, subject plans and knowledge requirements should take place as part of a continuous process that is firmly rooted in higher education institutions and among teachers and school heads. This would improve the chances of keeping governance documents relevant and useful and of ensuring that these are based on current research and proven experience.</p>
<h2>Curriculum goals and knowledge requirements</h2>
<p>The Commission is of the opinion that there needs to be an investigation to determine whether teaching is guided by the aims of syllabuses and subject plans or long-term goals in the manner intended or whether knowledge requirements and what are known as knowledge matrices have gained too much influence.</p>
<h2>A coherent follow-up and evaluation system</h2>
<p>There needs to be more reliable results information about pupils’ knowledge development at the national level, school authority level and school level than that which is provided by grades and national tests. It is particularly important for local follow-up for there to be instruments that provide the opportunity to, for example, assess the impact of teaching and support measures. If school choice is to be informed, it is of the utmost importance that there is access to information about a school’s contribution to pupils’ knowledge development through what are known as value-added measures. These can provide fairer information about quality than grades and test results. There is also a lack of information about how many children and pupils in Swedish schools are in need of and are receiving some form of additional adaptation or specific support intervention, what interventions are being used and how these work. There needs to be evidence concerning which programmes and interventions are effective in terms of additional adaptations and specific support.</p>
<h2>A robust school system with the power to develop and greater equity</h2>
<p>The Commission’s proposals have been structured so that they are mutually consistent and reinforce one another. Together, they constitute an overall national strategy for improving learning outcomes, the quality of teaching and equity in Swedish schools.</p>
