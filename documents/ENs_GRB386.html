<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Terms of reference</h2>
<p>In the debate on the fur farming industry two separate arguments have been put forward as constituting reasons for a ban. One is that the fur farming industry does not comply with the current Animal Protection Act. The controversy concerns whether the industry complies with section 4 of the Animal Protection Act, under which the animals shall be allowed the possibility of natural behaviour. Our interpretation of the term is that the animals shall be given the opportunity to exercise their biological behavioural needs. A particularly well-discussed issue has been whether mink have a biological need to swim. This is a decisive matter, since it would be impossible to run a competitive industry if the animals must be allowed access to swimming water. The second argument for closing down the fur farming industry is that the purpose of the breeding, production of pelts, is unacceptable for ethical reasons.</p>
<p>According to the terms of reference the Committee shall look into two different courses of action for the fur farming industry. One alternative is to report on the consequences of changing furbearing animal husbandry in accordance with the Swedish Board of Agriculture’s report to comply with the provisions of the Animal Protection Act. The second alternative is to illustrate the consequences of a closedown for reasons other than pure animal protection. The terms of reference also include a survey of the extent and localisation of animal breeding for the production of pelts and an analysis of how a closedown could be implemented.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The fur farming industry in Sweden refers to breeding of mink and chinchilla for their pelts. The mink farming industry is by far the largest. It produces 1.3 million pelts per year. There are about 180 mink farms in Sweden with a total turnover of SEK 360 million per year. Mink breeding is widespread geographically, but a third of the industry is concentrated to the municipality of Sölvesborg in Blekinge. The chinchilla farming industry produces about 2 000 pelts per year. There are about 15 chinchilla farms. The total turnover is SEK 1.5 million per year.</p>
<p>The wild mink is a predator and a solitary animal. The adult animals live alone in a territory of 1–6 kilometres. The mink spends most of its time in lairs. To a certain extent the mink is adapted to water. It has been kept in captivity for about 80 years. In Sweden mink are kept in net cages in shed houses. The cubs are born in May. The litter stays with the female until the cubs are eight weeks old. After this the mink are often put in pairs, a female and a male, in individual cages. The size of the cage is at least 40 cm x 30 cm x 80 cm. There is a nest box in each cage. In November–December the animals not intended for breeding are put down. The remaining animals are put in individual cages until they are mated in March. The breeding males are usually put down after this, while the breeding females are pregnant and will then breed cubs. A breeding animal is used for a period of 1–3 years.</p>
<p>Mink farming has been carried on in a similar way for a long period. In the last 30–40 years the conditions in which the animals are kept have only changed marginally. There are no Swedish research results concerning the behaviour of mink and the effects of environmental enrichment. However, from 1990 there are a number of reports on fur-bearing animals. In 1990 the Swedish Society of Veterinary Medicine (SVS) set up an inquiry, which was followed up in 1996. The European Commission commissioned a report from the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare (the EU report) on the welfare of animals kept for fur production. The report was mainly based on how eight researchers summarised published research results and their own assessments. Among these eight researchers were Doctor Georgia Mason, United Kingdom and Doctor Vivi Pedersen, Denmark. The report was presented in December 2001. In December 1999 the government instructed the Swedish Board of Agriculture to evaluate available research results regarding mink, review existing regulations and if possible propose improvements in mink farming. The report of the Swedish Board of Agriculture was submitted to the government in April 2002.</p>
<p>The reports are in agreement that mink exhibit stereotype behaviour to far too high a degree. Stereotype behaviour is repeated monotonous movements, such as repeated head shaking. The behaviour is aimed at mastering stress. The stereotype behaviour was said to occur mainly in the wintertime when the animal is sitting alone in its cage and is sometimes fed restrictively. The reports state that the present cage environment and feeding routines constitute the main reason for the stereotype behaviour. The cause of the stereotype behaviour is not considered to be the restricted area of the cage in itself but that the cage environment does not offer sufficient stimulation. There are measures that reduce stereotype behaviour, such as changed feeding routines, selection at the breeding stage and environmental enrichment of cages. Whether these measures are sufficient to limit the stereotype behaviour to an acceptable level is still not clear. Research is in progress internationally. The reports also include a question as to whether swimming is a biological behavioural need. SVS maintains that it has not been proved that mink need large quantities of water in which to swim or occupy themselves. Nor has it been proved that mink do not need water. The EU report draws the conclusion that minks in experimental conditions expressed a strong wish to swim. The experimental conditions referred to are Doctor Georgia Mason’s research results. The EU report’s conclusion was that the normal mink cage does not meet important needs. The research group that assisted the Scientific Committee, however, opposed this conclusion. They maintained that the report had been negatively slanted against fur farming for political reasons. The conclusion of the research group was that a lack of swimming water may possibly be an animal welfare problem; research has not yet arrived at a uniform conclusion. The Swedish Board of Agriculture stated in its report that a system that meets the needs of mink for swimming and bathing water should be developed. Further research results have emerged since then. Doctor Vivi Pedersen has expressed to the Committee that if these new research results had been available when the research group drew its conclusions then the conclusion would have been that swimming is not a biological need in mink. Doctor Georgia Mason has stated that further research is necessary, but that at present it is not proved that swimming is a biological need. She emphasises, however, that access to bathing water is a very powerful environmental enrichment.</p>
<p>Mink farming has been the subject of supervision and measures in other countries as well. In Denmark 12 million mink pelts are produced per year, which corresponds to 40 % of world production. The Animal Ethics Council, which in Denmark issues statements on animal protection matters at the request of the Minister for Justice, prepared a report in January 2003 on fur production, which is to form the basis for future legislative proposals. The report states that the existence of stereotype behaviour is a sign of welfare problems among mink. The Council believes that there are many possibilities of improving conditions for the animals without making production appreciably more expensive. According to the Council researchers now seem to be in agreement that mink do not have an essential need for bathing water per se, but that access to water is an environmental enrichment among others. According to the Council the industry should finance research projects and take initiatives for relevant plans of action aimed at improving the animals’ welfare. The Danish state must share the responsibility for financing welfare projects if there is a political wish to retain the fur farming industry in Denmark. The conditions should be evaluated after five years. In Norway the Ministry of Agriculture has made a survey of all animal husbandry. On the subject of the fur farming industry the Ministry states that on the basis of a general assessment it does not wish to advocate a closedown. It is, however, emphasised that the welfare of the animals must be substantially improved. Unless considerable improvement in the mental health of the animals is achieved within a ten-year period the fur farming industry should be closed down. Swimming water is not imposed as a requirement. In the United Kingdom it is forbidden to keep animals for the main purpose of killing them for their pelts. The ban is based on an ethical principle that the purpose of breeding production animals must be justified. In Italy a decision has been made that from 2008 mink shall have access to swimming water.</p>
<p>The reference material for chinchilla is less extensive than that for mink. This means that the conclusions that can be drawn are less certain than as regards mink. In April 2001 the government instructed the Swedish Board of Agriculture to draw up detailed regulations for the farming of chinchilla for fur production. The</p>
<p>Swedish Board of Agriculture has already made a decision on such regulations. The majority of the regulations are based on the Council of Europe’ recommendations. These are regulations that to a great extent change the conditions for chinchilla farming. For example, the cage height must be increased from 35–40 cm to one metre. In addition the regulations imply a transition from a polygamous system to pair or group housing.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>As indicated in the introduction, we are to examine two different courses of action. We have first looked into whether the fur farming industry can be adapted to the Animal Protection Act.</p>
<p>As regards mink, the Committee considers that the underlying material provides a consensus that the problem is that they exhibit stereotype behaviour to far too great an extent. What causes the stereotype behaviour is not the restricted area of the cage per se, but the fact that the cage environment does not offer sufficient stimulus and that the animals are fed restrictively during certain parts of the year. The behaviour indicates lack of compliance with section 4 of the Animal Protection Act. It is, however, also made clear that there are measures that restrict the stereotype behaviour. One problem is that the measures and their effects first need to be studied in the field and evaluated.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we consider that the Swedish Board of Agriculture’s conclusion about a system to meet the need of mink for swimming and bathing water was too far-reaching. The present state of knowledge does not support a conclusion that swimming is a biological behavioural need of mink. Accordingly, all in all the conclusion is that there are indications that the mink farming industry does not comply with the Animal Protection Act at present, but that after changes it could possibly comply with the Act in the future. It can be noted that the problem definition of the situation of mink in Norway and Denmark is identical with that of the Committee. Based on this, the core question for the Committee will be whom the uncertainty about the future is to affect. Should the mink farming industry bear the consequences of its present possible failure to comply with the Animal Protection Act? We consider that it is a matter of a reasonability assessment. As early as in 1990 the Swedish Society of Veterinary Medicine (SVS) found that to a far too high an extent mink exhibited stereotype behaviour. Despite this the cage environment has been largely unchanged for a very long time. This means that the mink farming industry itself has not worked towards reducing the stereotype behaviour. This alone would in fact indicate that there is no reason to give the mink farming industry further time to improve its animal husbandry. It may, however, be so that the mink farming industry does not bear sole responsibility for the inadequate development. One unfortunate circumstance may be that no research has been carried on in Sweden concerning the behavioural needs of mink. Another circumstance may also have been that responsible authorities did not push for a development of the mink farming industry either. One possibility may be to give the mink farming industry a short period to change its cage environment. Apart from reasons of reasonability, the factor that would favour such a solution is that it would be common to all Nordic countries.</p>
<p>The Committee’s conclusion on chinchilla is that the chinchilla industry would comply with the Animal Protection Act on the basis of the Swedish Board of Agriculture’s regulations. No further measures are considered necessary. In our opinion it cannot be within the discretion of the Committee to review the Board of Agriculture’s adopted regulations. We cannot therefore give any opinion on whether all the proposed measures were really necessary or not. Considering that it has not yet been decided when the regulations are to come into force we propose, however, a relatively long transition period if this is deemed possible. As mentioned above, the new regulations imply extensive changes. It would therefore seem reasonable that the industry and the supervisory authorities be given time to develop new systems. In our opinion it is also important that these new systems are evaluated.</p>
<p>Thereafter we have also analysed a possible closedown of the fur farming industry. As mentioned in the introduction two different reasons have been put forward for a closedown. One is for animal protection reasons, i.e. it is doubtful whether the fur farming industry complies with the Animal Protection Act. At present there are no such reasons applicable to the chinchilla industry. As regards the mink farming industry our viewpoint is that the industry should be given a short period in which to develop its animal husbandry. This means that at present no animal protection reasons exist for closing down the fur farming industry. A further argument for a closedown has been, however, that the purpose of the fur farming industry, to produce pelts, is ethically unacceptable. A decisive factor in this is that fur is a luxury item. The question of the purpose of the animal husbandry, unlike that of animal protection, emanates from humans and not the animals. How the animal is treated during its lifetime is not the decisive question, but rather that it is used for a product not essential for humans. We have further analysed the question of the purpose of animal husbandry in relation to the Animal Protection Act in force. At present this Act does not have any main rule concerning the purposes for which it is allowed to keep animals. Hence at present the main rule is that animals may be kept for any purpose at all, on condition that they are kept in accordance with the animal protection legislation in force. Under Swedish animal protection legislation the animals shall be protected, for example, against unnecessary suffering and illness.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the Committee is that a ban on the fur farming industry based on ethical reasons with reference to the purpose of keeping the animals would imply an innovation in Swedish law. An ethical or moral value has the limitation that it is often to a great degree subjective. The opinion that fur is more of a luxury item than meat is, in our opinion, a subjective value. It is doubtful if it is appropriate to legislate on the basis of such subjective values. Additionally, any enactment of such values would not automatically mean that socially positive values, such as animal protection, would be safeguarded to any greater extent. This means that a ban has no practical significance if the animal protection in the industry is already considered sufficient. Today of course each and every person is free to refrain from wearing fur. Many clothing chains have also adopted the rules for fur-free shops of the Animal Rights Sweden organisation; for example H&M, Intersport, KappAhl, JC, MQ, Lindex, Stadium and Team Sportia. See also www.modeoffer.com. What has been adduced implies that ethical values concerning the purpose for which animals are kept are more suited to voluntary measures than to legislation. In any case we consider that such legislation should be preceded by a survey of the purposes of all animal husbandry. This purpose should be analysed from a comparative perspective and an attempt made to provide an answer to the overall issue concerning for what purposes it is acceptable to keep animals. In addition the survey would need to evaluate the various purposes. For example, from an ethical perspective is it more defensible to keep animals for meat production than for pelt production? What purposes could be called into question? What applies to competition animals, for example, where the purpose is for sport and gambling ?</p>
<p>What has been stated above means that we believe there is no reason at present to close down the fur farming industry. Despite this we have outlined how a closedown could be implemented, since this is part of our terms of reference. We have made an initial analysis of whether a forced closedown would be compatible with the constitution. Crucial to this assessment is whether the closedown would be on the basis of animal protection or due to the fact that the purpose, production of pelts, is unacceptable. A forced closedown for animal protection reasons is in our assessment compatible with the constitution, on condition that important animal protection reasons exist. If it were a question of the industry not meeting the requirements of the existing Animal Protection Act, those affected by a ban would probably not be entitled to compensation. On the other hand, it is doubtful whether the constitution allows a ban against the fur farming industry for reasons based on the purposes of the animal husbandry. Such a ban would in any case require that those affected be awarded compensation.</p>
<p>A closedown for animal protection reasons would thus appear from the point of view of the government to be considerably less complicated than a closedown with reference to the purpose of the animal husbandry. If in future it becomes clear that the mink farming industry or parts of it are not able to comply with the existing Animal Protection Act, the breeding of mink could be banned. In such a case a ban would not be in contravention of the constitution. Since the issue would be that the industry did not comply with the Animal Protection Act already in existence probably no compensation from the state would need to be made to the businesses affected. This would mean that a closedown on the grounds that the industry does not comply with the existing Animal Protection Act would not imply any direct compulsory costs for the state.</p>
<p>A closedown for animal protection reasons would, however, have far-reaching economic consequences for the mink farming industry and its ancillary industry. The mink farming industry has estimated the total cost of investments made as SEK 580  million. The industry has not been able to estimate how much of this amount is already written off. The Committee assumes, however, that part of the amount has already been written off and therefore the actual cost of investments made is lower. The industry would also lose a total of about SEK 160 million  per year in profit. In addition there would be costs associated with the industry’s restoration of land and buildings estimated to be a total for the entire industry of about SEK 27 million.  This means that very roughly a forced closedown of the mink farming industry over a five-year period may imply a loss of over one billion kronor.  Of this figure, SEK 800 million constitutes loss of earnings for the five-year period. It may be noted that this very rough estimate corresponds well to the amount that was to be paid to the mink farming industry in England after the ban imposed there. The estimated compensation from the state would amount to SEK 70 million to 11 farmers. One of the points of departure was that compensation would be payable for four years’ average profit. Transferred to Swedish conditions with 180 farmers this gives a total of SEK 1.1 billion.</p>
<p>In addition a ban would imply that the ancillary industry would lose annual income of SEK 33 million and that they would be affected by increased costs of SEK 65 million. Finally a ban would have far-reaching socio-economic consequences and regional policy effects. The mink farming industry is spread over a wide geographical area. It is a rural industry. A third of the industry is, however, located in Listerlandet in the municipality of Sölvesborg. A ban would have very negative effects on the municipality of Sölvesborg.</p>
<p>A closedown of the chinchilla farming industry for animal protection reasons seems to be somewhat more hypothetical. The Committee has found that the chinchilla farming industry, after the Swedish Board of Agriculture adopted new regulations, complies with the Animal Protection Act in force as far as is known at present. A ban on chinchilla farming for reasons of animal protection would assume either that new research results proved that the chinchilla farming industry does not comply with the Animal Protection Act already in force or that the Animal Protection Act is tightened. Such a ban would then not be in contravention of the constitution. If after new findings it were shown that the industry does not comply with the Animal Protection Act now in force probably no compensation from the state would need to be paid to the businesses. This means that such a ban would not imply any direct financial expenditure for the state. A closedown of the chinchilla farming industry would also have economic consequences. The industry has estimated the value of equipment and capital in buildings to be about SEK 4 million.  It has not been possible to estimate how great a proportion has been written off. The total annual profit for the chinchilla farming industry is said to amount to SEK 600 000 . This means that the chinchilla farming industry would lose roughly SEK  5–8  million  over a five-year period. Of that amount about half would constitute loss of earnings over the five year period.</p>
<p>A closedown for ethical reasons with reference to the purpose of the animal husbandry would seem to be even more complicated. It is doubtful whether a ban on these grounds would be consistent with the constitution. It is particularly doubtful with regard to whether such a law would be in conflict with the legislation protecting freedom of trade in chapter 2, section 20 of the Swedish Constitution. If such a law were nevertheless to be introduced those affected under chapter 2, section 18 of the Constitution of Sweden would have the right in principle to full compensation for the restriction in land use the law would entail. This amount would probably include compensation for investments and accrued expenses. On the other hand compensation for loss of earnings would possibly not necessarily be included. On the basis of the figures reported the amount for the mink farming industry could be roughly estimated to be a few hundred million kronor . For the chinchilla farming industry the corresponding amount could be a maximum of four million kronor .</p>
<p>In addition it is the conclusion of the Committee that implementing a ban would also require that those affected be compensated with a reasonable amount for the restriction of freedom of trade. This compensation would not necessarily mean full compensation for the loss. Instead a more general assessment could be made and the compensation be determined on the basis of what is appropriate and reasonable. The Committee has stated the loss of annual earnings for the mink farming industry to be SEK 800 million over a fiveyear period and to be three million for the chinchilla farming industry. What would constitute a reasonable amount for restriction of freedom of trade on the basis of these amounts is very difficult to estimate. We can only assume that in addition to compensation for restriction in the use of land of a few hundred million kronor a further considerable amount may also be payable for the restriction in freedom of trade. Altogether it is our highly hypothetical conclusion on the basis of the material available that a ban for ethical reasons with reference to purpose could involve a cost to the state of at least SEK 500 million. Furthermore, such a ban would entail socio-political and regional policy consequences.</p>
<h2>The Committee’s proposals</h2>
<p>On the basis of present knowledge the Committee has drawn the conclusion that the chinchilla farming industry does comply with the Animal Protection Act. We also believe that ethical reasons referring to the purpose of keeping animals should not alone constitute the basis of a ban. The only remaining question is therefore in what way the mink farming industry can adapt to the Animal Protection Act as regards the natural behaviour requirement.</p>
<p>We propose that mink farming be developed in ways that have also been adopted for other animals, such as poultry. Animal husbandry must be better adapted to the animals’ needs and give them a better chance of natural behaviour as specified in section 4 of the Animal Protection Act. A difference between mink and other domestic animals in farming is that such development work for mink has hardly been started, while for other animals it has been going on for a long time. This means that the development work for mink must be carried out promptly.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the responsibility for improving conditions for mink as a whole rests with the mink farming industry. We also assume that it is in the interest of the industry to ensure that indications of non-compliance with the Animal Protection Act cease. As has been shown we consider that the industry should be closed down unless improvements are made. A closedown would entail substantial economic consequences for the mink farming industry.</p>
<p>A further problem is, however, that further research is needed on the behaviour of mink in order to indicate the way in which the conditions for mink are to be improved. The conclusion of the Committee is that one condition for the mink farming industry to adapt to the Animal Protection Act is that such research projects are implemented. The financing of such projects must therefore be secured as soon as possible. SLU (the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences) has set up a research project and stated that the cost will be just under four million kronor.</p>
<p>One question is how long the industry is to be given to improve conditions for mink. With reference to the fact that the change</p>
<p>must take place promptly we consider that a time period of five years should be sufficient to give the industry time to adapt. This time must, however, be extended somewhat, since research is to take place simultaneously. SLU estimated that research would need to be carried out until 2007. Taken together, we consider that the indications of non-compliance with section 4 of the Animal Protection Act should have ceased by the end of 2010. If this is not the case then the mink farming industry should be entirely or partially closed down.</p>
<p>The goal we consider that the mink farming industry should have achieved by 2010 is that the stereotype behaviour is at an acceptable level. In principle all species of animal exhibit some form of stereotype behaviour in captivity in order to overcome stress. It is therefore not possible to require that the stereotype behaviour cease altogether but a reasonable goal is that the stereotype behaviour be limited to an acceptable level. A future question will be of course what constitutes an acceptable level. On the part of the Committee it is not possible to describe our objective further for 2010. We propose instead that a forum of experts is to carefully and continuously follow developments in the mink farming industry for the period until 2010. It is particularly important that during the period of research a continuous dialogue is maintained with representatives of the industry and research representatives. The task of the forum would be to ensure that necessary changes take place. The government has already assessed that the new animal protection authority should appoint an animal protection council with broad competence for fundamental assessments and discussions concerning animal protection. The members should have both ethical and ethological competence (bill 2001/02:189, report 2002/03:MJU5, Riksdag Communication 2002/03:98). The Committee proposes that this animal protection council should be responsible for following developments in the mink farming industry in coming years.</p>
