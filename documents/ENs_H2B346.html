<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In April 2014, the European Parliament and the Council adopted a regulation on market abuse (Market Abuse Regulation) and a directive on criminal sanctions for market abuse (Market Abuse Directive), see annexes 4 and 5. These legislative acts replace the 2003 Market Abuse Directive.</p>
<p>The Market Abuse Regulation is binding and directly applicable in all Member States. In addition to the prohibitions against insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information and market manipulation (in the following, these will be jointly referred to as ‘market abuse’) and certain obligations such as public disclosure of inside information, the Regulation contains rules that give the national competent authorities and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) certain powers to take measures in the event of suspected and established infringements of the Regulation. It is primarily the rules concerning the competent authority and its powers that require implementation into the national legislation of Member States.</p>
<p>The Market Abuse Directive requires all Member States to introduce criminal sanctions for at least serious cases of market abuse, including inciting, aiding and abetting criminal offences and attempted insider dealing and market manipulation. The Directive also establishes a minimum level for the maximum term of imprisonment for acts that constitute market abuse offences.</p>
<h2>Some general starting points</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the provisions of the Market Abuse Regulation that require implementation into Swedish legislation should be implemented primarily by means of a new Act, in which Finansinspektionen (the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority) is specified as the competent authority in Sweden under the Regulation. The Market Abuse Directive will be implemented by means of amendments to the Act on Penalties for Market Abuse when Trading in Financial Instruments (2005:377) (Market Abuse Penalties Act).</p>
<p>One important purpose of the Market Abuse Regulation and the Market Abuse Directive is to achieve harmonised and effective rules in the area of market abuse, which presupposes that the Member States’ national legislation does not impose other requirements than those ensuing from the common regulatory framework. The Regulation implies full harmonization regarding prohibitions and obligations relating to market abuse, while the requirements for competent authorities' powers and (for the) administrative sanctions represent a minimum level of regulation. The Directive primarily represents a minimum level of harmonization. Based on these parameters, the Inquiry’s starting point has been that the regulations introduced into Swedish legislation should correspond with the level ensuing from the legal acts and not exceed what is required unless there is good reason for doing so.</p>
<p>To facilitate application of the delegated acts, implementing acts and technical standards that the Commission can be expected to adopt, it is proposed that terms and expressions in the new Act follow the Regulation’s terminology. Terminological consistency will also improve the prospects of achieving uniform regulation throughout the European Economic Area (EEA). Common and coherent terminology should also be aimed for in the criminal law areas. Regarding the offence otillbörlig marknadspåverkan  (‘undue market influence’), it is proposed that the legal classification of the offence be changed to marknadsmanipulation  (market manipulation), which corresponds to both the English and Swedish language versions of the Directive. The Inquiry considers, however, that the legal classification of the offence obehörigt röjande av insiderinformation  (‘unauthorised disclosure of inside information’) should not be changed to ‘ unlawful disclosure of inside information’, but  remain unchanged.</p>
<h2>A reformed sanctions system to combat market abuse more effectively</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s assessment is that combating market abuse can be expected to be made more effective by supplementing current legislation by the additional preventive and investigation-enhancing measures prescribed in the Market Abuse Regulation. In addition, the Inquiry considers that administrative sanctions, such as financial penalties, can also be considered well-suited to combating market abuse in certain cases. It is therefore proposed that, alongside the system for criminal sanctions, there should be a system for administrative sanctions. In addition, it is doubtful whether a system of purely criminal sanctions, without any administrative sanctions, can be interpreted as meaning that Sweden has fulfilled its obligation to have sanctions in place for infringements of the prohibitions in the Market Abuse Regulation.</p>
<p>Accordingly, it should be possible, in certain situations, for infringements of the prohibitions against market abuse to be dealt with in an administrative procedure and result in administrative sanctions. In terms of the relationship between the two systems, the Inquiry considers that a requirement concerning intent constitutes a suitable criterion for determining how the criminalised area regarding market abuse should be defined. Under the Inquiry’s proposal, other criteria, such as monetary limits or category of person, will not be used in setting this definition. The Inquiry considers that intentional acts that constitute ordinary offences or gross offences, as well as instigation of and complicity in such offences, should remain punishable. The same is to apply to attempted insider offences and attempts and preparation to commit gross insider offences. A new provision that criminalises attempted market manipulation will be introduced into the Market Abuse Penalties Act. Consequently, the Inquiry proposes that criminal liability for carless and minor offences under the Market Abuse Penalties Act be abolished. Such acts can instead be subject to examination and sanctions under the administrative procedure.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that one and the same prohibited act may not be subject to both a criminal penalty and an administrative sanction. For reasons pertaining to legal certainty, and in particular so as not to violate the principle of ne bis in idem , it is proposed that the new regulatory framework of administrative sanctions under the Market Abuse Regulation that will be placed alongside the penalty provisions of the Market Abuse Penalties Act should be based on a model in which public bodies choose whether to deal with prohibited acts in either the administrative or the criminal sanctions system. The decision by the authorities to choose between systems should be made prior to a decision on initiating prosecution or a decision on imposing administrative sanctions has been made. A choice system presupposes more developed cooperation between the authorities, partly to ensure that an individual is not subjected to duplication of legal procedures regarding one and the same act, and partly to create opportunities for the authorities to choose between – the administrative and the criminal sanctions system. Regulations on the obligation to provide information and the obligation to cooperate will be introduced in both the new Act and the Market Abuse Penalties Act.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the proposed definition of the criminalised area for market abuse means that only intentional ordinary offences or gross offences are punishable. Despite the fact that these offences can normally be considered as serious cases of market abuse and should lead to criminal sanctions under the Market Abuse Directive, they may include certain acts which can be considered as less deserving of punishment, and which, in addition, could suitably be dealt with in the administrative sanctions system. The Inquiry therefore proposes that a rule on an examination of the right to prosecute be introduced in the Market Abuse Penalties Act. The rule would be applicable to cases of market manipulation consisting of isolated transactions that do not result in any change of the actual ownership of a financial instrument, and to cases of unauthorised disclosure of inside information in which someone, without it being warranted, has received inside information and been included on an insider list such as is referred to in Article 18 of the Market Abuse Regulation. In these cases, prosecution shall only be initiated if called for from a public interest perspective.</p>
<p>For the purpose of effectiveness, it is further proposed that a jurisdiction clause be introduced stipulating that under the Market Abuse Penalties Act, prosecution proceedings are to be initiated at</p>
<p>Stockholm District Court and appeals accordingly are to be lodged with the Svea Court of Appeal.</p>
<h2>Division of investigative responsibility and expansion of investigative powers for Finansinspektionen</h2>
<p>As the competent authority, Finansinspektionen is to supervise compliance with the provisions of the Market Abuse Regulation and investigate suspected infringements of the Regulation. However, Finansinspektionen will remain obliged to report to the Swedish Economic Crime Authority when there is reason to assume that a market abuse offence has been committed. Under the Inquiry’s proposal, the Swedish Economic Crime Authority will retain responsibility for conducting preliminary investigations and initiating prosecution for offences under the Market Abuse Penalties Act.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Finansinspektionen will conduct independent investigations concerning suspected infringements of the Market Abuse Regulation. In line with this, Finansinspektionen should also review the reports on suspected market abuse that market actors are obliged to submit to Finansinspektionen and have the power to supplement the reports with certain examinations of its own. However, the design of the current provision on the obligation to report in the Market Abuse Penalties Act, and statements in the preparatory materials, have resulted in Finansinspektionen’s role in this regard most nearly resembling a ‘letterbox function’. For this and other reasons, the Inquiry proposes that the provision be removed from the Act.</p>
<p>Under the Inquiry’s proposal, when the Swedish Economic Crime Authority has decided to initiate a preliminary investigation, Finansinspektionen may not pursue any investigative measures on its own. It is, however, proposed that it be possible for Finansinspektionen to be engaged for assistance in the preliminary investigation. If the Swedish Economic Crime Authority decides not to initiate a preliminary investigation, or to discontinue a preliminary investigation, the Authority is to inform Finansinspektionen, which may thereafter continue the investigation under the provisions of the administrative sanctions system. If, in such a case, circumstances arise that lead Finansinspektionen to consider that there is, after all, reason to assume that an offence has been committed, the Inquiry proposes that Finansinspektionen should again report this to the Swedish Economic Crime Authority. An initial assessment, for example that there was no intent, could prove to be incorrect. In that case, the Swedish Economic Crime Authority must again decide whether a preliminary investigation should be initiated. However, under the proposal concerning the final juncture by which a choice must be made, a report cannot be submitted to the Swedish Economic Crime Authority after a decision to impose administrative sanctions has been taken. (See the proposal concerning decision-making procedures for administrative sanctions in the next section.)</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the proposed system of choice and the division of investigative responsibility presupposes that the authorities cooperate with one another. This in turn also requires that the authorities are able to share information with one another. To facilitate an exchange of information, the Inquiry proposes that the provisions on secrecy in Chapter 35, Section 1 of the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400) should apply to both the Swedish Economic Crime Authority’s preliminary investigations and Finansinspektionen’s investigations into suspected infringements of the Market Abuse Regulation. A new section will be introduced into the Act containing a secrecy-override rule that enables the authorities to exchange information.</p>
<p>To a great extent, the supervisory and investigative powers that the Market Abuse Regulation prescribes for the competent authorities correspond to the powers also prescribed in the 2003 Market Abuse Directive. Under the Regulation, an authority is to have the right to access information from anyone, conduct on-site investigations, freeze assets and prohibit certain activities. One assumption when implementing the 2003 Market Abuse Directive into Swedish law was that infringements of the prohibitions against market abuse were to be handled within the criminal law area, and accordingly the Swedish Economic Crime Authority was to lead investigations and a general court take decisions on penalties. This had repercussions on how the investigative powers under the 2003 Market Abuse Directive were implemented into Swedish law.</p>
<p>In light of the Inquiry’s considerations concerning an administrative sanctions system, there is no longer scope for the current division of investigative powers between Finansinspektionen and the Swedish Economic Crime Authority. The Inquiry therefore proposes expanding Finansinspektionen’s current powers so that they correspond with the requirements of the Regulation. Provisions concerning Finansinspektionen’s investigative and supervisory powers will be introduced into the new Act. It should be pointed out here that under Article 23(1) of the Market Abuse Regulation, these powers can be exercised directly by the competent authority, in collaboration with or by delegation to other authorities and actors, or by the competent authority’s application to ‘judicial authorities’. Regarding on-site investigations for the purpose of securing evidence (Article 23(2)(e) of the Regulation) concerning suspected infringements of the prohibitions against insider dealing and market manipulation, it is proposed that such an investigation may be conducted following a decision by Stockholm District Court.</p>
<p>The information exchange and collaboration with foreign authorities and ESMA prescribed by the Market Abuse Regulation can be achieved within the framework of current Swedish law, so no legislative measures are needed.</p>
<h2>A closer look at the administrative sanctions system</h2>
<p>To ensure that Member States have a common approach when dealing with infringements of the Market Abuse Regulation’s rules, the Regulation contains provisions on administrative sanctions and other measures that can be applied in the event of at least certain listed infringements. Accordingly, action is to be taken, but the Regulation does not limit the opportunities of Member States to establish rules on other, or stricter, sanctions and measures than those specifically stated in the Regulation. Nor are provisions on sanctions required if the national legislation of a Member State already contains, or is set to introduce, criminal law regulations on infringements of the Market Abuse Regulation’s prohibitions or orders. The Inquiry considers that there is no reason to use this ‘criminal law option’, and therefore proposes that provisions on administrative sanctions be introduced in the new Act in accordance with what is prescribed in the Regulation. However, no additional or stricter sanctions than those ensuing from the Regulation are proposed.</p>
<p>In addition to the infringements that, under the Regulation, could be the object of action, the Inquiry proposes that the previously criminalised disclosure prohibition in Section 11 of the Market Abuse Penalties Act be replaced by an essentially equivalent prohibition in the new Act. As before, the aim of the disclosure prohibition is to ensure that the person who is reported is not warned and able to cover their tracks. A prohibition of this kind is still warranted, and it should be possible to take punitive action by means of administrative sanctions.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the Market Abuse Regulation largely presupposes that both natural and legal persons can be the subject of administrative measures and sanctions in the event of infringements of the Regulation’s prohibitions and disregard of its obligations. Unless specially stipulated, the provisions on sanctions should therefore apply to both natural and legal persons. In addition, the Inquiry proposes that a provision be introduced in the Act that makes it possible to refrain from taking action, for example if the infringement is excusable. Equivalent provisions are also found in other regulations that contain administrative sanctions.</p>
<p>Under the Inquiry’s proposal, the Act should also contain an illustrative list of factors that are to form the basis for choosing administrative sanctions and for determining the size of the financial penalty, for which the starting point should be the gravity and duration of the infringement. The Act should also include provisions on maximum levels and adjustment of financial penalties, as well as on payment, collection and time limits.</p>
<p>Decision-making procedures</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that Finansinspektionen take decisions on administrative measures and sanctions in the event of disregard of the Market Abuse Regulation’s prescribed obligations concerning market supervision and reporting, disclosure of inside information, insider lists, reporting of transactions conducted by persons discharging managerial responsibilities and persons closely associated with them and the public disclosure of such transactions, and investment recommendations and statistics.</p>
<p>However, both reasons of legal certainty and prevailing legal traditions strongly suggest that sanction matters regarding infringements of the Market Abuse Regulation’s prohibitions against market abuse should be heard by a court of law. This particularly applies in matters concerning natural persons. The Inquiry considers that infringement matters under the Market Abuse Regulation probably fall within the scope of Article 6 of the European Convention on</p>
<p>Human Rights. Where relevant, the rights in this Article also apply to legal persons. Therefore, to avoid differences in the guarantees concerning legal certainty, the procedure should be the same regardless of whether the matter concerns a natural or a legal person.</p>
<p>It may be said that an order whereby Finansinspektionen must initiate legal action in a court for an examination of imposition of administrative sanctions will delay a decision of this kind. So as not to unnecessarily delay these infringement matters, the Inquiry proposes a model in which Finansinspektionen first issues a sanctions order which – if it is approved – is to be equated with a final and non-appealable judgment. In this way, a court examination is only necessary in cases where an order of this kind is not approved. Accordingly, it is proposed that Finansinspektionen, by means of an obligatory procedure for sanctions orders, examines issues concerning administrative sanctions for infringements of prohibitions against market abuse.</p>
<p>In addition, the Inquiry considers it most suitable that a general court hears sanctions matters involving infringements of prohibitions against market abuse (when a sanctions order that has been issued is not approved). Initially, at least, it can be assumed that the number of such examinations will be limited. Similarly to what has been stated concerning prosecution for market abuse offences, the Inquiry considers that there are, accordingly, substantial grounds for also coordinating court hearings as regards infringements of the prohibitions in the Market Abuse Regulation. It is proposed that the hearing be held at Stockholm District Court. Channelling both prosecution for market abuse offences and infringements of the Regulation’s prohibitions against market abuse to one and the same court further increases the potential for more effective processing and consistent practice.</p>
<p>If a sanctions order has not been approved within the set time, Finansinspektionen may, accordingly, initiate legal action at Stockholm District Court. Regarding an action of this kind, the applicable provisions are those of the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure on prosecution for an offence for which there is no reason to impose a penalty other than a fine. The new Act will also include provisions on appeals of judgments and decisions.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the obligation prescribed in the Market Abuse Regulation to publish sanctions decisions and decisions taken as a result of an infringement of a prohibition or the disregard of an obligation under the Regulation should be implemented by means of regulations at ordinance level.</p>
<h2>Adjustments of Swedish law resulting from the EU legislative acts</h2>
<p>Proposals arising from the provisions of the Market Abuse Directive</p>
<p>Under the Inquiry’s proposals, insider offences, unauthorised disclosure of inside information and market manipulation (formerly designated ‘undue market influence’) shall, accordingly, remain criminal offences. However, the Market Abuse Directive presupposes certain necessary changes to certain criteria of an offence and adjustments regarding the Market Abuse Penalties Act’s scope and definitions.</p>
<p>There is no provision in the Market Abuse Penalties Act that specifies the Act’s scope. To achieve implementation that is closer in line with the Directive, the Inquiry proposes that a special section be added to the Market Abuse Penalties Act that, as is the case with the Market Abuse Directive, establishes the scope and the financial instruments that are covered. Furthermore, it is proposed that the restriction that it is to be a matter of ‘trading in the securities market’ be abolished. The new section will make clear that the Act will also apply to emission allowances and other products under Commission Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 of 12 November 2010 on the timing, administration and other aspects of auctioning of greenhouse gas emission allowances pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowances trading within the Community. As a consequential amendment, the provisions on market abuse regarding emission allowances in the form of 2-day spot commodity contracts will be removed from Chapter 8 of the Emissions Trading Act (2004:1199). Furthermore it is proposed that a modified and expanded derogation be included in the Market Abuse Penalties Act for actions in buy-back programmes and for stabilising financial instruments.</p>
<p>The current definition of ‘inside information’ will be replaced by a direct reference to the Market Abuse Regulation’s definition.</p>
<p>Regarding insider offences, the requirement concerning transformation will be abolished; in this way, the offence covers a person who ‘has inside information’ and no longer just a person who ‘receives inside information’. Accordingly, a prosecutor will not have to show how a defendant gained access to the information, merely that he or she did have access to it. Through the proposal, we also achieve a regulation that is in conformity with the Directive.</p>
<p>The Swedish prohibition against insider dealing does not make ‘use’ a criterion. However, a number of procedures are listed that are exempted from the criminalised area. The Inquiry considers that insider offences should not include a criterion concerning use in the future, either. Rather, it proposes that the current catalogue of exemptions regarding insider trading should instead be formulated as an exemption (1) for situations where inside information has not been used, and (2) for legitimate procedures that are covered by Article 9 of the Market Abuse Regulation (by referring to the above-mentioned Article). It is up to the defendant to prove that the exemption provision is applicable.</p>
<p>The prohibition on trade included in insider offences will be expanded to also include cancellation or amendment of a placed order, if the cancellation or amendment is made after the person who placed the order gained access to insider information concerning the financial instruments. In addition, the prohibition on providing advice included in insider offences will be expanded in that a person who follows advice (or a recommendation) on acquiring or disposing of financial instruments is to be convicted of insider trading, if he or she knows that the advice is based on insider information. The same is to apply to a person who follows advice to cancel or change an order. However, the same exemptions that apply regarding insider offences in general – that insider information has not been used or that it is a matter of a legitimate procedure – are also to apply in these cases.</p>
<p>Apart from the Inquiry’s proposal that the classification otillbörlig marknadspåverkan  (‘undue market influence’) be changed to marknadsmanipulation  (market manipulation) ,  it is proposed that a special criminal classification of the gross offence, grov marknadsmanipulation  (gross market manipulation), be introduced. The Inquiry proposes that in other ways as well, the design of the criminal provision should be more in line with the Directive. One example is by ensuring that the provision, like the corresponding provision in the Directive, addresses actions that actually have the specified effect. This, however, does not mean that an action is exempt from punishment if it is not possible to prove that it actually sent misleading signs or affected the price, but was obviously intended to do so. In such cases, the action may be deemed to constitute attempted market manipulation.</p>
<p>In addition the Inquiry proposes changing the scale of penalties for unauthorised disclosure of inside information to imprisonment for a maximum of two years, and for gross insider offences and gross market manipulation to imprisonment for a maximum of six years. The penalties in the Act on control of wholesale of energy products (2013:385) were designed using the Market Abuse Penalties Act as a model. It is therefore proposed that corresponding amendments to the scale of penalties be made in that Act as well.</p>
<p>Proposals arising from the provisions of the Market Abuse Regulation</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the prohibitions and orders of the Market Abuse Regulation are directly applicable in Swedish law, and no measures will be taken to transpose the material provisions of the Regulation. However, many of the Regulation’s provisions are contained in some form in the 2003 Market Abuse Directive. In other words, the provisions of the Regulation already have an equivalent, wholly or in part, in Swedish law. Due to the chosen legal instrument, the Swedish provisions must now be adapted or removed from Swedish law.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that it should be possible to keep the provisions in the Securities Market Act (2007:528) on market supervision in regulated markets and MTFs unchanged. However, as mentioned above, it is proposed that the provisions in the Market Abuse Penalties Act on reporting of suspected market abuse be abolished. The Inquiry also proposes abolishing the provisions on the obligation of issuers to publically disclose information that affects prices and the regulations on delayed public disclosure in the Securities Market Act. However, Sweden should make use of the opportunity to introduce a national provision that a written explanation on how the conditions for a delay were fulfilled is only to be submitted to the competent authority (Finansinspektionen) if requested.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the provisions on insider lists and notification obligations for insiders in the Act on Reporting Duty on Possession of Certain Financial Instruments (2000:1087) be removed from the Act. The same applies to the provisions in the same Act on a prohibition for these persons and stock market companies to trade, during certain periods, in financial instruments related to the company.</p>
<p>Regarding the requirement on publication of transactions conducted by insiders, Finansinspektionen already has a well-functioning system in place for this. The Inquiry therefore proposes that Sweden should use the opportunity provided in the Market Abuse Regulation that publication is to be dealt with by the competent authority and that a corresponding provision to this effect be introduced in the new Act. The applicable provisions on the transparency register in the Act on Reporting Duty on Possession of Certain Financial Instruments can, with certain minor adjustments, be kept. However, the Inquiry proposes that, as a result of the rules in the Market Abuse Regulation, the provisions on investment recommendations in the Swedish Financial Instruments Trading Act (1991:980) should be removed from the Act.</p>
<p>The Market Abuse Regulation prescribes that the competent authority is obliged to establish efficient procedures for receiving reports regarding infringements of the Regulation. In the Inquiry’s view, implementation of this provision should be carried out at ordinance level in the form of a general provision that Finansinspektionen is to set up a system of this kind. The Inquiry proposes that the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act be supplemented with an absolute protection of confidentiality for information that reveals a notifier’s identity. The obligation of professional secrecy is to have precedence over freedom of reporting. Confidentiality will apply for a maximum of fifty years.</p>
<p>Under the Regulation, even companies covered by the obligation of professional secrecy are to have effective systems in place so that their employees are able to report infringements internally. The Inquiry proposes that a new provision to this effect be included in the new Act and that disregard of this obligation may result in an administrative sanction.</p>
<h2>Financing of Finansinspektionen’s supervision</h2>
<p>Regarding Finansinspektionen’s supervision under the new Act, the Inquiry proposes that companies supervised by Finansinspektionen should pay an annual fee.</p>
<h2>Implementation and entry into force</h2>
<p>Following the entry into force of the Market Abuse Regulation and the Market Abuse Directive , Member States have 24 months in which to take necessary measures to comply with the provisions of these legislative acts. As explained above, the Inquiry proposes that the provisions in the Ordinance which require implementation should be implemented by means of a new Act, and that other necessary adjustments resulting from the legislative acts should primarily be carried out through amendments to the Market Abuse Penalties Act. The Inquiry proposes that the new Act and the other legislative amendments enter into force no later than 24 months after the entry into force of the Regulation and the Directive.</p>
<p>However, under Article 39(4), second paragraph of the Market Abuse Regulation, the provisions in the Regulation that refer to organised trading facilities (OTFs), SME growth markets, and emission allowances or auctioned products based thereon are to begin to be applied at a later date than the Regulation in general. Since the Market Abuse Directive’s scope is determined by the Regulation’s scope, the provisions in the above-mentioned Article have an impact on the Swedish Market Abuse Penalties Act. Until this later date, neither financial instruments traded on an OTF nor emission allowances will fall within the scope. Therefore, it is pro- posed that amendments to the Market Abuse Penalties Act include a transitional provision stating that this expansion of the field of application will apply only when the Market Abuse Regulation begins to be applied in these areas. Regarding OTFs, the delayed entry into force is linked to the fact that this type of marketplace – which is regulated in Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments and amending Directive 2002/92/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU (recast) – will not exist until this later date. Regarding emission allowances, there are currently special pro- visions on market abuse regarding these allowances in the Emissions Trading Act. Accordingly, these will continue to apply until the Market Abuse Regulation begins to be applied in these areas. The Market Abuse Penalties Act does not include any provisions on</p>
<p>SME growth markets, so no transitional provisions are needed in this area.</p>
