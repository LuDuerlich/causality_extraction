<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In accordance with its directives, the Commission shall carry out a review of the current legislation pertaining to the vehicle sector and prepare proposals for the regulations that are deemed necessary. The principal objective is to simplify and modernise the regulatory system and to render it more efficient. The Commission shall also consider how the processing of personal information contained in the Swedish National Road Administration’s database of road traffic accidents for, among other things, statistical purposes, should be statutorily regulated.</p>
<p>In the course of our investigation work, we have examined the different statutory areas and compiled an inventory of both practical and technical problems associated with statutory legislation, as well as outlined proposed solutions within each sub-section. In this way, we have endeavoured to achieve harmony between the content of the legislation and the procedures that are actually prevailing within different agencies, as well as, where possible clarify various types of inspections and create prerequisites for more efficient and simpler procedures.</p>
<p>While reviewing the statutory areas, the legal text has been modernised and revised linguistically and editorially with the aim of simplifying and creating clarity. The wording of the statutes has been wholly adapted to the prevailing EC legislation. The review has resulted in a Vehicle Act, and a Vehicle Decree affiliated to the act. Moreover, we are proposing an act dealing with the registration of road traffic accidents. The statutory proposals bring about repealing and changes of a number of statutes.</p>
<p>It is considered that the whole body of legislation will be easier to apply, both for authorities and private individuals as a result of the simplifications that are to be made. A certain degree of efficiency and rationalisation ought to be the result of the proposals. Consequently these should lead to reduced costs both for the parties involved in the vehicle sector in general and for society as a whole. In addition, a number of positive effects on the work of crime prevention can be expected to follow as a result of clearer rules for the police when they are inspecting vehicles in various contexts.</p>
<p>The proposed changes within the different sub-sections principally involve the following.</p>
<h2>Statutory form and structure</h2>
<p>The current legislation in the vehicle sector is divided into different levels. It is proposed that a new Vehicle Act should include both the regulations that for constitutional reasons have to be regulated by law, and the most important remaining regulations pertaining to vehicle inspection. The latter concerns regulations that have a particular impact on private individuals, for example, issues of approval and recall. The act includes the most important regulations dealing with each type of inspection along with the fundamental regulations concerning the actual test. The regulations in the act pertaining to certain testing agencies operating in the vehicle sector are transferred to the new act. The remaining regulations concerning vehicle inspection are included in the decree affiliated to the act. A number of the current regulations regarding vehicle condition and equipment are also included therein. Detailed regulations and regulations of an administrative nature are moved down to public authority level. As a result of the proposal the present vehicle decree and the off-road vehicle decree are nullified.</p>
<h2>A new Vehicle Act</h2>
<p>The new Vehicle Act brings together the fundamental regulations concerning vehicle inspection, inspection of a vehicle’s load, examination of tachographs and fare meters, along with regulations regarding the activities carried out by testing agencies in the vehicle sector.</p>
<p>Vehicle inspectors and police officers are given the right to stop vehicles in certain cases in order to carry out an inspection. According to the law, police officers, inspectors, vehicle inspectors and technicians may enter into vehicles or in some cases to premises or similar or to grounds adjacent to such premises in the course of carrying out an inspection. Police officers or vehicle inspectors may enter to sealed spaces in a vehicle or its load in order to check that the vehicle is loaded in the prescribed manner. A vehicle may be testdriven during an inspection to whatever extent is necessary to carry out a vehicle test or an inspection.</p>
<p>The supervision that the Swedish Board for Accreditation and Conformity Assessment (SWEDAC) exercises over the vehicle testing operations is elucidated. The supervision shall cover the technical competence and the standard of equipment in the organisation, as well as ensuring its quality.</p>
<p>The Vehicle Decree brings together the more detailed legislation concerning the vehicle inspection and the different inspection types.</p>
<p>The institution of inspecting vehicle dealer’s premises is withdrawn.</p>
<h2>Definitions in the vehicle statutes</h2>
<p>The Swedish definitions in the vehicle sector are to be brought into line with the EC definitions. However, they are to be broader than the EC definitions so that they encompass the EU’s but also cover the current Swedish concepts. Changes are proposed in the definitions of different vehicle categories in the previously proposed act pertaining to road traffic definitions. The current concept ”motor vehicle” is replaced by the concept ”road motor vehicle”. Certain central concepts are defined in the introduction to the Vehicle Decree. A new concept ”motor vehicle” receives its particular meaning with regard to EC typeapproval of vehicles. This concept and certain other important concepts that concern the procedure of type-approval of vehicles are included in the special chapter on EC type-approval in the Vehicle Decree.</p>
<h2>Vehicle condition and equipment</h2>
<p>The general and fundamental regulations pertaining to vehicle condition and equipment are carried over to the proposed Vehicle Decree, while the detailed directives are moved down to the public authority level (primarily the National Road Administration). The regulations contained in the statute will also in principle be applicable to vehicles involved in international road traffic in Sweden.</p>
<p>The legislation concerning vehicle usage requirements is transferred to the Traffic Decree.</p>
<p>An easing of asbestos testing is to be introduced for light duty vehicles for national type-approval and registration inspection.</p>
<h2>Different forms of type-approval</h2>
<p>The principal features of the different EC-directive’s legislation that concern EC type-approval are included in the proposed vehicle statues. The fundamental regulations are found in the Vehicle Act, while the regulations pertaining to the procedure itself are included in a special chapter dealing with EC type-approval in the Vehicle Decree. This is also where the fundamental concepts concerning such type-approval are defined: multi-stage type-approval, vehicle type, motor vehicle and technical service.</p>
<p>The regulations regarding ECE type-approval that are based on an international agreement from 1958, are included in the proposed Vehicle Decree in connection with the regulations on other forms of type-approval and are adapted to them.</p>
<p>The current vehicle type inspection approval is converted to a national type-approval. The National Road Administration grants national model approval after an application by a manufacturer. National type approval can be obtained both for vehicles, and, according to National Road Administration’s regulations, for systems, components and separate technical units. It is proposed that the physical testing of the vehicle (the actual examination of the type), quite simply called testing, should remain with the testing body.</p>
<h2>Registration inspection</h2>
<p>The registration inspection should be clarified. Its connection to the roadworthiness inspection is discontinued by removing the requirement for a physical test comparable to a roadworthiness inspection.</p>
<p>If there is a lack of sufficient information on a vehicle to enable it to be clearly identified and described at the time of registration, the National Road Administration may decide that it has to undergo a registration inspection.</p>
<p>The National Road Administration is also given the right to order a registration inspection of a vehicle for which the Administration has previously granted an exemption from the current regulations concerning the vehicle’s condition and equipment.</p>
<p>It is proposed that any vehicle that has previously been registered as a military vehicle should be required to undergo registration inspection.</p>
<h2>Inspection of mopeds, inspection of suitability, etc.</h2>
<p>The regulations concerning inspection of mopeds are carried over to the new vehicle statutes. The regulation stipulating that whoever runs a commercial enterprise selling mopeds must guarantee in writing at the point of sale that the moped has not been changed in any way during the period it has been in his possession, is removed.</p>
<p>The regulations pertaining to suitability inspection are also transferred to the new vehicle legislation. The off-road traffic decree’s requirement for the suitability inspection of off-road motor vehicles is, however, removed.</p>
<p>The requirement for registered vehicles to have a suitability certificate is withdrawn; however it is retained for trailers that are towed by motor driven vehicles.</p>
<p>The institution of coupling inspection is proposed to be withdrawn. The regulations concerning the coupling together of vehicles are not included in the Vehicle Act or the Vehicle Decree but is removed to the public authority level.</p>
<p>The rules regarding the inspection of export vehicles have not been included either, but are assumed to be excluded in accordance with proposals under consideration in the report Road Traffic Registration (SOU 1998:162).</p>
<h2>Roadworthiness inspection</h2>
<p>The regulations pertaining to annual roadworthiness inspection are to be adapted to the recently implemented changes in the system by which vehicles are called-up for periodic inspection, whereby vehicles with the final figure 5 in their registration number, are now called-up during the period May-September in order to relieve the pressure on the Swedish Motor-Vehicle Inspection Co.</p>
<p>The principle of annual inspection of vehicles manufactured after and including 1951 with an interval of one or two years remains. For vehicles that are used in a particular way – for ex. in driving schools or in commercial traffic – as well as for all buses, a certain tightening-up is proposed by requiring an annual roadworthiness inspection irrespective of age.</p>
<p>The requirement for off-road vehicles to have a test mark is removed.</p>
<p>An order requiring a vehicle retesting must include an alternative option that the vehicle owner in certain cases is given in order to comply with the demand, namely testing at an accredited workshop.</p>
<p>The requirement for test of the fare meter in taxi vehicles when the roadworthiness inspection is carried out is removed.</p>
<p>The requirement that the vehicle owner shall present certain documents in connection with the annual inspection is removed.</p>
<h2>Roadside inspections – Other inspections carried out by police officers</h2>
<p>It is proposed that roadside inspections of vehicles used in commercial traffic may also take place in a company’s premises or similar or on an area adjacent to them.</p>
<p>A commercial vehicle can be exempted from a technical roadside inspection if it has undergone a complete annual roadworthiness inspection or a roadside inspection during the last three months, on the condition that the driver is able to show when the vehicle was last tested. The regulations are thereby adjusted to those that are in force according to EC directive 2000/30/EC of 6 June 2000 on the technical roadside inspection of the roadworthiness of commercial vehicles circulating in the Community.</p>
<p>The regulations concerning ”Supervision by police officers” are included in connection with the regulation of roadside inspections and are called ”Other inspection by police officers”.</p>
<h2>Other issues pertaining to vehicles</h2>
<p>An intensification in penalties from monetary fines to day-fines is proposed for any individual who prevents or makes more difficult an inspection under the terms of the Vehicle Act. A regulation on the prevention of further travel is included in the Vehicle Act.</p>
<p>A principal rule concerning appeals to the General Administrative Court with a requirement for permission to appeal to the Administrative Court of Appeal is proposed. However, it is proposed that appeal of certain decisions may take place with the responsible authority (the National Road Administration). In other cases, it is proposed that there shall be no right of appeal. The regulations concerning appeals are included in the proposed Vehicle Act.</p>
<p>The government or the authority the government decides upon, is authorised partly  to announce the regulations pertaining to vehicle condition and equipment, partly , with regard to questions concerning the types of inspection regulated by law, to announce further regulations regarding the scope of the inspections and the inspection body’s activities, the requirements for passing the test, directions and imposition of driving bans, the prerequisites under which certain vehicles can be used and on the charges for the test. The inspection organisation examines questions which concern the exercise of authority and which involve vehicles passing the inspection within the respective body’s area of testing. The regulations are included in the proposal for the Vehicle Act.</p>
<p>The authorisations that currently prevail in the vehicle and off-road traffic decrees are transferred to the proposed Vehicle Decree. The regulations concerning consultation between the National Road Administration and other authorities involved in the notification of the regulations are also transferred to the new statute.</p>
<p>The government or the authority that the government decides upon, is authorised to rule more closely on the testing organisation’s right to charge fees for the testing. The current regulations pertaining to fee charging in certain cases according to the vehicles and off-road traffic decrees are included in the proposed Vehicle Decree.</p>
<h2>The Swedish Traffic Accident Data Acquisition</h2>
<p>The Swedish Traffic Accident Data Acquisition (STRADA) is statutorily regulated by an Act on Registration of Road Traffic Accidents. According to this act, personal information in the register (database) may be used for the production of official statistics and other statistics, following-up, evaluating and quality assurance of traffic safety operations as well as for research. The register may contain only the information necessary for the named objectives. The health and medical services must supply the information needed for the register’s purposes. The authority responsible for statistics within the areas of transport and communications, the Swedish Institute for Transport and Communications Analysis (SIKA), may have direct access to the register. Issuing of information by means other than by such direct access may take place on a recording for automatic processing, but only for the specially stated purposes.</p>
