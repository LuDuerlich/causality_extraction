<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The first part of our assignment was to review the rules on access to public documents for the purpose of extending the scope of public access to information in the information society. In this connection we also dealt with certain matters related to our task of considering the need to coordinate the provisions of chapter 15 of the Secrecy Act (1980:100) concerning the registration of public documents etc. with the provisions of the Public Records Act concerning the importance of recording documents for file management etc. We also considered the question of whether there is a need to restrict access to public documents that are subject to copyright or similar rights under the Copyright Act.</p>
<h2>The principle of public access to information and IT</h2>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The general purpose of our investigation of the application of the principle of access to information in the information society was, in accordance with our terms of reference (Dir. 1998:32), to consider, and present proposals concerning, the application of this principle in new and future technological environments. The terms of reference also state that the purpose of the rules should be to strengthen the principle of public access to information by ensuring that it can be applied in new circumstances.</p>
<p>We are progressing towards completely electronic public administration in which documents are produced, received and processed electronically and dealt with by computer-aided routines. This development is being accelerated by the requirements imposed on public authorities as regards effectiveness and efficiency, collaboration with other authorities and improved services for the citizen. The declared objective of the</p>
<p>Government and Parliament is for central government administration to set an example in the use of information technology. The rules governing public access to information are crucial to the development of an IT-based administration. Consideration of application of the principle of public access to information in the information society should therefore be based on the principle that the constitutional right of public access should be regarded as an integral part of the authorities’ information services. This right of access should therefore, as far as possible, be formulated in such a way as to allow coordinated solutions in this field, in particular as regards standards, technologies and methods. The trend towards closer collaboration between authorities should not be slowed down. It is also necessary to formulate the constitutional rules in as general terms as possible, and base them on technology-neutral concepts, if we are to take advantage of developments in information technology within the framework of the constitutional public access to information. The rules should therefore allow the broadest possible access. At the same time, the rules must obviously be formulated in such a way so as to avoid infringements of privacy.</p>
<p>In our view, the rapid development of public authorities’ information services is encouraging from the point of view of transparency. However, it also makes it necessary to emphasize that the principle of public access is a unique primary source for public scrutiny and control of the authorities. Traditionally, the purpose of the principle of public access to information is to guarantee legal certainty and effectiveness and efficiency in administration and government. In essence, therefore, the principle guarantees public scrutiny and control of the matters dealt with by the authorities and of their activities as a whole. However, in the last few decades the principle has come to fulfil a function as a means of communicating information in a broader sense. To a certain extent it now serves the purpose of ensuring the transparency of information. From our point of view this is all to the good. However, the aim of ensuring transparency of information must not be pursued so far as to prejudice the possibility of achieving the fundamental aim of the rules relating to public access, i.e. to guarantee real opportunities for scrutiny and control of the authorities’ activities. This fundamental aim can only be achieved if the rules on public access to information are formulated in such a way as to allow access irrespective of how the authorities themselves provide their information services.</p>
<p>Although the expansion of the authorities’ information services is beneficial from the point of view of public access, it should be pointed out that, to the extent that they are related to the authorities’ own activities, they can never replace the right of access guaranteed in chapter 2 of the Freedom of the Press Act. They should instead be regarded as a complement to this right. We have concluded that the authorities’ Internet-based information services cannot, in their present form, be regarded as a primary source for public scrutiny and control of their activities. It is also important to emphasize this in view of the fact that a large sector of the public still does not, or does not wish to, make use of information technology for its contacts with the authorities. In our opinion, it is essential that everybody, during the transition to an information society, should have the same opportunities to exercise their right to scrutinize the authorities’ activities, regardless of whether or not they make use of information technology.</p>
<p>A necessary measure in order to strengthen the principle of public access in the information society is to ensure that public employees are familiar with the rules relating to public access and their practical application. We have therefore taken it for granted that the rules should be as clear and easy to apply as possible. Moreover, training will be needed, both for administrators and management, to meet the need for education about these rules that still exists in public administration. The rapid increase in the authorities’ use of information technology makes it necessary to organize this education in the near future. Otherwise, the increasing use of information technology may result in a weakening of the principle of public access to information. The cooperation with the National Competence and Quality Council which has been launched within the framework of the Government’s campaign on public access to information may be one way of meeting the education needs.</p>
<p>The term ‘document’</p>
<p>We consider that the term ‘document’ should remain the fundamental concept in the Constitution’s rules on public access to documents. The main reason for this is that the public should continue to have access to certain information kept by the authorities in uncorrupted form regardless of the medium in which this information is stored. Retaining the document as the central element of the constitutional right of public access would ensure that the purpose of objectively communicating the authorities’ information assets would still be served. It is true that the term ‘document’ does raise some doubts from a linguistic point of view. However, it is very difficult to find a synonym that is better. Case law has demonstrated that the term is flexible and independent of technological developments. Nor do we see any need to make any changes in the other fundamental concepts applied in the Constitution.</p>
<p>The obligation of public authorities to compile data under the constitutional rules on public access to documents</p>
<p>We see no reason to alter the scope of public access to documents. The authorities should therefore still be obliged under the Constitution to compile information from their public records at the request of an individual. They should still have the option of making such compilations automatically, using routine procedures. If public access to documents were not assured to this extent in an electronic environment, where information is easier to access, the principle of equal access would not be fulfilled. According to this principle, the public should have the same access to information as the public authorities.</p>
<p>According to our proposal, the obligation to compile data should, however, be explicitly expressed in the legal provisions. The purpose is not to change the present legal situation, but only to establish in law the principles that are already applied in the travaux préparatoires and case law. This would, as we see it, eliminate the lack of clarity for which the present rules have been criticized and which is reflected in early discussions on ‘potential documents’. As before, however, the authorities’ obligation to make such compilations should, in order to protect the individual’s privacy, be subject to restrictions. An authority should not be obliged to make such a compilation if the request relates to personal data and the law does not permit the authority to make the compilation.</p>
<p>The term ‘custody’ and the library rule</p>
<p>In our view, records should continue to be deemed to be in the custody of an authority if they can be accessed by the authority by technical means that are used by the authority itself for transmission in a form that allows them to be read, heard or otherwise understood. Therefore, we do not propose any alteration of the definition of ‘custody’ with respect to public authorities’ records. The Swedish Governmental Data Act Commission, whose proposals in its report Privacy, Public Access, Information Technology  (SOU 1997:39) represent one of the points of departure for our work, regarded this definition of the limits of the authorities’ responsibility as absurd, since it includes anything that can be retrieved by technical means, for example via the Internet. According to the Commission, it is impossible for the authorities to have any control over such information. However, in our opinion this objection is answered by the ‘library rule’. Under this rule, documents used by an authority as a library, i.e. as reference material, are not public documents. This provision is technologyneutral and can thus also apply to information on the Internet, for example, if an authority uses it as reference material. How the limits of an authority’s responsibility are defined is therefore irrelevant to the extent of the right of public access in the case of records that are kept in external databases kept by an individual. Such records are not generally regarded as public documents anyway. If the term ‘custody’ were to be altered in accordance with the Commission’s proposals, however, this would impose substantial restrictions on an authority’s access to the databases of other authorities. This right of access, which is guaranteed in the Constitution, would be abolished by the Commission’s proposal. Furthermore, since 1992 this right of access has also been guaranteed in doubtful cases by an exception to the library rule. In our opinion, such a limitation of the present principle of public access is not compatible with the current trend in public authorities’ use of IT, since exchanges of information take place in an increasingly integrated manner. As regards the responsibility for entering, filing and sorting out the contents of a database to which several authorities have access, it should in our opinion be restricted to a single authority. We have noted that this is already provided by existing law, which lays down that as a general rule a single authority should be responsible both for the entry, filing and deletion of data.</p>
<p>We do, however, propose some changes in the wording of the provisions governing the exception to the library rule in order to achieve greater conformity with the existing IT terminology. We also propose a clarification to make it clear that the provisions only guarantee access to records that represent public documents to which an authority has access under an agreement with another authority.</p>
<p>Extension of the obligation to make public documents available</p>
<p>According to the existing rules, an authority is not obliged to make available a record ”for automatic data processing” other than in printed form. We propose that this provision be abolished. This would mean that the constitutional right to receive a transcript or copy of a public document would apply regardless of the form in which the document is stored. In practice, therefore, applicants would have the right to receive electronically stored documents not only in printed form but also in electronic form. According to our proposal, an exception would be made in the case of records that consist of software. The reason for this is the need to protect the copyright to such software. An authority should not be obliged to make documents available in electronic form if it is prohibited from doing so by law. The restrictions stipulated in the legislation on public and other records would therefore continue to apply. Our proposal would make it necessary to review such legislation.</p>
<p>As regards the risk of infringements of privacy in connection with authorities’ disclosure of personal data, we consider that, in view of the wide use of information technology nowadays, these risks are mainly associated with the distribution of the data as such. However, making data available on computer media can increase the risk of infringement of privacy since it involves practical advantages where large amounts of data are extracted and where the purpose is to process data automatically. It should, however, be borne in mind that the Data Protection Act has been replaced by a Personal Data Act, which has a wider area of application. There is a specific reference to the latter Act in the provision concerning the confidentiality of personal data (chapter 7, section 16 of the Secrecy Act). This confidentiality clause is applicable to the disclosure of both individual personal data and mass data extraction, regardless of the method of disclosure. We therefore consider that privacy would be effectively protected in connection with any release of public documents containing personal data even if the provision relating to printed material was abolished. Apart from that, we do not consider it necessary to introduce any restrictions in chapter 2 of the Freedom of the Press Act relating to mass data extraction, apart from the restriction resulting from application of chapter 7, section 16 of the Secrecy Act and the provisions in records legislation.</p>
<p>Our proposals would involve an extension of the authorities’ obligations in connection with the principle of public access to information. It may therefore be questioned whether the proposals are consistent with the EC Data Protection Directive. However, the proposals do not affect the authorities’ obligation to provide access to personal data. Consequently, we do not consider the Directive relevant to our proposals or an obstacle to their implementation.</p>
<p>In our opinion, our proposals would not affect authorities which sell information, either as regards the fees they charge for such sales or in other ways. However, the proposals would necessitate a revision of the Charges and Fees Ordinance, since there are no provisions in the Ordinance concerning public documents that are released in electronic form in accordance with the principle of public access to information.</p>
<p>Supporting systems for public access to documents</p>
<p>We propose the introduction of a new provision in the Constitution clarifying the implications of the filing rules for the right of access to public documents. The Constitution’s provisions on public access to documents lay down a general requirement for public documents to be kept in such a way as to ensure that they can be found and cannot disappear or be destroyed. However, this need of protection is even more important in the context of the authorities’ use of information technology, in order to ensure that the possibility of public access does not remain a dead letter. When it comes to information technology, it is important to take measures at an early stage. The ongoing changeover to information technology by public authorities makes the filing rules increasingly important. We therefore consider that there is a need to emphasize the importance of these rules in the context of public access to information more strongly than before. The connection between the filing rules and the Constitution should therefore be strengthened. The relevant legislation should still contain substantive rules concerning the authorities’ obligations as regards the keeping, sorting out and other disposal of public documents. The new provision in the Constitution would therefore consist of a reference to these rules.</p>
<p>In our opinion, there is a need to coordinate the provisions of the Public Records Act (1992:191) and the provisions of chapter 15 of the Secrecy Act concerning the recording of public documents etc. so as to ensure that the rules are uniform. To ensure that the authorities that apply the filing rules are more familiar with their implications it is not enough to emphasize the importance of the rules by adding a provision to the Constitution. It is also essential that the structure of the rules should be as simple and comprehensible as possible. The obligations imposed on the public authorities in order to ensure that they meet the need of protection that arises in connection with public access to documents exist in various sets of rules, which sometimes overlap. It is therefore not clear which rules are general rules and which are supplementary rules, nor whether different sets of rules are involved. We therefore consider it very important to enact uniform rules. Such rules should as far as possible be technology-neutral. They should also set out all the obligations to which authorities are subject throughout the process of keeping public documents, i.e. from the moment when the authority prepares to produce documents and receives documents up to the moment when documents are sorted out or otherwise disposed of. We have not yet presented any such proposals in this respect, but will return to the matter at a later stage.</p>
<h2>Public access and copyright</h2>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Our terms of reference state that in some cases a public document protected by a copyright is submitted to an authority for the sole purpose of making it available to the public. The terms of reference therefore point out that in isolated cases it may be necessary to investigate the need to extend the possibility of not providing access to documents that contain works protected by copyright.</p>
<p>In this connection the Commission’s assignment has thus been to investigate whether there is a need in certain cases to restrict</p>
<p>access to a public document that is subject to copyright or related rights. We have worked on the assumption that as a general rule the principle of maximum access to public documents should continue to apply.</p>
<p>The principle of public access to information and copyright</p>
<p>In principle, the Freedom of the Press Act and the Copyright Act operate side by side for the purpose of ensuring a free society and promoting intellectual creativity. Generally speaking, there is no conflict between the principle of providing access to public documents and the Copyright Act. However, a conflict of interest may arise in connection with the application of the provisions on access to public documents in chapter 2 of the Freedom of the Press Act where a work protected by copyright is included in a public document. The legislator has so far solved this conflict of interest by giving precedence to public access to documents. This principle applies in general, even where it is used to produce copies of and circulate works protected by copyright against the author’s will.</p>
<p>Our analysis of the need of reform indicates that this general principle of the Swedish system should continue to apply. However, we have concluded that it is not reasonable for the principle of public access to documents to take precedence over copyright without any exceptions.</p>
<p>When an authority provides access to a public document which contains a work protected by copyright on the premises or in copies or transcripts, it is, from a copyright point of view, disposing of the work contained in the document in certain respects. The author may incur a loss in terms of both the financial and the moral rights safeguarded by copyright law.</p>
<p>In principle, an author has unlimited rights to works that have not been published in the copyright sense. An important element of these rights is the right to decide if and when the work is to be published for the first time. This may be described as a right for the author himself to decide when he is ready to release the work. The fact that an authority provides access to an unpublished work, included in a public document, that has been submitted to it without the author’s consent deprives the author of the right to decide when the work is to be made available to the public.</p>
<p>However, for an authority to provide access to a work protected by copyright as a public document is prejudicial to copyright not only because the work is made available to the public. Since in such cases the authority is acting in accordance with the law, the work must also be deemed to have been lawfully published within the meaning of copyright law. When a work has been published within the meaning of copyright law, this has various legal consequences. For example, once the work is published it can be used to make copies for personal use and it may also be quoted without the consent of, or payment of monetary compensation to, the author.</p>
<p>For these reasons we have considered it necessary to provide protection from public access in certain cases with reference to the copyright to certain unpublished works. Since the author has the right to decide what to do with the unpublished work, the only exemptions that can be made in our opinion are works that have been submitted to an authority without the consent of the author or any other right-holder.</p>
<p>Access to public documents within the meaning of the Constitution may only be restricted to the extent provided for under chapter 2 of the Freedom of the Press Act. The present wording of these provisions does not permit any limitation of access to public documents except as regards the financial aspects of copyright law. To extend protection to include other kinds of damage and infringements it would be necessary to amend the Freedom of the Press Act.</p>
<p>Some unpublished works, which may not be assumed to lack commercial interest, are protected from public access since April 1 2000 by a confidentiality clause (chapter 8, section 27 of the Secrecy Act). The origin of this clause is an event that took place in 1996, when confidential material belonging to the American organization Religious Technology Center was submitted to various authorities for the sole purpose of ensuring the production of a number of copies and circulation of the material to the public (the ‘Scientology Case’). The United States and other countries subsequently questioned whether Sweden, in view of the fact that its legislation made it possible in accordance with the principle of public access to documents to circulate unpublished works protected by copyright, could be considered to comply with the Berne Convention and the TRIP Agreement. The fact that a cornerstone of our legislation has thus been questioned obviously presents a problem.</p>
<p>Although we have concluded that there is a need to extend protection in some cases, we have decided not to propose any further limitation of access to public documents. The reason for this is that in our view the scope of copyright law is now so broad that parts of it present a problem in view of the overriding interest in free debate and balanced information. Instead, the Committee recommends that the question of striking a balance between copyright law and freedom of expression and information should be made the subject of a broader review and that further legislation for the purpose of preventing forced publication of works protected by copyright should wait until such a review has been completed.</p>
<p>The Commission has elaborated and discussed several proposals for amendments of the Freedom of the Press Act, the Secrecy Act and the Copyright Act. The aim has not been to propose any derogations from the principle that public access to documents should normally take precedence over copyright law. Although none of these proposals are presented here, our consideration of various technical legislative solutions is presented in an appendix.</p>
<p>Authorities’ release of computer software and databases</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Commission proposes the introduction of a right to obtain access to electronically stored documents in electronic form. In this connection the Commission has given particular consideration to the question of whether authorities should make their computer software and databases available in electronic form.</p>
<p>As regards the authorities’ computer software, the Commission has concluded that the provision relating to printed material in chapter 2, section 13 of the Freedom of the Press Act should be retained. This means that public authorities would continue to be required only to provide hard copies of computer software. In our opinion, the need to protect copyright interests relating to computer software is met by this measure.</p>
<p>As regards databases which contain public documents, there is no reason in our opinion to propose that they should not be made available in printed form or in copies in the same way as other public documents. In other words, our proposal to allow public documents to be supplied in electronic form would apply also to</p>
<p>the authorities’ databases insofar as they consist of public documents.</p>
<p>Proposal for an EC Directive on copyright</p>
<p>We have followed the ongoing negotiations in the EU on a proposal for a Directive on harmonization of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society – COM(99)250 final. A proposal for a Directive on copyright and related rights in the information society will probably be adopted in the spring of 2001. The current proposal includes a provision to the effect that the Directive should not affect access to public documents. This provision is the result of negotiations by Sweden, the purpose of which was to prevent the Directive affecting Sweden’s constitutional rules on access to public documents. Consequently, the Swedish provisions on access to public documents are in principle consistent with the proposed Directive.</p>
<p>The copyright rules in the proposed Directive do not necessitate any amendments to chapter 2 of the Freedom of the Press Act.</p>
