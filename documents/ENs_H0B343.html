<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Committee of Inquiry into Future Support to Consumers has been tasked with reviewing existing support for consumers in the form of public information and guidance on consumer rights and obligations, choosing products in consumer markets and publicly financed services, and selecting products on the basis of ethical and environmental criteria. The Committee has also been instructed to propose ways of organising and providing appropriate, effective support available on equal terms to all consumers in the country, while taking account of the need to ensure that relevant actors’ roles and spheres of responsibility are clearly defined. The Committee’s remit further includes proposing strategies and methods to be applied by actors when designing measures in order to ensure that support reaches consumers and can be utilised by them. It is also required to identify target group needs and appropriate information channels. Finally, the Committee has been tasked with conducting a general survey of how consumer support is organised and implemented in other countries such as the UK, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands, and with proposing suitable legislation based on the Committee Chair’s deliberations.</p>
<h2>Consumer need for support as a point of departure</h2>
<p>A starting point for the Committee was the need for consumer support. Considerations regarding choice of methods, strategies and information channels and the organisation of consumer support have accordingly been based as far as possible on a consumer, as opposed to an actor, perspective. Social developments in the past 20 years have radically changed conditions for consumers in terms of opportunities to seek and share information. One example is the now widespread tendency, particularly among young people, to search for information in the social media, and to share their purchasing experiences with others on the internet. A growing proportion of all information exchange in society now takes place on the internet, a trend that has created new risks as well as opportunities, as the information available there is of varying quality and not always reliable.</p>
<p>These developments have also led to new ways of consuming. Ecommerce has made it easier to shop from home and contributed to the emergence of new consumption patterns. Similarly, the proliferation of large shopping centres has created new purchasing patterns and behaviours. Changes in the credit market have also given rise to new consumption patterns. These include quick, easily available credit to meet daily consumption, a development which has also played a major part in growing over-indebtedness in society. Re-regulation and new innovations in certain areas have given rise to new markets where responsibility for choosing goods or services has devolved on the consumer. Thanks to technological advances, commercial marketing messages can now reach the consumer more easily over a growing number of channels, such as mobile telephony and the internet. In a number of respects, this development has been favourable from a consumer standpoint, with a wider selection of products on offer and more information, e.g. through the emergence of product comparison tools. However, it also places new demands on – and correspondingly higher risks for – consumers when selecting goods and services.</p>
<p>Moreover, it places new demands on independent consumer support in terms of ensuring accessibility and visibility in a limitless stream of information from different independent and commercial actors. The Committee accordingly recognises the need for a higher level of ambition with regard to consumer support.</p>
<p>If the consumer is to have ready access to independent support, this should be available as far as possible via a single entry point and be experienced as a cohesive unit. A single contact interface for consumer support is more conducive to enhancing consumer knowledge and easy accessibility. It also makes for accessible, coherent support. In addition, support efforts should incorporate active outreach in order to make contact with consumers in any given search query. A further aspect which the Committee has taken into consideration, and which constitutes one of the directive's points of departure, is the need for more equitable consumer support.</p>
<p>Consumer support methods and strategies should take account of the needs and behaviours of different target groups. The Committee has chosen to divide consumers roughly into two target groups, each requiring different methods and strategies. One group comprises consumers who actively search for information. The other is composed of consumers who do not. The first group is most effectively reached by support which is accessible, informative and relevant. Reaching the second group requires targeted strategies aimed at raising awareness of the value of being a competent, critical consumer. The Committee’s proposed measures for reaching out more effectively to consumers are aimed at the firstmentioned target group. Its proposals on methods and strategies for consumers who are not easy to reach are aimed at the second group.</p>
<h2>Proposed measures for reaching consumers more effectively A new structure for consumer support</h2>
<p>A part of consumer support consists in offering guidance in specific cases and providing web-based information. Examples range from the provision of pre-purchase information to support in the event of a consumer complaint. These forms of support are aimed at consumers who have a degree of involvement and insight into consumer-related issues, as availing oneself of support requires a certain amount of activity on the consumer’s part. The Committee considers that existing structures for reaching out to consumers are unsuited to the provision of effective, equitable and accessible consumer support. In the Committee’s view, this is because entry points to guidance and information provided by actors are not adapted to consumers' search behaviours. Consumer support must be visible at the point where the consumer is located and searching for information. It must therefore be provided within a simpler, more straightforward structure that makes it easier for consumers to get started and track down information and advice at need. Consumer support must also be more equitable. The Committee recognises the relevance of the argument that support should be perceived as a unified entity despite the involvement of different actors. In addition, the structure must be designed in accordance with the way consumers search for information – primarily on the internet.</p>
<h2>Web-based information provided by actors must be available via an electronic information service</h2>
<p>With a view to improving accessibility to web-based consumer information provided by authorities, consumer advice centres, actors in civil society and municipal councils, the Committee proposes the establishment of an electronic information service with a comprehensive body of information available on a public network. The Committee proposes  that the service be governed by a new government ordinance on consumer information. The service would be required to include information on consumers’ legal positions, and information designed to enable them to make conscious, informed choices. It would also be required to include information from relevant authorities deemed to be of interest to consumers. Under the proposal, each authority would make its own assessment of what is to be regarded as applicable, reliable and appropriate for consumers of the existing information authorities are already required to provide and make available on their own websites or elsewhere. The Committee proposes  that responsibility for providing consumer information be vested with the following government agencies, and that this task be specified in the respective agencies’ standing instructions: the National Board for Consumer Disputes, the Energy Markets Inspectorate, the Board of Supervision of Estate Agents, the Financial Supervisory Authority, the Swedish Enforcement Authority, the Swedish Competition Authority, the National Food Administration, the National Gaming Board, the Medical Products Agency, the Post and Telecom Authority, the Swedish Transport Administration, the Swedish Transport Agency, the Swedish Pensions Agency, the Swedish Chemicals Agency, the National Electrical Safety Board, the Swedish Consumer Agency, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Board of Housing, the Swedish Energy Agency and the Data Inspection Board.</p>
<p>The aim of the proposal is to make it easier in future to determine whether information content is inadequate in a given sector, in which case the agency's instructions in the corresponding areas may need to be more clearly formulated.</p>
<p>The Swedish Consumer Agency as coordinating body for the electronic information service</p>
<p>The Committee proposes  that the Swedish Consumer Agency act as the coordinating authority for the electronic information service, and that this responsibility be specified in the agency’s standing instructions. The Committee proposes that the coordinating agency's functions be set out in the proposed ordinance on consumer information. The Consumer Agency should be given responsibility for the development, provision and management of the information service. In addition, the agency should be made responsible for practical coordination and joint operational issues, the technical system itself, and performance monitoring of the information service. The responsibilities of a coordinating agency include that of editor-in-chief; the agency will accordingly be expected to make final decisions on the structuring of information and editorial content. Any changes of a non-editorial character made by the coordinating agency must be implemented in consultation with the information provider as each actor bears responsibility for the content of its own texts, a requirement which should also be stated by the information service. In addition, the agency would be required as part of its extended responsibility to look into the possibility of using social media as a component of the information service. The Committee wishes to call attention to the importance of developing the electronic information service using open format. This both enables automatic coordination of information between authorities responsible for its provision and makes data available to other actors.</p>
<p>Information provided by consumer advice centres, municipal authorities and civil society organisations.</p>
<p>The Committee acknowledges the value to consumers of access to web-based consumer advice information via the electronic information service. It also takes a positive view of the contributions to the information service of civil society organisations whose aims are in agreement with consumer policy objectives. The Committee proposes  that the Swedish Consumer Agency in its capacity as coordinating authority be responsible for entering into agreements with actors – other than those with official responsibility for providing information – which in the agency's view could play an active role in the information service and meet the terms and conditions for participation. The Committee also proposes  that the Government task the authorities represented on the boards of consumer advice centres with seeking to ensure that centres collaborate with the Consumer Agency in providing consumer information within the framework of their respective remits. Consumer information relating to local or regional conditions should be accessible via the information service through links to municipal council websites.</p>
<p>Establishment of a consumer information council</p>
<p>As responsibility for the information content of the electronic information service is vested in a number of actors, continuous cooperation between them will be essential to ensure coherence and facilitate solutions to problems that may arise. To ensure that those tasked with contributing information bring their influence to bear, operate effectively and coordinate with other actors, the Committee proposes  the establishment of an advisory body, a consumer information council, tasked with assisting the Consumer Agency in its role as coordinating authority. It is further proposed that the council be composed of not more than 10 members appointed by the Government and be chaired by the agency. The council should comprise representatives of the agencies responsible for providing information. The municipal sector and the consumer advice centres should also be represented.</p>
<h2>Consumer Agency responsibility for guidance to individual consumers</h2>
<p>Direct guidance and advice on consumer issues is an essential complement to web-based support and a significant factor in reaching consumers who for various reasons cannot access web-based information. The fact that the Consumer Agency’s is not currently required to provide guidance to individual consumers is at variance with many consumers’ expectations of the agency. This state of affairs may have contributed to a structure which is ill-adapted to the way consumers search for information. In order to achieve a clearly articulated structure with a single contact interface to the consumer , consumer support must be in the form of first-line  support so  the consumer can easily obtain guidance and support from the electronic information service via social media, telephone, email or written correspondence. The focus should be on ensuring that consumers can be helped by the electronic information system using self-help tools and information from other actors. Other authorities and the consumer advice centres should function within the proposed structure as second-line support capable of offering consumers specialised skills. Municipal consumer guidance activities can also constitute second-line  support  in cases where the guidance officer needs to look through written material, e.g. to address a local issue, or where the case involves meeting the officer in person.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes  that agency instructions in this connection should state that the Consumer Agency bears responsibility for providing guidance to individual consumers on sale-related and contractual issues, and for informing and advising consumers within its sphere of activity, with the aim of enabling the latter to make conscious, informed choices. The Committee proposes  that the Government task the Consumer Agency with developing and providing nationwide direct guidance, including guidance by telephone and in writing. In the Committee’s view, an initial staff complement of 25 annual full-time equivalents for guidance services constitutes a reasonable figure.</p>
<p>Collaboration between actors responsible for direct guidance services</p>
<p>If the structure is to be appropriate and effective, there must be collaboration between the Consumer Agency and other agencies, consumer advice centres and municipal consumer guidance services, where existing skills are to be found. The Committee proposes  that the Government task the National Post and Telecom Agency, the Energy Markets Inspectorate, the Swedish Energy Agency and the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority with working to ensure that consumer advice centres – acting in accordance with their respective purpose descriptions – cooperate with the Consumer Agency in its efforts to develop and deliver guidance services. The Committee’s proposal represents a higher level of ambition, with municipal consumer-related activities continuing to play a significant role.</p>
<p>The Committee’s assessment  is that this proposal will give municipal councils greater scope to improve the service for their communities with better and more accessible guidance, while enabling them to pursue a more assertive outreach approach vis à vis municipal residents and businesses than at present.</p>
<h2>Guidance in the prevention of over-indebtedness</h2>
<p>There is a need for a national guidance service, a ‘financial emergency facility’ designed to counter over-indebtedness among private individuals. The Committee considers  that the introduction of such a service would require a more in-depth analysis in a number of areas, and that its proposal should be evaluated more closely in a different context.</p>
<h2>The need for marketing measures</h2>
<p>Promoting public awareness of consumer support and encouraging general recognition of the benefits of becoming an informed consumer will require a communication plan.</p>
<p>T he Committee proposes  that the Government task the Swedish Consumer Agency with drawing up a communication plan designed to give consumers a better idea of where to turn for guidance and advice. One strategy is to establish a visual identity, a graphic profile and logotype for independent consumer support.</p>
<p>Another is to collaborate with business operators to offer information on independent consumer support. The communication plan should also include strategies and activities aimed at raising awareness of the benefits of being an informed consumer. Such measures would be aimed primarily at consumers who are difficult to reach.</p>
<h2>Methods and strategies for communicating with consumers who are difficult to reach</h2>
<p>The Committee’s proposals regarding outreach measures for consumer support will serve to lower the threshold for information and guidance provision and better enable consumers to find and come in contact with consumer support.</p>
<p>Reaching consumers who do not search for information requires a targeted outreach approach.</p>
<h2>Information provided in the right way, at the right time</h2>
<p>It is important to arouse the recipient’s interest by explaining the benefits of being a critical and informed consumer. It is also essential that the relevant actors share a common point of departure in terms of target groups and that their choice of information channels are appropriate to the target groups to be reached. The Committee proposes  that actors make more concerted efforts than at present to identify situations suitable for relaying information to consumers. Efforts should be made from time to time to remind consumers that consumer support is available, to explain how  it can be accessed, and to highlight the importance of being an informed, critical consumer.</p>
<h2>The key role of municipal consumer support activities in outreach efforts</h2>
<p>Crucial to outreach work is proximity to the consumer, who can now be reached virtually as well as physically. The role of municipal councils with regard to outreach will continue to be highly relevant thanks to their strong local connections and natural proximity to their communities. The Committee's assessment  is that municipal consumer support activities have the potential to play a more pivotal role in this area than at present. The provision of first-line  support  by the Consumer Agency will allow municipal councils to give greater priority to outreach work than at present.</p>
<h2>The Consumer Agency should support municipal councils in their outreach activities vis à vis consumers</h2>
<p>Government agencies and municipal councils currently carry out outreach activities at local level or as part of broader coordinating projects. Inter-municipal collaboration on outreach work is important. Councils should be given support and information about successful projects and be informed of indications received by the Consumer Agency in its capacity of coordinating authority regarding the proposed information and guidance services. Assigning an actor a supporting role will benefit outreach work in the municipalities. The Committee proposes  that the Consumer Agency’s remit be defined more precisely through a provision in its instructions expressly requiring the agency to support municipal councils in their outreach activities.</p>
<h2>The need for collaboration and coordination of outreach efforts</h2>
<p>Outreach work must be planned and coordinated in accordance with an overall approach, and to a large extent take place through collaboration between the relevant agencies, consumer advice centres, municipal councils and consumer advocacy organisations. It is vital that the Consumer Agency contribute to continued methods development in this sphere. The Committee proposes that the following approach serve as a point of departure for outreach work.</p>
<p>• Identify the sectors or choices deemed appropriate for action aimed at impacting consumer involvement and insight.</p>
<p>• Define the underlying problem and set up clear, preferably measurable, goals.</p>
<p>• Gain better understanding of the purchasing behaviours of different target groups.</p>
<p>• Establish  best practices  (new projects tested as pilot projects).</p>
<p>• Evaluate effectiveness and goal fulfilment.</p>
<p>• Ensure clear allocation of competencies among the actors concerned.</p>
<h2>The need for a common point of departure when defining target groups</h2>
<p>If identification of target groups is to be meaningful, a more uniform conceptual framework will be needed in the Committee's view. Choosing common points of departure when defining target groups also furnishes actors with a joint platform. This in turn makes collaboration easier as efforts can more readily coordinated. The Committee proposes  that a common point of departure for defining target groups should take the following form: A consumer is in a vulnerable  position if he or she is likely to suffer harm in the purchasing process. The risk of suffering harm will vary with the character of the market, the qualities of the product, the type of transaction, personal qualities or personal circumstances that adversely impact the consumer's ability to choose or to pursue a complaint. The risk of harm may also arise from a combination of the market’s character and the consumer’s personal circumstances. A consumer is placed in an exposed  situation when his or her circumstances and/or personal qualities adversely affect the consumer process in more permanent ways. A person is placed in an exposed situation when he or she repeatedly suffers harm as a consumer or experiences reduced satisfaction with the products he or she consumes.</p>
<h2>Survey of consumer behaviour in different situations</h2>
<p>The needs of different target groups in terms of information and support is a complex question involving a number of factors, such as the type of market concerned and the choices facing the consumer. In order to develop suitable methods for this undertaking and to determine whether such methods are appropriate, it will be necessary to examine the underlying reasons for consumer action or passivity, market by market and choice by choice. The same applies to consumer involvement, or lack thereof, in environmental or ethical concerns.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes  that the Government vest the Swedish Consumer Agency with responsibility for charting the underlying causes of consumer behaviour in choice situations deemed to be of particular significance, and to recommend suitable methods and information channels on the basis of the survey findings in terms of the needs of the various target groups. The Committee takes a favourable view of ongoing collaboration on consumer research at various universities and institutes of higher education.</p>
<h2>The need for clearer information on the impact of household consumption on people and the environment A new responsibility for the Environmental Protection Agency</h2>
<p>The Committee proposes  that the Environmental Protection Agency be given responsibility for informing consumers on the impact of household consumption on people and the environment. The aim here is to enable consumers to access information with a broader perspective on the impact their consumption can have on people and the environment. Such information should not, however, include (for example) the environmental or human impact of the activities of the enterprise or public sectors. The Committee’s assessment is that information of this kind should help give consumers a better understanding of how to consume in an environmentally friendly way.</p>
<h2>Support for consumers in choice situations involving schools, healthcare and the social services</h2>
<p>Greater freedom of choice in the school market has led to a situation where choosing a school resembles in certain respects the process of choosing a product in a traditional consumer market. The Committee’s recommendations regarding the structure, composition and promotion of consumer support are thus relevant to the configuration of support and information for consumers who are considering a choice of school. However, there are substantial differences. The school choice situation not only places additional demands on those responsible for providing guidance but also involves the development of methods and strategies for reaching users. This issue should therefore be addressed elsewhere. Having regard to the inquiry currently in progress (Committee of Inquiry on Independent Schools, ToR 2011:68 ), the Committee has no plans to present proposals in this area.</p>
<p>The Committee notes that individuals can face complex choice situations in the healthcare and social services sphere, in situations where the Free Choice Systems Act (2008:962) is applicable. The structure and composition of support in the healthcare and social services sphere is a broad, complex issue and should therefore be addressed elsewhere. In light of the above, and having regard to the deliberations of the Committee of Inquiry on Patient Power (ToR 2011:25 ) and its forthcoming findings, the Committee has no plans to present proposals in this area.</p>
