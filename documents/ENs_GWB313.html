<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The overall objective under the terms of reference of the Grid Connection Inquiry is to promote the development of renewable electricity production. The electricity certificate system is absolutely crucial for the amount of renewable electricity produced in Sweden in the future. It is not part of this Inquiry’s remit to evaluate the electricity certificate system. However, the proposals presented by the Inquiry are expected to lead to more favourable conditions for renewable electricity production. Indirectly, this may lead to increased production since the introduction of renewable electricity can take place at a lower cost to the economy, which may increase acceptance for extending the electricity certificate system.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals can be expected to lead to:</p>
<p>• More  self-produced electricity: The Inquiry proposes that small power plants of less than 63 amperes (which is equivalent to an output of around 44 kW) can be connected without requiring hourly metering, which will lead to significantly lower costs.</p>
<p>• Simpler and faster grid connection of plants producing renewable electricity: The Inquiry proposes relaxed routines with regard to concession management for electricity networks and the provision of administrative guidelines for how renewable electricity producers are to agree with network companies when connecting to the grid.</p>
<p>• More economically sound expansion of renewable electricity production: The Inquiry proposes that the present 1 500 kW limit for reduced network charges be replaced by a ceiling on the network charge of SEK 0.03 per kWh. The reason for this is to increase incentives to choose the most  cost-effective power plant instead of optimising capacity so as to minimise network charges. The proposal to introduce a ceiling on network tariffs instead of the 1 500 kW limit is expected to enable the interest in expanding renewable energy in rural areas to continue to increase rather than drastically declining. Compulsory individually estimated tariffs based on the share of the network used by a company and a defined method for estimating the impact of production plants on network losses provide incentives to connect power plants at the point in the electricity network that is right from a cost-benefit point of view.</p>
<p>• More economically sound expansion of the grid: The Inquiry proposes the establishment of a grid investment fund. This will lead to necessary investments for connecting renewable energy being able to receive funding, provided that they deliver cost benefits, i.e. the lowest cost per kWh renewable electricity produced. This is expected to lead to lower costs for electricity customers.</p>
<h2>The remit (see chapter 1)</h2>
<p>World energy use primarily consists of fossil fuels. In historical terms, consumption has never grown so rapidly as in the last three years. To achieve a long-term sustainable energy supply, the challenge thus facing us mainly involves combining radically more efficient energy use with a very sharp increase in the use of renewable types of energy.</p>
<p>Sweden’s electricity supply is currently based on two strong pillars, hydro power and nuclear power. Sweden is in a very good position to be able in the future to rely on a third strong pillar consisting mainly of biofuels and wind power. This Inquiry involves examining ways in which grid connection regulations for power plants in this third pillar could be improved to achieve a rational electricity supply.</p>
<p>To increase the amount of renewable electricity production in the Swedish energy mix, an electricity certificate system has been introduced. At present, most of the indications are that this system leads to the building of about the same amount of renewable production as it is designed for, i.e. at present, 17 TWh by 2016, compared with when the system was introduced.</p>
<p>The first point in the terms of reference for this Inquiry is: “Evaluate whether the current regulatory framework for renewable electricity production creates barriers to large-scale development and expansion of renewable electricity production. If it is considered that changes in the regulations are required, the Inquiry is to present proposals to this effect.” The regulations that are absolutely core to “large-scale development and expansion of renewable electricity production” are thus the quotas and other rules of the electricity certificate system. However, the Inquiry has interpreted the terms of reference to mean that the level of the amount of certificateentitled production, which is determined in the detailed regulations of the certificate system, is a political question that lies outside the remit of this Inquiry. If, however, “large-scale development and expansion of renewable electricity production” is taken to mean more than 17 TWh by 2016, the quotas and other rules of the electricity certificate system must be changed.</p>
<p>With reference to the first point in the Inquiry’s terms of reference, the purpose of this Inquiry is not to pay regard to the amount of electricity production linked to “large-scale production and expansion of renewable electricity production,” but rather to examine the competition between the various plants (at a given total amount) so that as rational expansion as possible is achieved. The purpose of the Inquiry is thus to bring about as economically sound an expansion of renewable electricity production as possible. One possible consequence, which is uncertain and requires political decisions, is that a more economically sound expansion may lead to increased political interest in allowing higher electricity certificate quotas.</p>
<h2>Renewable electricity production in Sweden (see chapter 2)</h2>
<p>In 2006, there were 1 916 plants receiving electricity certificates, i.e., plants for the production of wind power, solar electricity, smallscale hydro power and biofuel-based combined heat and power plants (CHP). The total number of plants was 2 288. Of these plants, 1 847 had a capacity less than or equal to 1.5 MW and 229 of these had a capacity that was less than or equal to 50 kW.</p>
<p>For the actors on the market to invest in new electricity production plants, long-term and stable economic conditions are required. The revenue side consists of the price of electricity and the price of the electricity certificate. The price of electricity is not expected to fall. However, with an unchanged electricity certificate system, the electricity certificate price will be very low when the expansion of new certificate-entitled electricity production exceeds 17 TWh. This is equivalent to today’s quota level. With a very low certificate price, no new electricity production will be built when 17 TWh has been reached, unless the price of electricity increases significantly. If society seeks production of renewable electricity greater than 17 TWh, it is therefore important that the Riksdag determines a new target for the electricity certificate system at an early stage. This applies to the significant proportion of renewable electricity production, for which the price of electricity is not a sufficient source of funding.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has studied productivity potential assessments and forecasts of how much new, renewable electricity production can be built. What will ultimately be achieved will depend on the economic conditions. Elforsk expects some 60 per cent of the fuel for CHP production in district heating to consist of biofuels by 2015, equivalent to a total electricity production of 9 TWh. In the long term, forecasts and productivity potential assessments show that CHP production, based both on biofuels and natural gas, may account for between 18 and 20 TWh of electricity per year. Neither solar cells, wave power or geothermics are expected to become part of the Swedish power system to any great extent by 2025. The Swedish Energy Agency estimates that hydro power can increase by a total of 0.75 TWh by 2015 and according to its forecasts, wind power will produce some 8.6 TWh by 2025. There is, however, considerably greater potential to expand wind power. If all planned plants over 25 MW were realised, estimated wind electricity production from these plants alone would be between 17 and 23 TWh.</p>
<h2>International comparison (see chapter 3)</h2>
<p>To gain inspiration, the Inquiry has studied how the relevant issues are dealt with in Spain, Portugal, Germany and the UK. These countries show strong development with regard to renewable electricity production. The comparison in this Inquiry has primarily focused on wind power, as electricity network issues are especially relevant to this technology in particular.</p>
<p>The areas studied where the differences between existing Swedish legislation and the current situation in the four countries studied have been most marked are:</p>
<p>• The compensation level: All the four countries studied have higher levels of compensation for electricity produced by wind turbines.</p>
<p>• Network tariffs: In the countries studied, no network tariffs apply to any production in Spain, Portugal or Germany. This is important to note when comparing the compensation levels of different countries.</p>
<p>• Network concessions: In all four countries analysed, wind power producers themselves are allowed to build electricity lines within the wind farm and between the wind farm and the transmission/ distribution network, i.e., it is not necessary to go via a network company.</p>
<p>• Other network investments: Each country has different detailed regulations on the upgrades in the electricity grid that are to be financed either by electricity producers or network companies.</p>
<p>• Requirement for metering of small plants: There is no requirement in Germany, Spain or Portugal for smaller plants to meter and submit returns on an hourly basis. Compensation for electricity produced domestically is, however, often so high, that it pays to sell this electricity instead of using it to reduce one’s own consumption.</p>
<p>All of the four countries analysed have shown flexibility with regard to continuously adapting energy policy, rules and provisions to technical and economic developments. However, this also applies to Sweden, as exemplified by this Inquiry.</p>
<h2>Electricity network investment funds (see chapter 4.1)</h2>
<p>The existing electricity grid has the capacity to receive a considerable increase in electricity production. However, the Inquiry has found that there is a need to solve certain bottlenecks in the electricity network to make it easier to expand the network in an economically sound way. This primarily concerns areas with good conditions for renewable electricity production where the initial costs for upgrading networks are higher than an individual producer can afford.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore proposes the creation of a grid investment fund to finance investments in the electricity grid for future renewable electricity production. This fund is planned to partially finance network charges for connection to plants that fulfil the criteria for being allocated electricity certificates. The electricity producer itself is to be responsible for part of the network charge for connection; the Inquiry’s proposal is that the point of departure for the selffinancing component be SEK 1.3 million per megawatt installed.</p>
<p>The fund will be financed via network companies and will be shared according to each company’s underlying electricity consumption by end customers. The fund will be placed as a special managing body at a host agency. The Inquiry sees the Swedish Energy Agency and the Energy Markets Inspectorate as possible host agencies.</p>
<h2>Changes regarding network concessions (see chapter 4.2)</h2>
<p>There are a number of different circumstances connected with network concessions that hinder the introduction of renewable energy sources. One of them, for example, is that it is difficult to make the expansion of the necessary line capacity subject to competition. Sometimes a planned expansion leads to production and network companies finding it difficult to agree on the technical performance of the grid connection for an electricity production plant. If an electricity producer wants to build its own network independently, it is necessary to form a network company and apply for a concession. This is accompanied by requirements for submitting returns and other demands which, in many cases, are considered to lead to unnecessary red-tape. Licensing procedures for production plants and electricity networks are not coordinated, which leads both to increased costs and unnecessarily long waits from application to startup. With its proposals, the Inquiry aims to facilitate the licence procedure and thus reduce costs and speed up processing times.</p>
<p>For the above reasons, the Inquiry proposes that an exemption from the network concession requirement prescribed in the Electricity Act be introduced for internal networks at electricity production plants. A possibility should also be introduced for the Energy Markets Inspectorate to approve certain measures to relax requirements for concession holders. This is a first step in making it easier and increasing predictability for new electricity producers, something that has been put forward as one of the most important factors in achieving an expansion in renewable electricity production. As a second step, the Inquiry also proposes that the Energy Network Inquiry, which under its terms of reference is to conduct a review concerning concessions, analyse the advisability of implementing an amendment to the Electricity Act allowing the possibility of granting network concessions for private power lines.</p>
<p>To facilitate the licence procedure for new power lines for renewable electricity production, the Inquiry proposes that a provision be introduced into the Electricity Act to the effect that the Energy Markets Inspectorate will only examine the suitability of the plant and network company, provided that another agency has examined and approved their suitability on the basis of other aspects to be considered under the Electricity Act. The Inquiry also proposes that the Environmental Procedures Inquiry M2007:04 be assigned the task of further reviewing the possibilities of coordinating environmental assessments and localisation issues for electricity power lines and electricity production plants, in order to simplify the licence procedure for new electricity production plants.</p>
<h2>Administrative guidelines for grid connection (see chapter 4.3)</h2>
<p>After instructions from the Inquiry, Swedenergy and Svensk Vindkraft have produced trade recommendations for facilitating contacts between network companies and electricity producers in the process of connecting new electricity production plants to the grid. The issues are the same, regardless of the type of electricity production being considered, which is why the Swedish Renewable Energies Association (SERO) and LRF have also endorsed the guidelines. The result, the document ‘Administrative guidelines for grid connection’ (appendix 3), is to have the status of a trade recommendation. The Inquiry urges the parties to follow up the way in which the document works and how it is complied with and, where necessary, to revise it after a given period.</p>
<h2>Proposals for network tariffs and changes in exemptions for small electricity producers, the 1500 kW ceiling (see chapter 4.4 and 4.5).</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the present reduced network charge for small electricity production plants under the Electricity Act, Chapter 4, Section 10 be removed and replaced with a limited charge for electricity transmission for all new electricity production fulfilling the criteria for allocation of electricity certificates. The charge for transmitting electricity from these will be limited to a maximum of SEK 0.03 per kWh plus a fixed cost for the annual costs of metering, estimating and submitting returns in the concession holders’s network, over a ten-year period. Where the ordinary tariff exceeds SEK 0.03 per kWh, the tariff will return to the ordinary level ten years after start-up. The network tariff will be determined by the network company. The Act prescribes that it must be reasonable and it is the duty of the Energy Markets Inspectorate to monitor that this is so. The ceiling concerns the charge for transmitting electricity, excluding compensation for use of the network.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes the introduction of transitional provisions for a set period, so as not to significantly worsen the situation for existing electricity production plants. These transitional provisions will be designed so that existing plants completed before 1 January 2007 will retain their present reduced network charge until 1 January 2015. Until this date, owners of electricity production plants that can deliver an output of a maximum of 1 500 kW for electricity transmission will only need to pay the part of the charge under network tariffs that corresponds to the annual cost of metering, estimating and submitting returns on the network concession holder’s network. Under this proposal, the electricity producer will pay the full annual network charge as of 1 January 2015.</p>
<p>This proposal will enable network companies to receive considerably greater revenues from small-scale electricity production than they are receiving at present. One of the consequences will be that some new large-scale electricity production facilities will also pay a lower charge for transmitting electricity than they do under today’s conditions, but it must also be borne in mind that many will pay less than the SEK 0.03 level, even without this ceiling. Without the proposal to remove the exemption for small-scale electricity production, however, many new plants would be built with a maximum output of 1 500 kW so as to avoid the charge. The Inquiry’s proposal to replace the exemption for small-scale electricity production with a ceiling on tariffs will enable the expansion of the electricity system to be more rational. The 10-year limit is an important signal of the fact that the new electricity producers will later pay the full tariff, which will provide incentives to connect the electricity production plant to the network in as cost-effective a manner as possible. In the Swedish electricity grid, where there are major differences between production and consumption in different regions, it is important that the tariff continues to act as a financial lever directing where new electricity production is to be placed.</p>
<p>If the Riksdag were to take a decision on a change in the electricity certificate system and this should lead to increases in the price of the certificate, the electricity producers would be compensated for the increase in tariffs resulting from the abolition of the 1 500 kW ceiling. If the increase in the price of an electricity certificate is equal to the increase in price of the network charge, no further compensation will be needed in the form of the proposal presented by the Inquiry to introduce a SEK 0.03 ceiling. This is because new electricity production plants receiving electricity certificates will also benefit from the rise in the price of certificates.</p>
<p>Today regional network companies are able to choose between charging an individually estimated tariff or a tariff that is independent of geography and is equal for all those within the same category of customers. The Inquiry’s proposal means that companies must make their estimates according to the first alternative, i.e., estimate individual tariffs based on the share of the network that they use.</p>
<h2>Hourly metering, estimating and submitting returns – proposal for exemptions for small electricity producers (see section 4.6)</h2>
<p>The main reason for including an exemption from hourly metering for small production plants, according to the Inquiry, is the high cost of these procedures, which is disproportionate to the small amount of electricity produced in plants of this size. The cost of managing hourly metering is a crucial obstacle to investments in small plants, and under today’s legislation, plants that do not have hourly metering are not entitled to electricity certificates either. SERO estimates that in 2006 there were 400 TPF FPT  small-scale production plants that were not connected to the electricity certificate system because the costs of metering and submitting returns were too high. The Inquiry’s proposals will also clarify the right of producers to be responsible for metering returns to the electricity certificate system, which means that this service will be subject to competition.</p>
<p>Thus the Inquiry proposes that an exemption be included in the Electricity Act (1997:857) to the effect that production plants that are connected to low voltage with a fuse level of at most 63 amperes will not need to be metered and returns submitted over time. A customer profile method will be applied for metering and submitting returns from these plants. Electricity producers will, however, be entitled to demand hourly metering and returns, but in that case, the network company will be entitled to charge for this service. Those who are electricity users on a yearly basis, but who are also electricity producers, are only to be charged a subscription fee. Whichever of net consumption or net production reaches the highest power level will determine the subscription level that is to apply.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes the introduction into the Electricity Certificates Act (2003:113) of an exemption to the effect that a statement on the distribution of production over time will not be needed for production plants that are connected with low voltage and with a fuse level of at most 63 amperes. A customer profile method will be used for these. It is also proposed that a possibility be introduced for small production plants to be responsible themselves for metering and returns used as a basis for allocation of electricity certificates.</p>
<h2>Proposal for consideration to be given to network losses in regional networks when setting tariffs (see chapter 4.7)</h2>
<p>In the regional grids, the Inquiry proposes that the impact of an electricity production plant on network losses be estimated as their marginal impact on losses, i.e., according to the same method applied today by Svenska Kraftnät at the national grid level. The Inquiry proposes that Svenska Kraftnät be tasked by the regional grid companies to perform these estimates. The aim of this proposal is to bring about an equal and fair estimate of losses in regional grids and to enable electricity producers connected to regional and main grids to be treated in an equal manner. By determining a method for performing these estimates, transparency also increases.</p>
<h2>Power cut compensation to electricity producers and limitations to output (see chapter 4.8 and 4.9).</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has taken up and discussed issues concerning power cut compensation and limitations to output, but does not present any proposals with regard to these issues.</p>
