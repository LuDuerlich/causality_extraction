<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>In this interim report, we present our analysis of what regulation of personal data processing for research purposes is possible and may be required given that the Data Protection Regulation (EU 2016/679) is to be applied from 25 May 2018, and submit the legislative proposals required. The proposals refer to regulation in addition to the general provisions proposed by the Data Protection Inquiry (Ju 2016:04) in its report (SOU 2017:39). In addition, we have been tasked with considering, and where necessary proposing, amendments to certain related legislation.</p>
<h2>Background, legal position and terms</h2>
<p>The Data Protection Regulation entered into force on 24 May 2016, but under Article 99(2) is to apply from 25 May 2018. The Regulation is directly applicable in all Member States and will apply instead of equivalent national regulation. The Data Protection Regulation thus replaces the current Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) and its implementation in Sweden by means of the Personal Data Act (1998:204). Under Article 2, the Regulation will constitute a legal starting point for the research that uses personal data and is carried out in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the European Union, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the Union or not (Article 3). Research that does not encompass processing of personal data falls outside the scope of the Regulation as defined in Article 2.</p>
<h2>The term “research purposes”</h2>
<p>In the view of the Committee, the phrase “scientific or historical research purposes”, used repeatedly in the Regulation, covers research without the need to draw any particular distinctions in meaning between these two aspects in terms of personal data processing. The Committee judges that the terms “research” and “research purposes” can be considered equivalent.</p>
<p>Personal data processing for research purposes should additionally be able to encompass all or parts of the research process. Organising personal data in databases for research purposes should be covered by what is meant by research in a broad sense. The judgment of the Committee is thus that the individual parts of this process could be designated processing for research purposes without all the parts having to be included. This is particularly important in longitudinal studies in which subjects are studied over periods of time that sometimes span many years.</p>
<h2>A Research Data Act</h2>
<p>The Committee has defined a need to introduce a Research Data Act with the purpose of enabling personal data to be processed for the purpose of research and to protect the freedoms and rights of the individual in conjunction with such processing of personal data. The proposed Research Data Act must be applicable to all processing of personal data for research purposes irrespective of the legal basis for such processing.</p>
<p>The proposed Research Data Act is to apply in addition to that set out by the Data Protection Regulation. The general supplementary Data Protection Act proposed by the Data Protection Inquiry is to be subsidiary in relation to other acts and ordinances. For reasons of clarity, the Committee proposes that the Research Data Act state that the Data Protection Act applies unless stated otherwise in the Research Data Act. A statute on a specific data register or a provision in such a statute which is specifically applicable to processing personal data for research purposes shall take precedence over provisions to the contrary in the Research Data Act.</p>
<h2>Legal basis Establishing public interest as a legal basis</h2>
<p>Article 6 of the Data Protection Regulation sets out the conditions that must be met for the processing of personal data to be lawful. In the view of the Committee, the legal grounds that tend to be most relevant for research purposes are consent under Article 6(1)(a), necessary processing for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest under Article 6(1)(e) and (for private actors) balance of interests under Article 6(1)(f).</p>
<p>However, regarding the legal grounds under Article 6(1), the Regulation requires additional national regulation regarding Article 6(1)(e) (processing necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest). Considering that Article 6(1)(e) is central in a research context, because research in general is to be considered a task carried out in the public interest, the Committee has been charged with particularly analysing and, where necessary, supplementing the Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>These requirements are set out in Article 6(2) and Article 6(3), which enable and require national provisions to determine and specify the application of the legal grounds in Article 6(1)(e). The legal basis may as an element in such specification also contain general conditions governing the specific processing, for example. Under the Data Protection Regulation, it is thus possible to introduce specific provisions in national law that specify when and how personal data processing for research purposes is to take place.</p>
<p>The requirement under Article 6(3) that the basis for the processing under Article 6(1)(e) must be laid down by Member State law creates a tangible distinction between different categories of research actors regarding the legal conditions for processing personal data.</p>
<p>As far as private actors are concerned, the research task is rarely or never laid down as prescribed by the Regulation. However, it is generally accepted that private research may also be considered to constitute a task carried out in the public interest. In order for private actors to be able to cite Article 6(1)(e), statutory provisions need to be introduced on which application can be based.</p>
<p>Recital 45 of the Regulation states that Member States should state which actors, including private ones, are able to perform a task carried out in the public interest, which shows that it is possible for both public and private actors to perform tasks carried out in the public interest in the sense of the Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>If no national legislative measures are taken, the provisions of the Regulation mean that public research actors predominantly have to use tasks carried out in the public interest, under Article 6(1)(e) when processing personal data for research purposes. Private research actors predominantly have to use consent, under Article 6(1)(a), or weighing up interests under Article 6(1)(f) when processing personal data for the same purposes. In the view of the Committee, the fact that the Data Protection Regulation entails such significant differences in opportunities to cite the different legal grounds in Article 6(1) when processing personal data for equivalent research purposes, in practice depending on the organisational form of the actor concerned, is unintentional.</p>
<p>It is necessary to have a coherent fundamental regulatory framework for processing personal data for research purposes, not least so as to attain protection for the personal privacy of the individual under the rule of law that is also adequate in other respects. The opportunities of different research actors to collaborate and carry out research that may benefit the public at large should be placed on as equal a footing as possible. Protection of personal privacy must remain equally high irrespective of the category into which the research actor falls. This should be achieved through safeguards. The Committee therefore proposes that a provision be introduced in the Research Data Act that enables both public and private research actors to cite “task carried out in the public interest” as the legal basis for processing personal data for research purposes.</p>
<h2>Further processing</h2>
<p>The provisions of the Data Protection Regulation mean that personal data for research purposes may be processed further by the same controller without a new legal basis having to be cited, provided that the data was originally collected citing a legal basis under Article 6(1). This differs from the application of the Personal Data Act, in which all processing must be justified under Section 10. When the personal data was originally gathered with consent, however, it is not as clear-cut whether further processing may be carried out without a new legal basis for doing so.</p>
<p>When transferring personal data to another controller for processing for research purposes, the new processing is still to be seen as compatible with the original processing, provided that the new purpose is research. However, the new controller must have their own legal basis for their processing for research purposes once the personal data has been transferred to them. This means that research actors that collect personal data for research purposes that was previously collected for other purposes, for example, by another agency, must cite a legal basis under Article 6(1) for the new processing. Such a legal basis may be research carried out in the public interest under Article 6(1)(e).</p>
<h2>Consent</h2>
<p>The definition of consent in the Data Protection Regulation essentially matches the provisions of the Personal Data Act. The introduction of the Data Protection Regulation thus entails no significant changes to the meaning of consent. Consent must be freely given, specific, informed and for sensitive personal data, explicit, and must be given by means of a statement or an unambiguously confirming document. The latter wording of the type of activity approved as consent has been added to the definition compared with the Personal Data Act.</p>
<p>The Committee judges that Article 9(2)(a) of the Regulation together with the Act (2003:460) concerning the Ethical Review of Research Involving Humans (the Ethical Review Act) means that it is possible to also process sensitive personal data for research purposes with consent as the legal basis if consent exists together with ethical approval under the Ethical Review Act.</p>
<p>Recital 33 of the Data Protection Regulation involves expanding the potential scope of consent where the purpose of the research concerned cannot be described precisely at the time of data collection. At the same time, Recital 43 of the Data Protection Regulation involves restrictions, for public authorities, regarding the opportunity to use consent as the legal basis for processing personal data. Here, it is of particular importance whether the legal basis of public interest exists concurrently with consent being obtained.</p>
<p>The Data Protection Regulation offers no final solution to the hybrid circumstances already highlighted by the Article 29 Working Party and which mean that the validity of consent may be questioned.</p>
<p>Further processing of personal data for research purposes should normally be covered by obtaining new consent, irrespective of whether this is carried out by the same or a new controller. This should apply irrespective of the wording of Article 5(1)(b) second sentence if it is possible in practical terms and not inappropriate on ethical grounds.</p>
<h2>Sensitive personal data</h2>
<p>Article 9(1) of the Data Protection Regulation states that processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited. The Data Protection Regulation’s definition of this category of personal data is somewhat expanded compared with that in the Data Protection Directive. Furthermore, Article 9 of the Data Protection Regulation uses the term special categories of personal data . However, in line with the view of the Data Protection Inquiry, we are choosing to continue to term this kind of data sensitive personal data .</p>
<p>For processing of sensitive personal data to be permitted under certain conditions, support must be provided in Member State law with suitable and specific safeguards. The Committee therefore proposes a provision in the Research Data Act that allows such processing where this is necessary to attain the purpose of the research. As the main safeguard, the Committee proposes that the ethical review requirement in line with the Ethical Review Act remains.</p>
<h2>Personal data that concern criminal offences, etc.</h2>
<p>Processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences is regulated in Article 10 of the Data Protection Regulation. Under the Data Protection Regulation, supplementary regulation in Member State law is required for bodies other than an official authority to be able to process data that concern criminal offences, etc. for research purposes. The Committee therefore proposes a provision in the Research Data Act that allows such processing where this is necessary to attain the purpose of the research.</p>
<p>Such regulation must furthermore contain provisions on suitable measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and interests of the data subject. The Committee proposes that ethical review under the Ethical Review Act should continue to be the main safeguard.</p>
<h2>Personal identity numbers and coordination numbers</h2>
<p>The regulation proposed by the Data Protection Inquiry for the processing of personal identity numbers and coordination numbers contains the same directly applicable conditions as found in current legislation. These conditions are likely to be met in certain research contexts.</p>
<p>The Committee judges that the legal position regarding the use of personal identity numbers for research purposes will not be changed by the provisions proposed by the Data Protection Inquiry. Compared with today, the same conditions must be met to permit processing of personal identity numbers, and the Government and the supervisory authority have the same opportunities as before to issue special provisions in the form of statutes on specific data registers for certain types of processing. There is thus no need for additional supplementary national regulation.</p>
<h2>Restrictions on the rights of the data subject</h2>
<p>Chapter III of the Data Protection Regulation (Articles 12–23) sets out the rights of the data subject in conjunction with the processing of his or her personal data. These rights may be restricted under certain circumstances. The Data Protection Inquiry has proposed certain general restrictions to these rights.</p>
<p>According to Article 89(2) of the Data Protection Regulation, where personal data are processed for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, Union or Member State law may provide for derogations from the rights referred to in Articles 15, 16, 18 and 21 subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 89. We have therefore analysed the effect of these rights on research and propose certain restrictions in the Research Data Act.</p>
<p>The right to rectification (Article 16) shall not apply to such personal data as is processed for research purposes if this is only preserved for archiving purposes. The right to rectification shall otherwise apply without derogations.</p>
<p>The right to restriction of processing (Article 18) shall not apply where the data subject contests the accuracy of the data during the verification period required in order to verify the accuracy of the personal data if this means that the research cannot be carried out or would be crucially delayed or impeded. The same shall apply when the data subject has objected to processing, pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.</p>
<p>There is no need for further derogations from the right of access (Article 15) or the right to object (Article 21) where personal data is processed for research purposes, in addition to that proposed by the Data Protection Inquiry.</p>
<h2>Monitoring and sanctions</h2>
<p>The Committee has addressed issues of monitoring and sanctions in a general sense in relation to the processing of personal data for research purposes.</p>
<p>The Data Protection Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Data Protection Authority be appointed as a supervisory authority and have the powers under the Data Protection Regulation over the national Data Protection Act that supplements the Data Protection Regulation at a general level and the other national statutes that supplement the Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>Because the proposed Research Data Act supplements the Data Protection Regulation, it is the view of the Committee that the provision proposed by the Data Protection Inquiry thus also covers the Research Data Act regarding the powers of the supervisory authority. Therefore there is no need to introduce a separate provision on monitoring in the Research Data Act.</p>
<p>The Data Protection Inquiry proposes a provision in the Data Protection Act that provides that the right to compensation under Article 82 of the Data Protection Regulation also applies to infringement of the provisions of this act, i.e. the Data Protection Act, and other statutes supplementing the Data Protection Regulation. It is the view of the Committee that the provision proposed by the Data Protection Inquiry thereby also covers the right to compensation in the event of infringement of the Research Data Act. There is therefore no need to introduce a specific provision on compensation in the Research Data Act.</p>
<h2>Safeguards</h2>
<p>Our mandate was to analyse the safeguards that should apply to all processing of personal data for research purposes and the form these safeguards should take. Regarding sensitive personal data and personal data relating to criminal offences, etc, our mandate was to analyse the need for supplementary provisions in order to be able to process this data at all, and to determine which suitable and specific measures such a regulation should contain.</p>
<p>We have therefore analysed key concepts, such as personal data, pseudonymisation and anonymisation, so as to subsequently examine the requirements in the Data Protection Regulation regarding safeguards. Furthermore, we have analysed a selection of organisational, technical and legal measures to safeguard the fundamental rights of the data subject, particularly in the light of the security requirements of the Data Protection Regulation.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind existing opportunities to regulate safeguards when personal data is processed for research purposes, we judge that it is possible and appropriate to introduce such regulation in the form of a statute. Compared with conditions set in conjunction with ethical approval and codes of conduct, statutory regulation can provide greater clarity in application and ensure that suitable measures are also taken regarding processing that does not cover sensitive personal data or personal data that concerns criminal offences, etc.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the existing provision in the Personal Data Act, which states that data gathered for research purposes may not normally be used to take measures regarding the data subject, be transferred to the Research Data Act.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we propose that a provision be introduced in the Research Data Act stating that personal data must be pseudonymised or protected in an equivalent manner when processed for research purposes provided that the purpose can be attained by doing so.</p>
<p>Finally, we propose that the individual be given an opportunity to contest their personal data being processed for research purposes. If providing the data subject with the opportunity to contest the processing of their data proves to be impossible or involves disproportionate effort, or if the purposes of the research cannot otherwise be attained, the data may, however, be processed nevertheless.</p>
<h2>Proportionate legislation</h2>
<p>The Committee has analysed the proposed provisions of the Research Data Act on the basis of the requirements predominantly of proportionality laid down in the Data Protection Regulation, the Instrument of Government and other relevant legal instruments. The analysis has been carried out on the assumption that the proposed Act is a form of framework legislation which is unable to regulate the processing of personal data at a detailed level, and that the actual processing of personal data carried out in research projects must be examined on the basis of the same proportionality requirement. Here, the proposed safeguards constitute a basis for ensuring that the infringement that the processing of personal data in question involves is proportionate to the expected benefit of the research.</p>
<p>The proposed regulation must meet requirements of proportionality laid down in several different legal contexts. The view of the Committee, on the basis of the survey of privacy carried out, the safeguards proposed and the value of the processing of personal data enabled by the regulation, is that the Research Data Act is proportionate on the basis of all these proportionality requirements.</p>
<h2>Ethical review</h2>
<p>The Committee has analysed the modifications that need to be made to the Act (2003:460) concerning the Ethical Review of Research Involving Humans before the Data Protection Regulation starts to be applied. Initially, the Committee has addressed the issue of ethical review as a safeguard in line with the requirements of the Data Protection Regulation and reached the conclusion that ethical review constitutes such a suitable and specific safeguard as required by the Data Protection Regulation to process for research purposes sensitive personal data or personal data that concerns criminal offences, etc.</p>
<p>The Committee subsequently analysed whether the area of application of the Ethical Review Act should be expanded to apply to all processing of personal data for research purposes and reached the conclusion that this would be far too invasive a measure that is disproportionate for its purpose. The Committee therefore proposes that the requirement for ethical review, also in the future, cover the processing for research purposes of sensitive personal data or personal data that concerns criminal offences, etc. in line with the definitions set out in Articles 9(1) and 10 of the Data Protection Regulation, and that the ethical review requirement regarding the additional data currently set out in Section 21 of the Personal Data Act should continue to be covered by the area of application in the Ethical Review Act in the future.</p>
<p>The Committee has further found that there is reason to further investigate the need for changes to the ethical review procedure. A differentiated ethical review procedure appears to be more fit for purpose predominantly in certain sociological and legal research. We submit several examples of such needs in conjunction with processing personal data for research purposes being based on data that is already published and where subsequent processing merely involves a minor privacy risk. In the light of restrictions to our mandate and frameworks in general, we propose that this be investigated further in a separate form.</p>
<p>Finally, the Committee has analysed the amendments to the Ethical Review Act that otherwise need to be made as the Data Protection Regulation starts to be applied and submits the necessary statutory proposals in this regard.</p>
<h2>Modifications to certain register statutes</h2>
<p>In the next stage of the inquiry we have been charged with further preparing the proposals of the Register-based Research Inquiry (U 2013:01) in the report Unik kunskap genom registerforskning (Unique knowledge through register-based research) (SOU 2014:45). As it is not long until the Data Protection Regulation starts to be applied, 25 May 2018, no general regulation governing research databases will be in place by then. Therefore, in an initial phase, an analysis needs to be carried out regarding which adaptations in respect to the Data Protection Regulation and the general regulation proposed by the Data Protection Inquiry that need to be carried out to the Act (2013:794) on certain registers for research into the impact of genetics and environment on people’s health and the Act (1999:353) on a forensic psychiatric research register until the Data Protection Regulation starts to be applied.</p>
<p>Because the Committee has a mandate in a second phase to investigate and propose long-term regulation of research databases, this first part of the mandate has focused solely on technical legal modifications to the register statutes in relation to the provisions of the Data Protection Regulation. This means that, in present phase, the Committee has assumed that considerations already made and its views on this matter should be adopted where these are compatible with the Data Protection Regulation. The analysis is thus focused on such amendments as are necessary due to the Data Protection Regulation. The overall purpose of the mandate in this phase is to ensure that the legislation on registers can also be applied after the Data Protection Regulation starts to be applied on 25 May 2018, and that the existing conditions for processing personal data in line with legislation on registers will not in any case be watered down.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>According to Article 99 of the Data Protection Regulation, the Regulation is to be applied from 25 May 2018. The Data Protection Inquiry proposes that the Data Protection Act, which constitutes supplementary national legislation at a general level, is to enter into force the same day and that the Personal Data Act cease to apply at the same time. Because the Research Data Act constitutes supplementary national legislation to the Data Protection Act in the research sector, we also propose that it should enter into force the same day.</p>
<p>The Regulation states that references to the Data Protection Directive must be construed as references to the Data Protection Regulation as this starts to be applied and the Directive is thus repealed. Recital 171 of the Data Protection Regulation furthermore states that adaptations in Member States should be in place when the Regulation starts to be applied. It is the view of the Committee that there is thereby no scope for any transitional provisions in the Research Data Act. From 25 May 2018 all processing of personal data for research purposes must thus apply the Data Protection Regulation and, where this is supplemented, the Research Data Act and at a general level also the Data Protection Act.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>The Commission has been charged with analysing the consequences of our proposals on the basis of certain specifically stated aspects. Our proposals are simultaneously primarily caused by other changes, mainly the abolition of the Personal Data Act and the entry into force of the Data Protection Regulation, but also the proposals sub- mitted by the Data Protection Inquiry. We have therefore limited the analysis to such consequences that we have an opportunity to influence in any real sense, and operated on the basis of the aim of retaining the opportunities for research and protection of personal privacy that follow from current regulation. We will therefore not analyse the consequences of the Data Protection Regulation starting to be applied.</p>
<p>The Committee judges that the proposals will not involve any changes in costs for the actors referred to in the Swedish Committees Ordinance (1998:1474). Furthermore, it is the view of the Committee that the proposals in general will reinforce personal privacy.</p>
