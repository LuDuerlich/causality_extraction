<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>According to her terms of reference, the investigator is to take a position on three main issues, viz. 1. the position of the landowners and the holder of the usufructuary rights during prospecting, 2. the position of the landowners during mining operations, and 3. the protection of valuable environments during exploration work</p>
<p>The following report begins with a summary of the considerations and positions that have served as the basis of the recommendations. A summary of the main points of the recommendations is then presented. Finally, the legal amendments proposed are listed in point form.</p>
<h2>General considerations Mineral extraction is of public interest</h2>
<p>The geological conditions for finding extractable mineral assets in Sweden are relatively good. Sweden also has a long tradition as a mining country and is the biggest producer of iron ore, copper and silver in the EU. A high level of technical competence has been acquired in the field of mining and there are consequently several world-leading Swedish industrial companies. Mineral extraction is very important for employment and prosperity in certain regions of Sweden. There are places in the traditional ore provinces in Bergslagen, Västerbotten and Norrbotten where the district depends on the mining industry for its survival. From an international point of view, it is also beneficial if mineral extraction takes place in a country with an effective environmental legislation and with acceptable working conditions for the employees. Taken as a whole, it must be considered as an important public interest that conditions for prospecting and mining operations in Sweden are not made substantially worse.</p>
<h2>Special mining legislation is needed</h2>
<p>The Minerals Act is an exploitation law that aims at making possible extraction of certain listed ”concession minerals”. Common for these is that they seldom occur in such great concentrations as to make extraction financially profitable. Mineral prospecting is an expensive activity that initially assumes that the prospector is able to explore relatively large areas. For those considering investing substantial amounts in exploration work, it must also be clear from the start on what conditions any deposits may be made use of. For these reasons, it is not possible to completely avoid expropriation components in mineral legislation. Practically every country with mineral deposits of any size has also found it necessary to regulate this in some form.</p>
<p>The investigator has noted that minerals that exist at a property belong to the owner of the property. In Sweden, the state has not asserted ownership of all ore although the proposal has historically been raised at various times. Neither since the state’s half share in mining concerns was abolished, is there any public claim for direct financial payment for mining operations.</p>
<p>However, the fact that the mineral belongs to the property owner does not mean that he may freely dispose of the ore. There is a strong public interest in Sweden being able to retain and develop the mining industry. If landowners had the right to refuse to allow others to carry out exploration work on their land or could freely determine the conditions for prospecting and extraction, this would probably lead to the cessation of prospecting activities in Sweden. A balance must therefore be struck between opposing interests.</p>
<h2>Striking a balance between different interests in the Minerals Act</h2>
<p>In the Minerals Act, a balance has been struck between the interests of the landowner, the prospector and society. The position of the landowner must generally be described as weak in the present legislative framework. Certain elements in the legislation, for instance, that landowners and other affected parties are not informed before an exploration permit is granted for their property, that they have no influence over how exploration work is carried out and that they only have a right to compensation for damage and encroachment, have with justification been perceived as altogether too far-reaching and almost insulting. It is possible and appropriate to reinforce the position of the landowner on several points without this having any serious negative consequences for mineral interests.</p>
<p>It is proposed that landowners and others affected be given considerably greater influence in consideration of applications for exploration permits and in exploration work. Landowners shall also have the right to payment in addition to that now made for damage and encroachment when their properties are made use of for mineral prospecting and mining operations.</p>
<h2>The impact of prospecting on the environment</h2>
<p>Exploration work of varying kinds and intensity is carried out in conjunction with mineral prospecting. In the initial stage, this may entail looking for rocks, taking samples of soil and till and making measurements of the electrical characteristics of the bedrock from an aircraft or at ground level. If a mineralisation of interest is found during this exploration, exploratory drilling normally takes place for deep exploration of the bedrock. This is carried out with the aid of a drilling unit mounted on a vehicle. If exploration then shows that it is highly probable that the mineralisation is worth extracting, exploratory excavation can take place in certain cases as a final component of the exploration work.</p>
<p>The initial and most frequently occurring exploration methods only entail a very small impact on the natural and cultural environment. In the cases that mineral deposits lead to exploratory drilling, the environmental impact is somewhat greater, mainly due to it often being necessary to use vehicles off road. Exploratory extraction can entail considerable encroachment.</p>
<h2>The Environmental Code and other environmental legislation apply to prospecting</h2>
<p>The exploration permit gives the permit-holder the right to carry out exploration work in relation to the landowner and those who have a usufruct to the properties within the exploration area. The rules that exist in other legislation to protect general interests, e.g. the Environmental Code, the Act concerning Ancient Monuments and Finds, the Planning and Building Act and the Off-road Driving Act are fully applicable, however, during exploration work pursuant to the Minerals Act. Examples of provisions that the licence-holder is obliged to comply with are the provisions on protection of areas in the Environmental Code as well as the protection for ancient monuments in the Act concerning Ancient Monuments and Finds and the general prohibition against off-road driving. As a rule, exploration work may not either be carried out in areas that are covered by regional provisions or a detailed town plan and the Mining Inspector is hindered from permitting explorations that conflict with such plans. The exploration permit does not either entail any exception from the regulations on planned permission in the Planning and Building Act. Exploratory extraction that constitutes the most far-reaching form of exploration work, is classified as environmentally hazardous activity according to the Environmental Code and requires a licence from the Environmental Court.</p>
<p>Should the environmental consequences of prospective mining operations be considered at an earlier stage?</p>
<p>Proposals have been made in the public discussion that the environmental consequences of possible future mining operations should be investigated and taken into consideration already at the time an application for an exploration permit is considered. Only a very small number of the exploration permits granted result in mining operations, however. The exploration permit often relates to large areas of land and it is not possible to describe the consequences of possible mining operations in detail before it is known approximately where the ore is, what kind of ore it is and the methods to be used for extraction.</p>
<h2>Recommendations for stronger protection for valuable natural and cultural environments when prospecting for minerals</h2>
<p>In certain respects, the protection for valuable natural and cultural environments should be strengthened. Although it is neither appropriate nor even possible to demand an environmental impact description for future mining operations at the time that the application for an exploration permit is submitted, the applicant should describe the exploration methods that may be used and the natural and cultural environments that may exist within the exploration area that are particularly important to protect. It is furthermore proposed that the county administrative board be given the opportunity of making a statement on the application. In this way, it will be possible to check the information provided by the applicant. When appropriate, the county administrative board can either take measures on its own initiative or draw the attention of the Mining Inspector to the need for such measures in its statement. According to the recommendation, the Mining Inspector shall notify the conditions that are required to protect public interests in conjunction with the exploration permit and have the opportunity of requesting a detailed plan for the exploration work, when necessary.</p>
<h2>The main points of the report The position of the landowner during prospecting for minerals A clarification of the prospecting measures that may be undertaken without an exploration permit</h2>
<p>Both interested amateur geologists and professional prospectors at present carry out some searches for minerals without having applied for an exploration permit. This mainly involves looking for boulders and stones with traces of concession materials in the area and taking small samples of till, turf and sedimentary basin. It is not wholly clear what measures are permitted or prohibited in such investigations. It should therefore be clarified in a special provision in the Minerals Act that only such measurements and sample-taking that can take place without any risk for damage or inconvenience for the landowner may take place. However, these shall not be permitted in the vicinity of housing, in conflict with the provisions for nature and cultural reserves, in national parks or at cemeteries and other burial places.</p>
<h2>Information to the landowner and other interested parties on applications for exploration permits</h2>
<p>Applications for exploration permits are decided today in most cases without any other person than the applicant having an opportunity to make a statement. The landowner and others affected, for instance, leaseholders, holders of reindeer husbandry rights and tenants, are only informed after the permit has been granted. The affected interested parties should be given the opportunity of making a statement before the application is granted. It is perceived as insulting that a permit for an activity that affects the property can be granted without any other person than the applicant having an opportunity to make a statement. In future, all applications for exploration permits should therefore be sent to the landowner and other affected interested parties, so that these are informed at an early stage on the planned exploration permits.</p>
<h2>Notification to the landowner when the exploration permit ceases to apply</h2>
<p>An exploration permit applies for three years but can thereafter be renewed for four and five-year stages, and can apply at the longest for fifteen years. The original area is often successively reduced in extensions. The landowner and other affected interested parties are informed when an exploration permit is extended but not when it ceases to apply. This is a defect since it can be of at least as of great interest for those affected that the exploration permit is no longer valid. Notification shall therefore also be given when the exploration permit ceases to apply to a particular property.</p>
<h2>Conditions for protection of individual rights</h2>
<p>According to the present provisions, the Mining Inspector can only notify conditions for protection of individual rights in permits that concern oil, gas or diamonds. No reasons of weight have emerged as to why conditions should only notified for certain forms of exploration permits. According to the recommendation, the Mining Inspector shall always notify such conditions when required. The condition may be based on points of view that the landowner and others have submitted after receiving the application and may concern, for instance, the right to pass through or stay at certain places or that consultation is to take place with a usufructuary before entering an area.</p>
<h2>Negotiations and agreement prior to encroaching exploration works being allowed to take place</h2>
<p>Certain forms of exploration work can entail inconvenience for the landowner that goes far beyond what must normally be tolerated by virtue of free public access. The exploration work that can be considered as being more encroaching is use of vehicle-borne equipment off road, construction of roads, felling trees and use of explosives. It is reasonable that the landowner and others affected have a real opportunity to influence how exploration work is to be carried out. The investigator therefore recommends that, as a general rule, an agreement with the landowner and other interested parties shall be required for such exploration work. However, it is not possible to permit individual landowners to completely prevent exploration work at the property without weighty reasons. If it is not possible to reach agreement, a balance must be struck between the interest of the prospector to carry out a functional exploration and the reasons that can be advanced against the exploration taking place. If it is not possible to reach an agreement, the Mining Inspector shall consider the matter. The work may not be carried out unless the latter gives special permission.</p>
<h2>Compensation for the right to make use of the property in the event of encroaching exploratory works</h2>
<p>At present, the landowner receives compensation for damage and encroachment that the exploration work entails at the property. However, no compensation is paid for the prospector making use of the property for exploration work. However, the prospectors often pay some excess compensation to landowners and others affected already today. More encroaching exploration work can, however, cause inconvenience which is not compensated for according to present provisions. In addition, it seems reasonable that those who make their property available for a commercial activity should receive some compensation for this. In future, the landowner shall according to the recommendation also receive compensation therefore for his making the property available for prospecting when encroaching exploration work is involved.</p>
<h2>The right to make use of land to erect buildings is to be abolished</h2>
<p>The holder of an exploration permit has at present the right to make use of land to erect buildings. These measures appear as encroaching for the owner of the property. The provision has existed in the minerals legislation for a long time. It has emerged that there is scarcely any need to erect buildings in conjunction with exploration work nowadays. The right to erect buildings by virtue of an exploration permit should therefore be abolished.</p>
<h2>Limitation of the right to carry out exploratory work closer than 200 metres to residential properties, etc.</h2>
<p>According to the present provisions, exploration work may not take place without the permission of the Mining Inspector within an area closer than 100 metres from a plot with a building where someone lives for the greater part of the year. Thus, only permanent residences and not, for instance, holiday cottages are protected. Residents in holiday cottages can experience exploration work as an equally great inconvenience as others affected. According to the recommendation, the restriction on the right to carry out exploration work shall apply to all residential buildings. Since the extent of a plot can be unclear, the provision should instead apply within an area of 200 metres from the inhabited building in question.</p>
<p>The rules of the Minerals Act on limitations in the right to carry out examination work are also unclear in other respects. According to the recommendation, they are to be made exact so as to make evident the area that is referred to.</p>
<h2>Secrecy is to be abolished for the examination result</h2>
<p>According to section 58 of the annex to the Secrecy Ordinance (1980:657), the examination result presented pursuant to Chapter 14, section 3, of the Minerals Act is declared secret for at most four years. As reasons for this has been given that the person who has carried out the explorations has an interest in having a sole right to dispose of the results for a period and that a balance is to be struck between this interest and the public interest for the results to be generally available.</p>
<p>The geological knowledge that has emerged through the exploration work is important for future exploration work in the area. If the results show that future explorations are not meaningful, this should be published as soon as possible. This recommendation means therefore that secrecy is abolished for the results.</p>
<h2>The position of the property owner during mining operations The landowner’s right to compensation when the property is made use of for mining operations.</h2>
<p>According to present provisions, the person who has an exploitation concession is obliged to compensate the owner of the property for damage and encroachment. No compensation is paid for the minerals that are extracted.</p>
<p>In Swedish law, the general rule is that a landowner owns everything on a property without any limitation in respect of depth. Unlike the situation in many other countries, ore in Sweden has not either been declared as state property. Neither does the state make any claim to civil law right of ownership of the ore. It does not either appear reasonable according to Swedish law that ore should be property without an owner. It is noted in the report therefore that the landowner must be considered as also being the owner of the concession mineral that exists at the property. However, this cannot be used to justify that the landowner should have sole right to extract ore on his property or prevent others from doing so. Through the Minerals Act, the public has a right to determine who shall have a permit for exploitation. This circumstance can be motivated by the important public interest in a functioning mining industry. If a landowner could freely determine the conditions for mining operations on his properties or veto such activity, this would in all probability lead to mining operations no longer being possible in Sweden.</p>
<p>Another issue is the right to compensation that the landowners are to have during mining operations. As an argument for the landowner not receiving any compensation for ore extracted at his property, it has been argued that the mineral is of no value to the landowner. However, the fact that the landowner cannot demand compensation for the ore is only a consequence of the provisions of the Minerals Act and the argument is thus tautological. In general, compensation is payable when a person is obliged to surrender property to another, particularly if commercial activity is involved and it is not usually a requirement that the landowner should have been personally active with regard to localising or extracting other natural assets, for instance, an attractive type of granite, for the landowner to receive compensation. If the landowner receives some compensation for the value of the mineral, this can also counteract negative consequences on property prices within the areas affected by the exploration permit.</p>
<p>Through the proposed amendment to the law, the landowner shall receive compensation from the licence holder for the mineral claimed on his property. This payment is to take the form of a mine fee which is linked to the value of the mineral extracted and constitutes two per thousand of the value of the ore. The fee is to be shared between the owners of the properties that are within the concession area or on which land has been designated for extraction.</p>
<h2>Right to compensation and redemption of property in the case of unused extraction concessions</h2>
<p>An extraction concession need not immediately lead to mining operations starting. The concession is valid for 25 years. The concession holder can wait for a longer or shorter period before he requests that land be designated for extraction and starts operations. It may also be the case that exploitation never starts, e.g. for financial reasons. In such cases, the landowner can live in uncertainty with regard to what is going to happen to the property for a long time. This can entail problems for the long-term planning of property maintenance that can have a negative effect on the value of the property. It can also be called in to question whether the present arrangement where a permit to dispose of another’s property in future is valid for such a long period as 25 years without any possibility of review and without any payment being made, is wholly compatible with the protection of property in article 1 of the supplementary protocol (20 March 1952) of the European Convention on Protection of Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p>
<p>According to the investigator’s recommendations, compensation shall be paid to the landowner for the inconvenience it entails for the property to be subject to an unused exploitation concession. Furthermore, the landowner shall have the right to request that the property or the part of the property is purchased if a land appropriation is not requested within ten years from the notification of the exploitation concession.</p>
<h2>The protection for valuable natural and cultural environments during prospecting The county administrative board is to be given the opportunity to make a statement on all applications for exploration permits and affected municipalities are informed of the application.</h2>
<p>The consideration of applications for exploration permits now takes place normally without the affected county administrative boards and municipalities being notified. The decision is first sent to these authorities when the permit has been granted. In the case of applications relating to oil, gas and diamonds, however, a statement shall be obtained from the county administrative board.</p>
<p>If the county administrative board receives notification of the planned mineral search at an earlier stage and is given the opportunity of inspecting the effects that this can have on the natural and cultural environment and how the prospector intends to prevent damage to these, the risk for damage will be further reduced. In its statement, the county administrative board can furthermore also provide information on natural and cultural environments that are important to protect and other conflicting interests to the extent that the applicant has not referred to these. According to the recommendation, all applications for exploration permits are to be sent to the county administrative board to enable it to make a statement.</p>
<p>Affected municipalities are also to be informed about the application and can then submit points of view to the Mining Inspector. Through the</p>
<p>Planning and Building Act, the municipality has a dominating influence over the use of land and water areas and is able to control and affect whether and how any mining operations are to take place. However, it is also important that municipalities are also informed at an early stage on the planned exploration works.</p>
<h2>The application for an exploration permit shall contain a description of the exploration works and their impact on the environment</h2>
<p>The inclusion in the application of a description of the exploration works and their impact on the environment ensures that the permit-holder will take into consideration in advance the risks for damage to natural and cultural environment and comply with his obligation, according to Chapter 2, section 2 of the Environmental Code, to obtain the requisite knowledge. This description also serves as a basis for the inspection by the mining authorities and county administrative board. If there are special reasons, for instance due to particularly valuable natural and cultural environments within the exploration area, the Mining Inspector is given the opportunity of requiring a more detailed plan of these.</p>
<h2>The suitability of the applicant is to be considered when considering examination permits</h2>
<p>When considering applications for exploration permits for oil, gas and diamonds, the Mining Inspector shall according to existing provisions consider whether the applicant is suitable to carry out the examination work. If a permit holder shows insufficient willingness or ability to comply with the laws and provisions that apply to protect the environment, this should be taken into consideration if he applies for a new exploration permit. A consideration of suitability with regard to the applicant’s ability to carry out the work without damage being caused to the natural and cultural environment shall according to the recommendation therefore be included in all forms of exploration permit. A prospector who has previously displayed lack of consideration accordingly risks being refused an exploration permit.</p>
<h2>A general provision on consideration to protect public interests is to be introduced in the Minerals Act.</h2>
<p>According to Chapter 3, section 3, of the Minerals Act, exploration works shall be carried out so that the least damage and encroachment is caused. This provision aims particularly at damage and encroachment that can affect the landholder. There is no general provision on consideration to protect the environment, however.</p>
<p>According to the recommendation, the provision shall be amended so that it is clarified that exploration work is to be carried out so that the least damage and encroachment is caused to the natural and cultural environment.</p>
<h2>Conditions in support of public interests</h2>
<p>According to the existing provisions, the Mining Inspector cannot attach conditions to an exploration permit, unless they refer to oil, gas or diamonds. According to the recommendation, the Mining Inspector shall in the exploration permit prescribe the conditions that are needed to support public interests. Such conditions can be particularly relevant if the application includes natural and cultural environments that are particularly important to protect. The conditions may refer to limitations to the right to carry out exploration work, e.g. with regard the time and place these takes place, or restrictions in the right to travel or stay at certain places. The county administrative board’s statement on the application may give special reason for the Mining Inspector to notify conditions.</p>
<h2>Review of the rules of the Environmental Code on the application for consultation in measures that can damage the cultural environment</h2>
<p>According to Chapter 12, section 6, of the Environmental Code, the person who intends to undertake measures or engage in activity that can significantly affect the natural environment, is obliged to make a notification for consultation. There is no corresponding obligation according to the wording of the provision for measures that can affect the cultural environment which appears to be a deficiency. The attention of the Environmental Code Committee has therefore been drawn to this issue.</p>
<h2>Recommendations for amendments to the law in point form The position of the landowners and usufructuaries during prospecting</h2>
<p>• It shall be clarified in the Minerals Act what prospecting measures may be undertaken on another person’s property without an exploration permit.</p>
<p>• Landowners and other interested parties shall be notified about all applications for exploration permits so that they can submit points of view.</p>
<p>• Encroaching exploration works shall be preceded by negotiations with the landowner and other affected interested parties. An agreement is normally required to carry out work that involves use of  vehicle-borne equipment off road, road construction, tree felling or the use of explosives.</p>
<p>• In the event of encroaching exploration work, the  permit-holder shall – in addition to compensation for damage and encroachment – also pay compensation for making use of the property for exploration work.</p>
<p>• The Mining Inspector shall notify the conditions that are needed to protect the rights of the individual in all forms of exploration work.</p>
<p>• The landowners shall be notified when the exploration permit ceases to be valid for their property.</p>
<p>• The right to carry out exploration work is to be restricted closer than 200 metres to all forms of residential buildings. Restrictions in the right to carry out exploration work shall also be made specific otherwise.</p>
<p>• The right for the  permit-holder to make use of land to erect buildings is to be abolished.</p>
<h2>The position of the landowner during mining operations</h2>
<p>• During mining operations, the landowner shall receive compensation for the mineral that is made use of from their property.</p>
<p>• Payment shall be made in the form of a mine fee, which is to amount to two per thousand of the value of the minerals that the concession holder receives.</p>
<p>• The fee shall be shared between the owners of the properties on which the mineral is extracted and the owners of the properties that are directly affected by the activity in relation to the size of the properties.</p>
<p>• Owners of properties that are affected by unutilised exploration concessions shall have the right to compensation for the inconvenience this entails.</p>
<p>• If the concession holder has not requested a designation of land within ten years, the landowners shall have the right to request that the affected properties be purchased.</p>
<h2>Protection for valuable environments during prospecting</h2>
<p>• The county administrative board shall be given the opportunity to make a statement on all applications for exploration permits and the affected municipalities shall be informed about the application.</p>
<p>• A description of exploration works and their environmental impact shall be enclosed with applications for exploration permits. The Mining Inspector shall be able to demand that the  licence-holder make a detailed plan.</p>
<p>• The suitability of the applicant shall be taken into consideration when considering exploration permits</p>
<p>• The conditions that are needed to protect public interests shall be notified in all forms of exploration permits.</p>
<p>• The provisions of the Environmental Code on the obligation to consultation in measures that can damage the cultural environment should be reviewed.</p>
