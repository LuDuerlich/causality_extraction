<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>A secure, coordinated and long-term supply of drinking water may seem self-evident, but in general this reflects the fundamental problem highlighted by the Inquiry. We have become accustomed to water and wastewater services being arranged by public authorities in cities, urban areas, and many small communities and settlements. This has been the case for a long time and how we expect it to work that way in the future as well. Drinking water is by far the country’s most critical supply system – a prerequisite for society, companies and other activities to function. Threats and risks that the drinking water supply is exposed to in the form of changes to the climate and society have received increased attention. It is now high time to tackle the overall challenges we are facing regarding drinking water. Public drinking water is used by 85 per cent of the population, and until now, the price has been only a few öre per litre. It is a foodstuff that everyone must have every day throughout their lives. The public commitment regarding drinking water must consequently maintain a high level of quality and security in a very long-term perspective. For consumers, this may involve slight price increases, but at the same time it will provide opportunities for continued security of supply.</p>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The overarching task of the Drinking Water Inquiry has been to review the entire gamut of public drinking water, from raw water to the drinking water tap. The objective has been to identify current and potential challenges to a secure drinking water supply in the short and long term. The remit particularly emphasises the importance of climate change, adjustments and changes of approaches that may be needed regarding drinking water issues.</p>
<p>Two interim reports have been submitted – Materials in contact with drinking water: government agency roles and responsibility issues  (SOU 2014:53) and Climate change and drinking water supply (SOU 2015:51). The latter report concerned a knowledge base with an updated analysis of climate change in Sweden for the remainder of this century, and a report on foreseeable risks to the drinking water supply.</p>
<p>The point of departure for the Inquiry’s terms of reference has been that proposed measures are to build on current divisions and principles of responsibility regarding drinking water supply. The Inquiry sees a value in thus mainly building on structures that, on the whole, work well today. Several of the Inquiry’s proposals are of a systemic nature, with a focus on improving functionality of systems that should continue to be maintained at different administrative levels and by the actors currently responsible for them. Balance has been sought between what is possible today and what is necessary for tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s work has been conducted with transparency with regard to relevant government agencies, organisations and other actors that work in various ways with public drinking water supply. This has enabled an ongoing dialogue on considerations and proposals that have emerged in the course of the work, but has also been a driving factor in the continuous change process that is under way. This has resulted in regulatory changes and development on many of the issues that the Inquiry perceives to be central.</p>
<h2>Changes in society challenge drinking water</h2>
<p>Today, changes in society and demographics, together with natural conditions and climate change, constitute substantial challenges for the drinking water supply and also set the parameters for the future. Society is changing more rapidly than the climate and the changes are also closely linked to drinking water issues: because the existence of clean and safe drinking water sets the parameters for development of activities, housing construction, regional development, public health and well-being, and because this development in itself creates new conditions for how bodies of water and drinking water supply can be secured in the long term.</p>
<p>Cities – in particular major cities – are shaped by ongoing urbanisation, with increased pressure on technical infrastructure and other needs. Significant parts of rural areas are becoming more sparsely populated, which can weaken conditions for good quality public drinking water services there. Growing urban area regions result in greater strains on land and water use, with increased vulnerability of the bodies of water that form the basis of drinking water there. At the same time, expectations and difficulties grow with respect to protective measures and crisis preparedness.</p>
<h2>Climate change is already here</h2>
<p>Climate change as a result of global warming will continue to have an impact in Sweden as well, through higher average temperatures, increased precipitation levels, changed patterns for outflow and evaporation, and rising sea levels. These developments were highlighted in the Inquiry’s interim report. Land and water use will be indirectly affected in various ways, for instance as a result of extended growing seasons, in some places in combination with dwindling water resources and competition for water. The developments can lead to quantitative and qualitative changes to the water in the raw water resources on which supply relies: besides a direct physical strain on drinking water infrastructure, there may be an increase in chemically and microbiologically conditioned health risks. Pollutants and natural organic material already flow into connected water supplies via outflows. Climate change with more precipitation, milder winters and more precipitation in the winter season, such as rain or frequent snow melts, increases this outward transport. This may result in changed quality of raw water, as well as risk of disruptions to water works’ preparation. Ground water access and quality may also be affected. Overall, demands are increasing when it comes to building a future secure and robust structure for water and wastewater services.</p>
<h2>Increasing risks place new demands</h2>
<p>Growing risks of water-borne pollutants increase the need for preventive efforts regarding bodies of water for human consumption, water supplies and processes. Municipal comprehensive planning can clarify choices and consequences. A  long-term  approach is needed concerning monitoring, planning, protection of water supplies, crisis preparedness and other measures. Ageing infrastructure and neglected maintenance can make the situation even more vulnerable. Preparation of drinking water must be given more attention, with the development of new technical solutions to manage some of the pollution problems that arise and that raw water protection cannot fully provide for. Demands are increasing significantly for skills and knowledge of drinking water supply and many other technical supply systems. This also means an increased demand for systematic skills supply, which presupposes basic knowledge development, and research and development initiatives. Traditions and habitual working methods can no longer be taken for granted. There is a significant need to work in new ways, making use of economies of scale, finding  cost-effective  solutions and cooperating in a way that benefits supply.</p>
<h2>Regional perspective on drinking water</h2>
<p>Production and provision of public drinking water is a fundamental welfare task subject to strict health and security requirements. Future perspectives, with increasing risks associated with drinking water, make it necessary for municipalities to secure and administer strategic bodies of water in the long term. Waters do not recognise any administrative boundaries, and it is therefore increasingly necessary to take a more overarching and regional perspective. A regional perspective, a greater focus on inter-municipal collaboration and a long-term approach are needed to secure conditions and operations in a generational perspective. The work of county administrative boards on regional planning underpins municipal land and water use. The need for a regional approach applies to the entire chain, from protection of drinking water supplies to preparation and distribution of processed drinking water. Cooperation can, for instance, cover protection matters and technical infrastructure, as well as organisational and skills-related structures.</p>
<h2>Cooperation – a key to the future</h2>
<p>At present, responsibility for drinking water supply lies with the country’s 290 municipalities, despite their very different prospects for coping with the task: there are large differences in terms of natural conditions, population and development potential.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s contacts with local actors working with drinking water supply, lack of time, skills and financial resources were often highlighted. However, these are essentially conditions that responsible municipalities themselves control, through better planning, politically well-balanced decisions, adequate pricing levels and appropriate financial management. An inability to cooperate across municipal borders regarding resources and skills, for instance via municipal associations or jointly owned water and sanitation companies, should therefore not primarily be tackled with national manuals to prop up failing operators. These problems and the future must be addressed at another level. Research also shows that conditions exist for collaboration and there is a widespread willingness among the relevant administrative organisations in many of the country’s municipalities. There are a number of good examples of existing and planned cooperation, from more large-scale initiatives to small inter-municipal projects.</p>
<p>Overall, increased regionalisation and inter-municipal collaboration must be seen as important starting points for future work on drinking water. The Inquiry also considers continued strategic work on the special conditions in the country’s major cities and larger population centres to be crucial. This refers to long-term solutions around the Mälaren and Göta Älv river regions, as in Skåne and other areas where more large-scale supply solutions already exist or are being discussed in the long term. Developments in society depend entirely on access to clean drinking water. Cooperation concerning reserve systems, emergency water and crisis preparedness may also be required to ensure deliveries and manage unforeseen events that may still occur.</p>
<h2>The role of central government is important</h2>
<p>The role of central government is to continue to focus considerable efforts on adapting and coordinating regulatory frameworks and other forms of more overarching support to drinking water operations, enabling it to develop in a positive direction. This can also take the form of guidance, supervision and monitoring issues. Government also bears responsibility for developing and supplying comprehensive exercises and training in the area of contingency planning. Deeper and sustainable research and development investments are also needed, which to a large extent can be arranged in collaboration with actors within the drinking water trade.</p>
<p>Below are a number of proposals presented by the Inquiry intended to meet the need for a strategic working method, greater collaboration and necessary requirements regarding the drinking water supply. These proposals aim to clarify requirements and support to municipalities, producers and other actors in their work. Improved coordination, information and knowledge dissemination is to be sought at different management levels and for relevant national activities. The proposals can be collected under a number of headings, but are still to be seen as a coherent package for future secure drinking water supply.</p>
<h2>Protect bodies of water and water supplies</h2>
<p>Water protection areas with safety regulations have been established for a significant proportion of sources of water supplies, but protection has not always been updated and many supplies still lack protection. Continued measures are also needed to address changes in climate and society, commitments under EU law and Swedish environmental quality objectives. The Inquiry proposes an amendment to the Environmental Code. Municipalities should be obliged to apply to set up and review water protection areas for major public water supplies. This should include all supplies providing more than 10 m a day as an average or serving more than 50 persons.</p>
<p>Municipalities are to ensure that applications are made to set up water protection areas, and county administrative boards are to prepare and take decisions with the guidance of the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management. Municipalities are also to ensure that older areas and regulations are reviewed as needed. A special timetable for entry into force will be established. Further, it is important to secure and administer water protection areas in a long term perspective.</p>
<p>Improved protection presupposes development of supervision, appropriate planning information at local and regional level and work to reduce the use of toxins in connected bodies of water. Regional drinking water supply plans are to be drafted by all county administrative boards. This kind of foundation provides the conditions for a strategic approach to water in municipalities’ overall planning. The Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management is to provide guidance here as well, supported by, among others, the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning. The Swedish Board of Agriculture will be tasked with highlighting the agricultural sector’s future need of water as a basis for planning.</p>
<p>In the future, protection of public surface water supplies will be done by setting up water protection areas with associated regulations. This means that a municipality’s possibilities to issue regulations based on the Ordinance on Environmentally Hazardous Activities and Public Health Protection may be limited.</p>
<h2>Adapt drinking water controls</h2>
<p>Official controls of drinking water plants will be strengthened by tasking the National Food Agency with designing specific objectives for drinking water in the national control plan. Control areas and risk classification systems for drinking water plants will be reviewed. Specific guidance material will also be drafted for municipal control agencies. To facilitate reporting to the EU on drinking water, the Inquiry proposes that the National Food Agency be given the possibility to obtain information on drinking water quality from major public producers and distributors.</p>
<h2>Develop examination of raw water</h2>
<p>Drinking water producers need to examine their raw water regularly to detect risks and optimise preparation of drinking water. However, sampling and analysis need to be developed, through clarification by the National Food Agency of the functional requirements in the drinking water regulations.</p>
<p>Information exchange on chemical and other environmental and health risks in surface and ground water also needs to increase. The Inquiry therefore proposes that water authorities be able to request raw water data more extensively from municipalities and producers of public drinking water. Water authorities, for their part, should report back results from available environmental monitoring to drinking water producers.</p>
<h2>Increase focus on crisis preparedness issues</h2>
<p>Official responsibility for crisis preparedness needs to be strengthened further to ensure a secure drinking water supply. This includes increased responsibility on the part of the National Food Agency for long-term financing of overall training, exercises and expert support. The county administrative board’s geographic area responsibility also needs to be developed, as well as the fundamental crisis preparedness of municipalities and drinking water actors.</p>
<p>Access to high-quality public drinking water is an essential basis for development and public health, and must therefore be secured by municipalities. A clarification to this effect will be made in the Public Water Services Act.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the National Food Agency investigate the conditions for a national system for incident reporting regarding drinking water. County administrative boards are to conduct an in-depth follow-up of municipalities’ analyses and planning concerning drinking water and crisis preparedness.</p>
<p>The National Food Agency’s water emergency group (VAKA) and reinforcement resources in the form of emergency water tanks can provide support to drinking water producers and municipalities in crises and crisis-like conditions. The work has proven valuable and should therefore be kept up for an extended period by the National Food Agency. In the long term, consideration should be given to whether activities can be more closely linked to municipalities and the drinking water sector as part of their own responsibility for crisis preparedness.</p>
<h2>Renewal and maintenance</h2>
<p>Waterworks, pipes and other infrastructure in the drinking water area do not present any general or acute problems. However, there is great variation between different municipalities and in some places there is a considerable need to step up efforts.</p>
<p>Measures are needed to remove a number of obstacles. Development of water and sanitation organisation, skills supply, local financial management and auditing is needed. There is also a need for basic planning measures and adapted production and distribution technology. Many actors currently find themselves in a situation in which remedial action is needed.</p>
<p>The Inquiry notes that the current regulatory framework does not constitute a significant obstacle for renewal and maintenance. However, renewal and maintenance plans as support for adaptation, financial management and pricing must be mandatory.</p>
<p>Waterworks also need to renew and develop their technical and other processing systems, in order to handle increased chemically and microbiologically conditioned health risks in the raw water. The National Food Agency needs to develop clearer requirements on drinking water preparation.</p>
<h2>Materials in contact with drinking water</h2>
<p>In its interim report on materials in contact with drinking water, roles and responsibilities of government agencies were discussed, as well as proposals for increased information and clarity on the part of central government. The report recommended increased coordination between agencies, a closer link to ongoing European cooperation, and the establishment of an information and knowledge platform at the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning. The report resulted in the Government specifically tasking the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning to establish a strategy for coordination, improvement and development of issues concerning materials in contact with drinking water.</p>
<h2>Improved coordination and governance</h2>
<p>Local conditions, opportunities and skills with regard to drinking water supply vary significantly between different municipalities and providers. As mentioned earlier, inter-municipal collaboration needs to increase and develop to provide financial, technical and skillsrelated conditions, stability and sustainability. This could facilitate the necessary change towards a more regional approach to protection and use of water resources. A strategic approach based on regional and local planning information creates conditions for operative work and secure supply. The Inquiry proposes that it should be clear in the Swedish Water Services Act that municipalities should make use of possibilities to cooperate.</p>
<p>The Inquiry notes that current national coordination in the drinking water area has not had the intended effect. A clearer and broader task of coordinating drinking water issues should therefore be given to the National Food Agency and closely involved central administrative agencies and county administrative boards. A national drinking water council should be established at the National Food Agency to support a coherent drinking water strategy with a timetabled action plan. The National Food Agency should also be tasked with establishing a knowledge centre for drinking water matters to further increase support to municipalities and other actors in the area. Developed national governance and coordination would also give county administrative boards a clearer role in regional drinking water issues.</p>
<h2>Costs and funding</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s overall proposals will generate certain increased costs for central and local government and water and sanitation collectives. Overall, the proposals will generate relatively limited costs, compared with the significant resources already represented by the drinking water supply. Water and sanitation fees alone total approximately SEK 21 billion annually, of which drinking water is estimated to represent approximately 40 per cent. The Inquiry estimates that, in addition, the State allocates around SEK 75–130 million for various knowledge development, information, support and regulating measures in the drinking water supply area.</p>
<p>These proposals, with the limited cost reinforcements given by the Inquiry, are estimated to be of decisive importance for efforts on a future secure drinking water supply. The Inquiry proposes additional costs to central government totalling around SEK 10–32 million per year, and around SEK 40–76 million per year for municipalities and water and sanitation collectives over a defined and limited period. To this can be added more long-term investments and adaptations to climate change that are needed to face the future. Further costs may arise in connection with possible compensation for restrictions in land use when protection areas are developed to a greater extent. The Inquiry considers these measures to be necessary and well founded, based on the significant values that are at stake and need to be secured for individuals, companies and society.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also discusses financing models that need to be applied to cover additional costs. The increased tax revenues that can be generated through an earlier proposal for a new excise duty in the chemicals area may be an appropriate source of financing for the expanded tasks of central government. At municipal level, it should be possible to cover a large part of the additional costs through water and sanitation collectives’ fee-based financing.</p>
<h2>Investigate wastewater issues</h2>
<p>Wastewater issues affect drinking water supply and the water ecocycle. A number of related issues need further investigation, such as measures linked to untreated emissions during overload as a result of large flows of wastewater and runoff (overflow), renewal needs at treatment plants and collection systems, and possibilities and costs associated with purification of chemical substances and products that affect the environment and health.</p>
<p>There are currently around 2 000 municipal wastewater management plants in the country. These are crucial and critical supply systems in society, that also set long-term conditions for parts of the drinking water supply system. Insufficient purification also applies to emissions from a large number of smaller independent sewerages, which leads to risk of contagion and contributes to eutrophication of watercourses, lakes and coastal waters.</p>
<h2>Control station 2020</h2>
<p>The Inquiry on drinking water proposes that a control station for drinking water be set up within a five-year period. The Inquiry’s proposals and future conditions for our drinking water supply need to be followed up to adjust development as needed. It is primarily a matter of gauging whether necessary coordination efforts are progressing at an adequate rate, to what extent regional planning information is being drafted and water protection areas are being established and reviewed.</p>
<p>Further follow-up issues concern climate adaptation and crisis preparedness capacity, and municipalities’ possibilities to secure supply in earnest. Funding issues should also be analysed to highlight possible weaknesses in the system.</p>
<p>Prompt follow-up action is essential. The impact of the Inquiry’s measures as a whole needs to be assessed. Regulatory frameworks, responsibility issues and organisational prospects may need to be adjusted in the future if the rate of development is considered too slow. Future tasks of municipalities, as the authorities responsible for drinking water supply, will have to be assessed based on the quality and capacity of the activities. In this respect, collaboration and a more large-scale approach may turn out to be decisive, as has been the case in several other countries.</p>
