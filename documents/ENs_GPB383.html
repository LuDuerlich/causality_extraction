<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Registered mortgage in foreign currency Background</h2>
<p>In Sweden, it is at present not possible to grant a registered land mortgage or business mortgage (floating charge) in foreign currency. Our Commission has been given the assignment of proposing rules to make this possible. The matter thus involves both registered mortgages relating to real property (land units) and business mortgages.</p>
<p>The background to our assignment in this respect is a ruling by the European Court of Justice. The ruling gives cause, according to the Government Directive for our Commission, for a change of the rules to make it possible to grant registered mortgages in foreign currency.</p>
<p>The Swedish registered mortgage system for real property operates in a manner that differs from means employed within the systems of most other countries. The loan document is not submitted for registration. Instead, the landowner requests from the Land Registration Authority a mortgage registration (inteckning) for a particular amount in his real property. The Land Registration Authority registers the mortgage. The property owner receives a certificate of the mortgage registration. This is referred to as a mortgage certificate (pantbrev). The property owner can then hand over the mortgage certificate as a security for a debt.</p>
<p>When a business operator wishes to use his operation as security, he can request registration against the business operation of a particular monetary amount, business mortgage. A certificate for the mortgage registration – corresponding to a pantbrev – is referred to as a business mortgage certificate.</p>
<h2>Our proposals</h2>
<p>As has been mentioned before it shall be possible to grant a land or business mortgage registration in foreign currency. Upon registration of the mortgage, the Land Registration Authority, in accordance with our proposal, shall specify the amount of the mortgage registration and the currency. The landowner or – as regards business mortgages – the business operator shall be at liberty to decide whether to register in foreign currency. No limitations to any particular currencies shall exist.</p>
<p>A conversion to Swedish currency must be made in connection with the grant of the mortgage registration. A duty computed on the amount of the mortgage registration is normally charged when the mortgage registration is granted. There are already in existence conversion provisions that apply, for example, when a duty is to be charged for a purchase of real property in foreign currency. We propose that these provisions shall also apply to the grant of land and business mortgage registrations in foreign currency.</p>
<p>In preparation for an executory sale of real property, the Enforcement Service must prepare a list of interested parties. With the guidance of this, the lowest amount at which the property may be sold is determined. We propose that the Enforcement Service, when preparing the list of interested parties, shall convert mortgage certificates in foreign currency into Swedish kronor. The Authority shall also add a supplement of five per cent as a buffer against changes in rates of exchange.</p>
<p>Funds received from the executory sale are subsequently distributed to the creditors. The time taken before implementing a distribution varies, inter alia, depending upon which form of sale has been used. This can often take 4–10 weeks. In connection with the distribution, according to our proposal, a final conversion shall be made. When making this conversion, it shall not be possible to include the mortgage certificate at a higher amount in Swedish kronor than that stipulated in the list of interested parties.</p>
<p>A list of interested parties is not prepared in connection with a sale pursuant to a business mortgage. We therefore propose that a business mortgage certificate in foreign currency, upon execution, shall be converted only in connection with the distribution.</p>
<h2>Excess security</h2>
<p>Our second main task, which is related only to land, has been to deliberate upon whether ‘excess security’ within Swedish land law should continue to exist or not.</p>
<h2>The current system and alternatives to this</h2>
<p>In conjunction with a Land Registration Authority granting a land mortgage registration, as mentioned earlier, a mortgage certificate is issued as evidence of the mortgage registration. The nominal amount of the mortgage certificate is the same amount as the mortgage registration.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the debt is less than the amount of the mortgage certificate. An unused interval has arisen. This is referred to as excess security. The reason for this being known as excess security results from the fact that the landowner upon enforcement is primarily entitled to the amount represented by the unutilised interval. The underlying mortgagees, i.e. second, third mortgagees, etc., consequently do not shift upwards to absorb the interval. The unused capacity may normally be used by the landowner to arrange a new loan using this capacity as security. If the mortgage certificate is only partially used, the landowner can arrange a so-called sub-mortgage. If a mortgage certificate is instead completely unused (usually due to complete redemption), a completely new loan on the mortgage could be arranged using this certificate as security.</p>
<p>If one abolishes excess security, the consequence will be that the underlying mortgagees will move up in pace with the mortgage certificate in front of it becoming vacant. Thereby, funds upon enforcement will never primarily pass to the landowner before the mortgagees. Another consequence of excess security being abolished is that the possibility to distrain a mortgage certificate should be removed. Briefly, this can be explained by the fact that this distraint basically is a distraint of the excess security. The first alternative that we have deliberated upon is therefore the abolition of excess security and distraint of mortgage certificates. This alternative does not involve any limitation of the opportunity to use completely or partially vacant mortgage certificates as security.</p>
<p>Sub-mortgaging is used rather widely, not least in a way whereby a person who has the mortgaged rights in a mortgage certificate other than the certificate with the best priority rights takes a sub-mortgage in the more preferential mortgage certificate. Practitioners have asserted that sub-mortgaging is expensive and complex. We have therefore also deliberated upon whether a prospective abolition of excess security and distraint of mortgage certificates should be combined with the removal of the right to effect a sub-mortgage. However, we consider that the right to arrange loans secured on completely vacant mortgage certificates in all circumstances should be retained.</p>
<h2>Excess security and distraint of mortgage certificates</h2>
<p>We propose that excess security and distraint of mortgage certificates should be abolished.</p>
<p>Upon the introduction of the system, almost 100 years ago, three reasons were referred to in support of excess security. It was considered to be systematically correct and fair as well as facilitating the enforcement procedure. None of these reasons are sustainable today.</p>
<p>The effect that excess security has in practice is primarily that it results in the use of sub-mortgaging and distraint of mortgage certificates.</p>
<p>A system without excess security is more logical. There are no strong reasons for giving a landowner or ordinary creditors an opportunity, upon an executory sale of the real property, to receive a distribution before creditors with mortgage rights in the land unit.</p>
<p>The system without excess security would correspond most closely with that applicable in the majority of other, neighbouring countries. A reform also means some simplification of the enforcement system.</p>
<h2>Sub-mortgaging</h2>
<p>However, we consider that the possibility for sub-mortgaging should remain.</p>
<p>An abolition would mean first a reduction of the scope for action by the landowner, second a rather complex transitional problem. Nor is there among interested parties any uniform opinion concerning the abolition of the possibility to sub-mortgage.</p>
<p>As the system with sub-mortgaging is considered to be complex, there is reason to try to simplify the routines. However, no statutory amendments are required for this. A simplification is consequently something which may be achieved by agreements between the credit institutes.</p>
