<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Committee’s terms of reference</h2>
<p>The terms of reference for this Committee – the Digital Radio Committee – have been to make an overall analysis of the future conditions for digital radio and to come to a decision about the future of digital radio. The assignment constitutes a continuation of the work of a special inquiry, which was described in the interim report Digital Radio. Kartläggning och analys (Digital Radio. Survey and analysis –  SOU 2002:38). The interim report prompted a number of questions and the government has instructed the Committee, on the basis of these questions, to make an overall analysis of the future prospects of digital radio by assessing the financial viability, developments in various broadcasting techniques and the interest among various players. The Committee has also been instructed to come to a decision about the future of digital radio in Sweden by advocating one of the following; that digital terrestrial radio be introduced on a larger scale, that the trials with digital radio be continued for a further period or that the digital broadcasts cease.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In chapter 1  The Interim report and referral bodies a summary is given of the information in the interim report concerning a number of areas and the views of the referral bodies on this information.</p>
<p>In chapter 2  Regulatory code relating to radio an account is given of legislation and other regulations concerning radio broadcasting, including licensing for both analogue and digital broadcasting technologies. The views of the referral bodies on the interim report in this respect are also reported here.</p>
<h2>Supplementary information</h2>
<p>Chapter 3 Supplementary Information  follows up developments in the areas covered in chapter 1, which are of fundamental importance for the analysis of conditions for digital radio in Sweden. Apart from information about the analogue radio market and radio listening and other media use a description is given of developments in various technologies for distribution of digital radio, frequency planning, DAB receivers, digital radio broadcasts in Sweden since 2002, developments in other countries and positions taken by the industry.</p>
<p>Eureka 147 DAB is the standard for digital terrestrial radio which is most established in Europe. The European Broadcasting Union has recommended DAB as the European standard and broadcasting using the DAB standard is in progress in several European countries. As regards developments in the Nordic countries Sveriges Radio AB (SR) has been making broadcasts in the national DAB multiplex in 2002 and 2003. The broadcasts have covered about 35 percent of the population. In autumn 2003 SR adopted a new digital strategy and since autumn 2003 SR has broadcast seven digital channels, most of which were unique as regards digital selection. In Denmark DAB broadcasts have covered 80 percent of the population since spring 2003 and the degree of coverage is expected to reach 100 percent on 1 April 2004. DR has broadcast eight national channels in DAB in 2003. In Norway as well DAB broadcasts have been increased recently. Finland is, however, waiting before making further investments in the DAB standard until it has achieved greater international penetration.</p>
<p>As regards the developments for DAB receivers it can be noted that several new models have been launched since spring 2002, stationary, portable as well as mobile, and the prices of receivers have fallen from previously high levels. In the United Kingdom sales of receivers have increased. Up to October 2003 about 200,000 DAB receivers had been sold in the United Kingdom and according to information from the DRDB (Digital Radio Development Bureau) about 100,000 DAB receivers were sold there in December 2003. The problem of low sales figures for DAB receivers in Europe has, however, by and large continued even in 2003.</p>
<p>One reason put forward as an explanation for the weak penetration of the DAB standard in Europe as yet is that neither governments nor players in the radio industry have decided that DAB is to be the future distribution technology for digital radio. Another reason is the lack of availability of cheap DAB receivers in the market. In France, for example, a government commission has stated that the future for radio lies in creating a situation where different digital technologies, such as DAB, satellite radio, mobile telephony and mobile Internet are used together. In the United Kingdom, however, co-operation between all the players involved has meant that both the BBC and commercial broadcasters offer DAB services. They provide a large range of digital channels and the degree of coverage for the broadcasts is successively increasing. The range of DAB receivers in the United Kingdom also increased in 2003 and the receivers are marketed by large chainstores around the country.</p>
<p>Apart from DAB there are other standards that can be used to distribute digital radio, including the Internet and DVB-T. The problem with these standards is that they have not been adapted for mobile coverage. Within the DVB organisation development work has been carried out in recent years with the aim of creating a new standard to enable mobile coverage. The standard is called DVBH (Digital Video Broadcasting-Handheld) and it is based on the DVB-T-standard. Its technical standard is expected to be established around the turn of the year 2003/2004 and it should be ready for commercial broadcasts in January 2005. In Finland test transmissions using the DVB-H-standard in a new fourth digital network will be started in 2004.</p>
<p>In Sweden the players involved in radio have given their support to further investments in the DAB standard. SR and Radioutgivareföreningen (the Association of Radio Publishers – RU) have put forward proposals for extending the DAB networks and phasing out the FM networks. Their proposal is described in chapters 3 and 4.</p>
<h2>Costs of DAB broadcasts</h2>
<p>A description is given in chapter 4 on the costs of DAB broadcasts etc.  To start with, a description is given of the interim report’s information concerning costs and the referral bodies’ views on this information. After this the supplementary information gathered by the Committee is presented. The cost calculations assume that the two co-ordinated and partly developed DAB networks in Sweden are to be initially used by both SR and commercial players. SR has presented three different alternatives for developing the DAB networks and phasing out the FM networks (FM1–FM4; P1–P4), while RU has presented a proposal and commented on SR’s three alternatives. Chapter 4 reports the costs that would arise for developing the two existing DAB networks and phasing out the four FM networks, on the basis of all three of SR’s alternatives. The various alternatives differ from each other as regards the rate of development and phase-out for the networks. In chapter 4 an example is also given of distribution costs for commercial players if they were to start DAB broadcasts.</p>
<p>SR’s alternative 2 is the one of the three alternatives that is closest to RU’s proposal, see table 4.17, chapter 4. The alternative implies that the national DAB network should be developed with a population coverage of 88 percent in 2005, 90 percent in 2012, 95 percent in 2015 and 99 percent in 2018. According to this alternative, the regional network is to be developed with population coverage of 75 percent in 2005, 80 percent in 2012, 86 percent in 2015 and 99 percent in 2020. The alternative is also based on a continual phase-out of the analogue FM networks; FM2 in January 2012, FM1 in January 2015, FM3 in January 2018 and FM4 in January 2020. RU’s proposal implies that the regional multiplex is to be developed with a population coverage of 75 percent in 2005, 80 percent in 2007 and with at least 85 percent in 2013. RU’s proposal also assumes that the analogue FM broadcasts can be phased out by 2020. As regards alternative 2, SR’s increased distribution costs, compared with the distribution costs for the analogue FM broadcasts in 2002 are estimated to be about one billion including value added tax up to and including 2019. This assumes, however, full cost recovery in both DAB networks. Otherwise the costs will increase further.</p>
<h2>Financial conditions for development of Swedish radio</h2>
<p>The  financial conditions for development of Swedish radio are presented in chapter 5. The financial situation of public service companies, the commercial radio industry and local radio, which was presented in the interim report, has remained by and large unchanged in 2003. The public service companies are in a licence period that started on 1 January 2002 and extends until the end of 2005. During this period the companies’ financial conditions will remain the same. Hence it is difficult to address SR’s and UR’s financial conditions for investing in digital radio without at the same time taking into consideration the full range of the public service companies’ activities. The costs of DAB broadcasts are great and a shift in technology from FM to DAB can be counted on to continue for a long period. The costs for double broadcasting can thus be expected to reach considerable amounts.</p>
<p>As regards commercial local radio, several commentators consider that a successful technology shift from FM to DAB assumes diversified programming and that at all events the commercial radio industry starts DAB broadcasts as soon as possible, alongside those of the public service companies. RU has, however, reported to the Committee that the commercial radio companies are in a difficult financial situation. This applies above all to the radio companies that were granted broadcasting licences on the basis of the now repealed Local Radio Act. RU is of the opinion that a change must be made in the concession fees so that these broadcasters will be able to start DAB broadcasts.</p>
<p>As far as community radio is concerned the possibilities of contributing the investments needed to start digital radio are very small, since community radio has limited resources in general. The situation for the commercial radio industry and community radio is, thus, that both operate under such financial conditions that they have difficulties in financing investments in new technology.</p>
<h2>Media policy and consumer policy aspects</h2>
<p>Chapter 6 presents the  media policy and consumer policy aspects of digital radio broadcasts. It is noted that the goal for the government investments in the media field also applies to the choice of new technology. The question whether the advantages of digital broadcasting technology, compared with the analogue technology, also imply media policy advantages for consumers, broadcasters and the radio as a medium, shall thus be assessed in the light of such considerations as protection of freedom of speech, freedom of information, freedom of establishment, diversity and availability. The significance for public service shall also be taken into consideration. A transition to digital broadcasting technology means that the radio companies can broadcast more channels and programmes and the consumers can enjoy a greater and wider selection. This makes increased diversity possible and benefits freedom of expression and freedom of information. The public service companies, through the use of digital broadcasting technology, are given the opportunity to fulfil their public service mandate even better and to offer diversified services that meet shifting needs and interests within the country’s population.</p>
<p>Digitalisation makes convergence possible between different media and between the media, telecoms and IT sectors. If radio is not digitalised and remains analogue, there is therefore a risk that radio and what it offers will be marginalized. In the light of the great importance of public service radio it is, in the opinion of the Committee, important that the public service companies and other players in the radio industry are given favourable conditions for using new technology to develop and renew their operations.</p>
<p>As regards consumers a transition from analogue to digital radio mainly concerns the value added by a greater and wider selection of channels, programmes and services and the costs of replacing analogue receivers with digital receivers. According to the Committee, significant factors for whether consumers will be prepared to invest in new radio receivers include the programmes and services offered, sound quality, coverage of the broadcasts, information concerning DAB broadcasts and their contents and services, as well as a large selection of user-friendly receivers at reasonable prices. A further factor which, in the opinion of the Committee, will be of importance to consumers’ willingness to invest is the degree of certainty in predicting that the new technology will in the long run replace FM broadcasts.</p>
<h2>Approaches to digitalisation of radio in Sweden</h2>
<p>The analysis of future prospects for and consequences of digital radio is presented in chapter 7 Three alternative approaches to digitalisation of radio in Sweden.  Under the Committee’s terms of reference the analysis shall be made on the basis of three alternatives: the large-scale introduction of digital terrestrial radio, the continuation of trial broadcasts for a while longer or the discontinuation of broadcasts. By way of introduction the chapter starts with a description of how the Committee sees the three alternatives.</p>
<p>As regards alternative one, introduction of DAB broadcasts on a large scale, the Committee believes that this alternative should include a concrete goal that FM broadcasts are to be replaced in the long term by DAB broadcasts. The Committee believes that what is crucial in the choice of alternative one is being able to predict now that the DAB standard, even in the longer term, will contribute to the fulfilment of media policy goals as well as creating conditions for competitive overall solutions, both technical and financial, for all players within radio, including the consumers.</p>
<p>Alternative two, which the terms of reference calls ”continuation of trial broadcasts for a while longer”, has been called by the Committee “development of DAB broadcasts in stages”. The main reason is that the concept “trial broadcasts” can be understood to mean that there is uncertainty as to the technical properties of the DAB standard. In the opinion of the Committee there should no longer be any uncertainty as to the fact that the DAB standard has the technical capabilities required to distribute radio and other supplementary services. The Committee therefore believes that the alternative should instead be called development of DAB broadcasts in stages. This designation should indicate that the approach does not imply a decision as to the establishment of the DAB standard as the future distribution system for radio and other supplementary services in Sweden and that the approach assumes a later decision, which may imply that the broadcasting activities are extended or that they cease. Alternative two is understood by the Committee to be a natural choice if there are insufficient grounds either for the assessment that FM broadcasts will in the long term be replaced by DAB broadcasts or for the assessment that the reasons for discontinuing DAB broadcasts outweigh the benefits of continuing the DAB broadcasts in some form. The purpose of developing DAB broadcasts in stages should be, according to the Committee, that the transmissions, within a relatively short period and at a limited cost, are to clarify whether the DAB standard has the potential required for establishment as the future distribution system for radio and other supplementary services in Sweden.</p>
<p>Alternative three, discontinuation of DAB broadcasts, should be chosen according to the Committee if it is already known now that the DAB standard does not have the potential required to be the main future method of distribution in the area of radio and replace FM broadcasts. According to the Committee it may also be rational to discontinue DAB broadcasts in the event that the costs of continued transmissions under alternative two are estimated to be greater than their expected benefit.</p>
<p>The analysis of the future prospects for and consequences of digital radio according to the three alternatives is made on the basis of nine different subject areas. These areas are the scope of the transmissions, the broadcasters’, manufacturing industry’s, retailers’ and consumers’ interest in implementing the respective alternatives, frequency considerations, the regulatory code, costs and financial consequences, technical developments and media policy and consumer policy consequences.</p>
<h2>Considerations and proposals</h2>
<p>Chapter 8 presents the Committee’s Considerations and proposals  concerning the future of digital radio. The assessment of the Committee is that digitalisation of radio in Sweden should continue, since there are a number of advantages to distributing radio also using digital technology. Digital standards utilise a given frequency space more effectively than analogue standards, which implies that more players can broadcast radio and active broadcasters can increase and broaden their present services. This would make increased variety possible and benefit freedom of expression, information and establishment. The possibility of broadcasting more channels and programmes gives the broadcasters greater scope to meet the various needs and interests of radio listeners. For the public service companies it would entail even better opportunities to satisfy the requirement to offer varied services that provide for changing conditions and needs among the country’s population. Digitalisation would probably, according to the Committee, also contribute to ensuring that the position of radio in the mass media field can be retained or strengthened.</p>
<p>In a comparison between different standards for distribution of digital radio the DAB standard has stood out as being the superior existing standard in terms of technology. However, in the opinion of the Committee it is difficult to foresee which platform or platforms should be used in a technology shift from analogue to digital distribution of radio. A deciding factor should be which system can most cost-effectively promote radio listening in Sweden and satisfy the various requirements of the public as regards selection and availability in different environments. The Committee considers that at present, instead of designating one standard for distribution of digital radio, the conditions should be created for broadcasters to distribute radio via various digital standards which in the future will have a corresponding coverage to today’s FM networks, i.e. good indoor and outdoor coverage as well as both portable and mobile coverage. In the opinion of the Committee the public service companies also in the future should be obliged to broadcast with the same coverage as at present.</p>
<p>Phasing out FM broadcasts is dependent on a number of different factors, such as geographical coverage for terrestrial digital radio, the number of digital radio receivers sold, digital radio listening, costs of parallel analogue and digital radio transmissions and the savings that a closedown of analogue broadcasts would entail. Since digital radio is still at an introductory stage, the Committee believes there is no basis on which to determine a definite date when analogue radio broadcasts can cease.</p>
<p>The Committee notes that DAB broadcasts constitute an important link in the development of digital distribution of radio. A cessation of these broadcasts, pending the outcome of whether the DAB standard will be established as the main distribution system for radio in Europe, would mean many years’ delay of digitalisation of radio in Sweden. Therefore the Committee thinks that DAB broadcasts should continue in Sweden. To start with these broadcasts should take place from the perspective of innovation, i.e., the broadcasts should create scope for more diversity and better accessibility to more groups, in order to increase the attractiveness of the radio medium. When evaluating the broadcasts, which according to the Committee should be done in 2008, it should be possible to then decide if it is possible to go further with a technology shift and direct policy towards replacing the present analogue broadcasts with digital broadcasts.</p>
<p>The Committee finds that at present there is uncertainty concerning the possibilities of DAB broadcasts to reach a larger number of radio listeners within a short period. As a consequence of this uncertainty, as well as of the substantial costs associated with rapid development, the Committee therefore proposes that continued broadcasting using the DAB standard should take place through creating conditions for development of DAB by stages. In the first stage, which the Committee proposes be started in 2005, the scope of investments in the DAB networks should be restricted. In the opinion of the Committee this decision does not prevent the broadcasters from themselves taking the initiative of increasing transmissions within the framework of available broadcasting space and available broadcasting licences.</p>
<p>As regards the extent of transmissions in the first stage of continued broadcasting the Committee considers that the investments should be restricted. The Committee has assumed that both SR and commercial players are to be given the opportunity to offer DAB services during the continued transmissions. In this, the public service companies and the commercial players should have approximately the same population coverage during the first stage. The Committee proposes that the DAB networks already set up be used for DAB broadcasts in the first stage and that the broadcasts in each of the networks should have about 35 percent population coverage. This implies that it will be possible to broadcast in the Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö areas as well as the Luleå region. After the first stage the Committee considers that the question of putting up further funds for increasing the DAB broadcasts should be put in relation to the degree of consumer demand for the broadcasts. However, during the stage by stage development of the DAB broadcasts the players in the radio market, in the opinion of the Committee, should themselves be able to initiate increased DAB broadcasts both in the regional and the national DAB network.</p>
<p>The Committee’s assessment is that conditions should be created for diversified programming in the first stage of the continued DAB transmissions. The Committee proposes that SR be allocated increased resources to cover the added costs associated with the Committee’s proposed broadcasting in the first stage of the continued DAB transmissions. As no commercial market has as yet been established for DAB broadcasts, the Committee assumes that the participation of commercial players will require the provision of incentives to broadcast.</p>
<p>As regards the allocation of capacity in the broadcasting networks, the Committee’s assessment is that SR, during the first stage of the continued transmissions, should have the entire capacity of the national DAB network at its disposal, as well as about one third of the capacity of the regionally divisible DAB network. Other capacity in the regional DAB network should be let to commercial players. Broadcasts in the national DAB network are relatively costly and as no commercial market for DAB broadcasts has as yet been established, relatively extensive incentives would probably be needed to induce the commercial players to broadcast in the national DAB network. The Committee’s assessment is that at present it is not possible to propose such incentives. The transition to digital broadcasting technology, however, creates greater scope for national broadcasts and the Committee considers that commercial players should also be offered the opportunity to use this broadcasting space. In connection with the expiry of the present broadcasting licences for the public service companies consideration should therefore be given to whether there is a commercial demand for broadcasting on the national frequency. If such an interest exists the Committee believes that it should also be possible to grant licences to broadcast in the national DAB network to commercial players.</p>
<p>As regards digital community radio broadcasts, the Committee considers that in the future it will be of the greatest importance that community radio can be provided with broadcasting space of at least the same proportions as community radio has at its disposal in the present analogue transmissions. The Committee’s assessment, however, is that at present there are neither financial nor technical solutions for the participation of community radio in the DAB broadcasts.</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the public service companies should continue even in the future to be granted broadcasting licences for both national and regional DAB broadcasts. In the first stage of the continued DAB transmissions, licences should be offered to commercial players to make both regional and national radio broadcasts in the regionally divisible DAB network. Licences to make digital radio broadcasts should, both for SR and the commercial players, be issued by the government under the present regulations. In the event of competition between commercial players for broadcasting licences, the Committee proposes that the licences be allocated in accordance with the basic principles applicable for allocation of licences to make analogue local radio broadcasts. Holding an analogue broadcasting licence in a certain broadcasting area shall not, however, constitute an obstacle to receiving a digital broadcasting licence in the same broadcasting area. The broadcasting licences to commercial players should be allocated in an open application procedure.</p>
<p>The licence period for public service companies in the opinion of the Committee should be the same both for the analogue and the digital broadcasts. The question of the licence period’s length should be referred to the Committee for radio and television in the public service (Ku 2003:01) for a decision. For the commercial broadcasters the Committee proposes that the licences for DAB broadcasts should be issued for a period of eight years. The first period should be counted from 1 January 2005 inclusive, even if the transmissions are started at a later date.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the incentives, which in the opinion of the Committee should be created to facilitate the operation of local digital radio broadcasts, consist of the possibility for the licence holders for analogue local radio broadcasts to enjoy less stringent requirements in the form of reduced concession fees or reduced obligations to broadcast a certain amount of own material and programmes with a local connection. The incentives should be directed at all licence-holders for analogue local radio and aim to promote diversity of both the analogue and the digital radio broadcasts. The model for incentives advocated by the Committee is based on the existing licence-holders being given the opportunity to operate under conditions that are equal and do not affect competition. The model implies that a licence-holder who was granted a broadcasting licence before 1 July 2001 shall be able to obtain relief from the concession fees if the licence-holder is granted a licence for DAB broadcasts. Correspondingly, licence-holders who have received a broadcasting licence after 1 July 2001 shall be able to obtain relief with regard to the conditions applicable to the content of their analogue broadcasts. As regards concession fees, the Committee proposes that the concession fee for a licence to broadcast analogue local radio that is associated with corresponding conditions concerning the contents of broadcasts as stated in a licence to carry on digital radio broadcasts, should consist of a fixed component of SEK 40,000 with certain indexation, and a variable component. The variable component shall be dependent on the revenue that constitutes payment to the broadcaster for broadcasting advertisements in its analogue programmes and in the opinion of the Committee should be payable at the rate of four percent of the revenue.</p>
<p>The continued DAB transmissions should be evaluated in 2008 according to the Committee. This evaluation should examine whether a step is to be taken from the perspective of innovation; to enable programming that is more diverse and more available to a greater number of groups in order to increase the attractiveness of the radio medium, to a technology shift perspective; to direct policy towards replacing the present analogue broadcasts by digital broadcasts. If the evaluation concludes that the continued transmissions should be based on the technology shift perspective a decision must be made on several questions, including the rate at which the DAB networks should be developed and the FM networks phased out, whether the legislation relating to radio should be neutrally formulated in terms of technology, which authority should issue licences for local digital radio broadcasts and the conditions for licensing of special multiplex operators. Further questions that will be of immediate interest will be investigating how community radio can be guaranteed digital broadcasting space of at least the same proportions as at present when FM broadcasts are being phased out, examining the conditions set up for commercial players’ digital radio broadcasts and examining whether there is a commercial interest among commercial players to broadcast radio in the national DAB network.</p>
<p>The evaluation should also examine the possibilities of achieving an integrated assessment and examination for the building of a mast system for electronic communication within the framework of the Environmental Code or the Planning and Building Act.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>The consequences of the Committee’s proposals are presented in Chapter 9. As regards the economic consequences the Committee’s proposal implies that SR should be allocated further funds to be able to carry out DAB broadcasts both in the national and regional DAB networks. During the first stage of the continued transmissions the Committee considers that the increased resources should be equivalent to SR’s costs for utilising the entire capacity of the national DAB network and on average a third of the capacity in the regionally divisible network. The costs should, according to the Committee, be calculated on the basis of the assumption that SR’s broadcasts in the respective network will have about 35 percent population coverage. On the basis of the Committee’s proposal for broadcasting during the first stage, SR’s distribution costs are calculated to be about SEK 25 million including value added tax per year for distribution of digital radio. In relation to the resources SR has used in 2002 and 2003 respectively to cover distribution costs for DAB broadcasts, SR should be allocated a further SEK 14 million per year. The Committee considers that the increased cost should be financed by means of an increase in the television licence charge of about SEK 4 per year.</p>
<p>The Committee’s proposal for reduced concession fees as an incentive to facilitate for commercial players to carry on DAB broadcasts may imply a fall in revenue for the state of about SEK 60–65 million per year. The Committee’s proposal for a new concession fee with a fixed component of SEK 40,000 and a variable component of four percent of the broadcaster’s advertising revenue entails, however, that the state’s revenue losses can be calculated to be a maximum of about SEK 50 million per year during the first stage of the continued transmissions.</p>
