<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Inquiry has been instructed in its terms of reference, first, to take a position on the implementation in Sweden of Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted  (the Qualification Directive), and second,  to make a comparison of the percentage of persons granted refugee or subsidiary protection status in Sweden and in some selected Member States and to analyse the reasons for substantial differences.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has examined the shape of Swedish legislation and case-law in each individual area covered by the terms of reference. The Inquiry has proceeded on the basis of the New Aliens Act (2005:716) (below, the “New Aliens Act”).</p>
<p>Implementation of the Qualification Directive</p>
<p>To begin with, the Inquiry has studied different methods of implementing the Directive, in particular the requirements placed on a Member State if it chooses to implement a “minimum directive”.</p>
<p>In assessing whether the Qualification Directive has been implemented in Swedish law, the Inquiry has investigated whether the Swedish legislation and/or case-law establishes a sufficiently clear and unambiguous framework for the legal position, and whether individuals therefore, firstly, have adequate opportunities to identify their rights and obligations and, secondly, can have their claims heard in a court of law.</p>
<p>The provisions of the Qualification Directive often display a greater degree of regulatory detail than the provisions of the New Aliens Act. To the extent that the provisions of the Directive are entrenched in well established case-law it has not been considered</p>
<p>necessary, nor in some cases appropriate, to introduce the detailed provisions of the Directive in the text of the law. In certain respects, principally concerning subsidiary protection status, the Swedish regulations do not correspond to the rights and responsibilities that follow from the Qualification Directive. The purpose of the Inquiry’s proposals is an adjustment of the Swedish legislation.</p>
<p>Refugees</p>
<p>The definition of refugees used in both the New Aliens Act and in the Qualification Directive is based on the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. The determination of status made in this connection is to be forward-looking, and in the opinion of the Inquiry this should be clear from the wording of the law.</p>
<p>In its bill  Refugee status and persecution on grounds of sex or sexual orientation (Gov. Bill 2005/06:6), the Government has proposed that people who feel a  well-founded  fear of persecution on grounds of sex or sexual orientation, and who are granted protection under current regulations as otherwise in need of protection (subsidiary protection status), should instead receive protection as refugees.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposal and the Government Bill would bring Swedish law into line with the Qualification Directive.</p>
<p>It is essential that asylum applications are tested against the provisions of the Geneva Convention. It is not enough for a person who qualifies as a refugee under the Convention to receive a residence permit on other grounds. The Inquiry’s proposal makes this clear by proposing that the issue of refugee status be determined in all asylum cases. In this process of determination it is important to adopt an international perspective.</p>
<p>The Qualification Directive contains optional (non-mandatory) provisions on protection needs arising sur place  and internal protection. The provisions reflect an interpretation of the Geneva Convention that is established in Swedish and international caselaw. The optional scope provided by the regulations can be used without statutory support. The examples given in the Qualification Directive of actors of persecution and actors of protection against persecution reflect an interpretation of the Geneva Convention that is established in Swedish and international case-law. There is</p>
<p>no reason to regulate the issue in detail in the text of the law. The Inquiry notes, further, that the concept of persecution used in the definition of refugee does not assume that the direct source of persecution is the state. Current law also covers cases in which there is no effective government in a country and no legislative amendments are needed in order to implement the provisions of the Qualification Directive in this area.</p>
<p>Swedish procedures in connection with the cessation of refugee status comply with the requirements of the Qualification Directive.</p>
<p>The proposal is made to link the grounds of exclusion in Article 1D, E and F of the Geneva Convention, which currently can limit the right to obtain a residence permit, to the granting of refugee status.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that a provision be introduced in the New Aliens Act that a residence permit for a refugee must be permanent or be valid for at least three years and renewable unless compelling reasons of national security or public order otherwise require.</p>
<p>The provisions in the New Aliens Act on revocation of refugee status fulfil the mandatory provisions of the Qualification Directive on revocation or ending of refugee status.</p>
<p>Subsidiary protection</p>
<p>An alien who does not meet the criteria for refugee status may in future be granted subsidiary protection status.</p>
<p>In order to implement this part of the Qualification Directive, it is proposed that Chapter 4, Section 2 of the New Aliens Act be supplemented by a provision covering serious and individual threat to a civilian’s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict.</p>
<p>The Qualification Directive contains optional provisions on protection needs arising sur place  and internal protection. The optional scope given by the provisions can be used without statutory support. An addition in Chapter 4, Section 2 of the New Aliens Act makes it clear that a risk of actions such as the section refers to can be present irrespective of whether the actions proceed from the authorities in the country or it cannot be assumed that these authorities will provide security against such actions being committed by individuals. The examples of actors that can provide protection against serious harm given in the Qualification</p>
<p>Directive reflect Swedish case-law. There is no reason to regulate the issue specially in the text of the law.</p>
<p>The Qualification Directive uses as objective risk criteria “substantial grounds for believing” and “real risk of suffering serious harm”. These criteria may be considered more favourable for the individual than the criterion “well-founded fear” in the New Aliens Act. The New Aliens Act should therefore be amended to include the criteria in the Directive. Furthermore, in accordance with the requirements of the Qualification Directive, the Aliens Act should contain a provision on the ending of subsidiary protection status.</p>
<p>A residence permit for a person with subsidiary protection status should be permanent, or valid for a period of at least one year, and renewable unless compelling reasons of national security or public order otherwise require.</p>
<p>Granting subsidiary protection status is an acknowledgement in the course of the decision-making process that an alien is in need of subsidiary protection. As in the case of refugees, a person granted subsidiary protection should receive confirmation of his or her status (declaration of subsidiary protection status). In addition, provisions are proposed on when subsidiary protection status is to be revoked.</p>
<p>Assessment of facts and circumstances</p>
<p>The Qualification Directive contains provisions on how to assess applications for international protection. The Swedish system for assessing applications for international protection currently meets the requirements raised by the Directive, both legally and in practice. The implementation of the New Aliens Act, which will lead to a system in which appeals against decisions by the Swedish Migration Board are made to a court of law, will mean that the guarantees of legal certainty required by the Directive will be further ensured.</p>
<p>Information concerning the rights and obligations relating to the status granted</p>
<p>Under the Qualification Directive, refugees and individuals with subsidiary protection status must be informed of the rights and obligations relating to the status granted. This is done. However, there is no regulation in an act or ordinance directing that information must be provided. The Inquiry therefore proposes that a new provision on information concerning the rights and obligations relating to the status granted be introduced in the Aliens Ordinance (1989:547).</p>
<p>Maintaining family unity</p>
<p>Swedish law applies the principle of family unity to families of refugees. As far as possible, the unity of families of individuals with subsidiary protection status is also maintained. Family members generally obtain the same status as the person granted protection.</p>
<p>The Qualification Directive entails certain obligations for the Member States concerning family members of beneficiaries of refugee or subsidiary protection status who do not individually qualify for such status. Family members are entitled to residence permits and have far-reaching rights to the other benefits that are regulated by the Directive. The Inquiry proposes that a provision be introduced in the New Aliens Act stating that a spouse, partner or unmarried child of a refugee or person with subsidiary protection status is entitled to a residence permit. The residence permit is to be permanent, or valid for a period of at least one year, and renewable unless reasons of national security or public order otherwise require.</p>
<p>The provisions in the New Aliens Act concerning revocation of residence permits of family members are compatible with the provisions of the Qualification Directive.</p>
<p>The proposed provision that family members of beneficiaries of refugee or subsidiary protection status are to be granted permanent residence permits or temporary residence permits valid for at least one year ensures that family members will have access to the residence-based benefits regulated in Chapter VII of the Directive. With regard to the level of benefits to be provided to family</p>
<p>members of beneficiaries of refugee or subsidiary protection status, Swedish law meets the requirements of the Qualification Directive.</p>
<p>Under both the Qualification Directive and Swedish law, a travel document is to be issued to refugees in the cases specified in the Geneva Convention. No amendments of current regulations are needed to implement this part of the Qualification Directive.</p>
<p>Travel documents for beneficiaries of subsidiary protection status in the case of serious humanitarian reasons</p>
<p>The Qualification Directive requires Member States to issue to beneficiaries of subsidiary protection status a document that enables them to travel to another state if serious humanitarian reasons arise that require their presence in the other state. At present an alien’s passport can be issued for this purpose, but there is no obligation to do so. The Inquiry therefore proposes that the provision concerning alien’s passports in the Aliens Ordinance should be supplemented by an obligation for the Swedish Migration Board to issue an alien’s passport to a beneficiary of subsidiary protection status if necessary for serious humanitarian reasons.</p>
<p>Access to the labour market</p>
<p>The Qualification Directive stipulates that Member States must give beneficiaries of refugee or subsidiary protection status access to the labour market.</p>
<p>Refugees must also be given access to labour market related measures.</p>
<p>Beneficiaries of refugee and subsidiary protection status do not need a work permit in order to work in Sweden. There is no requirement of a permit corresponding to a work permit for aliens who wish to run their own business. There are provisions in Swedish law that limit the right of aliens to practice a profession. These provisions comply with the requirements of the Qualification Directive. Beneficiaries of both refugee and subsidiary protection status have access to labour market related</p>
<p>measures under the same conditions as Swedish nationals. No amendments to current statutes are proposed.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>The Qualification Directive stipulates that children who are refugees or have been granted subsidiary protection status must be given access to the education system under the same conditions as Swedish children. Adults who are refugees or have been granted subsidiary protection status must be given access to the education system under the same conditions as other third country nationals legally resident in the country.</p>
<p>Swedish legislation gives children who are refugees or have subsidiary protection status the right to schooling or other education under the same conditions as Swedish children. Adult refugees and aliens who have been granted subsidiary protection status have access to municipal adult education and higher education. Furthermore, they can claim credit for both Swedish and foreign education under the same conditions as Swedish nationals. The requirements of the Qualification Directive are accordingly fulfilled.</p>
<p>A special question regarding the right to education is the possibility of being granted a study allowance. Beneficiaries of refugee and subsidiary protection status have the same right to a study allowance as Swedish nationals for studies in Sweden, which means the provisions of the Qualification Directive are fulfilled.</p>
<p>Social security, social benefits and health and medical care</p>
<p>The Qualification Directive stipulates that legislation in Member States on social security systems for employed and self-employed persons must be applied for beneficiaries of refugee and subsidiary protection status.</p>
<p>Most Swedish social insurance benefits are included in the Community law concept of social security. In practice, beneficiaries of refugee and subsidiary protection status are granted residence permits for at least one year, which means that these aliens are registered as residents and are thereby entitled to residence-based social insurance benefits under the same</p>
<p>conditions as Swedish nationals from the date that a residence permit that leads to entry in the population registry is granted. Work-based social insurance benefits can be paid to a working person regardless of whether he or she is a resident of the country or not.</p>
<p>The Qualification Directive also stipulates that beneficiaries of refugee and subsidiary protection status are to receive necessary social assistance that is provided to the Member State’s own nationals. Regarding beneficiaries of subsidiary protection status, this support may be limited to pertain to core benefits which are then to be paid under the same conditions as for the Member State’s own nationals.</p>
<p>In order to determine which benefits and measures are included in the Qualification Directive’s social benefits (social assistance) under Swedish law, the Inquiry has based its analysis on the concept of social service in Swedish legislation. Beneficiaries of refugee and subsidiary protection status have access to social benefits under the same conditions as Swedish nationals once a residence permit leading to resident status is granted.</p>
<p>Beneficiaries of refugee and subsidiary protection status must be given access to health and medical care under the same conditions as the Member State’s own nationals. Regarding beneficiaries of subsidiary protection status, access to health and medical care may be limited under the same conditions that apply for social support. Furthermore, beneficiaries of refugee and subsidiary protection status with special needs must be given access to health and medical care under the same conditions as the Member State’s own nationals.</p>
<p>The draft act prepared by the Government Offices on health and medical care as well as dental care for asylum seekers and others means that the Qualification Directive’s provisions on providing health and medical care to beneficiaries of refugee and subsidiary protection status will be implemented in Swedish law. The Swedish regulations on health and medical care for persons with special needs correspond to those which must apply under the Qualification Directive.</p>
<p>Unaccompanied minors</p>
<p>In the Qualification Directive, “unaccompanied minors” refers both to a child who has arrived in a Member State unaccompanied by a responsible adult, and a child who has been left alone after arrival in a Member State. The Qualification Directive stipulates that these children are to be represented by a guardian or in some other appropriate manner. The guardian is subject to supervision. The child is to be placed in suitable accommodation. The Member State is to endeavour to trace the child’s family members. Information in connection with this search must remain confidential.</p>
<p>By means of the provisions of the Act on custodianship for unaccompanied children (2005:429) and the provisions of the Children and Parents Code concerning specially appointed guardians, the requirements of the Qualification Directive that unaccompanied children must to be provided with appropriate representation have been implemented in Swedish law. The provisions of the Children and Parents Code on supervision by a chief guardian and the provisions of the Social Services Act (2001:453) on municipal responsibility for children and young people living in the municipality together mean that the Directive’s requirement that a minor’s needs be met has been implemented in Swedish law. The provisions of the Qualification Directive concerning the placement of an unaccompanied child are implemented in Swedish legislation through the provisions of the Social Services Act.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Swedish Migration Board be given the task of tracing an unaccompanied child’s family members after a child has been granted a residence permit. By means of the provisions of the Secrecy Act (1980:100), the requirements of the Qualification Directive that information in connection with the search must remain confidential have been implemented in Swedish law.</p>
<p>Access to accommodation</p>
<p>Under the Qualification Directive, beneficiaries of refugee and subsidiary protection status must be given access to accommodation under equivalent conditions as other third country nationals legally resident in the country.</p>
<p>By means of the Reception of Asylum Seekers and Others Act (1994:137), the Social Services Act and the agreements made between the central government and municipalities on the reception of refugees, Swedish legislation guarantees that beneficiaries of refugee and subsidiary protection status gain access to housing on conditions that fully satisfy the requirements of the Qualification Directive.</p>
<p>Right to free movement within the Member State</p>
<p>Under the Qualification Directive, beneficiaries of refugee and subsidiary protection status must be allowed to move freely within the Member State’s territory under the same conditions and with the same restrictions that apply for other third country nationals legally resident in the Member State.</p>
<p>Aliens’ freedom of movement is limited either through legislation or through ordinances. These provisions make no distinction between aliens on the basis of the grounds they have for living in the country. Accordingly, Swedish law fulfils the requirements of the Qualification Directive.</p>
<p>Access to integration facilities</p>
<p>Appropriate integration programmes must be available to refugees. If appropriate, beneficiaries of subsidiary protection status are to be given access to such programmes.</p>
<p>In Sweden, beneficiaries of both refugee and subsidiary protection status have access to integration facilities, in part through the provisions of the Ordinance regarding state compensation for refugee services (1990:927) and in part through the provisions of the Education Act (1985:1100) regarding Swedish for immigrants. The EC Directive makes no additional obligations beyond this.</p>
<p>Repatriation</p>
<p>The Qualification Directive contains an optional provision on assistance for repatriation.</p>
<p>In Swedish law provisions on assistance for repatriation are found in the Repatriation Ordinance (1984:890).</p>
<p>Administrative cooperation within the EU</p>
<p>The Qualification Directive makes clear that Members States are to appoint a national contact point.</p>
<p>It should be up to the Government to determine a Swedish contact point and to inform the Commission which body or agency has been appointed.</p>
<p>Staff</p>
<p>The Qualification Directive prescribes that those in charge of implementing the Directive are to have the necessary training and be bound by the confidentiality principle.</p>
<p>According to the Inquiry, the point of this provision is to ensure that decisions made are objective and legally correct. The Qualification Directive does not specify the extent to which training is to be provided and involves no obligation for Member States to take legislative measures in the area.</p>
<p>The Secrecy Act and other legislative provisions on prohibiting the release of documents and the confidentiality principle meet the requirements of the Directive. No legislative amendments are needed to implement the Qualification Directive.</p>
<p>Costs and consequences of the submitted proposal</p>
<p>The proposals for legislative provisions submitted by the Inquiry are intended in part to codify what is already clear from established case-law and in part to give legislative form to the provisions of the Qualification Directive, primarily with regard to beneficiaries of subsidiary protection. The proposal of giving the Swedish Migration Board the task of tracing an accompanied child’s family members will entail higher costs for the Board. However, the proposal is intended to meet the demands the Qualification Directive places on Swedish law.</p>
<p>Refugee status and subsidiary protection categories – a statistical comparison</p>
<p>Only a small percentage of persons who are granted a residence permit in Sweden having called for protection are recognised as refugees. Sweden is one of the countries in the EU with the lowest percentage of decisions granting residence permits on the grounds of having refugee status, while relatively large scope is accorded to subsidiary protection categories. The gap to the EU average for granting residence permits on the grounds of having refugee status is substantial. The difference between Swedish and foreign practice cannot be linked to a single or a limited number of legal factors.</p>
