<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit was to report on the conditions for Sweden to ratify the Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships. The terms of reference instruct the Inquiry to propose the legislative amendments and other measures necessary for a Swedish ratification of the Convention.</p>
<h2>The Hong Kong International Convention</h2>
<p>The Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships was adopted on 19 May 2009 by the United Nations International Maritime Organisation. The Convention contains numerous provisions aimed at safer and more environmentally sound recycling of ships than is the case at present. For ships, requirements for certificates and inventories of hazardous materials and substances will be introduced. Ship recycling facilities must be authorised and operations conducted in compliance with fairly detailed Convention provisions.</p>
<p>Ships with a gross tonnage of at least 500 GT that operate in international waters and are not owned or operated by a state are covered by the provisions of the Convention. The Inquiry’s proposals therefore encompass only those ships that fulfil the stipulated criteria.</p>
<p>With regard to ships, two different certificates will be introduced, namely the International Certificate on Inventory of Hazardous Materials (ICIHM) and the International Ready for Recycling Certificate (IRRC).</p>
<p>A new ship may not be built using materials or products containing the hazardous materials or substances listed in the Convention. The same applies to subsequent installations and renovations. The substances are stipulated in the Convention’s appendix and include asbestos, ozone-depleting substances, PCB and other organostannic compounds.</p>
<p>The presence of these substances on a ship is to be specified in the Inventory of Hazardous Materials (IHM), which forms the basis for the ICIHM, and is to be on board the ship and properly maintained and updated throughout the operational life of the ship.</p>
<p>A ship sent for recycling is to undertake to minimise the amount of hazardous waste prior to entering the ship recycling facility. Prior to any recycling of a ship, a Ship Recycling Plan (SRP) specifying the manner in which the ship will be recycled is to be prepared and approved. The SRP is to include information concerning how the type and amount of hazardous materials present on the ship will be managed at the ship recycling facility. The SRP is to be developed by the facility and approved by the competent authority of the recycling state.</p>
<p>Immediately before the ship is delivered for recycling, details regarding remaining products containing hazardous materials and substances are to be added to the IHM. Remaining products to be listed may include, for example, ship-specific products needed to operate the ship and common items such as refrigerators and electronic equipment.</p>
<p>A final survey will be carried out to verify that the IHM coincides with the approved SRP. After the final survey has been conducted and approved, an International Ready for Recycling Certificate will be issued. Only when this has been issued may recycling of the ship commence.</p>
<p>A ship recycling facility  that is to recycle ships covered by the provisions of the Convention must be authorizsed. The authorisation procedure is to ensure that each facility fulfils the requirements set forth in the Convention and may involve site inspection, supervision, monitoring, sampling and testing, and so on. Authorisation of a facility may not be issued for a period exceeding five years.</p>
<p>To obtain authorisation, a facility must have a management system in place, together with processes and methods aimed at protecting human health and the environment. An authorised facility may deal with ships that have a Ready for Recycling</p>
<p>Certificate and otherwise fulfil the requirements defined in the Convention, regardless of whether the ship in question flies the flag of a Party or the flag of non-Parties to the Convention.</p>
<p>The ship recycling facility is to have recycling facility plan that includes the facility’s safety, health and protection, environmental protection, the mitigation of adverse effects on human health and the environment, systems for ensuring implementation of the requirements set out in the Convention, organisation and roles for employers and workers, training and information, emergency preparedness and response plan, monitoring systems, a recordkeeping system showing how ship recycling is carried out, a system for reporting discharges, emissions, incidents, accidents, etc. and a system for reporting occupational injuries, accidents, diseases and other adverse effects on workers safety and human health. A facility is also to take preventive measures or procedures to reduce the risk of explosions, harmful or unsafe atmospheres in confined spaces and enclosed spaces, accidents, injuries and harmful spills or emissions to land, water and air. Furthermore, a facility is to manage hazardous substances and materials in an environmentally sound manner.</p>
<h2>EU proposal for a ship recycling regulation</h2>
<p>On 23 March 2012 the European Commission presented Proposed Ship Recycling Regulation, its proposal to speed up the entry into force of the provisions of the Hong Kong International Convention since the Convention is not expected to enter into force before 2020. The EU’s proposal for a regulation contains, by and large, the provisions of the Convention but with a few amendments; see annex 4. The EU regulation proposes environmental provisions that are stricter than those of the Convention, the drawing up of a European list of ship recycling facilities that may be used, and that the ship owner and recycling facility enter into a contract with specified contents for each ship that is to be recycled.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals Regulations pertaining to ships</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Act on Measures against Pollution from Vessels (1980:424) and the Ordinance on the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (1980:789) be expanded to include the additional requirements on ships set out in the Hong Kong International Convention. In addition to these legislative amendments, the Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Transport Agency be tasked with more closely regulating, in regulation form, many of the conditions required in the Convention.</p>
<p>Since the Swedish Transport Agency is already the Government-appointed agency for issuing various certificates for ships and supervising and conducting inspections, it is appropriate that the Hong Kong International Convention’s certificates be issued by the agency and regulated in the Swedish Transport</p>
<p>Agency’s regulations. The provisions in the Ordinance on the</p>
<p>Prevention of Pollution from Ships are supplemented by the introduction of requirements stipulating that a ship must have an inventory or recycling certificate and of a ban on shipping in the absence of a certificate. There is no reason to regulate the Convention’s certificates requirement in the Act on Measures against Pollution from Vessels or the Ordinance on the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. The Swedish Transport Agency can already issue regulations concerning various certificates and the</p>
<p>Inquiry therefore considers that the Convention’s certificates can also be regulated in the Agency’s regulations. Many of the Convention’s requirements for ships will therefore be transformed in the Swedish Transport Agency’s regulations.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Swedish Transport Agency is also proposed as the competent authority for the Hong Kong International Convention and to be responsible for fulfilling related matters that rest with the Administration according to the Convention.</p>
<h2>Regulations pertaining to ship recycling facilities</h2>
<p>While the Inquiry finds it unlikely that facilities for recycling of end-of-life ships will be set up here in Sweden in the foreseeable future, it presents proposals for the new rules that are required for</p>
<p>Sweden to ratify the Hong Kong International Convention in compliance with the remit.</p>
<p>According to the Swedish Environmental Code, environmentally hazardous activities require a permit before operations begin. The Government has the right to prescribe the structure of permit applications for environmentally hazardous activities in accordance with the Ordinance on Environmentally Hazardous Activities and Public Health Protection (1998:899). The Inquiry proposes that a new point be inserted in the annex to the aforementioned ordinance stating that a permit for a ship recycling facility is to be examined by the Land and Environment Court and supervised by the county administrative board.</p>
<p>The Convention sets out the requirement that a ship recycling facility is to be authorised. In addition to the permit already required under the rules of the Swedish Environmental Code, rules are therefore to be introduced stipulating that a ship recycling facility for end-of-life ships is to be authorised. Rules concerning authorisation of the company operating the facility (ship scrapper) will be introduced in a new regulation with the support of a new authorisation for the Government, or the Government-appointed agency, in a new paragraph in Chapter 15 of the Swedish Environmental Code. The new regulation for recycling facilities for end-oflife ships will regulate the conditions that must be fulfilled to allow authorisation of a ship scrapper, the obligations of the ship scrapper and related issues. The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency is proposed as the competent authority for authorisation of ship scrappers, responsible for issuing and withdrawing such authorisations. It is also proposed that the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency be entitled to issue regulations on obligations and requirements for those operators of ship recycling activities, on inspections and on the various plans the facility is required to prepare.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s analysis of the consequences of the proposals indicates that the additional work for the Swedish Transport Agency in conjunction with issuing the new certificates, supervision, work on regulations and the Agency’s administration function as described in the Hong Kong International Convention does not entail costs</p>
<p>that must be separately financed. A similar assessment applies to an even greater extent to the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency as the competent authority for ship recycling facilities in view of the highly hypothetical scenario of such facilities existing in Sweden.</p>
<p>With regard to the concerned ship owners, the Inquiry also concludes that the proposal will not entail more than marginally higher costs.</p>
<p>Given that the Inquiry is examining the ratification of a convention, the scope for regulatory simplification is obviously limited.</p>
<p>The proposals’ approach entails advantages for environmental work even if, for all intents and purposes, the new rules will not have full practical impact for the next few decades.</p>
