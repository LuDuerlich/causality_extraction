<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduktion</h2>
<p>The health care and social services sector faces a number of challenges. Differences in the level of service and quality provided are becoming increasingly visible and at the same time are less accepted. Patients, service users, relatives and carers are making ever greater demands for information and influence on their own health care and social services. Knowledge is being developed in the sector in an increasingly international context and at an everquickening pace. Increasing needs for health care and social services and new technical capabilities are accentuating the need for priority-setting and effective working practices. Greater diversity in forms of organisation and operation may be one way of meeting the needs for modernisation, but also requires new demands on overarching governance.</p>
<p>Patients and service users who need most health care and social services often have multiple needs. These people must be met with integrated support and preventive efforts adapted to their circumstances.</p>
<p>Sweden is a small country. Our health care and social services system must work coherently and effectively. Skills that today are dispersed in many different agencies need to be utilised more effectively in the future.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers the challenges to pose a great need for changes in the sector in the years ahead. More and more questions will necessitate cooperation at national level. In our interim report in October 2011, we identified some areas where such national cooperation is becoming increasingly important: health care and social services on equal terms, support for empowering patients and service users, quality enhancement, IT coordination, knowledge management, priority-setting and leadership. We also pointed out that health-promoting and disease-preventing efforts need to have a greater impact in practical health care and social services. All these areas will gradually need to be addressed, for many years to come.</p>
<p>Many EU Member States are working on similar issues. Several countries are currently implementing radical changes of system in order to meet the challenges. As far as Sweden is concerned, a great deal can be achieved through changes in the present structure and by enhanced interaction between the national, regional and local level.</p>
<p>For the central government level, the Inquiry proposes a focus on four main tasks: Knowledge Support  that supports successive improvement efforts, Regulation and Supervision  that ensure an acceptable quality in all providers, Infrastructure for IT and Communications  and Long-Term  Strategic Management .</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a new government agency structure based on these four main tasks:  A knowledge agency responsible for all types of knowledge support for health care and social services. Here we also propose enhanced cooperation with service providers and responsible authorities at regional and local level.  An inspection agency responsible for permits, licences to practice, approvals of drugs and other medicinal products and supervision. This agency is to be given greater resources for supervision than exists in the presents agencies.  An agency that, together with other stakeholders, manages and develops the IT and communication solutions the sector needs.  An agency that monitors the overarching development of public health, disability issues, healthcare and social services – and in so doing strengthens the prospects of strategic governance  The Inquiry also proposes the special legislation on Drug Therapeutic Committees to be abolished, to make it easier for all relevant areas of expertise to be integrated in knowledge management.</p>
<p>The proposal presents a long-term sustainable central-government structure that can meet the needs of the providers and the demand. The new structure does not, in itself, answer all the questions, but will make it easier to tackle the issues the sector faces.</p>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>Terms of reference</p>
<p>The Inquiry's remit has been to “... review how central government, through its agencies, can promote a long-term sustainable system of health care and social services focused on health-promoting and disease-preventing efforts with the aim of promoting health and reducing ill-health and future care needs and bring about equal health care and social services throughout the country.”</p>
<p>The focus in the Inquiry's terms of reference is on bringing about a clearer distribution of responsibilities and improved efficiency in the central-government parts of the system of health care and social services, both between the agencies and for national government as a whole. The terms of reference highlight the need of an integrated and systematic approach, in order to provide a better basis for collective priority-setting, be able to resolve problems that are common to several agencies and improve the prospects for coordination between agencies. The role and functionality of the National Board of Health and Welfare are to be elucidated in particular, but the Inquiry has otherwise focused on a comprehensive system approach, not primarily on functions and effectiveness of individual agencies.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has also been tasked with suggesting how the proposed changes should be implemented.</p>
<p>An important basic premise has been that the prevailing distribution of responsibilities between national, regional and local government should be fixed.</p>
<p>Our interpretation of the remit</p>
<p>The citizen’s perspective is highlighted in our remit as taking precedence. This has guided our work, so that analysis and our proposals have been consistently linked to the combined effects for citizens, the service providers and the professions.</p>
<p>The remit has a long-term perspective. The present-day strengths and weaknesses of the current agencies provide an important background picture, but our proposals are based on more long-term assessments of what the service providers and the sector as a whole need.</p>
<h2>Our analysis of the current situation Increasing need for national coordination</h2>
<p>There is demand from healthcare and social services for greater national coordination in several important areas. This need for national coordination can be understood in the light of the significant changes that healthcare and social services are going through:</p>
<p>The development of knowledge is becoming increasingly international. It is becoming ever simpler – and therefore also necessary – to spread best available knowledge effectively. This is partly a matter of effectively spreading knowledge developed by individual experts, but it is largely also a matter of building systems for data capture and analysis where knowledge is developed successively on the basis of broad experience. This trend necessitates greater national and international cooperation.</p>
<p>The growth of information and communication technology has created greater opportunities for comparing quality and efficiency in health care and social services. Differences between different ends of the country, units and sometimes also individual practitioners are becoming increasingly apparent. The steadily increasing transparency applies to health care and social service providers, but also to overarching factors such as public health and conditions for people with disabilities. Issues concerning health care and social services on equal terms are becoming clearer and need to be addressed collectively.</p>
<p>Increasing needs for health care and social services and greater expectations from patients, service users, relatives and carers, combined with increasing opportunities to provide treatment and assistance, are accentuating the need for priority-setting and effective working practices. The challenge is accentuated when priority-setting becomes increasingly visible to the public. Additional to this, the need for coordination and joint development is increasing.</p>
<p>Some responsible authorities see greater diversity in forms of organisation and operation as a way of meeting the needs for modernisation. However, new forms of organisation and operation make new demands on regulatory frameworks and routines.</p>
<p>The Inquiry regards these long-term changes to have great significance for many years to come. Many initiatives are gradually being taken to respond to the increasing needs for cooperation, but far more needs to be done.</p>
<h2>Specific problems areas</h2>
<p>Fragmented knowledge support</p>
<p>The providers, the professions and the elected representatives in health care and social services need knowledge bases that are userfriendly in both content and form. Service users and patients have similar needs based on their particular circumstances.</p>
<p>The present structure, in which several different agencies provide knowledge support in their specialist fields, slows down the development of comprehensive material that integrates different perspectives.</p>
<p>The large number of agencies contributes to knowledge support to the sector being fragmented and unclear. The providers do not receive the needs-based and user-friendly support they need. Healthcare and social services for individual patients and service users are becoming less coherent than they could be.</p>
<p>This fragmentation is supported by the special legislation on regional Drug Therapeutic Committees, under which county councils have to organise knowledge support on pharmaceutical issues in special committees.</p>
<p>Supervision is too weak</p>
<p>Central government has difficulty guaranteeing the levels of quality that are to apply in all service providers. There are obvious deficiencies in the supervision of health care and social services in particular, but there is also criticism of the supervision aimed primarily at the pharmaceutical industry and the pharmacy market.</p>
<p>Some of the problems can presumably be solved in present agencies, but there are also structural problems: the balance between audit and providing advice and guidance is unclear. Nor is the supervision sufficiently adapted to the increasing diversity in provision and rate of change, where supervision has to be aimed at different players and both directly at service providers and at their constituents/purchasers. Supervision generally needs to be strengthened.</p>
<p>Guidelines should drive development forward, but actual change is what is important.</p>
<p>Advice and guidelines need to be developed and updated faster than they are today, based on the issues that arise in practical work.</p>
<p>Advice and guidelines must also be based on the practical and financial circumstances of the providers to have an impact. At present there is a lack of clear forms in which to link work on guidelines to the specific circumstances of the responsible authorities and providers.</p>
<p>Inadequate dialogue with the research and education sector</p>
<p>Supply of skills in the sector is a key issue. This involves, among other things, training a sufficient number of people with the needed skills. Research, development and innovation are also key issues in long-term.</p>
<p>There is a clear need for better regular communication between various representatives of the sector and universities and colleges.</p>
<p>Lack of coordination of IT structure and communication channels</p>
<p>There is an increasing need for a national infrastructure for IT solutions and communication channels in the health care and social services sector.</p>
<p>There are several dimensions to this task, including creating a basic structure and standards, for example through uniform terms and concepts, building, managing and successively developing infrastructure for data management and building, managing and successively developing integrated communication channels for practitioners and the general public.</p>
<p>Many stakeholders, both public and private, have taken and are taking initiatives in this area, but to face up to the continued challenges central government needs to be represented by some kind of authority with a comprehensive mandate in this field.</p>
<p>Need for enhanced strategic management</p>
<p>Management by the Government in recent years has been done increasingly through strategies, which in several cases are linked to agreements with the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions. In several ways success has been achieved in strengthening the ties between the Government and the political leaderships of municipalities and county councils. The large number of parallel initiatives and unclear distribution of responsibility between the Government Offices, agencies, the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions has, at the same time, posed certain problems.</p>
<p>Nor does the Government have sufficient support from an overarching knowledge base for long-term policy. The present agencies develop basic documentation in their particular specialist areas, but none of them has been commissioned to prepare a knowledge base that integrates several different areas and provides a collective picture of the state of, and challenges faced by, the sector.</p>
<p>National policy could have a greater impact by focusing on a smaller number of issues and knowledge and analysis support that can relieve the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs of operational tasks.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals Fundamental proposals</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a clearer focus on four principal tasks of central government:  Supporting the development of the sector, through support for effective development and dissemination of knowledge.  Ensuring acceptable quality in all service providers, through effective management of approvals, permits and licences to practice, as well as efficient supervision  Coordinating and taking responsibility for strategic key functions with regard to information and communications technology  Managing strategically on the basis of a broad approach to the state of and challenges faced by health and welfare sector</p>
<p>Support for development of the sector</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the work of central government on knowledge support be made more coordinated and better adapted to the needs of the users, with regard to both content and form. Observations made in supervision are also used as support in the gradual development of knowledge.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that the local and regional authorities be given a clearer place in the work on guidelines and other knowledge bases that contain priority-setting.</p>
<p>In addition, the Inquiry proposes that procedures be developed for a continuous dialogue between local and regional authorities, universities and other players on the training needs of the sector and its need for research.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the legislation on regional specific Drug Therapeutic Committees be abolished.</p>
<p>Ensuring quality in all providers</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the supervisory activity of central government be strengthened and enhanced. The balance between strict audit on the one hand and advice and guidance on the other is to be clarified. An integrated and strengthened supervisory function should ensure that laws and regulations are complied with.</p>
<p>Coordinating and supporting key functions for the sector’s information and communication needs</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that central government brings together and strengthens its initiatives to support the needs of the health care and social services sector for joint IT and communications solutions. Central government needs to coordinate its own efforts in the area and also be a party to the interaction with other players that are involved in building national solutions.</p>
<p>Strengthened strategic management</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that central government establish a function that provides a basis for broad and long-term political assessments and priority-setting in health care and social services.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that the interaction between the Government and the responsible authorities be given a structure that facilitates a long-term approach and focus. Among other things, the process that leads to agreements should be given a clear form that is supported by both knowledge base and practical support.</p>
<h2>Organisational proposals</h2>
<p>To facilitate modernisation, the Inquiry proposes a collective organisational approach in which a new agency structure is shaped according to the needs of tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore proposes that ten current government agencies , a non-profit association and a state-owned company be replaced by four new agencies:  the  Knowledge Agency  for Public Health, Health Care and Social Services  the  Inspectorate  of Public Health, Health Care and Social Services  the  Infrastructure Agency  for Public Health, Health Care and Social Services  the Agency for  Welfare Strategy</p>
<p>It is proposed that these four agencies be given a joint overarching remit to work in cooperation to promote the health of the population and ensure good health care and social services for those who need them.</p>
<p>Two of the agencies, the Knowledge Agency and the Inspectorate will work with health care and social services as their principal target groups: professions, responsible authorities, patients and service users etc. Both will have important roles to play in the continuous development of the sector, where continuous learning and development lead to successive improvements.</p>
<p>The Infrastructure Agency for Public Health, Health Care and Social Services supports the development of the IT and a communication structure of the whole sector and also assists the other three agencies in the health care and social services sector with IT support and communication channels.</p>
<p>The Agency for Welfare Strategy supports strategic overview and policy.</p>
<p>Three of the agencies, the Knowledge Agency, the Inspectorate and the Infrastructure Agency, will be operational. The Agency for Health Strategy will be given a more strategic way of working.</p>
<p>The remits of all four agencies will include successively developing work content and procedures.</p>
<p>New ways of working</p>
<p>All four agencies are to develop procedures that make it possible to use skills throughout the country.</p>
<p>It is proposed that all the agencies should develop various forms of employment and procedures that make it possible to engage staff in several places. The opportunities for decentralised ways of working provided by new technology create important conditions for modernisation.</p>
<p>The Inspectorate, at least, needs a regionalised organisation adapted to the division proposed by the Regions Inquiry . If the Knowledge Agency chooses a regional division, it should be cosited with the Inspectorate's regional organisation.</p>
<p>The head offices are to be co-sited to facilitate interaction between the agencies.</p>
<h2>Consequences for the activities of present agencies</h2>
<p>Our proposal is based on how central government could better support the future needs and challenges of health care and social services. The area of knowledge appears as a hub in this work. It is therefore the agencies that have the task of developing knowledge in various parts of health care and social services that are most affected by our proposals.</p>
<p>The agencies we propose should be phased out are: the National Board of Health and Welfare, the Medical Products Agency, the Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency, the Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care, the National Institute of Public Health, the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control, the Swedish Agency for Health and Care Services Analysis, the Swedish National Council on Medical Ethics, Handisam (the Swedish Agency for Disability Policy Coordination) and the</p>
<p>Swedish Intercountry Adoptions Authority. It is also proposed that the Swedish Institute of Assistive Technology and Apotekens Service AB be phased out. The skills and work tasks of the organisations would be transferred to the new agencies.</p>
<h2>Alternatives considered</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has considered a number of alternative organisational solutions that could respond to our fundamental ambitions and proposals.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has, among other alternatives, examined the idea of forming an Inspectorate, and IT agency and a strategic authority to allow knowledge support to remain in the present agencies. This could be done by dividing off the National Board of Health and Welfare's supervision to a new independent agency, creating a new IT agency and broadening the remit of the Swedish Agency for Health and Care Services Analysis.</p>
<p>We have also examined the idea of merging some of the present agencies which have related activities into larger units. This might, for example, mean merging the National Board of Health and Welfare and the Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care, merging the National Institute of Public Health and the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control and merging the Medical Products Agency and the Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency.</p>
<p>In addition, we have examined ways of meeting the challenges of the future without making any organisational changes at all.</p>
<p>Our assessment is that these alternatives would not be effective. We present several reasons for this assessment, but in particular we consider that the creation of integrated knowledge support is a key factor that would be lost in all these alternative solutions.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the new agencies begin work on 1 January 2014. Until the new structure is in place, the present agencies will continue to be responsible for their tasks.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers around nine months of preparation to be required from the time when the organising committees and director-generals are in place to when the new structure is established. We therefore propose that the Government submits a special Bill to the Riksdag for a decision at the beginning of 2013, to ensure introduction on 1 January 2014.</p>
<p>In a political and administrative perspective, eighteen months may be regarded as a short time, but for the sector, the agencies and the affected staff a longer implementation process could lead to uncertainty, loss of skills and loss of production.</p>
<p>As so many agencies are affected, a comprehensive responsibility for the transformation needs to be clearly designated. The Inquiry's proposal is that a joint project manager should be appointed at the Ministry. The project manager is to act as a link between the new and old agency structures and to the department.</p>
<p>The terms of reference for the organising committees should make clear the Government’s choice of location for the new agencies. The Government should, in addition, indicate in the terms of reference the form of management and the principal remit of the new agencies and task them with drawing up final suggestion for instructions and appropriation directions.</p>
<p>The phasing-out of the present agencies should be dealt with by a joint Phasing-Out Agency.</p>
<h2>Consequences and effects</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposal has consequences for the majority of the existing agencies in the sector. The proposal does not signify any changes in central government commitments, but many tasks have to be fulfilled and developed further on the basis of new conditions and ambitions.</p>
<p>The new agency structure, taken together, provides opportuni- ties for savings, both for central government and for health care and social services as a whole. It is estimated that the proposal will lead to a reduction of around 20% in the long-term costs of the central-government service providers. The saving in the central- government budget is estimated at around 15%. It is estimated that the proposal will reduce the number of full-time equivalent em- ployees by around 550.</p>
<p>The table below summarises the Inquiry’s overall assessment of the resources required by the new agencies, expressed as the sum of employees and hired-in full-time equivalents.</p>
<p>The new agencies will be mainly funded in the same way as the present-day agencies. With regard to knowledge support on phar- maceutical issues for health care and social services, it is proposed that central government should take over responsibility for funding from industry. This represents an increase in costs for central gov- ernment of around 70 full-time equivalent employees or SEK 70 million, and an equivalent decrease in costs for industry.</p>
<p>The table below shows the Inquiry’s estimate of costs to central government over the next few years, including phase-out costs:</p>
<p>Consequences for the agencies’ employees</p>
<p>Around 2 700 full-time equivalents, of whom 1 950 are women and 750 men, are affected by the proposals.</p>
<p>The Inquiry estimates that most of the employees in the present agencies will be transferred to positions in the new agencies. The new agencies must be manned in compliance with the rules con- tained in Section 6b of the Employment Protection Act (1982:80).</p>
<p>In the event of surplus numbers, the Central Government Job Se- curity Agreement will be applicable.</p>
<p>Consequences for public health work and disability issues</p>
<p>The Inquiry's proposal to integrate the work on public health is- sues and disability issues is intended to produce a greater impact, both at the overarching level of society through the Agency for Health Strategy and in practical health care and social services, through the Knowledge Agency. In addition, the responsibility of other sector authorities (as authorities for housing, transport etc.) for the integration of public health and disability-perspectives un- der their particular areas of responsibility is retained.</p>
<p>Overall, the Inquiry judges that the integration of these issues will result in a greater impact.</p>
<p>Consequences for health care and social services</p>
<p>The proposals will, in several ways, bring about simplification for patients, service users, service-providers, professions, heads of units, contractors and authorities on regional and local level.</p>
<p>The proposals will not in themselves solve the sector's prob- lems, but they mean that health care and social services can deal with a central-government that is significantly more coherent, clear and easy to cooperate with.</p>
