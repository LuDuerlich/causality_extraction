<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Inquiry on the posting of foreign workers to Sweden was tasked with reviewing lex Laval , i.e. the changes to the legislation on the posting of foreign workers to Sweden introduced on 15 April 2010 as a result of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the Laval case. The Inquiry makes a number of proposals to safeguard the Swedish labour market model and status of collective agreements in situations involving posted workers. The proposals, which the Inquiry considers to be compatible with EU law, and which are proposed to enter into force on 1 January 2017, are essentially as follows.</p>
<h2>An employer posting workers must, when requested to do so, appoint a representative who is authorised to negotiate and conclude collective agreements</h2>
<p>If requested to do so by an employees’ organisation, the employer must, within ten days, appoint a representative who is authorised to negotiate and conclude collective agreements on behalf of the employer, and notify the organisation of who has been appointed and of their contact details. The request from the employees’ organisation must state that the organisation wishes to conclude collective agreements and whether or not the organisation has members working for the employer, and include details of the minimum conditions in the sector in question and the contact details of a representative who is authorised to negotiate and conclude collective agreements on behalf of the organisation.</p>
<p>Within seven days of the deadline for appointing a representative, the employer’s representative must contact the employees’ organisation’s representative and report the employer’s stance on the request to conclude collective agreements.</p>
<p>If the employer or its representative fails to honour any of these obligations, the employer must pay damages to the employees’ organisation that made the request.</p>
<p>The damages are to include compensation for losses incurred and for the infringement committed. Damages may be reduced or cancelled if it is reasonable to do so. With regard to statutory limitation, rules corresponding to those in the Employment (Codetermination in the Workplace) Act (1976:580) should apply.</p>
<h2>Industrial action is always permitted to achieve a collective agreement for posted workers containing minimum conditions under applicable Swedish sectoral agreements</h2>
<p>The regulations on industrial action under lex Laval  will be replaced by a new regulation, to apply when a Swedish employees’ organisation wishes to take industrial action against an employer with the aim of obtaining regulation of the conditions for posted workers via a collective agreement. Such industrial action may only be taken if the conditions demanded correspond to the minimum conditions, including minimum wage, or, in the case of the hiringout of workers, the conditions, including wages, in the applicable sectoral agreement and fall within the ‘hard core’ of the Posting of Workers Directive. Industrial action is permitted regardless of whether the posted workers already have better conditions, and the conditions demanded may not prevent the application of such conditions that are more beneficial to workers. If there are several applicable central collective agreements in the sector in question, this means the conditions in whichever collective agreement offers the most beneficial conditions for an employer. Any industrial action taken in contravention of this provision is unlawful under the Employment (Co-determination in the Workplace) Act (1976:580). However, this prohibition of industrial action in cases of posted workers applies only when the employer posting workers is established within the EEA or in Switzerland, i.e. not in cases of third country postings.</p>
<p>Collective agreements that regulate the conditions for posted workers will have special legal consequences in relation to other collective agreements. However, the provisions to this effect are only to be applied to collective agreements concluded after entry into force.</p>
<p>If a collective agreement for posted workers is concluded following industrial action or notice of such action, it does not entail any obligations on the part of the employer in relation to an employees’ organisation, its union representatives or the public under any legislation other than the Posting of Workers Act.</p>
<p>Nor should such a collective agreement be taken into account when applying the provisions on the order of selection for termination of employees’ contracts due to shortage of work (redundancy) or the preferential right to re-employment under Sections 22 and 25 of the Employment Protection Act (1982:80). These restrictions do not apply in the case of third country postings.</p>
<p>The minimum conditions in a collective agreement for posted workers, whether entered into voluntarily or following industrial action, also apply to workers who are not members of the employees’ organisation that concluded the agreement. In terms of minimum conditions, this means that an employer that is bound by a collective agreement for posted workers cannot with valid effect make arrangements that conflict with the agreement with a posted worker who is not bound by it. Moreover, such a posted worker is entitled to demand these conditions of the employer. With respect to damages in the case of breaches of minimum conditions in a collective agreement for posted workers, statutory limitations and legal proceedings in cases of disputes, rules corresponding to those in the Employment (Co-determination in the Workplace) Act are to apply.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a collective agreement for posted workers, whether entered into voluntarily or following industrial action, confers supervisory powers on the contracting employees’ organisation. Any employer that is bound by a collective agreement for posted workers must, if requested to do so by the contracting employees’ organisation, submit within three weeks documentation of all employment contracts, wage specifications, timesheets and certificates of wage disbursements needed by the organisation to allow it to assess whether the collective agreement has been followed with respect to minimum conditions. The employer is also obliged, if requested to do so by a contracting employees’ organisation, to submit within three weeks a translation to Swedish of the documentation in question. These obligations apply while the worker to whom the documentation pertains is posted here in Sweden, and for four months afterwards. Any employer that breaches these obligations must pay damages to the contracting employees’ organisation for losses incurred and for the infringement committed. Damages may be reduced or cancelled if it is reasonable to do so.</p>
<p>With respect to what conditions can be demanded via industrial action, the Inquiry’s assessment is firstly that it should be possible to consider that demands for the payment of premiums for occupational injury insurance or life insurance that offer financial compensation to the employee, or their surviving relatives, where there are shortcomings in safety, health or hygiene at work, come under Article 3.1 e) of the Posting of Workers Directive.</p>
<p>The Court of Justice of the European Union has not yet ruled on whether this is the case. Secondly, the Inquiry considers that the term ‘minimum wage’ should be clarified in the Posting of Workers Act such that ‘minimum wage’ refers to the minimum wage under the collective agreement without deductions to compensate for expenses engendered by the posting.</p>
<h2>Predictable conditions for posted workers</h2>
<p>Where an employees’ organisation has not already done so, or where there are grounds to do so, the Swedish Work Environment Authority is to analyse which conditions in central collective agreements may be demanded through industrial action under the</p>
<p>Posting of Workers Act. The Authority’s assessment is not binding, but should be made public.</p>
