<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Committee of Inquiry into Legislation governing Radio and Television has been instructed to analyse and consider the need for various alterations to the Radio and Television Act (1996:844) (hereafter referred to as RTVL) and to propose the amendments occasioned by its deliberations.</p>
<p>After having addressed a number of specific issues in the reports</p>
<p>Skydd av barn mot olämpligt programinnehåll i TV (Protecting children against unsuitable contents of TV programmes)(SOU 2001:84), Reklamtid i TV (TV advertising time)(SOU 2003:62), Must carry</p>
<p>Anpassning av radio- och TV-lagen till den digitala tekniken (Adapting the Radio and Television Act to digital technology) (SOU 2005:62), the Inquiry’s final report discusses the remaining parts of its remit. The report gives an account of our deliberations on issues concerning repeated infringements of conditions relating to content, the application of licence conditions to certain transmissions, official announcements from government agencies and authorities, local noncommercial television and access to television programmes by people with disabilities. In addition, we have analysed the consequences of a Swedish accession to the European Convention on Transfrontier Television (hereafter referred to as the TV Convention), with regard to the aspects that have not been discussed in the report Adapting the Radio and Television Act to digital technology (SOU 2005:62). We also give an account of our deliberations on issues relating to television transmission to mobile reception devices and the possibility of registered religious communities obtaining licences for broadcasting community radio.</p>
<p>The remit</p>
<p>Licences are required to broadcast sound radio or television programmes using radio waves of frequencies of under 3 gigahertz. A broadcasting licence may be linked with conditions to the extent stated in Chapter 3, Sections 1–4 of the RTVL.</p>
<p>The Inquiry was instructed to propose more forceful measures when a broadcaster repeatedly and in a similar manner infringes on licence conditions concerning the contents of broadcasts.</p>
<p>In addition we were instructed to consider the application of licence conditions to programmes that a licence holder transmits in a manner that does not require a licence and also to present proposals that enable the same regulations, where appropriate, to be applied to all broadcasts from a company, irrespective of whether or not broadcasts are made in a manner requiring a licence.</p>
<p>Finally, in view of Sweden’s membership of the European Union, we were instructed to consider whether amendments should be made to the provisions on the obligation, at the request of a central government agency, to broadcast announcements of importance to the general public.</p>
<p>Deliberations and proposals</p>
<p>Licence conditions will become legislation</p>
<p>Several of the conditions that may be linked to a broadcasting licence entail limitations in the licence holder’s right to determine programme content. Some of these conditions on contents, that is, conditions on the obligation to exercise broadcasting rights objectively, conditions on taking account of the special impact of the media with regard to the subject and design of programmes, the times programmes are broadcast and conditions on programme activities respecting the private lives of individuals, have been identically prescribed in the broadcasting licences of all broadcasters falling under Swedish jurisdiction. Licences for those licence holders that are entitled to broadcast advertising have also been linked with conditions prohibiting the discrimination of advertisers. We consider that there are objective reasons for converting these conditions into direct legislation. The general design of these conditions also supports this view. In our opinion, these legal regulations should not only include transmissions undertaken under licence, but all broadcasts transmitted by means other than wire.</p>
<p>A prerequisite for enabling the obligations and prohibitions regulated in the conditions to be converted into general legal regulations is that legal regulations can be designed so as to be sufficiently clear and precise. We consider that this is the case with regard to the obligation to exercise broadcasting rights objectively, the obligation to respect the private lives of individuals and the prohibition against discrimination of advertisers. In view of this, we propose that provisions be incorporated into the RTVL prescribing that those transmitting television programmes and sound radio programmes other than community radio and local radio, by means other than wire: 1. are to exercise broadcasting rights objectively, apart from broadcasting advertisements and other commercials, 2. are to respect the private lives of individuals in programme activities, if significant public interest does not warrant otherwise, and that 3. those entitled to broadcast advertisements or other commercials are not to discriminate against advertisers.</p>
<p>The condition pertaining to the obligation to take account of the special impact of the media has a broad field of application. The significance of this condition also changes over time. We do not therefore consider it appropriate to convert the entire condition to a generally applicable legal regulation. However, we do consider it justified to detach the parts of the condition that apply to the portrayal of violence and representations of a sexual nature, and to convert these into a legal regulation. We therefore propose that the provision of Chapter 6, Section 2 of the RTVL is supplemented with an obligation for those transmitting television programmes or sound radio programmes other than community radio and local radio by means other than wire, in addition to that which applies under the current provision in Chapter 6, Section 2 of the RTVL, to observe restraint when broadcasting programmes containing portrayals of violence and representations of an advanced sexual nature. This provision is intended to be applied to such portrayals of violence and representations of a sexual nature that are regarded, under the current practice of the Broadcasting Commission, as contravening the licence conditions on the obligation to take account of the special impact of the media.</p>
<p>Sanctions for infringements of the provisions and licence conditions regulating broadcast content</p>
<p>The conditions on broadcast content that can currently be linked to a broadcasting licence can only be sanctioned by ordering that the licence holder who has disregarded the condition is to publicise a negative verdict issued by the Broadcasting Commission. We believe that this sanction should continue to be considered for individual infringements of licence conditions and the parts of the licence conditions we propose transforming into legal regulations. We also propose that the same sanction could be applied for individual infringements of the prohibition against broadcasting programmes containing detailed portrayals of violence of a realistic nature or pornographic images at times and in a manner referred to under the current Chapter 6, Section 2 of the RTVL.</p>
<p>The part of the condition on the obligation to take account of the special impact of the media aimed at the obligation to observe restraint when broadcasting programmes containing portrayals of violence or representations of an advanced sexual nature has been infringed upon on a number of occasions and in a similar manner. The injunction to publicise negative verdicts issued by the Broadcasting Commission has thus failed to restrain licence holders from continuing to contravene this condition. We believe that this situation gives cause for including an option to intervene with more forceful sanctions when the proposed regulation on the obligation to observe restraint when broadcasting programmes containing portrayals of violence or representations of an advanced sexual nature is contravened. We therefore propose that the Office of the Chancellor of Justice be given the opportunity to impose fines on those who repeatedly and in a similar manner contravene the regulation.</p>
<p>With regard to other conditions on content and the proposed legal regulations, our assessment is that a more far-reaching sanction than an injunction to publicise the Broadcasting Commission’s negative verdict should not be considered.</p>
<p>Supervision</p>
<p>According to our proposal, the Broadcasting Commission is to be entitled to prescribe that those contravening the provision of the current Chapter 6, Section 2 of the RTVL and those who disregard the proposed provision on the obligation to observe restraint when broadcasting programmes containing portrayals of violence or representations of an advanced sexual nature are to publicise the Board’s negative verdict in an appropriate manner. In view of this, we propose that the main responsibility for supervision of the provisions of Chapter 6, Section 2 of the RTVL be transferred from the Office of the Chancellor of Justice to the Broadcasting Commission. We further propose that the Board’s obligation to report when a broadcast contains portrayals of violence and pornographic images in contravention of Chapter 6, Section 2 of the RTVL be extended to include also such portrayals of violence or sexual representations as are referred to in the new provision on the obligation to observe restraint when broadcasting programmes containing portrayals of violence or representations of an advanced sexual nature.</p>
<p>The application of licence conditions to certain transmissions</p>
<p>Because of the provisions of the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression, we consider that it is not possible to prescribe that those licensed to broadcast television in the terrestrial network are to be obliged to comply with the broadcasting licence conditions even when transmitting via cable networks.</p>
<p>In addition, we consider that our proposal for certain of the obligations and prohibitions that may currently be prescribed in the licence conditions to be converted into general legal regulations and for these legal regulations to be made applicable to all transmissions taking place through means other than wire meet, at least to a certain extent, the need for the same regulations to apply to broadcasting transmitted via both the terrestrial network and satellite. In other respects we consider that there are not sufficient grounds for prescribing a general obligation for those licensed to transmit terrestrial television to comply with the conditions linked with the licence even when transmitting via satellite. However, we propose that a possibility is introduced of making a licence to transmit television via the terrestrial network conditional on the other licence conditions also applying to such supplementary transmissions via satellite that are made to fulfil an obligation prescribed in a broadcasting licence to transmit programmes throughout the country or to a certain area of the country.</p>
<p>Official announcements from government agencies and public authorities</p>
<p>Under Chapter 3, Section 2.5 of the RTVL, a broadcasting licence may be linked with conditions on the obligation to broadcast official announcements free of charge. The aim of this obligation is to allow the possibility of effectively informing or warning people concerned in an emergency situation or communicating to the general public information of benefit to society.</p>
<p>As far as the Inquiry is aware, there has never been a situation in which EU institutions and bodies have been unable to reach the Swedish people with information important to the general public by engaging Swedish authorities. We therefore do not consider that Sweden’s membership of the EU means that there is cause to amend the provision on the obligation to broadcast official announcements.</p>
<h2>Mobile television</h2>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Technological developments have meant that it is now possible to relay television broadcasts to mobile telephones and other mobile receivers. Television programmes are already being transmitted to mobile telephones in Sweden via mobile telephone networks (UMTS or 3G networks). Up until now these services primarily consist of recorded clips that begin when the viewer so requests, but there is a growing possibility of receiving live television programmes or recorded material that is retransmitted at a point in time determined by the broadcaster. In parallel with transmissions via mobile telephone networks, various systems for transmitting television programmes to mobile telephones using specially adapted round radio technologies (IP data casting, IPDC) are being developed.</p>
<p>The development of television programmes broadcast using technology that is especially intended for reception in mobile reception devices, referred to below as mobile television, gives rise to issues related to the issue of licences and regulation of the contents of these broadcasts. We have seen an obvious need for a review of regulations in this area so as not to impede development and have therefore chosen to take up this issue for discussion.</p>
<p>Deliberations and proposals</p>
<p>Points of departure</p>
<p>Mobile television differs somewhat from traditional television. The fact that the viewer can take the television receiver wherever he or she wishes means that transmissions are more easily accessible than television transmissions received by traditional television sets. On the other hand, mobile reception devices have such small screens that they cannot serve as a natural meeting point for several people in the same way as the traditional television set. There is strong evidence that those watching television on a mobile telephone or other mobile reception device will watch broadcasts for shorter periods, for example while travelling by public transport, and that to a certain extent they will therefore demand shorter programmes, in which the contents are especially adapted to temporary viewing.</p>
<p>The scope of the RTVL</p>
<p>The RTVL applies to transmissions of sound radio and television programmes targeted at the general public and intended to be received using technical aids. In accordance with what we have stated in our interim report Anpassning av radio- och TV-lagen till den digitala tekniken (Adapting the Radio and Television Act to digital technology) (SOU 2005:62), we consider that the sole fact that a transmission is received by a mobile telephone does not mean that the transmission is not a television programme. What determines the scope of the RTVL instead is whether the transmission is targeted at the general public. This is considered to be the case if the transmission is started by the broadcaster at a time decided by the latter and is targeted at everyone wishing to receive it.</p>
<p>In view of this, we consider that the RTVL covers both television transmissions sent directly to the receiver at a time determined by the broadcaster and playback of previously recorded material in which the contents have been determined by the broadcaster and where the receiver connects up to a transmission started at a point in time determined by the broadcaster (streamed programmes). However we do not consider that the Act covers programmes downloaded by the receiver and started at a point in time determined by the receiver.</p>
<p>Licence issues</p>
<p>Under the present wording of the RTVL, licences are required to transmit television programmes at frequencies of less than 3 gigahertz. Both television transmissions relayed via the mobile telephone networks and mobile television using round radio technology are relayed in the frequency area that requires a licence.</p>
<p>Unlike mobile television, which is transmitted with round radio technology a television broadcast transmitted via a mobile telephone network does not use any frequency which could otherwise be used for traditional round radio. We therefore propose that licences should not be required under the RTVL to broadcast programmes relayed by a radio transmitter that under Chapter 3, Section 9 of the Electronic Communications Act should be used for purposes other than round radio. This means that mobile television broadcasts via such radio transmitters that are to be used for mobile services will not be included in the licence obligation.</p>
<p>We consider that there may be a market for relaying mobile television using round radio technology that has been specially adapted to mobile reception. We therefore propose that when deciding on the frequencies and transmission areas to be reserved for television transmissions, the Government should be allowed to reserve special frequency space for mobile television entailing a licence obligation.</p>
<p>In order to create conditions for the greatest possible competition on the market for mobile television we consider, as opposed to our previous proposal with regard to the traditional terrestrial digital television (compare interim report Nytt regelverk för marksänd digital-TV, New regulations for terrestrial digital TV, SOU 2004:39) that the frequency space reserved by the Government for mobile television should be distributed directly among broadcasters holding transmission licences for mobile television. Transmission frequencies should thus not be placed at the disposal of an operating company, but the licence holder should be free to enter into a contract with an operator of their choice with regard to packaging and sales of the service to consumers.</p>
<p>Since transmission space in the terrestrial network is a limited resource, we suggest that a licence to transmit mobile television could be linked with conditions in the same manner and to the same extent as a licence to transmit traditional television in the terrestrial network.</p>
<p>To avoid certain programme services being exclusively restricted to some operators, thereby forcing consumers to sign agreements with several operators so as to gain access to all the programme services they desire, we propose that a broadcasting licence for mobile television could be linked with conditions on an obligation, on a nondiscriminatory basis, to offer transmissions to each operator wishing to provide a programme service to its clients. We further propose, in order to enable frequencies to be given for free television in mobile television, that a licence to transmit mobile television could be linked with conditions on the licence holder being required to offer transmissions as free television.</p>
<p>Broadcast content</p>
<p>The provisions of Chapter 6 of the RTVL on broadcast contents and of Chapter 7 of the same Act on advertising and other commercials are also applicable to television broadcasts to mobile reception devices. We consider that the different conditions for reception between mobile television and traditional television give cause to allow, to a certain extent, exemptions from the provisions of Chapters 6 and 7 of the RTVL with regard to mobile television. Our point of departure has therefore been that regulation of the contents of television broadcasting that is especially adapted to mobile reception devices does not need to be as extensive as that applying to traditional forms of television.</p>
<p>However, mobile television must comply with the requirements stipulated in the TV Directive and to enable Swedish accession to the TV Convention drawn up by the Council of Europe, it should also follow the provisions of the Convention. We consider that the regulations of the TV Directive and the TV Convention mean that all the provisions on broadcast content in Chapter 6 of the RTVL must apply to mobile television in the same way as it does to other terrestrial television.</p>
<p>Since it may be assumed that transmissions that are specially adapted for mobile television will contain a greater number of shorter television programmes, we propose that mobile television is exempted from the application of the provisions of Chapter 7, Section 6 of the RTVL on minimum total advertising time on any given occasion. We also propose that advertising in mobile television may be broadcast to the extent that the TV Directive and the TV Convention allow advertising broadcasts, i.e., of a maximum of 15 per cent of broadcasting time per 24 hours but no more than 12 minutes during one full hour.</p>
<p>We also consider that the provisions of Chapter 7 of the RTVL should also be applicable to mobile television.</p>
<h2>TV programme accessibility for people with disabilities</h2>
<p>The remit</p>
<p>According to the RTVL, conditions for licences to broadcast television programmes may involve the obligation to design the broadcast in such a manner that programmes are accessible to people with disabilities. No equivalent provision exists for television transmissions that do not require licences, i.e. transmissions via satellite or cable.</p>
<p>Conditions entailing the requirement for television programmes to be made accessible to people with disabilities are included in the broadcasting licences for SVT, UR and TV4. No such conditions exist for other broadcasters licensed to transmit terrestrial television.</p>
<p>The Inquiry was instructed to consider the need for legislative amendments to improve access to television programmes for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Deliberations and proposals</p>
<p>More stringent legislation for greater accessibility</p>
<p>With the transition from analogue to digital transmission technology, there will be greater opportunities to make television programmes accessible to people with disabilities. Digital technology enables new methods for subtitling, both directly and inserted later. Conditions for creating accessibility for viewers with sight impairments will be improved through opportunities for audio description, in which a recorded voice describes what can be seen in the image of a television programme during natural pauses in the dialogue, and voice subtitles in which the subtitle in the picture is read aloud and transmitted to the viewer in the form of a separate sound channel.</p>
<p>The greater technological opportunities to design accessible television programmes combined with the importance of people with disabilities being given the greatest possible access to programme content, means, in our opinion, that requirements should be included in the RTVL to the effect that broadcasters are to make their broadcasts accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Field of application</p>
<p>We consider that greater accessibility is such an important aim that there is cause to legislate on the obligation for all those broadcasting television, irrespective of whether or not these broadcasts are transmitted under licence and regardless of the transmission technology used, to ensure that the programmes broadcast are made accessible to people with disabilities. However we consider that the provisions of the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression mean that without constitutional amendments it is not possible to prescribe such obligations for those broadcasting television programmes via wire. Under the Inquiry’s terms of reference, our task did not include proposals for constitutional amendments. The proposals we present with regard to television programme accessibility for people with disabilities therefore include transmissions relayed by means other than wire, i.e. terrestrial and satellite transmissions. Since there are no objective reasons giving cause to exempt wire transmissions from the obligation to make television programmes accessible for people with disabilities, we believe however that there is reason to consider an amendment to the provisions of the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression on the possibility of limiting freedom of establishment for wire transmissions. This issue could be appropriately dealt with within the framework of the work of the Inquiry concerning the freedom of the press and freedom of expression (Ju 2003:04).</p>
<p>More detailed regulations</p>
<p>The provisions regulating the obligation to make television programmes accessible for people with disabilities should be flexible so that the different technical and financial situations of broadcasters can be taken into account. It should also be possible to change the requirements from time to time, partly in case of change to an individual broadcaster’s situation, but also if technical developments give cause to alter the requirements or establish new requirements. At the same time, the provisions must be so clear and distinct that it is evident to each individual or company that transmits television programmes what specific requirements he or she must fulfil.</p>
<p>We consider that clear and distinct yet still flexible regulations can be established by making the fundamental requirement on accessibility evident in the law itself, and also by instructing the Government or an agency appointed by the Government to issue more detailed provisions on the requirement. We therefore propose that a provision be introduced in the Radio and Television Act that requires those who transmit television programmes by means other than wire to design the transmissions in a manner that allows people with disabilities access to the programmes to the extent that the Government, or the agency appointed by the Government, prescribes. When determining the manner in which, and the extent to which, programmes are to be made accessible for people with disabilities, consideration is to be given to the broadcaster’s financial situation, the technical development of accessibility services in the field of television and the number of viewers who use the individual programme service.</p>
<p>Although the proposal states that it is incumbent upon the Government or the agency appointed by the Government to publish the detailed provisions concerning accessibility, the Inquiry presents a number of guidelines that we feel should serve as the basis for formulating the provisions.</p>
<p>We consider that the provisions should require broadcasters to provide a certain percentage of television programmes with subtitles, sign language interpretation, audio description and voice subtitling. In our view, the following final objectives should be prescribed:</p>
<p>In addition, further short-term targets should be announced (such as annual goals) regarding the various accessibility services.</p>
<p>The provisions should allow exemptions from the requirement, or in certain situations reduce the requirements regarding accessibility, for programme services from broadcasters whose financial situation is too limited to satisfy the requirements or whose transmissions are only seen by a small number of viewers. Technical grounds may also exist for exempting certain types of programmes from the accessibility requirements, such as audio descriptions of music programmes and pure news programmes.</p>
<p>The provisions should not contain regulations that require broadcasters to transmit programmes where the programme content is specially adapted to people with disabilities, such as news broadcasts that are adapted for people with minor learning disabilities. Instead, there should still be an opportunity for prescribing obligations of this kind in the licence conditions. We therefore consider that the current opportunity to combine broadcasting licences with conditions on the obligation to design transmissions so that they are accessible to people with disabilities should be retained.</p>
<h2>Local non-commercial television</h2>
<p>The remit</p>
<p>Chapter 8 of the RTVL contains provisions on the obligation for cable television network owners to relay certain television programmes to residents. The obligations of network owners include providing, without charge, a specifically determined frequency in each municipality for transmissions of television programmes by one or more local cable transmission undertaking. The term ‘local cable transmission undertaking’ refers to a legal person set up to operate local cable transmissions and which can be expected to allow different interests and opinion trends voice their views in the course of operations. Local cable transmission undertakings may not broadcast advertisements.</p>
<p>The remit of the Inquiry includes analysing the impact of digitalisation on non-commercial television transmissions and whether the conditions for these transmissions can be improved through legislation. The remit also includes giving consideration to the activity’s designation.</p>
<p>Deliberations and proposals</p>
<p>Adjustment to the Universal Service Directive</p>
<p>We consider that the obligation to provide frequencies for local cable transmission undertakings should be adjusted according to Article 31 of the Universal Service Directive. We therefore propose amending Chapter 8, Section 2 of the RTVL so that it applies to each individual broadcaster that owns or otherwise controls an electronic communications network used for relaying television transmissions to the general public by means of wire if at least 100 of the households connected to the network use it as their primary means of receiving television transmissions. ‘Take away obligation’</p>
<p>The requirement that network owners are to provide frequencies for transmissions from local cable transmission undertakings without charge means that the network operator may not charge a fee for the space in the network. However, the network owner is not obligated to pick up the signal for the transmissions from the local cable transmission undertaking, known as a ‘take away obligation’; instead, the costs that arise for sending the transmissions to the network owner’s distribution centre are to be paid by the local cable transmission undertaking.</p>
<p>We do not consider that a statutory ‘take away obligation’ should be introduced since regulation of this kind would have an unreasonable impact on smaller network owners and would involve a risk that the increased operating costs of the cable network resulting from a ‘take away obligation’ would ultimately be passed on to the households connected to the network.</p>
<p>Expanded transmission capacity</p>
<p>The ongoing digitalisation of the cable networks means that there will be room for more programme services in the networks. This could justify increasing the network owners’ obligation to provide frequencies for transmissions from local cable transmission undertakings to include more than one channel.</p>
<p>With few exceptions, only a limited amount of the broadcasting time that local cable transmission undertakings presently have is used to distribute programmes produced in-house in premiere broadcasts. Accordingly, there seems to be no lack of transmission capacity for those wishing to express their views and ideas in a broadcast by a local cable transmission undertaking. We therefore consider that at present it is neither imperative nor necessary to increase the network owners’ obligation to provide frequencies for transmissions from local cable transmission undertakings.</p>
<p>Networks with analogue and digital transmission technologies</p>
<p>At present, the major cable networks, at least, are entirely or partially digitalised. The cable operators that control the digitalised networks do, however, transmit television programmes with both digital and analogue technologies.</p>
<p>The provisions on the obligation to provide frequencies for transmissions of television programmes from local cable transmission undertakings contained in Chapter 8, Section 2 of the RTVL can be interpreted as a right for the broadcaster using both analogue and digital technologies for transmission to choose whether the local cable transmission undertaking is to be assigned analogue or digital transmission frequencies.</p>
<p>We consider that transmissions from local cable transmission undertakings should be able to be received by all households connected to the network in which they are broadcast. To the extent that the network owner, or the broadcaster otherwise in control of a cable network, gives households connected to the network the opportunity to receive certain programme services with analogue technology, there is, accordingly, reason to require that broadcasts from local cable transmission undertakings are included in the analogue selection. We therefore propose that those network owners that retransmit television programmes using both analogue and digital technologies are to be obligated to provide analogue frequencies for broadcasts of the local cable transmission undertakings.</p>
<p>However, we do not consider that there should be a requirement that cable transmission undertakings must be assigned digital frequencies.</p>
<p>Shared channels</p>
<p>A local cable transmission undertaking is not obliged to transmit programmes throughout the day, every day. Where a cable transmission undertaking has chosen to refrain from part of the capacity of the channel reserved for its broadcasts, it has been considered possible to let one or several commercial broadcasters use the unused space. Representatives of local cable transmission undertakings have pointed out that the shared transmission space can lead to the risk of confusion between commercial and non-commercial programme activities.</p>
<p>One of the aims of the provision on the obligation to provide frequencies in cable networks for transmissions from local cable transmission undertakings is that even those with limited financial resources must have the possibility to broadcast television programmes. We therefore do not consider it reasonable to place requirements on cable transmission undertakings to transmit a specific minimum number of hours per day or per week.</p>
<p>The lack of a requirement regarding minimum broadcasting time means that the transmission frequency reserved for the local cable transmission undertaking’s broadcasts is unused insofar as the cable company does not use it. For the network owner to be able to make efficient use of transmission frequencies in the network, we consider it reasonable that the owner be given the opportunity of allowing one or more commercial broadcasters take over the frequency that a local cable transmission undertaking does not utilise.</p>
<p>Despite the negative consequences for the local cable transmission undertaking that may ensue from a shared channel, we therefore consider that it should still be permitted for the network owner to allow commercial broadcasters to take over unused capacity.</p>
<p>The role of local television in the terrestrial network</p>
<p>Digitalisation of the terrestrial network provides scope for additional programme services. There is thus reason to consider whether part of this space should be set aside for local, non-commercial television. In our opinion, this issue should, however, be determined by the Government and the Swedish Radio and TV Authority in connection with the approval of licences. Thus, we do not consider that provisions should be included in the RTVL that entail a certain amount of space in the terrestrial network being allocated to local non-commercial television.</p>
<p>The term given to these activities</p>
<p>We propose that the term ‘local cable transmission undertaking’ be replaced by ‘local cable TV association’, as this term better reflects the fact that the legal persons operating these activities are largely non-profit associations.</p>
<h2>Licences to broadcast community radio</h2>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The term ‘community radio’ refers to local sound radio broadcasting for associations. Licences to broadcast community radio can, under Chapter 4, Section 4 of the RTVL, be given to non-profit associations linked to the broadcasting area and to parishes and associations of parishes in the Church of Sweden. However it is not possible to issue community radio licences to religious communities other than the Church of Sweden.</p>
<p>In connection with the processing of a legislative matter pertaining to more stringent demands for local connections when approving community radio licences to non-profit associations, the Council on Legislation questioned whether there were grounds for discriminating in favour of the Church of Sweden compared with other religious communities in the text of the law (Govt. Bill 2003/04:182, p. 21).</p>
<p>In the Bill presented after the statement by the Council on Legislation, the Government announced that the question of enabling registered religious communities to obtain community radio licences will be deliberated upon in due course.</p>
<p>After this question was presented to the Inquiry, we have undertaken to review it without special supplementary terms of reference.</p>
<p>Deliberations and proposals</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that there is no objective reason to discriminate in favour of the Church of Sweden compared with other religious communities with regard to the right to broadcast community radio. We therefore propose that Chapter 4, Section 4 of the RTVL be amended so that it would be possible to grant licences to broadcast community radio to all registered religious communities and registered organisational sections of registered religious communities. These concepts include both the Church of Sweden and its parishes, church associations and dioceses and other religious communities and organisational sections of religious communities that have been registered under the Act on Religious Communities.</p>
<p>For a non-profit association to obtain a licence to broadcast community radio under Chapter 4, Section 4 of the RTVL, the association must have links with the broadcasting area. We consider that the same thing should apply to registered religious communities and registered organisational sections of registered religious communities.</p>
<h2>The European Convention on Transfrontier Television</h2>
<p>The remit</p>
<p>In 1989, the Council of Europe approved the European Convention on Transfrontier Television (the Television Convention) 1 . Sweden signed the Convention in 1989 but has not yet ratified it. The Convention contains regulations for programme content in television broadcasts in general, for advertising broadcasts and for programme sponsorship.</p>
<p>The Inquiry was instructed to analyse the consequences of a Swedish accession to the Convention and to present proposals for the legislative amendments necessary for the Convention to be ratified.</p>
<p>In connection with our deliberations on certain advertising issues in the interim report Adapting the Radio and Television Act to digital technology (SOU 2005:62), we have considered the consequences of a Swedish access to the Convention’s advertising and sponsorship provisions and have presented proposals on amendments to the provisions of the RTVL concerning advertising and sponsorship that are necessary to ratify the Convention. In this report we discuss issues related to accession to the other provisions of the Convention.</p>
<p>Deliberations and proposals</p>
<p>Jurisdiction</p>
<p>The RTVL’s regulation of the television broadcasts that come under Swedish jurisdiction are based on the provisions of the Television Without Frontiers Directive (TV Directive). Like the TV Directive, the TV Convention’s regulation of the issue of jurisdiction is based on the transmitting country principle. The criteria for when a broadcaster is considered to be established in a state that has acceded to the Convention are the same as those of the Directive for establishment in an EEA state. The difference between the Convention and the Directive is that there are a number of states that have ratified or are able to ratify the Convention but are not bound by the EEA agreement and are thus not included in the provisions of the TV Directive. Furthermore, not all the provisions of the Convention</p>
<p>regarding broadcast content are completely identical with the content provisions of the Directive. We therefore propose that Chapter 1, Section 2 of the RTVL be expanded to include a provision signifying that the transmitting country principle and the establishment criteria that apply under the TV Convention are to apply with regard to issues regulated in the Convention. In order to emphasise that the TV Directive takes precedence over the TV Convention, we propose that the new provision only be applied in those cases where the applicability of the RTVL is not determined in accordance with Chapter 1, Section 2.</p>
<p>Transmissions relayed through wire</p>
<p>Television programmes transmitted or relayed in Swedish cable networks are intended to be received only in Sweden. These transmissions can therefore not be regarded as being of such a transfrontier nature as is required for the TV Convention to be applicable. We therefore consider that the fact that some of the Radio and Television Act’s provisions do not include television programmes transmitted via wire does not in itself represent an obstacle to Swedish access to the Convention.</p>
<p>General programme regulations</p>
<p>Article 7 of the TV Convention contains provisions on the content of television broadcasts. These provisions entail, inter alia, limitations in the right to broadcast programmes containing portrayals of violence, pornography or indecent representations.</p>
<p>We consider that the ‘democracy provision’ in Chapter 6, Section 1 of the RTVL, the provision in Chapter 6, Section 2 of the same Act on limitations to the right to broadcast programmes with intensive portrayals of violence of a realistic nature or with pornographic pictures and the provision of Chapter 7, Section 3 of the RTVL, prohibiting people with a prominent role in programmes dealing mainly with news or current affairs from appearing in advertisements, together with the provisions we proposed in Chapter 2, are sufficient to fulfil the provisions of Article 7 of the TV Convention.</p>
<p>The right of reply or its equivalent</p>
<p>The TV Convention prescribes in Article 8.1 that “every transmitting Party is to ensure that every natural or legal person, regardless of nationality or place of residence shall have the opportunity to exercise a right of reply or to seek other comparable legal or administrative remedies.” To sustain this right, according to Article 8.2, “the name of the programme service or of the broadcaster responsible for this programme service shall be identified in the programme itself.”</p>
<p>We consider that the provisions of Chapter 6, Section 3 of the RTVL on the right of reply and of Chapter 6, Section 9 of the same Act on the obligation to broadcast an approved designation is sufficient to fulfil the provisions of Article 8 of the TV Convention.</p>
<p>Events of major importance for society</p>
<p>Articles 9 and 9bis in the Television Convention contain provisions that regulate the transmission of events considered to be of importance for society. The provisions mean that the Standing Committee, specially set up for the Convention, is to publish a list of the events considered to be of major importance for society in any of the states that have adopted the Convention. Furthermore, it prescribes that a broadcaster that transmits television programmes and that holds the exclusive right to broadcast an event that is on the list may not exercise the right in such a way that a substantial proportion of the public in that country is deprived of the possibility of following the event on free television.</p>
<p>Chapter 6, Section 10, second paragraph of the RTVL contains provisions on events of major importance for society. To a great degree, these provisions correspond to the provisions of the TV Convention. With a view towards adapting the Radio and Television Act to the Convention, we propose that Chapter 6, Section 10, second paragraph be expanded to also include those events on the list published by the Standing Committee.</p>
<p>Proportion of European programmes</p>
<p>Article 10 of the TV Convention contains provisions on the minimum proportion of European programmes. Under the Article, each Contracting State, where practical and by appropriate means, must ensure that broadcasters within its jurisdiction reserve a majority proportion of their transmission time for European productions, excluding time appointed to news, sports events, games, advertising, teletext services and tele-shopping.</p>
<p>We consider that the regulations on European programme quotas in Chapter 6, Section 8, first and second paragraphs of the RTVL are sufficient to fulfil the requirements of the Convention.</p>
<p>Other matters</p>
<p>Under Article 19 of the Television Convention, each Contracting State is to designate one or more authorities to be responsible for certain specifically defined tasks. Among these tasks, the designated authority is to furnish information upon request regarding the broadcasters that are under the State’s jurisdiction. We consider that the tasks charged to a responsible authority can be managed by the Radio and TV Authority and the Broadcasting Commission within the framework of each of these authorities’ areas of responsibility. We propose therefore that the Radio and TV Authority and the Broadcasting Commission be appointed as the responsible authorities.</p>
<p>According to Article 24 of the TV Convention, a state is able to temporarily stop retransmission of programme services broadcast in contravention with certain of the provisions of the Convention. There is no obligation to use the opportunity to prevent retransmission; rather each individual state can choose the extent to which provisions allowing such stops are to be introduced. We consider that Swedish legislation has made full use of the opportunities for preventing retransmission in cable networks allowed by the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression. It is therefore our assessment that without a prior constitutional amendment, there is no possibility of introducing provisions that prevent retransmission of television programmes from other states that have acceded to the Convention. This does not present an obstacle for Sweden to accede to the Convention.</p>
