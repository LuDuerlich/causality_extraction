<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Committee’s terms of reference require it primarily to address the question of whether the legislation has achieved its basic purpose — that is to say, whether the use of involuntary care, coercive measures and transition to involuntary care has declined as intended and whether legal protection of the patient has been strengthened. In addition, the Committee is to analyse and evaluate the existing rules and their implementation with regard to public safety or the personal safety or physical or mental health of other persons, including the rules relating to discharge, parole and probation. The Committee is also to study the conflict which can occur, and its consequences for the individual patient, when, owing to the prosecutor’s assessment of public safety and the senior consultant’s assessment of the need for care, patients whose medical treatment is deemed to have been completed cannot be discharged. Furthermore, the Committee is to observe possible problems relating to implementation of the legislation in the broad sense, investigate ways in which the supply of information by advisory boards and health and medical services generally to supportive persons could be improved, and carry out an editorial review of the legislation, aimed at enhancing its lucidity.</p>
<p>The development of involuntary care</p>
<p>The Committee has conducted a survey of cases in all county administrative courts, with reference to all psychiatry cases decided by these courts between 4th and 22nd November 1996 inclusive. In addition, the National Board of Health and Welfare, acting on behalf of the Committee, has collected particulars of all LPT (the Compulsory Mental Care Act) placements concluded between 1st October 1996 and 31st March 1997 and has compiled an inventory of patients on parole under LPT and LRV (the Forensic Mental Care Act) on 30th September 1996.</p>
<p>The total number of psychiatry cases coming before the county administrative courts fell from 12,222 in 1993 to 11,589 in 1996. The actual decline concerns LPT cases only, whereas the number of LRV cases has increased somewhat. The survey of county administrative court cases focused on a number of specific questions, such as the questions of fact that were dealt with, the appointment or otherwise of public counsel and expert adviser, the proportion of applications allowed, the outcome of the case and the role of the prosecutor.</p>
<p>The inventories by the National Board of Health and Welfare show the number of LPT in-patients to have declined steeply since LPT came into force. Thus it was 1,933 on a given day in 1991, falling to 1,114 on a given day in 1994 and 931 on a given day in 1997. The number of LPT placements also fell steeply between 1988 and 1993, namely from 10,259 to 7,730. This, however, has been followed by a certain increase. Thus in 1996 there were 8,771 LPT placements. But the number appears to have declined somewhat during the first two quarters of 1997.</p>
<p>The number of LRV in-patients also shows something of a decline between 1991 and 1994, namely from 817 to 736. This, however, has been followed by a resurgence, and an inventory in March 1997 showed 770 LRV in-patients.</p>
<p>Effects of the new legislation — points of departure for the review</p>
<p>It is our opinion that, since the new legislation came into force, involuntary care has diminished to the extent appropriate and possible in the present situation. A further reduction is desirable per se  but is contingent on measures being taken to improve the overall quality of psychiatric care and on out-patient psychiatric care and municipal social services being given resources and possibilities for variously helping and supporting persons with mental disorders.</p>
<p>Our contacts have given us the impression that the new legislation is quite generally considered to have strengthened legal protection. This is not to say that more cannot be done to improve legal safeguards, especially in those areas where the new legislation has little effect. The legal protection of the patient must of course be a crucial consideration in the framing of coercive psychiatric legislation, but it is also important that legislation of this kind should include rules making provision for public safety. The LRV rules concerning the role of the prosecutor and the adjudication by the county administrative court of paroles and discharge for patients committed by the courts subject to special discharge assessment have, in our opinion, also resulted in additional protection for society. But, since the rules catering for public safety are liable to come into conflict with the legal protection of the patient, it is important to achieve a judicious balance between these two interests.</p>
<p>However, it is not only juridical or formal legal protection that matters. Great importance also attaches to the availability of care, the content of care and the response which the patient meets with. New rules added recently to the Health and Medical Services Act (HSL) imply greater insistence on care being provided with respect for human equality and for the dignity of the individual. Lately, the legal protection of the patient and his or her status in care have been points of growing emphasis in medical care generally. We wish to underline that these viewpoints obviously also apply to patients receiving involuntary psychiatric care. Given the vulnerable position of these patients, it is especially important that they should receive the help and support they need, in both personal and legal matters. Special attention must therefore be paid to the situation of involuntary patients in the framing of psychiatric quality systems and care programmes. Special attention should also be devoted to the situation of these patients by the National Board of Health and Welfare, acting in a supervisory capacity.</p>
<p>The placement procedure</p>
<p>Neither LPT nor LRV provides any statutory support for involuntary treatment or the use of any other coercive measures before a involuntary care order can be made. Thus personnel can only resort to coercive measures with reference to the provisions of the Penal Code concerning non-liability when an action normally constituting a crime is performed in an emergency or in self-defence. Once a detention order has been made, however, it becomes possible for personnel to intervene in order to prevent the patient from leaving the medical establishment or that part of the establishment where the patient is to be placed. On the other hand, there is no statutory definition of the measures which may be taken by personnel in order to prevent the patient from leaving the establishment.</p>
<p>We realise that coercive measures sometimes have to be taken before a placement order for involuntary care has been made. It is unsatisfactory that measures of this kind can only be taken with reference to the provisions of the Penal Code concerning exemption from criminal liability, and LPT ought therefore, in our view, to be made to include provisions permitting involuntary treatment and other coercive measures to be resorted to in acute situations occurring before a placement order has been made by an authorised physician. We therefore propose that the rules concerning restraint, isolation, intimate body search and superficial body search applicable during involuntary care also be made to apply pending a placement order, and that it be possible for decisions of this kind to be made by a physician on duty. Needless to say, this faculty must be very restrictively applied. we also propose that treatment prior to the placement order be made permissible if there is an imminent danger to the life or health of the patient. we wish to emphasise that the rules thus proposed do not imply any additional scope for the use of coercion: they merely serve to elucidate the rules at present in force.</p>
<p>It is also our opinion that the measures permissible in order to prevent the patient from leaving the precincts of the establishment should be defined as closely as possible, and we recommend the inclusion in LPT of a rule to the effect that such force may be used as is defensible in order to prevent the patient from leaving the precincts of the establishment or in order to make due provision for security in the care. This provision too is merely an elucidation and does not imply any additional scope for the use of coercion in care.</p>
<p>Care certificates can be issued by both public and private medical practitioners. Private practitioners, however, may carry out a certification examination only where possible with the patient’s informed consent, whereas a physician in public practice is entitled to take the patient in charge and to obtain police assistance if the patient does not consent to the examination.</p>
<p>It is quite common nowadays for medical authorities to conclude agreements with private care providers, whereby the latter are to be responsible for offering medical care to the population of a geographical area, e.g. by running a health centre or an out-patient psychiatric reception. At present, tasks implying the exercise of public authority may not be entrusted to private care providers. If, then, a certification examination cannot be performed with the patient’s informed consent, a private medical practitioner can enlist the aid of a physician in public practice in order to bring about an examination or obtain police assistance. We find this an unsatisfactory state of affairs, and we therefore recommend that authorised physicians who, by agreement with a medical authority, are to carry out certification examination also be empowered to order detention for certification examination and to request police assistance.</p>
<p>General prerequisites of involuntary care under LPT</p>
<p>It is above all relatives of persons with mental disorders who have stated that, in their opinion, the threshold for involuntary placement in psychiatric care is too high. In our view, however, the problems described are to a great extent connected with deficiencies in the effect given to the legislation, and we wish to recall that, in cases of explicit threats to or harassment of next-of-kin or other persons, the existing legislation already includes a special provision whereby an order can be made for involuntary placement.</p>
<p>As regards the term “serious mental disorder“, there do not, where LPT is concerned, appear to be any direct problems of implementation connected with the technical construction of this legal concept, and so there is no reason why a new pathological term should be introduced.</p>
<p>As regards the expression “admitted to a medical establishment for whole-day care“, one finds that a different term, namely “qualified 24hour psychiatric care“, is employed in the Medical Care (Financial Liability of Municipal Authorities) Act. It is important that legislation should as far as possible employ uniform terminology for identical matters. For this and other reasons, it is our opinion that the term “qualified 24-hour care“ should also be employed in LPT.</p>
<p>The criterion that involuntary care may only be provided if the patient opposes the care or is manifestly incapable of expressing an informed standpoint in the matter has proved to entail problems of legal implementation. It is above all the question of when the patient can be deemed manifestly incapable of expressing an informed standpoint that causes problems, especially in cases where the patient’s attitude to the care is ambivalent.</p>
<p>Thus the existing provision refers to the patient’s condition and means that, in particularly severe pathological states, the patient’s wishes can be disregarded. One may ask whether such a gradation of patients in the assessment of consent is necessary and appropriate. The most important thing is for the patient to receive the necessary care, and whether the patient’s consent at the time of assessment means that such care can be provided. We therefore recommend framing the rule of consent in such a way that involuntary care may be provided if the patient opposes the care or if, as a consequence of his mental state, care presumably cannot be provided with his consent.</p>
<p>Transition from voluntary to involuntary care</p>
<p>The question of transition from voluntary to involuntary care, has been and remains much debated. With the passing of LPT, a danger requisite was introduced as a precondition for transition being permissible. Thus, over and above the other prerequisites of involuntary care, transition is conditional on the patient, as a consequence of his mental disorder, being liable to inflict serious injury on himself or another person. No care certificate is issued in connection with transition to involuntary care, which accordingly is not subject to assessment by two physicians, though on the other hand the senior consultant must apply to the county administrative court within four days for permission for involuntary care to continue.</p>
<p>The new danger requisite has not entailed any significant decline in the number of transitions, and it is found difficult to apply. There has been criticism both of the faculty of transition as such and of the restriction on the scope for transition which the danger requisite implies.</p>
<p>There are strong arguments both for and against transition to involuntary care. As an objection to transition one can argue that it is wrong, in terms of principle. for a subsequent involuntary care order to be possible in the case of a person who has requested voluntary care. Then again, the prospect of voluntary care being made involuntary may deter people with mental disorders from seeking help, for fear of being subjected to involuntary care later on. On the other hand it is unsatisfactory, from a humanitarian viewpoint, when a voluntary patient who is severely ill and meets the general criteria for involuntary care has to be discharged and in this way perhaps deprived of all care. If transition is an option, this can also facilitate the handling of placement decisions in cases where, owing to the patient’s hesitancy, it is doubtful whether he is willing to receive necessary care. Failing the possibility of transition in cases of this kind, involuntary care is liable to be ordered right from the beginning, to be on the safe side, instead of first investigating the possibility of care being provided on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>Most considerations, in our view, argue in favour of transition as an option. But a transition provision must guarantee a high standard of legal protection. The existing statutory rule, laying down a danger requisite in order for transition to be permissible, has been found wanting, and the existing rules are therefore in need of amendment.</p>
<p>One way of strengthening legal protection and preventing abuse is for the decision-making process itself to be hedged about with stronger guarantees of legal protection than at present. This can be done by introducing examination by two physicians and tightening up the requirement of adjudication by a court of law. we therefore recommend that the special danger requisite be abolished and that the possibility be introduced of issuing a care certificate at the medical establishment. The care certificate should be promptly examined by the senior consultant, whereupon the placement order shall be submitted, not later than the following day, to the county administrative court for adjudication. If the senior consultant finds cause for continuing involuntary care, he shall file an application to this end with the county administrative court within four days. In that the order has to be submitted immediately for adjudication by the county administrative court, all transitions from voluntary to involuntary care will be made subject to judicial appraisal.</p>
<p>Supportive person</p>
<p>Patients who come to be considered for involuntary psychiatric care are in a highly vulnerable position and often bereft of viable social networks, and so it is very important that they should have access to a supportive person — a “supportive person“ — who can assist them in their everyday contacts with the world outside the hospital. Thus it is essential for the patient to be offered the services of a supportive person.</p>
<p>The latest follow-up by the National Board of Health and Welfare of concluded cases shows that supportive persons are still only being appointed for a limited proportion of persons placed in involuntary care. The number of patients not offered supportive persons has declined considerably since the Board’s previous evaluation, but there are still very few patients in involuntary care for whom supportive persons are appointed. This may be partly due to many patients being placed in care for such a short time that they see no point in having a supportive person or time does not permit a supportive person to be appointed for them, but the available material shows the number of involuntary patients receiving supportive persons to be so small as to suggest that the opportunity is not given to all patients who would like to have it.</p>
<p>We therefore propose that the information supplied to senior consultants concerning the patient’s entitlement to a supportive person be intensified through the agency of the National Board of Health and Welfare. In our contacts with the advisory boards we have found their routines for the appointment of supportive persons to vary, and we therefore recommend that the advisory boards be informed, through the Federation of County Councils, of the importance of co-ordinating their routines in this respect. In his report, as part of his duty of notifying the advisory board, the senior consultant shall also indicate the patient’s attitude in the matter of appointing a supportive person. The patient’s attitude shall also be entered in his medical record. If it has not been possible for the patient’s attitude to be stated in the report to the advisory board, the latter shall contact the patient or his representative to inquire concerning the patient’s attitude.</p>
<p>We also recommend that it be made possible for the appointment of supportive person to continue for a month after the patient has been discharged, after which, though subject to the consent of patient and supportive person, the advisory board shall be duty bound to inform the social services. The social services, acting in consultation with the patient and supportive person, shall then decide whether the supportive person is to be appointed as representative.</p>
<p>The supportive person shall retain his appointment after care in the medical establishment has given way to the kind of out-patient care on special conditions which we propose in Chap. 11.</p>
<p>We further propose that LRV be made to include a provision to the effect that, where special considerations of the supportive person’s safety so demand, the senior consultant shall disclose necessary information to the supportive person or the advisory board.</p>
<p>Treatment during involuntary care</p>
<p>Various follow-ups have revealed shortcomings in the planning of treatment in connection with involuntary psychiatric care. A treatment plan is not always drawn up as prescribed in LPT. There are also serious shortcomings with regard to both the quality and the documentation of treatment planning.</p>
<p>That which is now termed a treatment plan ought in our opinion to contain not only purely medical treatment measures but also measures which include nursing and measures by social services. We therefore recommend that the term “care plan“ be substituted for “treatment plan“. In view of the present shortcomings, we propose that the purpose of the care plan should be made clear in LPT and LRV. It should be stipulated that a care plan is to be drawn up, showing the treatment and other measures judged necessary in order for the purpose of involuntary care to be achieved and in order for the patient to be capable of living in the community after the involuntary care is concluded. It should also be stipulated that a care plan is to be recurrently reappraised and when necessary revised.</p>
<p>The legislation ought in our opinion to include certain basic requirements concerning the content of a care plan. Exact requirements, on the other hand, are by nature unamenable to statutory regulation, and should therefore be defined by means of an Ordinance or official regulations instead.</p>
<p>The follow-up by the National Board of Health and Welfare of placements concluded in 1996 and 1997 shows the use of coercive measures to have increased in connection with care pursuant to LPT. Above all, it is involuntary medication that is being used in a greater proportion of cases. It is hard to tell, however, whether these figures point to an actual growth in the use of coercive measures or whether the increase is due to differing views in psychiatry concerning what is to be reported as involuntary medication. The increase can also be put down to differing cultures, attitudes and approaches in psychiatry concerning the use of coercive measures, but there is also much to suggest that resource deployment, organisational and other conditions in medical care generally are of importance.</p>
<p>We see no cause for a statutory proposal entirely prohibiting any particular form of treatment, and it is difficult to achieve a more precise statutory definition of the occasions when different coercive measures may be resorted to. On the other hand, we do feel that a general provision should be enacted whereby — coercive measures may be used only if the patient cannot be induced, through individualised information, to participate of his own free will, — coercive measures may not be used to a greater extent than is necessary in order to render the patient capable of voluntarily participating in the requisite care and of receiving the support which he needs, — the use of coercive measures shall be reasonable in proportion to what should be achieved through the measure taken, — less intrusive measures are to be employed if sufficient, and — coercive measures shall be exercised as gently as possible and with the greatest possible consideration towards the patient, so that he will not be subjected to any unnecessary infringement of his dignity and privacy.</p>
<p>We also feel that there is cause for medical authorities to carry out an internal audits of psychiatric activity and, on the basis of these audits, to take measures of qualitative improvement aimed at counteracting the use of involuntary care and reducing the use of coercive measures. Among other things, the medical authorities should ensure that the activities concerned have the personnel necessary for the provision of good care to be possible, and that the activities have in-built quality management systems of such a kind that the care is of the highest possible quality and that legal safeguards and public safety are duly provided for. We are further of the opinion that the medical authorities should ensure that the care of persons with serious mental disorders receives the highest priority.</p>
<p>The National Board of Health and Welfare should lay down national guidelines for equivalent, scientifically based care of persons with serious mental disorders and should actively promote the introduction of quality management systems for the effective self-control and development of coercive psychiatric care activities.</p>
<p>Parole — out-patient care on special conditions</p>
<p>Parole for the residue of placement time is a phenomenon specific to involuntary psychiatric care. It does not occur in any other form of health care or medical treatment. The possibility of this kind of parole has been introduced in order to ease the transition from involuntary care to care on a voluntary basis. The provision concerning parole for the residue of placement time, however, does not tally well with the provisions indicating the conditions which have to be met in order for involuntary care to be permissible. This is especially the case with LPT, where one of the requirements for involuntary care is for the patient to be in absolute need of psychiatric care which cannot be provided in any other way except by placement in a medical establishment for 24-hour care.</p>
<p>Particulars we have obtained concerning the use of parole in care under LPT and LRV show that it is used to a very great extent. But the number of persons on parole in 1996 is only a fraction of the number provisionally discharged from care under LSPV (the Compulsory Mental care (Certain Cases) Act) in 1988. The inventory showed, however, that 13 per cent (43 patients) of the LPT patients on parole were paroled for over a year and that 12 were paroled for over three years. Of the LRV patients subject to special discharge assessment and on parole, 34 per cent (84 patients) were paroled for more than a year.</p>
<p>Thus parole under LPT and LRV has also come to be used to a greater extent or for longer than ought to be the case and in this way has also come to serve other purposes than that of preparing for a transition to voluntary care. At the same time we feel it is necessary for the law to provide the opportunity of a longer or shorter period of follow-up after care in a medical establishment has been concluded especially where LRV patients are concerned. Given this background, a review of the provisions concerning parole is called for.</p>
<p>We therefore recommend that the possibility of parole during the residue of the placement period be abolished. Parole during involuntary care should be used in the same way as in other in-patient health care or medical treatment, i.e. it should be given for a particular occasion and for a fixed term. It is our opinion that a new form of involuntary care, namely out-patient care on special conditions, should be introduced for patients in need of prolonged follow-up after their care in a medical establishment has been concluded.</p>
<p>A transfer to out-patient care on special conditions means the replacement of hospital-based care with care in the patient’s own home or elsewhere away from the medical establishment. In the case of patients receiving care under LPT, we assume that out-patient care on special conditions will come into question in exceptional cases only. This also applies to LRV patients who are being cared for without special discharge assessment. In the case of LRV patients with special discharge assessment, on the other hand, the normal practice should be for hospital-based care to be replaced with a period of out-patient care on special conditions. LRV patients not committed by a court for forensic psychiatric care do not come under the rules of out-patient care. The conditions which may come into question should concern care and treatment, housing, occupation, prohibition of intoxicants etc. Even though involuntary measures will not be permissible during out-patient care, the introduction of the possibility of such care presupposes careful consideration, having regard to the infringement which the conditions imply of constitutional rights and liberties. Orders for out-patient care on special conditions should therefore be made by the county administrative court, so as to strengthen the legal protection of the patient.</p>
<p>In order for out-patient care to serve a real purpose, careful planning and investigation are necessary concerning the measures which the patient needs in out-patient care and the conditions which have to be made. This requires the municipalities to play an active part, providing measures under the Social Services Act (SoL) and LSS (the Support and Services (Certain Functionally Impaired Categories) Act). Co-ordinated planning and follow-up of measures taken by the county council and municipality must be insisted on. To this end, the agencies concerned shall draw up a co-ordinated care plan. A special investigation shall be carried out to assess the risk of recidivism and the measures required for public safety.</p>
<p>We recommend that the county administrative court be empowered to make orders for out-patient care on special conditions for LPT patients when the following requirements are satisfied. 1. The patient is still suffering from a serious mental disorder. 2. The patient is in continuing need of psychiatric care which can be provided by other means that that of placement in a medical establishment and, having regard to the patient’s mental condition, his personal circumstances generally or the personal safety or physical or mental health of another, it is necessary that he comply with special conditions with regard to care and treatment, housing, occupation or other measures, and 3. The care and support which the patient needs cannot be accomplished with his informed consent.</p>
<p>In the case of patients receiving forensic psychiatric care by court order, the county administrative court may, when the care is provided without special discharge assessment, make an order for out-patient care on special conditions on the same terms as for patients receiving care under LPT. No special assessment concerning the existence of informed consent is of course necessary in the case of patients serving custodial sentences.</p>
<p>In the case of patients receiving forensic psychiatric care subject to special discharge assessment, partly different conditions have to apply, out of consideration for public safety. In cases of this kind it is sufficient for the patient still to be suffering from a mental disorder. It also has to be considered whether the patient must be placed in a medical establishment in view of the risk of a relapse into serious crime. An outpatient care order should only be possible when this is not the case. As regards the patient’s need of care, the same rules shall apply as to other LRV patients. Special conditions shall also be prescribable in order to provide for public safety. It is important for the patient’s criminal proclivity to be taken into consideration during the investigation which has to be carried out before out-patient care on special conditions can be ordered.</p>
<p>An order for out-patient care on special conditions shall apply for six months from the assessment date. It should be possible for out-patient care to be prolonged for six months at a time if the preconditions for it are still satisfied. Special requirements shall apply to applications for the prolongation of care. When the preconditions no longer exist, the care shall be discontinued. These provisions shall apply to out-patient care under both LPT and LRV.</p>
<p>Re-admission to a medical establishment for care may come into question when the psychiatric care which the patient needs can no longer be provided on an out-patient basis. In the case of patients receiving care pursuant to LPT, re-admission shall be possible if the patient’s mental condition and personal circumstances generally have changed in such a way that the preconditions for care in a medical establishment exist. The senior consultant may then order re-admission. No care certificate need be issued, but the senior consultant shall apply to the county administrative court without delay, and not more than four days after making the order, for consent to continuing care in a medical establishment.</p>
<p>A patient receiving forensic psychiatric care without special discharge assessment may be re-admitted to a medical establishment when his condition and personal circumstances generally have changed in such a way that the psychiatric care he needs can no longer be provided outside the medical establishment. In the case of patients receiving care with special discharge assessment, re-admission shall  take place when the above stated conditions are satisfied. Re-admission, however, shall  also take place if the patient does not observe the conditions which apply and this means that his placement in a medical establishment is justified by the risk of a relapse into serious crime. The same rules of procedure shall apply as for patients receiving care pursuant to LPT. A prosecutor shall, however, have the possibility of applying to the county administrative court for the re-admission of patients undergoing forensic psychiatric care with special discharge assessment.</p>
<p>We also propose certain changes with regard to probation and parole for inmates of prisons etc. who are receiving care under LRV. Thus we propose that permission for patients confined in prison and receiving forensic psychiatric care to leave the precincts of the medical establishment be decided by the National Prison and Probation Administration, even if the prisoner will then be accompanied by personnel. We further propose that decisions concerning probation for these patients be made by the National Prison and Probation</p>
<p>Administration, and that persons remanded in custody and undergoing forensic psychiatric care be able to obtain temporary permission, in exceptional cases, to leave the precincts of the medical establishment.</p>
<p>Termination of LRV care</p>
<p>In the course of our work we have encountered some criticism of the rules governing the termination of forensic psychiatric care with special discharge assessment, mainly on the grounds that psychiatric services are having to assume greater responsibility than is justifiable for public safety and that the rules of discharge in these cases are resulting in patients being detained in psychiatric establishments without really being in need of care. Studying the case law, one finds that often the reason why a patient cannot be discharged is that the court deems there to be a continuing risk of the patient, due to the disorder which prompted the special discharge assessment order, relapsing into serious crime. Another common reason why the patient cannot be discharged is that the patient’s personal circumstances, e.g. with regard to housing, have not been settled in such a way as for discharge to be possible. In cases of this kind, certain municipalities have argued, with reference to a statement in the travaux préparatoires  of the Financial Liability Act, that they are not liable for payment for as long as the patient is undergoing forensic psychiatric care.</p>
<p>By proposing out-patient care on special conditions, with the stipulation of coherent, co-ordinated planning of care by county councils and municipalities, we expect some of the problems now existing to be eliminated. When a patient has been transferred to out-patient care on special conditions and, accordingly, is no longer receiving care in a medical establishment, the municipalities, as we see it, are liable to pay for the measures which are required during out-patient care. The coordinated planning of care also requires the municipalities to be involved in preparations for transfer to out-patient care.</p>
<p>In order for a patient referred to forensic psychiatric care with special discharge assessment to be detained in care, it is not necessary for him to have a serious mental disorder: the existence of a mental disorder is sufficient. We have considered whether the rules concerning the termination of forensic psychiatric care with special discharge assessment could be amended in such a way that the care shall end as soon as the patient is no longer suffering from a serious mental disorder, but we have come to a conclusion that a change of this kind is not feasible at present. Most of the patients who can be detained under the current rules of LRV but, as the critics maintain, ought to be discharged are patients with personality disorders, often of a serious nature, who at the time of committing the crime had, for example, an impulse irruption of a psychotic nature but, after a time, retain only their personality disorder. Often these are patients who have committed serious crimes and in serious danger of recidivism. Very often the risk of recidivism is greater for these patients than for those suffering from a serious mental disorder. No other form of involuntary care exists at present for these patients, and so the requirement that provision be possible for public safety precludes any change at present.</p>
<p>The existing legislation further requires that the mental disorder which prompted the special discharge assessment order no longer pose any risk of the patient relapsing into serious crime. Thus the risk required here has not in any way been qualified.</p>
<p>It should not, in our opinion, be the case that the slightest risk of recidivism can mean the patient being detained in a medical establishment for a long time. Nor, probably, was this the legislator’s original intention. In practice, though, a fairly negligible risk has in certain cases been taken to justify a patient’s detention in forensic psychiatric care. We have therefore considered the possibility, one way or another, of qualifying the risk which should be required, but we have decided against proposing any amendment on this point, partly because the rules of the Penal Code, concerning when a person shall be committed to forensic psychiatric care with special discharge assessment, only employ the term “risk“.</p>
<p>However, by now proposing two forms of forensic psychiatric care, namely care of this kind in a medical establishment and out-patient care on special conditions, we open up the possibility of differentiating the recidivism risk according to the need for care. Thus a patient should not be detained in a medical establishment if the risk of recidivism can be counteracted through various measures in out-patient care. This assessment should not be based on a forensic gradation of the risk of recidivism but should be made in the light of various material concrete factors, e.g. previous criminal records, substance abuse problems or other social problems and the result of the care.</p>
<p>Enforcement of deportation orders concerning persons receiving care under LRV with special discharge assessment</p>
<p>As the law now stands, if a refusal of entry, deportation or extradition order has been made concerning a person receiving care pursuant to LRV, the involuntary care shall cease if a request to this end is made by the authority which is to enforce the order and the senior consultant finds that the patients condition allows the order to be enforced. Thus it is the senior consultant, not the county administrative court, who decides that care is to be discontinued in cases of this kind.</p>
<p>We have discussed whether the present handling procedure should be altered, but have come to the conclusion that it should not. We propose, however, that the law be more distinctly phrased, so as to make clear that the involuntary care is not to end before the deportation has been effected. We further propose the introduction of a duty to inform the embassy or consulate of the patient’s country of origin that the patient will be deported to that country.</p>
<p>Procedural questions</p>
<p>We do not propose any alteration to the composition of county administrative courts in psychiatry cases, but we feel that the stipulation of expert participation by a medical adviser should be made stricter. In our opinion, a medical adviser shall be appointed except where unnecessary. This means that, contrary to the present state of the law, a presumption will be introduced in favour of a medical adviser being appointed.</p>
<p>Obligatory “bipartite“ proceedings were introduced in the common administrative courts on 1st May 1996. Exceptions are made to this practice, however, for LPT and LRV, in that the senior consultant may not appeal against the court’s decision. There is, in our view, no longer any reason why the senior consultant should not be entitled to appeal against the court’s decision.</p>
<p>A case brought before a county administrative court shall be heard within eight days of the day on which the court received the application or writing with the appeal. The county administrative court may prolong this period if further investigation is needed or if any other special circumstance makes a prolongation necessary. This rule has caused problems, especially in LRV cases when a prosecutor has to testify. We therefore propose that the time within which a county administrative court must hear a case be extended to 15 days for cases involving patients committed for LRV care with special discharge assessment. Otherwise no alteration is proposed.</p>
<p>In addition we propose certain elucidations regarding the duty of prosecutors to give notice that the court’s decision may come to be appealed.</p>
<p>We further propose that parole decisions made by the National Prison and Probation Administration concerning prisoners receiving forensic psychiatric care be contestable by appeal to a common administrative court, i.e. in the first instance to a county administrative court, and that appeals to an administrative court of appeal be made subject to the grant of a review dispensation.</p>
