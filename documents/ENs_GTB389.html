<p>Remit</p>
<p>The Inquiry has been instructed to submit proposals on the formulation of regulations to allow trade union organisations bound by collective agreements to effectively monitor compliance with collective agreements entered into, even when the organisation has no members at a workplace. The work of the Inquiry has primarily involved consideration of amendments to the Employment (Co- determination in the Workplace) Act (1976:580).</p>
<p>Proposals of the Inquiry</p>
<p>The remit includes creating the possibility of reviewing compliance with collective agreements also at workplaces where the employee organisation bound by collective agreement has no members. In order to be able to establish such rules the Inquiry has first endeavoured to survey the need for extended monitoring of collective agreements. This survey has shown that it is doubtful whether the existing problems as regards deficient compliance with collective agreements are sufficiently great to justify regulation of the matter through legislation. During the course of the inquiry, arrangements have been signed between the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise and the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (LO), and between the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise and the Federation of Salaried Employees in Industry and Services (PTK), which to a certain extent are intended to regulate the issue covered by this Inquiry’s remit. 1  This does not, of course, make the need for legislation greater, even though the impact that the arrangements made will have is at present somewhat unclear. The Inquiry notes therefore that it is highly</p>
<p>doubtful as to whether there is any need at present to further regulate the matter through legislation.</p>
<p>Regardless of the need, the Inquiry has been instructed to present a proposal on the formulation of regulations to allow trade union organisations bound by collective agreements to effectively monitor compliance with collective agreements entered into, even when the organisation has no members at a workplace. In the opinion of the Inquiry, such monitoring can be enabled by means of the employer, at a written request by the employee organisation bound by collective agreement, being enjoined to submit to the organisation the information required to enable the employee organisation to ensure that the employer is fulfilling its obligations in matters concerning the provisions of the collective agreement on pay and terms of employment. The employer must, however, only be obliged to submit information if there is reason to believe that the current collective agreement is not being followed. In its written request for information, the employee organisation must state the reason for suspecting that the collective agreement is not being followed and specify what information and which documents it considers to be necessary to be able to carry out the monitoring.</p>
<p>The employer’s obligation to provide information should, in the opinion of the Inquiry, be prescribed in law, suitably in association with Section 19 of the Employment (Co-determination in the Workplace) Act, and be applicable to both the private and public sectors. Furthermore, the right of employee organisations to information should apply to both non-organised and minority organised employees and, where called for, it should be possible for employee organisations bound by collective agreement to obtain data on individual employees’ salaries.</p>
<p>The right to transparency of information should not be limited to workplaces where an employee organisation bound by collective agreement has no members at all. Such a regulation could easily be circumvented by having one employee at the workplace join the employee organisation bound by collective agreement, thus eliminating the new transparency rule. In addition, a regulation only including workplaces where the trade union has no members could be perceived as discriminatory. Instead employee organisations bound by collective agreement should have the right to transparency of information at all workplaces where their collective agreement is applicable, though only on condition that there are reasonable grounds to assume that the employer is not following the agreement.</p>
<p>Accordingly, under these circumstances the employer, on written application from the employee organisation bound by collective agreement, should be obliged to provide the information needed by the employee organisation to verify compliance. It should be possible to depart from the transparency rule proposed by the Inquiry by means of regulation in a collective agreement.</p>
<p>At present, under Section 10 of the Employment (Co- determination in the Workplace) Act there is no right to negotiation for employee organisations bound by collective agreement unless the matter to be dealt with concerns a member of the union who is or has been an employee of the employer. In the opinion of the Inquiry it is important to maintain the tradition of the Swedish labour market that negotiations are held in disputes over rights before the parties delegate the dispute to a third party for settlement. If a dispute arises concerning the transparency of information proposed by the Inquiry, or concerning the application of the collective agreement, these disputes should, thus, first and foremost be settled through negotiations between the parties. The employee organisation bound by collective agreement should therefore, in matters concerning the provisions of the collective agreement on pay and terms of employment, have the right to negotiate with the employer or employer organisation also with regard to employees of the employer who are not members of the employee organisation bound by collective agreement. In order to provide the employee organisations with this negotiation possibility, Section 10 of the Employment (Co-determination in the Workplace) Act should incorporate provisions giving employee organisations bound by collective agreement a statutory right of negotiation to monitor compliance with the collective agreement also in respect of employees who are not members of the organisation. In the opinion of the Inquiry, prescribing a legal right to levy a charge for the work of monitoring compliance is not justified in view of the fact that both the employee organisation and the employer may incur extra work due to the proposed regulation.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit also includes consideration of the rules concerning confidentiality of the information provided by the employer. In the opinion of the Inquiry the legal provisions should apply to both the private and the public sector. In the private sector the rules concerning duty of confidentiality in Sections 21 and 22 of the Employment (Co-determination in the Workplace) Acts should be applicable. Secrecy in the public sector is regulated by the</p>
<p>Secrecy Act, which has precedence over the Employment (Co- determination in the Workplace) Act. Consequently, the secrecy at employers that are government authorities must follow these rules. In this context it should be borne in mind that the provisions of Chapter 14, Section 7 of the Secrecy Act provide that secrecy under Chapter 6, Sections 1–5, 7 and 8, Chapter 7, Sections 8, 10 and 11 and Chapter 8, Sections 2 and 8–10, shall not hinder any authority from fulfilling an obligation laid down by law to communicate information to a representative of an employee organisation or to a safety representative. This section will be applicable to the regulations proposed by the Inquiry. The proposed bill should include clarifications as to what confidentiality obligations apply in the same way as has been done in Section 12 of the Act concerning Equality between Men and Women (1991:433).</p>
<p>In the summary above the Inquiry has stated that for monitoring compliance the employee organisation should be able to obtain information about individual employees’ salaries. This should only be possible if a total figure for wages and salaries is not sufficient. The question of what information is necessary must be assessed case by case.</p>
<p>When assessing whether the employee organisation should be entitled to information on so-called individual salaries the Inquiry has balanced the integrity of the individual employee against the purpose of the proposed regulation. The purpose of the Inquiry’s proposal is first and foremost to combat distorting wage competition. Such competition could lead to a general deterioration in working conditions in the Swedish labour market and contribute to increased unemployment and elimination of Swedish companies. The proposed regulation and consequent right to transparency of information may further play an important part in upholding the strong position of collective agreements in the Swedish labour market. Hence there are strong reasons for allowing the employee organisations where necessary the right to obtain information on individual employees’ salaries. In the opinion of the Inquiry these reasons are such that they should be given precedence over the employee’s right to integrity. The proposed regulation would also seem to be compatible with the rules of the European Convention as well as with Sweden’s other international obligations.</p>
