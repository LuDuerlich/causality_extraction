<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Common regional boundaries for agencies</h2>
<p>The following agencies are of such importance to regional cooperation that they should have coordinated geographical boundaries:</p>
<p>• The Swedish Public Employment Service</p>
<p>• The Swedish Armed Forces</p>
<p>• The Swedish Migration Agency</p>
<p>• The Swedish Police</p>
<p>• The Swedish ESF Council (for the national social fund programme)</p>
<p>• The Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth (for the administration of the regional structural fund programmes)</p>
<p>• The Swedish Transport Administration.</p>
<p>In turn, these agencies have strong links with additional agencies that have regional boundaries. Based on the objective to have cohesive and effective state administration, we therefore propose that the following agencies also should have coordinated regional boundaries:</p>
<p>• The Swedish Prison and Probation Service</p>
<p>• The Swedish Security Service</p>
<p>• The Swedish Prosecution Authority.</p>
<p>Advantages of coordinated boundaries</p>
<p>The objective of Swedish administration policy is innovative and cohesive state administration that is legally secure and effective, has advanced quality, service and accessibility and hence contributes to the development of Sweden and effective EU work.</p>
<p>A number of prior inquiries regarding administration policy have determined that a problem in terms of cohesive state administration is that the regional boundaries vary between different agencies. We agree that this is not appropriate. In our view, coordinated regional boundaries could present – better clarity in state administration, and improved conditions for  sector-wide cooperation, – facilitation of contacts between representatives of different operations, – simplification of priority coordination and cohesive action, – facilitation of contacts between county councils/municipalities and the state, and opportunities for reaching consensus between the state and municipal level, and – facilitation of the possibilities of the Government to govern and perform  follow-up from an overarching and geographical perspective.</p>
<p>More effective and cohesive state administration is beneficial to individual citizens, industry and civil society alike.</p>
<p>At the same time, we wish to emphasise that the geographical asymmetry in state administration is only one of several obstacles to effective cooperation.</p>
<p>Our opinion is however that coordinating regional boundaries is an initial step towards a more cohesive state at the regional level. It improves conditions for the right functions to find each other, and for decision-making levels to match each other. Furthermore, coordinated geographical boundaries create a clearer regional structure within which tasks that require coordination between multiple entities can be managed, when the county level is not considered appropriate. Common regional boundaries also enable preparing, as part of a coordinated geographical structure, agency-wide status reports in various matters, which could provide a basis for deciding on joint strategic measures.</p>
<p>Relevant agencies</p>
<p>In the selection of agencies that ought to have common boundaries, we have proceeded on the basis of national government agencies that already have operations that are fully or partially grouped into regional areas, and which have not-insignificant cooperation either with other agencies or with county councils and municipalities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, relevant agencies should have a strategic or promotive function that could be meaningful to planning capacity at the regional level, or have strong connections with other such agencies. For this reason, we have exempted agencies with purely controlling tasks. Finally, we have also exempted certain authorities with a regional organisation that is currently subject to a separate inquiry, such as a number of education agencies.</p>
<p>In order to identify the agencies which, based on these fundamentals, are relevant in terms of having coordinated boundaries, we have queried county councils, regional associations and county administrative boards, and also met with a great number of agencies, representatives of the municipal sector and representatives of civil society. We have identified certain operational sections where the need for coordinated regional boundaries is particularly strong; these being contingency planning and total defence, regional development work and reception of newly arrived immigrants. There are of course additional operational sections with a need for coordination, in which coordinated boundaries would facilitate the situation, for example physical planning, infrastructure, energy transition to fulfil the climate targets, work related to environmental targets, and the supply of skills.</p>
<p>Contingency planning and total defence are activities that involve a great number of entities at the local and regional level, including government agencies as well as the municipal sector and other entities in society. It is crucial that the work is conducted in a coordinated manner and that there are developed structures in place that can be implemented quickly in a crisis situation. Civil defence within total defence should, as far as possible, be based on the processes and structures used within contingency planning.</p>
<p>Likewise, regional development is an area that involves numerous agencies, and in which there is a great need for the ability to meet a coordinated state at the regional level. Regional development responsibility includes a responsibility for the county’s strategic development, and covers adopting a strategy for development in the county, deciding on funds for regional growth efforts, and establishing county plans for transportation infrastructure. It is also incumbent upon those responsible for regional development to prepare regional skills platforms. In addition to these duties, all county councils are responsible for a number of other tasks linked to regional development such as public transport and regional cultural operations. In its proposal for an action plan, the Agenda 2030 delegation proposes that those responsible for regional development also be given responsibility for coordinating efforts at the regional level with global sustainable development targets.</p>
<p>The refugee situation in 2015 clearly demonstrated a great need for advanced coordination, not least between the numerous state and municipal entities involved in the reception of asylum seekers and newly arrived immigrants. In recent decades, the responsibility for receiving asylum seekers and newly arrived immigrants has varied between different entities. One sign of the need for cooperation is that there is a specific coordination delegation consisting of a number of agencies that deal with national and strategic issues in the area.</p>
<p>Based thereon, we have judged that the agencies we propose are of such importance to regional cooperation that they should have coordinated boundaries.</p>
<p>Structuring the boundaries</p>
<p>In our view, the proposed agencies should follow common boundaries in six geographic areas. We consider this to be the number that entails the least adjustment for most of the proposed agencies. Our proposal also implies a limited need in terms of changes to the location of sites of operation for regional offices. It is a matter of implementing boundaries which, although not optimal for all parties in every respect, can nevertheless function for as many as possible, and irrespective of the operational section.</p>
<p>Another fundamental element consists of the conditions for well-functioning contingency planning and total defence, regional development and reception of newly arrived immigrants, since these areas affect a great number of agencies, municipalities and county councils, as well as business and industry and civil society.</p>
<p>State coordination and boundaries cannot be seen in isolation from the municipal sector. Existing cooperation structures of municipal government have therefore also formed a premise of the inquiry. A new structure for coordinated state boundaries could create a new level at which the municipal sector could meet a coordinated state in a common geographical structure.</p>
<p>In our view, boundaries that match as far as possible the geographic boundaries decided for the six healthcare regions offer several advantages. First, in terms of number, they are consistent with the range that most government agencies with regional boundaries already apply and state are appropriate and resourceefficient. Also, the map of the healthcare regions has a lot in common in purely geographical terms with the existing boundaries of several agencies. It should also be added that the health and medical care of the county councils forms an important part of total defence.</p>
<p>However, the geography of the healthcare regions cannot be applied without further formality to the regional breakdown of the state. A fundamental premise for our proposal is that county and county-council boundaries are not broken. Halland county is split between two healthcare regions, so that boundary cannot be applied where our proposal is concerned.</p>
<p>With that adjustment made, our proposal is that the suggested agencies follow common boundaries in six geographic areas that include the following counties:</p>
<p>• Gotland, Stockholm</p>
<p>Alternative boundaries</p>
<p>An alternative to the regional boundaries we recommend could be that the proposed agencies apply geographical boundaries that correspond to the seven regions of the Swedish Police. An advantage of these boundaries is that they are already also applied by the Swedish Security Service and the Swedish Prosecution Authority. All three were organised into these areas relatively recently, and for the Swedish Police in particular, this involved extensive change. The police regions also form the geographical structure used as part of the Government’s initiative for agency-wide cooperation against organised crime.</p>
<p>A drawback in this alternative is that, purely in terms of resources, many of the agencies that we propose would have difficulty in bearing more than six regions. Also, such boundaries lack any equivalent in the municipal sector, which is an important premise in our main proposal.</p>
<h2>Terms and wording for names of county councils</h2>
<p>A growing number of county councils have started to use the term ‘region’ instead of ‘county council’ in line with them assuming regional development responsibility. In the counties of Skåne and Västra Götaland, this has been the case since the end of the 20th century. Today, 13 out of the 20 county councils may decide that county council assemblies and county council boards may instead be called regional assemblies and regional boards, pursuant to the Act on regional development responsibility in certain counties (2010:630). The municipality of Gotland has also obtained a similar possibility. If the proposals in the ministerial memorandum ‘Uniform regional development responsibility’ (Ref. 2017:61) are implemented, all county councils will be able to use the terms ‘regional assembly’ or ‘regional board’.</p>
<p>The official term is still ‘county council’ however. The current situation is not sustainable. It means that different terms are used in different parts of the country, and the term used on the ballot paper in general elections often differs from that used in communication with citizens. The same term should be used throughout Sweden and in all contexts.</p>
<p>When the first county councils gained the possibility to use the terms ‘regional assembly’ and ‘regional board’, this was motivated by the fact that, for citizens, agencies and industry, it was to reflect the changed role of county councils in the county, in that they assumed regional development responsibility. Over the years, this change has become even clearer as the county councils’ work with regional development has increased.</p>
<p>A lot speaks in favour of keeping the term ‘county council’. It is an established term with an extensive cultural and linguistic history, and for which there is no risk of mix-ups because it is not used in any other contexts.</p>
<p>At the same time, in our opinion an important change has taken place in that the county councils now bear responsibility for many more issues that affect inhabitants directly, besides health and medical care. In our view, a change has occurred that is so fundamental as to merit a change of name.</p>
<p>However, the term ‘region’ presents a number of issues. We have therefore carefully considered the alternative ‘regional municipality’ in order to have a more distinct term. The most important advantage in this alternative is of course that the term ‘regional municipality’ would reduce the risk of confusion and misunderstanding. It might also be an advantage to make clear that it is a matter of a municipal body. The strongest reason against ‘regional municipality’ in our view, however, is that the current problem of the use of different terms in different contexts would partly persist. This is because the formal name would not match that used in the media and in communication with citizens. If the term is to be changed partly to attain uniformity and greater clarity, it would be beneficial to also formally use a term that is used, and that will be used, in everyday contexts.</p>
<p>Despite the drawbacks, our overall assessment is therefore that the term ‘county council’ should be changed to the term ‘region’. The change entails that a great number of consequent amendments must be made to regulations.</p>
<p>For Gotland, however, we propose that the municipality be called ‘the municipality of Gotland’.</p>
<p>When devising names for the individual regions, we propose that they be worded such that the word ‘Region’ comes before the name of the county concerned, and that the word ‘county’ be included in the end of the name.</p>
<h2>Viewpoints of the county councils, municipalities and population when changing county-council boundaries</h2>
<p>The rules that apply to changes to municipal boundaries, and to county-council boundaries, respectively, are largely similar. However, there are some differences. When making changes to municipal boundaries, particular consideration must be given to the wishes and viewpoints of the affected municipalities. If a municipality opposes the change, such a decision can only be made if compelling grounds exist. Furthermore, particular consideration shall be given to the wishes and viewpoints of the population. Where such grounds exist, a specific investigation shall be carried out to determine the population’s standpoint. Such an investigation can be conducted by means of a vote, survey, etc.</p>
<p>There are no equivalent provisions in terms of changes to countycouncil boundaries. In our view, great importance should be attributed to the standpoint of the county councils concerned when changing boundaries. There is therefore reason to introduce a provision setting out that particular consideration shall be given to the wishes and viewpoints of the closest affected county council. More extensive changes to county-council boundaries entail that many county councils are affected. It is therefore likely that it would be difficult to put boundaries in place that satisfy the first choice of each individual county council or municipality. It is of course crucial that a change in boundaries is as widely accepted as possible. At the same time, it is impossible to satisfy the different interests of all entities. New administrative boundaries are, by necessity, a tradeoff based on an overall assessment, in which certain viewpoints and perspectives will need to be attributed greater importance than others. In that situation, it is difficult to envisage the possibility of enabling an individual county council – and even less an individual municipality – to block the implementation of a carefully considered reform.</p>
<p>In light thereof, compelling grounds should not be needed – but rather only special grounds – to carry out a boundary change against the will of an individual county council.</p>
<p>The municipalities work closely with the county councils and have a strong interest in how the latter work. It is therefore reasonable to give special consideration also to the viewpoints of other municipalities concerned. However, no provision should be introduced regarding a need for special grounds in order to circumvent such viewpoints.</p>
<p>In terms of the viewpoints of the population, the nature of the question of boundaries is such that it is reasonable that the decisions be preceded by information and discussions, and that they are broadly supported. There is therefore reason to specifically regulate that consideration shall be given to the wishes and viewpoints of the population. However, the population’s standpoint must be weighed against other interests and factors, such as the standpoint of the municipalities and county councils concerned, geographical aspects of business and industry, economic conditions and the need of the state to make changes to its administrative boundaries. Yet, the type of consideration in question requires an overall assessment that fundamentally rests on political positions and values. We therefore propose that the regulation, in terms of changes to county-council boundaries, should be devised such that account shall be taken  of the wishes and viewpoints of the population, and not that special consideration shall be given to such viewpoints.</p>
<p>In our view, gathering the viewpoints of the population should be carried out as part of the preparatory process of regional representative democracy, and not as a separate inquiry carried out by an agency. That way, the viewpoints can be weighed in as part of a comprehensive decision-making basis, both when the assembly is to decide on the matter, and when the Government is to decide on any change. We therefore propose that the county councils concerned obtain the viewpoints of their members unless that is clearly not necessary, as part of the preparation of a statement on or application for changed county-council boundaries.</p>
<h2>The cooperation pattern of the county councils</h2>
<p>We have identified the cooperation pattern of the county councils e.g. by sending out a survey with questions to all county councils and, where relevant, regional associations. The responses show that there is currently extensive cooperation between the county councils mainly in the areas health and medical care, regional development, infrastructure planning and public transport, as well as education and culture.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the county councils themselves, these developments will intensify in all operations, one reason being that developments in society are complex and that different entities, and different operational sections, need to interact and cooperate. The responses show that, in the area of health and medical care, intensive developments are in progress in terms of e.g. skills governance, which will bring further needs for cooperation structures. The same applies to developments in level-structuring of healthcare. Future financial commitments and investment needs will need to be addressed in cooperation, so that resources can be used more efficiently and so that different areas of specialisation can be allocated to different locations. Future challenges too in terms of the supply of skills give rise to heightened needs for cooperation.</p>
<p>On many fronts, new demands are being placed on accessibility and extended infrastructure, one reason being the growing population. Once the infrastructure is in place, sound cooperation is needed regarding public transport, so as to offer sound traffic that is highly accessible, coordinated fares and ticketing systems, and smooth transition between modes of traffic.</p>
<p>So as to enable the state to monitor these developments at an overarching level, we propose that the University of Gothenburg be commissioned to submit a report to the Government once every four years, describing the progression of the county councils’ cooperation.</p>
<h2>Financing of administrative expenses for regional development responsibility</h2>
<p>Regional development responsibility will, as of 2019, rest with the county councils in all counties except Gotland county, where the municipality bears the responsibility, provided that the proposals in ‘Uniform regional development responsibility’ (Ref. 2017:61) are implemented.</p>
<p>Administrative expenses within regional development responsibility are currently financed by the county administrative boards’ administrative appropriation (5:1 County Administrative Boards, etc.) under expenditure area 1. In counties where the county council or cooperative body bears regional development responsibility, the county administrative boards shall, in turn, pay a monthly amount thereto. This multi-stage financing model entails complex and unclear financial governance of the operations.</p>
<p>We propose that the state contribution for the county councils and the municipality of Gotland be based on expenditure area 19 Regional Growth.</p>
