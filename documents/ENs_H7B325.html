<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The task</h2>
<p>This Commission of Inquiry was tasked with submitting proposals as to how Directive (EU) 2018/957 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services (hereinafter the ‘Amending Directive’) should be implemented in Swedish law. Under the Commission of Inquiry’s Terms of Reference, one objective of this work has been to achieve equal treatment, as far as possible, between posted (non-resident) workers and resident workers while respecting the free movement of services. In accordance with the Terms of Reference, the starting point for our deliberations and proposals has been the Swedish labour market model and the current system that implements the Posted Workers Directive in Sweden.</p>
<h2>The Commission of Inquiry’s proposals A specific situation is to be equated with posting</h2>
<p>We propose an amendment to the Posting of Workers Act which would mean that a measure by a service provider other than the worker’s employer that entails sending the worker to Sweden is equated with ‘a posting’ under the Act. For this to occur, the worker’s employer is to have hired out the worker or otherwise placed the worker at the disposal of the company that sends him or her to Sweden. Both of these companies are to be established in a country other than Sweden, but they may be established in the same country or in different countries.</p>
<p>In all other respects, the situation is to be such that the user undertaking’s measure to send the worker to Sweden would have constituted a posting if the user undertaking had been the worker’s employer. Regardless of the type of service to be provided by the undertaking that has in fact sent the worker to Sweden, in all cases this situation is to be equated with the worker having been hired out or otherwise placed at the disposal of the recipient of the service in Sweden. If the conditions under this provision are met, in applying the Posting of Workers Act, the employer shall be deemed to be the person that has posted the worker in Sweden.</p>
<h2>Industrial action may be taken to enforce demands for remuneration and some allowances/reimbursements</h2>
<p>We have assessed that the substantive changes in the Posted Workers Directive’s ‘hard core’ in Article 3(1) first paragraph through the Amending Directive relate exclusively to terms and conditions of employment in areas where there are no laws, regulations or administrative provisions in Sweden. Any terms and conditions in these areas that may come into question in relation to a posting in Sweden are thus solely to be found in collective agreements. Consequently – for the purpose of implementing this part of the Amending Directive – we propose changes in the Posting of Workers Act only with regard to the conditions under which Swedish trade unions may take industrial action with the aim of enforcing the terms and conditions of employment for posted workers contained in collective agreements.</p>
<p>The concept of “minimum rate of pay” is replaced by “remuneration”</p>
<p>We propose that Swedish trade unions – under the same conditions otherwise as those that apply today – may take industrial action aimed at bringing about a regulation by collective agreement of the terms and conditions applying to posted workers for remuneration , instead of a minimum rate of pay , as is the case today. However, the remuneration demanded with the aid of industrial action is not to exceed the remuneration that an employer who is bound by the central collective agreement from which the remuneration demand derives is required to pay in an equivalent situation.</p>
<p>In the same manner as is the case today, it will be up to Swedish trade unions to determine what remuneration may be demanded with the aid of industrial action as a last resort in relation to companies posting workers in Sweden. The amendments in this part of the Posted Workers Directive give expression to the principle that foreign companies who post workers in Sweden are to be treated in the same way as Swedish employers in an equivalent situation; something that our proposal for their implementation also means.</p>
<p>Conditions concerning reimbursement of certain types of expenditure during a posting</p>
<p>We propose that industrial action – under otherwise the same conditions as today – may be taken to enforce demands for terms and conditions where applicable relating to accommodation provided by the employer, and those relating to allowances for or the reimbursement of expenditure to cover travel, board and lodging expenses. Where there are terms and conditions in a Swedish central collective agreement that entitle workers to accommodation and defining how this accommodation is to be arranged, then these terms and conditions, provided that the requirements are otherwise met, may be enforced with the aid of industrial action against a company posting workers in Sweden. The same applies to any terms and conditions relating to allowances for or reimbursement of expenditure to cover travel, board and lodging expenses. However, according to our proposal, such terms and conditions may only be enforced with the aid of industrial action if they are designed so as to give an entitlement to an allowance or reimbursement when the posted worker travels to and from his or her regular place of work in Sweden, and when he or she is sent by the employer to work at a different workplace than his or her regular place of work during the posting period.</p>
<h2>Determination of whether the employer has paid the correct remuneration</h2>
<p>We propose that Article 3(7) in the amended Posted Workers Directive is implemented in Swedish law by stating in the Posting of Workers Act that the remuneration which the employer has paid as allowances or reimbursement for expenditure actually incurred by the worker as a consequence of the posting, i.e., typically for travelling to or from Sweden and for increased living expenses a result of the posting itself, shall not be counted in determining whether the worker has received remuneration commensurate with what the Posted Workers Directive provides for.</p>
<p>We also propose – in line with Article 3(7) third paragraph in the amended Posted Workers Directive – that all paid remuneration shall be deemed to constitute allowances for or reimbursement of expenses incurred by the worker as a consequence of the posting unless the employer can, on request, demonstrate which part of the remuneration constitutes the worker’s wage or salary, and which part constitutes allowances for or reimbursement of the worker for expenditure that he or she has actually incurred as a consequence of the posting.</p>
<h2>The principle of equal treatment in theAgency Work Act is to apply to posted temporary agency workers in Sweden</h2>
<p>We find that the amended provisions on equal treatment of posted temporary agency workers in the Posted Workers Directive make it necessary to make the principle of equal treatment in Section 6 of the Agency Work Act applicable to posted workers in Sweden. This means that posted temporary agency workers in Sweden are to be entitled inter alia  to the same remuneration as the user undertaking applies to equivalent workers who are employees of the undertaking. The exemptions from the application of the principle of equal treatment afforded under the Agency Work Act, for example in cases where the worker is a permanent employee of the temporary agency and has the right to pay between assignments, shall also apply in the case of a posting.</p>
<p>On the same basis as afforded to Swedish companies, it is to be possible to derogate from the principle of equal treatment by signing a collective agreement with a trade union. We are not proposing any changes in the conditions under which Swedish trade unions may take industrial action aimed at bringing about a regulation by collective agreement of the terms and conditions applying to posted temporary agency workers.</p>
<h2>Additional terms and conditions of employment regulated in statute are to be applied in the case of long-duration postings</h2>
<p>We propose that, in addition to the statutory provisions already applicable under the current rules, employers of workers who have been posted in Sweden for more than 12 months are to apply the statutory terms and conditions of employment applicable for equivalent workers in Sweden. We propose that exemptions shall apply in the case of procedures, formalities and conditions of the conclusion and termination of employment contracts.</p>
<p>Where an employer submits a motivated notification to the Swedish Work Environment Authority, the additional terms and conditions shall begin to apply only after the posting has lasted for 18 months. This notification is to state which worker(s) it refers to, and provide reasons why the time limit should be extended. The notification must be submitted to the Swedish Work Environment Authority no later than the day on which the worker(s) referred to in the notification have been posted in Sweden for 12 months.</p>
<p>We have determined that the additional statutory terms and conditions which may be applicable in the case of long-duration postings are relatively few, and in all probability generally of less practical importance. These are primarily provisions in the legislation governing legal rights to leave, where posted workers of long duration should have the same entitlements under the same conditions as resident workers to leave for, for example, urgent family reasons. We have also assessed that certain rules in lagen (1982:80) om anställningsskydd  (the Employment Protection Act), such as an employer’s obligation to provide information to employees while under contract and the employee’s right to pay during a lay-off, are terms and conditions of employment which are to apply to longduration posted workers in Sweden.</p>
<h2>Scope to enforce collective agreement terms and conditions expanded for long-duration postings</h2>
<p>As part of the implementation of the amended Posted Workers Directive’s rules concerning long-duration postings, we propose that, under certain specified conditions, it shall be permitted to resort to industrial action to enforce terms and conditions of employment other than those that under the Posting of Workers Act may otherwise be enforced with the aid of industrial action against a company posting workers in Sweden. In the same way as is the case today, this rule shall apply only when industrial action is taken against companies from other countries within the EEA or Switzerland.</p>
<p>Services are to be provided or have been provided for more than 12 months</p>
<p>We propose that a fundamental prerequisite for the expansion of the right to take industrial action shall be that the service that a company posting workers in Sweden is to perform for a user undertaking in Sweden is provided or has been provided for more than 12 months. If the service is to be provided for a shorter period of time than this, it is our assessment that it is not justified, in view of the freedom to provide services within the EU, to hinder the provision of a service by means of industrial action in order to enforce terms and conditions which are not applicable anyway.</p>
<p>The same conditions for demands as apply today</p>
<p>In addition to the service being performed or having been performed for a certain period of time, we propose that the basic prerequisites for taking industrial action against employers posting workers in Sweden that apply today shall also apply when the demands being made relate to the terms and conditions for long-duration posted workers. The terms and conditions so enforced shall thus also be taken from the same type of collective agreement and, where there is also regulation in statute, the terms and conditions are to afford the workers greater protection than the terms and conditions under that regulation. Furthermore, the terms and conditions are to be designed in such a way that they do not hinder the application of any better terms and conditions that the posted worker may have recourse to, for example under a collective agreement in their home Member State or under their employment contract.</p>
<p>Special demands concerning terms and conditions for long-duration postings</p>
<p>Our proposal places special demands in two respects on the design of collective agreement terms and conditions if they are to be enforceable with the aid of industrial action as a last resort. One such demand is that the terms or conditions are to be applied only to those workers of the employer who have been posted in Sweden for more than 12 months. The terms and conditions are to be designed so that they become applicable only after a posting of 18 months’ duration in cases where the employer has submitted a motivated notification to the Swedish Work Environment Authority which results in the application of the statutory terms and conditions applicable to long-duration postings being postponed (see above).</p>
<p>Another special demand placed on these terms and conditions which, under our proposal, would be enforceable with the aid of industrial action, is that they do not relate to procedures, formalities and conditions of the conclusion and termination of employment contracts, non-competition clauses or supplementary occupational retirement pension schemes. In other words, these are terms and conditions that under the amended Posted Workers Directive are to be exempt from application to posted workers, even when the posting is of long duration.</p>
<h2>The worker’s entitlement to the terms and conditions in collective agreements</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the entitlement to the terms and conditions in a collective agreement that a posted worker under certain conditions has under today’s rules shall also apply to the terms and conditions in the collective agreement which the trade union has the right to enforce though industrial action in the case of long-duration postings. Such cases are where, under the current rules, a posted worker has the right as an individual to invoke some of the terms and conditions in a collective agreement even though he or she is not a member of the contracting trade union.</p>
<h2>Trade unions’ right to certain documents</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the obligation that an employer posting workers in Sweden has under the current rules concerning the provision of certain documents to Swedish trade unions on request, under the same conditions in all other respects, shall also apply to documents needed to check compliance with the terms and conditions in the collective agreement applicable to long-duration posted workers.</p>
<h2>The periods that two or more workers have been posted in Sweden to be aggregated in certain cases</h2>
<p>We propose, in line with the amended Posted Workers Directive, that the time that two or more workers have been posted in Sweden in order to perform the same work at the same place is to be aggregated when determining the length of time that a worker has been posted in Sweden. Such an aggregation of time is prompted when determining whether the statutory conditions applicable to long-duration postings in Sweden are to apply to a specific worker. The design of our proposal also means that collective agreement terms and conditions enforced with the aid of industrial action for long-duration posted workers are to be designed so that they also apply to workers who are regarded as long-duration posted workers by virtue of having replaced some other worker to perform the same work at the same place.</p>
<p>The proposed provision applies when the employer has replaced a worker with the worker currently performing the work in Sweden. If this has been done more than once, the time periods that all the workers who have been posted to perform the same work at the same place in the framework of providing the service in Sweden are to be aggregated.</p>
<h2>The employer’s obligation to provide information in a certain case</h2>
<p>We propose that the employer shall be obliged to inform their posted workers if and if so for how long other workers have previously been posted in Sweden to perform the same work at the same place.</p>
<h2>Transparency and administrative cooperation, etc.</h2>
<p>We assess that the provisions in the Amending Directive concerning an effective implementation of the Posted Workers Directive in Member States largely aim to improve coordination of the Posted Workers Directive with the provisions contained in Directive 2014/67/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the enforcement of Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services and amending Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 on administrative cooperation through the Internal Market Information System (‘the IMI Regulation’).</p>
<p>We have found that Swedish law is largely equivalent to the provisions in these parts of the Amending Directive. Already under the current regulatory framework, the Swedish Work Environment Authority for example has been assigned the tasks and obligations which, according to the amended Posted Workers Directive, the liaison offices in Member States are to have, such as to cooperate and communicate with the competent authorities and bodies in Sweden and in other countries.</p>
<p>We also found that under the current regulatory framework, there is already sufficient scope, when determining the amount of damages or any other penalty, for taking into account that the Swedish Work Environment Authority’s website may not have provided the information that an employer would have needed to determine what terms and conditions are to be applied in the case of a posting in Sweden.</p>
<p>The amendment we are proposing to implement this part of the Amending Directive is that Swedish trade unions, in the same way as currently applies to the terms and conditions in the ‘hard core’ of the Posted Workers Directive, shall in addition be required to submit to the Swedish Work Environment Authority terms and conditions assessed as being legally enforceable by means of industrial action as a last resort for long-duration postings.</p>
<h2>An obligation to provide information for Swedish user undertakings in certain cases</h2>
<p>We propose that two new provisions are inserted in the Agency Work Act which would impose on Swedish user undertakings an obligation to provide information to temporary work agencies.</p>
<p>A user undertaking that intends to post a temporary agency worker in another country within the EEA or in Switzerland is to inform the temporary agency of this measure, if it is within the framework of a transnational service which the user undertaking is to provide in the other country. The information is to be provided no later than ten days before the measure is taken, or otherwise as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a user undertaking is to inform a temporary agency that posts workers to that user undertaking of the terms and conditions that the user undertaking applies in the areas covered by the principle of equal treatment in Section 6 of Sweden’s Agency Work Act. However, the proposed obligation to provide such information is only to apply if the temporary-work agency requests the information, and the information is be provided no later than ten days after the request has been submitted.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions</h2>
<p>We propose that the proposed legislative changes shall enter into force on 30 July 2020 with some transitional provisions. Concerning the road transport sector, as a transitional provision, the Posting of Workers Act and the Agency Work Act in their current forms are to be applied until the date of application of a legislative act amend- ing Directive 2006/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to enforcement requirements and laying down specific rules in relation to Directive 96/71/EC and Directive 2014/67/EU for posting drivers in the road transport sector.</p>
