<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has been instructed to submit any legislative or other proposals that will be needed in connection with Council Regulation (EU) 2016/1103 of 24 June 2016 implementing enhanced cooperation in the area of jurisdiction, applicable law and the recognition and enforcement of decisions in matters of matrimonial property regimes (Regulation on matrimonial property regimes) and Council Regulation (EU) 2016/1104 of 24 June 2016 implementing enhanced cooperation in the area of jurisdiction, applicable law and the recognition and enforcement of decisions in matters of the property consequences of registered partnerships (Regulation on property consequences of registered partnerships). The remit includes explaining and clarifying the meaning and application of these regulations in a Swedish context. Because the regulations on property regimes of spouses and registered partners are primarily linked to the Succession Regulation and the Brussels II Regulation, the Inquiry’s remit also includes analysing how these different regulations relate to each other.</p>
<p>With regard to spouses, the Regulation on matrimonial property regimes contains a derogation which means, among other things, that Sweden and Finland may, in certain cases, refrain from applying the Regulation’s provisions on procedures for the recognition and enforcement of decisions issued in the other State. This derogation concerns rulings based on the Convention of 6 February 1931 between Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden comprising private international law provisions on marriage, adoption and guardianship (Nordic Convention on Marriage), the Convention of 19 November 1934 between Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden comprising private international law provisions on succession, wills and estate administration (Nordic Convention on Succession) and the Convention of 11 October 1977 between Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil matters (1977 Nordic</p>
<p>Convention). The Inquiry’s remit includes analysing the more detailed meaning of this derogation on applying the provisions that implement these Nordic conventions into Swedish law, and considering whether any legislative amendments are required.</p>
<p>The Inquiry will analyse how the regulations on property regimes of spouses and registered partners impact the Swedish rules and whether any changes or additions must, or should, be made to achieve clear, predictable and effective regulation in the area. Swedish provisions in this area are currently found in a number of different statutes. Under its remit, the Inquiry will consider, in particular, whether all the provisions in the area should be collected in a single new act. The Inquiry will also consider whether there is a need in Sweden to introduce substantive provisions on the property consequences of partnerships registered abroad.</p>
<h2>The regulations on property regimes of spouses and registered partners Scope of application</h2>
<p>The regulations on property regimes of spouses and registered partners have been adopted within the framework of enhanced cooperation between 18 EU Member States: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden. The regulations regulate matters of international jurisdiction, applicable law and the recognition and enforcement of decisions in matters of property regimes of spouses and registered partners that have cross-border implications. The relevant parts will begin to apply on 29 January 2019, and will be binding and directly applicable in the States participating in the enhanced cooperation.</p>
<p>International matters concerning the property regimes of cohabiting partners are not covered by the provisions of these regulations. Moreover, it follows from the transitional provisions of the regulations that the provisions on applicable law (Chapter III) apply only to spouses or registered partners who marry or register their partnership, or who specify the law applicable to their matrimonial property regimes or the property consequences of their registered partnership on or after 29 January 2019. This means that ‘older marriages’ and ‘older registered partnerships’ are not covered by the provisions on applicable law in these regulations.</p>
<h2>The Nordic derogation</h2>
<p>Certain matters in the area of matrimonial property regimes are covered by special private international law provisions that apply in relations between the Nordic countries. These provisions are based on the Nordic Conventions on Marriage and Succession, the 1977 Nordic Framework Convention and the Convention of 16 March 1932 between Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden on the recognition and enforcement of judgments (1932 Nordic Framework Convention). Since Iceland has not acceded to the 1977 Nordic Framework Convention, the 1932 Nordic Framework Convention still applies in relation to Iceland.</p>
<p>For Sweden, the inter-Nordic provisions are found in the Ordinance concerning Certain International Legal Relationships relating to Marriage, Adoption and Guardianship (1931:429), the Act on Inheritance in International Situations (2015:417), the Act on the Recognition and Enforcement of Nordic Judgments in the Field of Private Law (1977:595), and the Act on the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments Issued in Iceland (1932:540).</p>
<p>It follows from the Regulation on matrimonial property regimes that Sweden will be able to continue to apply the inter-Nordic provisions on matrimonial property regimes in relation to Denmark, Norway and Iceland. In relations between the Member States, i.e. between Sweden and Finland, however, the Regulation will take precedence. The basic principle is thus that Sweden will not be able to continue to apply the inter-Nordic provisions in relation to Finland. The Regulation contains a derogation, however, that means that Sweden can apply the inter-Nordic provisions on recognition and enforcement in relation to Finland in so far as they provide for simplified and more expeditious procedures for the recognition and enforcement of decisions than the Regulation.</p>
<h2>International jurisdiction</h2>
<p>The regulations on property regimes of spouses and registered partners regulate when the courts of Member States have jurisdiction to examine matters concerning the property regimes of spouses and registered partners (international jurisdiction). The provisions on international jurisdiction in the regulations are based on a scale of connecting factors, i.e. they are to be examined in order of precedence on this scale. Matters concerning property regimes of spouses and registered partners are firstly to be examined by courts in the Member State dealing with a related procedure on succession or divorce, or the dissolution of a registered partnership. If no international jurisdiction stems from any such related procedure, jurisdiction is instead determined in accordance with jurisdiction criteria connected to the habitual residence and citizenship of the spouses or registered partners.</p>
<p>The regulations provide an option for spouses and registered partners to conclude a choice-of-court agreement, or ‘prorogation agreement’, giving the courts of one Member State exclusive jurisdiction to rule on matters of their matrimonial property regime.</p>
<p>In addition, there are provisions on subsidiary jurisdiction and jurisdiction in exceptional cases (e.g. if it is impossible to obtain a ruling in a third State to which the case is closely connected).</p>
<p>A court that has jurisdiction under either of the regulations may, if certain conditions are met, decline jurisdiction. A court may decline jurisdiction only in exceptional cases if it considers that the marriage in question, under the Member State’s private international law, is not recognised or if the court considers that the law of the forum does not recognise registered partnerships.</p>
<p>In principle, international jurisdiction under the regulations is universal and covers property both in and outside the country. The regulations contain provisions, however, that allow the court that otherwise has jurisdiction to limit the proceedings in certain cases so as not to include property located in a third State.</p>
<h2>Applicable law</h2>
<p>As is the case with the current provisions, spouses and registered partners may, under the regulations, agree to designate which State’s law will apply to their matrimonial property regime. If spouses do not make a choice, the applicable law to their matrimonial property regime will be the law of the State of the spouses’ first common habitual residence after their marriage. If registered partners do not make a choice, the law applicable to the property consequences of their registered partnership will be the law of the State in which their partnership was registered. Only in exceptional cases can the law of a State in which the spouses or registered partners subsequently established their habitual residence be applied. These provisions are an example of the ‘principle of immutability’, i.e. that the law applicable on entering into a marriage or registered partnership cannot subsequently be changed because the spouses or registered partners become connected to another State.</p>
<p>The transition towards applying the principle of immutability to determine the question of applicable law is a fundamental change entailed by the regulations in Swedish private international law. At present in Swedish law, the applicable law is determined on the basis of the law of the State in which the spouses were habitually resident when they married. If both spouses subsequently established their habitual residence in another State and resided there for at least two years, the law of that State applies instead. It should be pointed out, however, that spouses and registered partners will still be able to agree that the law of their country of habitual residence is to apply to their matrimonial property regime.</p>
<p>Under the regulations, the applicable law is to regulate the dissolution of the property regimes of spouses or registered partners, and the partition, distribution or liquidation of the property. This means that under the regulations, the applicable law regulates matters of matrimonial property regimes both during the marriage and after its dissolution. There are also strong indications that under the regulations, the applicable law will also regulate procedures concerning distribution of property or equivalent. The current possibility under Swedish law to apply, at the request of a spouse, Swedish law to the procedure for distribution of property will thus no longer be available.</p>
<p>Under the regulations, the principle of universality applies, which means that the law applicable under the regulations’ provisions applies irrespective of whether it is the law of a Member State or of a third State.</p>
<p>In relation to Swedish law, the regulations contain some new provisions on the formal validity of agreements on the choice of applicable law and matrimonial or partnership property agreements. A basic requirement of the regulations is that these legal acts must be in writing, dated and signed to be formally valid. At present under Swedish law, an agreement on the choice of applicable law need only be in writing to be formally valid. The regulations also mean that matrimonial and partnership property agreements and choice-of-law agreements must, in certain cases, be registered with the Swedish Tax Agency to be formally valid. At present under Swedish law, only matrimonial and partnership property agreements must be registered to be formally valid.</p>
<h2>Recognition and enforcement</h2>
<p>Under the regulations on property regimes of spouses and registered partners, judgments issued in one Member State must be recognised in the other Member States without any special procedure being required. For enforcement, the judgment must have been declared enforceable in the Member State where enforcement is sought.</p>
<p>According to the regulations, the procedure for applying for a declaration of enforceability is to be regulated by law in the enforcing Member State, unless otherwise provided by the regulations.</p>
<h2>Continued need for Swedish provisions</h2>
<p>The regulations on property regimes of spouses and registered partners will be directly applicable in Sweden, which means they will apply as Swedish law. However, there will still be a need for Swedish rules in this area. This applies to rules that supplement the regulations and provisions that incorporate the rules on matrimonial property regimes into the Nordic conventions. It also applies to provisions regulating international matters concerning the property regimes of cohabiting partners, and provisions on matters concerning the recognition and enforcement of decisions not covered by the regulations and to which the inter-Nordic provisions on recognition and enforcement do not apply, either.</p>
<h2>Supplementary provisions to the regulations</h2>
<p>The regulations on property regimes of spouses and registered partners largely replace Swedish autonomous provisions on international jurisdiction and applicable law in matters concerning the property regimes of spouses and registered partners. In the regulations, however, Member States are given the possibility, through overriding mandatory provisions, to apply exceptions in relation to the provisions on applicable law. Overriding mandatory provisions are provisions the respect for which is regarded as crucial by a Member State for safeguarding its public interests, such as its political, social or economic organisation, to such an extent that they are applicable to any situation falling within their scope. The Inquiry proposes supplementary provisions on overriding mandatory provisions. According to these provisions, the provisions of the Marriage Code concerning the disposal of spouses’ joint home and property and, on the distribution of property, a spouse’s right to take over such property, must always apply if the home and property are in Sweden.</p>
<p>Supplementary provisions on a reserve forum are also proposed in cases when the regulations prescribe international jurisdiction for a Swedish court. Provisions on the registration of agreements on the choice of applicable law are also proposed.</p>
<p>According to the regulations, the procedure for applying for a declaration of enforceability is to be regulated by the law in the enforcing Member State, unless otherwise provided by the regulations. As supplementary provisions to the regulations, the Inquiry proposes that, in general, the procedure for applying for a declaration of enforceability (exequatur proceedings) should be in line with equivalent procedures under other international instruments, e.g. the Succession Regulation, and that such applications should be made to the district courts prescribed by the Government.</p>
<h2>Inter-Nordic provisions on matrimonial property regimes</h2>
<p>Under the Regulation on matrimonial property regimes, Sweden will no longer be able to apply the inter-Nordic provisions on international jurisdiction and applicable law in relation to Finland. When a matter of matrimonial property regimes concerns relations between Sweden and Finland, the provisions on international jurisdiction and applicable law in the Regulation on matrimonial property regimes will apply instead.</p>
<p>However, under the Regulation Sweden will still be able to continue to apply all inter-Nordic provisions in relation to Denmark, Norway and Iceland. Moreover, the Inquiry considers that the inter-Nordic provisions provide for simplified and more expeditious procedures for the recognition and enforcement of decisions than does the Regulation on matrimonial property regimes. As a result, under the Nordic derogation in the Regulation, Sweden will be able to continue to apply the inter-Nordic provisions on recognition and enforcement even in relation to Finland.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the current inter-Nordic provisions on matrimonial property regimes be retained in principle. Thus, this concerns the provisions currently found in the ordinance and three acts mentioned above: the Ordinance concerning Certain International Legal Relationships relating to Marriage, Adoption and Guardianship, the Act on Inheritance in International Situations, the Act on the Recognition and Enforcement of Nordic Judgments in the Field of Private Law, and the Act on the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments Issued in Iceland.</p>
<h2>Provisions on the property regimes of cohabitating partners</h2>
<p>International matters concerning the property regimes of cohabiting partners are not covered by the regulations on property regimes of spouses and registered partners. The 2012 Brussels I Regulation and the 2007 Lugano Convention contain private international law provisions that the Inquiry considers applicable, at least with respect to certain matters concerning the property regimes of cohabiting partners. Nevertheless, there is a need for autonomous Swedish provisions concerning the property regimes of cohabiting partners. At present, the Act on Certain International Issues relating to the</p>
<p>Property of Married and Unmarried Couples (1990:272) applies to matters concerning the property regimes of cohabiting partners.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the current provisions on the property regimes of cohabiting partners be retained in principle. This means, among other things, that in the future the provisions on applicable law will differ between spouses and cohabiting partners. With respect to the provisions on the formal validity of the choice-of-law agreement in the regulations on property regimes of spouses and registered partners, it is nevertheless proposed that the choice-of-law agreement between cohabiting partners also be written, dated and signed to be formally valid. The Inquiry also proposes introducing provisions on the material validity of a choice-of-law agreement between cohabiting partners. These provisions are consistent with what applies regarding the material validity of a choice-of-law agreement in the regulations on property regimes of spouses and registered partners.</p>
<h2>Special provisions on the recognition and enforcement of certain foreign decisions</h2>
<p>The provisions on recognition and enforcement in the regulations on property regimes of spouses and registered partners will only apply to judgments issued in other Member States. As a result, there will continue to be a need for Swedish provisions on matters concerning the recognition and enforcement of decisions on the property regimes of spouses and registered partners not covered by the regulations and to which the inter-Nordic provisions on recognition and enforcement do not apply, either.</p>
<p>The provisions on the recognition and enforcement of decisions on matrimonial property regimes are currently found in the Act on Certain International Issues relating to the Property of Married and Unmarried Couples. The Inquiry proposes that these provisions be retained in principle. However, it is proposed that the provisions regulating the conditions for recognition, and whether there are any obstacles to recognition, be changed to be consistent with the equivalent provisions in the regulations on property regimes of spouses and registered partners.</p>
<h2>A new act is introduced</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has considered which legal solutions should be chosen when it comes to the provisions to be introduced or retained with certain changes and additions. One alternative would be to collect only the supplementary provisions to the regulations in a new act and retain the other provisions in the statutes in which they are currently found. The placement of the provisions in several different statutes, however, would provide a fragmented picture that would probably result in courts and other authorities responsible for the administration of justice having difficulty applying them. The Inquiry therefore proposes that provisions on the property regimes of spouses, registered partners and cohabiting partners be collected in a single new act.</p>
<p>This new act should contain provisions that supplement the regulations. Moreover, the provisions that incorporate the Nordic Conventions on Marriage and Succession – and that are currently found in the Ordinance concerning Certain International Legal Relationships relating to Marriage, Adoption and Guardianship and the Act on Inheritance in International Situations – should be transferred to the new act with certain adjustments. The act should also contain provisions concerning the property regimes of cohabiting partners, and provisions on matters concerning the recognition and enforcement of decisions not covered by the regulations and to which the inter-Nordic provisions on recognition and enforcement do not apply, either.</p>
<p>However, provisions on the recognition and enforcement of Nordic decisions that incorporate the 1977 and 1932 Nordic Framework Conventions and that are currently found in the Act on the Recognition and Enforcement of Nordic Judgments in the Field of Private Law and the Act on the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments Issued in Iceland should not be introduced into the new act. Both of these acts have a broad scope of application and are not limited in particular to decisions on matrimonial property regimes. The Inquiry considers that it is most appropriate for the provisions regulating matters on the recognition and enforcement of Nordic decisions in the field of private law to remain basically unchanged.</p>
<p>This new act will replace the Act on Certain International Issues relating to the Property of Married and Unmarried Couples.</p>
<p>Similarly, it will replace the provisions concerning matrimonial property regimes in the Ordinance concerning Certain International Legal Relationships relating to Marriage, Adoption and Guardianship and in the Act on Inheritance in International Situations.</p>
<h2>Amendments to the Marriage Code</h2>
<p>The definition of a ‘matrimonial property agreement’ in the</p>
<p>Regulation on matrimonial property regimes is broader than the one provided by the term in Swedish law. A matrimonial property agreement within the intention of the Regulation means any agreement between spouses or future spouses by which they organise their matrimonial property regime. Accordingly, it is most likely that, in addition to matrimonial property agreements in a Swedish sense, the definition will also include agreements on the distribution of property and spousal agreements concluded immediately prior to filing for divorce.</p>
<p>The basic formal requirement under the Regulation is that a matrimonial property agreement is to be written, dated and signed. There is currently no requirement in the Marriage Code that matrimonial property agreements, agreements on the distribution of property or spousal agreements concluded immediately prior to filing for divorce be dated. The Inquiry proposes that, with regard to these legal acts, the additional requirements imposed by the Regulation concerning the formal validity of matrimonial property agreements be added to the Marriage Code.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals for a new act on international matters concerning the property regimes of spouses, registered partners and cohabiting partners should enter into force at the same time as the regulations on property regimes of spouses and registered partners begin to apply, on 29 January 2019. The new act should, at the same time, replace the Act on Certain International Issues relating to the Property of Married and Unmarried Couples. Transitional provi- sions are proposed to the effect that the provisions on applicable law in the Act on Certain International Issues relating to the Property of</p>
<p>Married and Unmarried Couples will continue to apply to spouses and registered partners who married or registered their partnership prior to 29 January 2019 and who did not subsequently choose a law to apply to their property regime, i.e. ‘older marriages’ or ‘older registered partnerships’. It is also proposed in the transitional provi- sions that the new act will not annul any valid legal act (i.e. an agreement on choice of law) between cohabiting partners that was entered into prior to the act’s entry into force.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposed amendments to the Marriage Code should also enter into force on 29 January 2019. Transitional provi- sions are proposed to the effect that the legislative amendments will not annul any valid matrimonial property agreements, agreements on the distribution of property or spousal agreements concluded immediately prior to filing for divorce that were entered into before the amendments’ entry into force.</p>
