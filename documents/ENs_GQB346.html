<h1>Summary in brief</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In the middle of 1996 the Swedish Government created a function as National Co-ordinator for Nuclear Waste Disposal for a three-year period. The following three years (July 1999 – June 2002) the function continued, although termed Special Advisor to the Government for Nuclear Waste Disposal.  The tasks have included extensive contacts with municipalities which have been considered by the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Co (SKB) as possible candidates for siting a final repository for spent nuclear fuel from the Swedish nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>As explained below, the site selection process in Sweden entered into a new phase during the first part of 2002. The reasons originally behind creating the function as Special Advisor were no longer applicable. As a consequence, no action was taken to prolong this arrangement.</p>
<p>SKB is a private company, owned by the Swedish nuclear power producers and commissioned by them to carry out the owners’ legal obligations with regard to safe handling and final disposal of nuclear waste from the production of nuclear power.</p>
<p>In spring 1999, the National Co-ordinator published a report to the Government. This report contained two parts. One was a description of the decision process, which aimed at leading to a choice of method and site for final disposal of spent nuclear fuel from the Swedish nuclear power reactors. A second part consisted of an account of how the municipalities concerned, selected on a voluntary basis by SKB, had organised their work during the initial phase of the site selection process, involving local feasibility studies. A translation of the Swedish title of the report is ‘Final disposal of nuclear waste – The municipalities and the site selection process’ (in Swedish Slutförvaring av kärnavfall – Kommunerna och platsvalsprocessen,  SOU 1999:45). The report contained no proposals. It was primarily intended as factual information for local politicians and the general public in municipalities taking part, or considering to take part, in the feasibility studies. However, later developments have made this report partly out-of-date.</p>
<p>At the time of the publication of the 1999 report, SKB had finalised feasibility studies in two municipalities in northern Sweden, and was conducting feasibility studies in four municipalities situated in central and southern Sweden. However, the two northern municipalities had chosen, after municipal referendums in 1995 and 1997, to withdraw from the site selection process. Shortly after the publication of the report, another two feasibility studies were started in central and southern Sweden.</p>
<p>The next phase of the site selection process is centered on site investigations involving deep drilling. Based on the results of the totally eight completed feasibility studies, as well as on other material, SKB announced in late 2000 that they wanted to carry out site investigations in three areas within the municipalities of Oskarshamn, Tierp and Östhammar (see maps on cover page and on p. 87). A site investigation in the municipality of Tierp would also affect the neighbouring municipality of Älvkarleby, which had also been one of the feasibility study municipalities. SKB asked these four municipalities for their consent to carry out the three site investigations.</p>
<p>The full background for the selection of sites for site investigations was presented in a report by SKB in December 2000. This ’Integrated account of method, site selection and programme prior to the site investigation phase’ was the result of a Government decision in early 2000, requiring that SKB should present such an account for review by the government authorities concerned, and by the Government itself. After a thorough review process, the Government concluded in November 2001 that it ‘had no objection to the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Co starting investigations within the three sites that the Company has specified’.</p>
<p>The four municipalities concerned had earlier stated that such a positive statement by the Government was a prerequisite for them to consider SKB’s proposals. The municipal councils in Östhammar and in Oskarshamn decided almost unanimously to allow SKB to start site investigations in the Forsmark  area and in the Simpevarp  area, respectively (see maps on pp 144 and 228). These municipal decisions were made in December 2001 (Östhammar) and in March 2002 (Oskarshamn). However, in April 2002, the municipal council of Tierp turned down, by a narrow majority, the proposed site investigation within their municipality. As a consequence, a positive decision in March 2002 by the municipal council of Älvkarleby had no practical implication.</p>
<p>Following these municipal decisions, SKB has commenced site investigations in the Forsmark area during winter 2002 and in the Simpevarp area during summer 2002. This means that the site selection process in Sweden has entered into a new phase.</p>
<p>Formal consultation processes - in accordance with provisions in the Environmental Code - with persons, municipalities and government authorities concerned - have started during the first half of 2002. These consultation processes will have in view the possibility of a future application for a site permit regarding a final repository in the Forsmark area or in the Simpevarp area. The two consultation processes will probably be carried out in parallel.</p>
<p>The fact that the site selection process has entered a new phase is a good reason for providing an up-to-date picture of how the eight Swedish municipalities have handled the ‘nuclear waste management issue’ since SKB started their feasibility studies in the beginning of the 1990’s. The description in the 1999 report of the decision-making process designed to lead to a choice of method and site for final disposal of spent nuclear fuel is also brought up to date.</p>
<p>An English translation of the title of this report is ‘Siting a repository for nuclear waste – Feasibility studies in eight municipalities’ (in Swedish Plats för slutförvaring av kärnavfall – Förstudier i åtta kommuner,  SOU 2002:46).</p>
<p>This is a mainly descriptive report of more important events up to summer 2002. The report contains no proposals.</p>
<p>Municipal elections held in Sweden on 15 September 2002 resulted in smaller swings between the political parties represented in the municipal councils of Oskarshamn and Östhammar (the two municipalities where site investigations have begun). There are no signs that the results of the elections in the two municipalities will cause major changes in the attitudes of the two municipalities towards these investigations.</p>
<p>The current report consists of four main parts.</p>
<p>Part I is an account of certain basic facts about the division of responsibilities, technical issues, safety, legislation and main actors in regard to the handling, storing and disposal of spent nuclear fuel and long-lived nuclear waste from Swedish power reactors. The information in this part is primarily intended for readers with only limited knowledge of nuclear waste management issues.</p>
<p>In Part II, the different phases in the selection of a site for final disposal are explained. Emphasis is on matters of particular importance from a municipal perspective. Information is provided on rules in the legislation about consultations to be initiated by the company when preparing a future application for a siting permit, including an environmental impact statement.</p>
<p>Part III shows how the eight municipalities have organised their own work in connection with the feasibility studies made by SKB. These eight municipalities were (cf. maps on cover page and p. 87) Storuman  and Malå  in northern Sweden, Östhammar, Tierp  and Älvkarleby  close to the power plant of Forsmark in central Sweden, and Oskarshamn  and the neighbouring</p>
<p>Hultsfred,  close to the Oskarhamn nuclear power plant in southern Sweden. Each municipality is described in a separate chapter. The time period covered is from 1992 to summer 2002.</p>
<p>For each municipality some general background facts are given about geographical location, area, population, industry, employment and voting behaviour. The process that occurred, in each case formally initiated by SKB, and leading up to some sort of municipal acceptance of SKB carrying out a feasibility study, is described. Next comes an account of the methods and the organisation each municipality chose in order to follow the feasibility study work in detail and to influence the contents of a preliminary report by SKB from the study. Then follow descriptions of how each municipality carried out its review of SKB’s preliminary report, which views and demands were presented to SKB as a result of this municipal review, and how SKB responded as reflected by the main contents of SKB’s final report. The course of events in each of the municipalities from the moment SKB presented their choice of three sites for further investigations (late 2000) up to the positive decisions by the municipal councils in Östhammar, Oskarshamn and Älvkarleby and the negative decision by the municipal council in Tierp during the winter months 2001/2002 is accounted for. There is a concluding presentation of how each municipality informed its inhabitants and of municipal efforts to build up knowledge and competence among both elected representatives and the general public.</p>
<p>To facilitate comparisons between the courses of events in each of the eight municipalities, a graphical illustration is presented on pp 256 257.</p>
<p>Part IV deals with cooperation and interaction between the municipalities concerned, between these municipalities and the County administrative boards concerned (the Government’s regional authorities) and finally between these County administrative boards.</p>
