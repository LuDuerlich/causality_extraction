<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Under our terms of reference, we were instructed to identify the rules of international law pertaining to armed conflicts, occupation and neutrality that are legally binding for Sweden. The remit also included describing how Sweden has incorporated existing rules of international humanitarian law in Swedish legislation and monitoring the extent to which, and the way in which, the content of Swedish international law training is relevant against the background of existing convention commitments. Another task was to analyse the rules of customary law, including the conclusions and reasons for these that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has laid down in its customary law study. Moreover, our remit included investigating whether there is a need for a national manual on international humanitarian law, and if so, submitting a proposal for such a manual.</p>
<p>Through supplementary terms of reference, we were also instructed to propose legislative amendments necessary to enable Sweden to ratify Protocol additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Adoption of an Additional Distinctive Emblem (Protocol III), and to review the Act on the Protection of Certain International Distinctive Emblems of Medical Aid, etc. (1953:771) and propose suitable amendments.</p>
<h2>Foundations of international law (Chapter 2)</h2>
<p>The interpretation and application of key international humanitarian law conventions and existing customary law require knowledge of the system of rules making up international law. Therefore, in this chapter we give a concise account of fundamental areas and concepts pertaining to international law. This account is based on our remit, which covers the rules of international law concerning armed conflicts, occupation and neutrality that are legally binding for Sweden. The focus is therefore on the laws of war and some areas of human rights.</p>
<p>This chapter also contains an account of how Sweden is implementing its obligations under international law.</p>
<h2>International law and Swedish total defence – a background (Chapter 3)</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we give an account of the work carried out by the committee appointed in 1978 to submit proposals concerning the interpretation and application of the rules of international law in situations of war, neutrality and occupation. The committee submitted its interim report, The laws of war (Krigets lagar, SOU 1979:73), in 1979, and its final report, International law in war (Folkrätten i krig, SOU 1984:56), in 1984.</p>
<p>The final report has been highly influential due to its systematic review of current international humanitarian law and its proposals for the interpretation and application of this law. The committee’s analyses and proposals have served as a guide for Sweden’s position in this area and for current national statutes with a bearing on international humanitarian law. The 1984 report has thus – together with subsequent inquiries and Swedish statutes in the area – been a natural starting point for our work. In this chapter, therefore, we start by giving an account of the issues dealt with in the report and the standpoints taken by the committee (Section 3.1); we then give an account of work in connection with the report that was carried out at a later date (Section 3.2).</p>
<p>In a separate section (3.3), we then give an account of the changes in the Swedish total defence.  There we note that the 1984 report was based on how the total defence at the time was organised, but that the total defence has undergone radical changes since the end of the 1990s, partly as a result of changes in the security policy situation. The foundation for these changes was laid through Govt. Bill 1998/99:74 A Changing World – A Reformed Defence. The changes mean that the Swedish Armed Forces have shifted focus from a large-scale defence against invasion to a smaller operational defence. The main tasks of military defence are not only to defend Sweden against armed attack and uphold Sweden’s territorial integrity, but also to contribute to peace in the world around us and strengthen Swedish society to meet peacetime emergencies. This change in focus has brought with it far-reaching changes to both the Armed Forces’ scale and structure – such as changes to the basic organisation’s size, personnel needs and the number of total defence conscripts and their training.</p>
<p>Not only the military defence has undergone radical change – so too have the civil parts of the total defence. The civil defence sector can now be regarded as a part of the new emergency preparedness system. Previous state-controlled activities within the civil defence sector have been integrated into the regular activities of the municipalities and county councils. Civil operations specifically aimed at preparing Sweden for war only occur on a small scale these days. The previous civil defence organisation – now the rescue services in wartime – is no longer allocated any staff who have undergone total defence training. The state-owned equipment for these activities has been sold or transferred to the municipalities for use in peacetime activities. New command concepts for extraordinary events in municipalities and county councils have meant that previous command locations and other facilities for wartime activities have also been closed down. Civilian participation in international operations is expected to rise.</p>
<p>Finally, in Section 3.4, we look at the extent to which we can use the 1984 report as a starting point for our work.  In it, we note that in the more than 25 years that have passed since the report was submitted, major international and national changes have occurred that have had an impact on the design, interpretation and application of international law. Although this means that some parts of the 1984 report need supplementing, we consider that this report remains a valuable summary and valid analysis of the key rules and principles of international humanitarian law from the perspective of Swedish needs and conditions. The major reforms that the total defence has undergone since 1984 – combined with the new security policy threat scenario of today – do not  mean that Sweden can no longer live up to the commitments under international humanitarian law dealt with in the report. However, Sweden should have high ambitions in this area. International humanitarian law – especially customary law – has undergone substantial development since the report was submitted. There is, therefore, reason to consider the new demands made by international humanitarian law today and the significance of these when it comes to how Sweden can best live up to its obligations under international law – especially in terms of training.</p>
<h2>Developments in international law after 1984 (Chapter 4)</h2>
<p>In this chapter we give an account of developments in international law, mainly concerning the rules that apply to armed conflicts, occupation and neutrality, in the period following the 1984 report. Focus lies on developments of international humanitarian law.</p>
<p>The introductory section (4.1) looks at conventions and protocols  in the area that have been adopted, or that Sweden has acceded to, during the period in question. We also look at the way in which Sweden has implemented the various international instruments.</p>
<p>One important development in recent years in the area of international humanitarian law concerns the activities and establishment of international courts and tribunals . In Section 4.2 we give an account of the emergence of various temporary courts, including the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), tasked with prosecuting individuals for crimes against international humanitarian law. A short account of the case-law developed at these courts is also given. In addition, there is a description of the emergence of the first permanent International Criminal Court, which was established through the entry into force of the ‘Rome Statute’ in 2002. In this section, we also present certain decisions by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) with a bearing on international humanitarian law. The section concludes with an account of how Sweden has implemented the obligations resulting from the establishment of the new courts.</p>
<p>In Section 4.3 we give a short presentation of the development of state practice  in this area. We point out that the International Committee of the Red Cross(ICRC) has carried out an ambitious and extensive project to give an account of state practice in these types of issues in the customary law study we discuss in Chapter 5, and that various issues concerning both Swedish and other countries’ practice is commented on in this context. We also refer to the periodic accounts of state practice and other developments in international humanitarian law provided in the Yearbook of International Humanitarian Law and elsewhere. In addition, we deal with various UN issues (e.g. peace operations, and children and women in armed conflict) and EU issues (e.g. guidelines for the promotion of international humanitarian law and ‘rules for operations’) that are important to our remit. The first case (the ‘Arklöv case’) in which a Swedish court has examined the issue of responsibility for violations of international law is also mentioned.</p>
<p>International humanitarian law takes shape alongside the emergence of new treaties, state practice, and case-law from courts and tribunals, as well as other developments. In Section 4.4 we give an account of some of these developments under the heading</p>
<p>Doctrine and a few current international law issues . Following an account of various issues discussed at the International Conferences of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent, we deal under separate headings with some of the international humanitarian law issues that have attracted particular attention in recent times. One such issue is how the increasingly common use of  private military companies (PMCs) should be assessed in legal terms. In this context, we look at the Montreux Document on private military and security companies, adopted in 2008 and in whose drafting Sweden was involved. The document deals with ‘international obligations’ and ‘good practices’ for states in relation to PMCs in armed conflicts. The aim of the document, which is not legally binding, is not to extend obligations under international law, but to remind states of what applies. We also give an account of the legally  non-binding  manuals drawn up for  maritime war (the San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea of 1994) and  air war (the Manual on International Law Applicable to Air and Missile Warfare of 2009). Moreover, in this section we look at the meaning of the term  direct participation and the report on this issue published by the ICRC. Under a separate heading, we also deal with  The War on Terror and the term</p>
<p>Unlawful Combatants .</p>
<p>Sweden has long been very much committed to the area of international humanitarian law. In Section 4.5 we describe various Swedish initiatives taken in the area. In recent years, this has occurred in areas such as electronic war and with regards to a gender perspective of international humanitarian law. In November 2004, Sweden hosted an international expert conference on ‘Computer Network Attacks and the Applicability of International</p>
<p>Humanitarian Law’, and in October 2007 Sweden held a conference on ‘International Humanitarian Law and Gender’.</p>
<p>To conclude, in Section 4.6 we comment on the developments and issues dealt with in the Chapter. The focus of this section lies on the issue of how Sweden has implemented the conventions and protocols that have come into being during this period. We have based our comments on information provided by relevant government agencies and civil society organisations which we have approached in order to identify any shortcomings in Sweden’s implementation. In most cases there has not been any particular criticism and nor do we consider there is reason to level any criticism at Sweden’s implementation. However, critical views concerning certain treaties have been voiced during our consultations or reached us through other channels.</p>
<p>These concern issues such as the fact that Sweden has not yet fulfilled its obligation to sign a Privileges and Immunities Agreement with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), as stated in the Convention on the prohibition of the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons and on their destruction .  We have not become aware of, or otherwise found, any particular reasons not to sign such an agreement. Similar agreements have been signed in other areas. As the full implementation of the Convention requires that an agreement be signed, we recommend that Sweden do so.</p>
<p>We have received viewpoints from various sources on the slow process of adapting Swedish criminal legislation to the penal provisions included in the Rome Statute . We consider it unfortunate that the processing of the proposals made by the Inquiry on International Criminal Law and Swedish Jurisdiction (Internationella brott och svensk jurisdiktion, SOU 2002:98) has taken so long and that Sweden, as a result of this, does not have the legislation in place that the Statute requires. The issue of adapting Swedish criminal legislation to the Rome Statute is also important in relation to several other treaties, as the regulations in the Statute are associated in several points with issues regulated in these other treaties. This applies to the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the Rights of the Child (and its Optional Protocols)  and the Second Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict .</p>
<p>Criticism has been levelled from various sources at Sweden’s implementation of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment . This criticism has focused, among other things, on the fact that Sweden has not made torture a criminal offence as defined in the convention. , and on the fact that, under Swedish provisions, torture is not exempt from statutory limitations. We note that the issue of the need for amendments to penal provisions has been considered in a legislative context and that, at the time, the assessment was made that no legislative amendments are required. However, we proceed from the assumption that the issue of how the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment  should suitably be incorporated into Swedish law will be considered more closely in connection with the processing of the proposals submitted by the Inquiry on International Criminal Law and Swedish Jurisdiction, and in light of this, we refrain from giving a more detailed account here of our own considerations. We also note that the issue of statutory limitations warrants special consideration in this context.</p>
<p>From a range of different sources, including the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, there has been criticism of and views on how Sweden has implemented the Convention on the Rights of the Child  and its Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict.  The views received in this regard are largely beyond the scope of our remit. The issue of the incorporation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child into Swedish law has been discussed in several instances, e.g. ‘Putting the best interests of the child first’ (Barnets bästa i främsta rummet, SOU 1997:116), which was a broad review of how consistent Swedish legislation and practice were with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. We do not consider there is reason to comment in particular on the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in Sweden, other than to point out that it is important that Sweden’s efforts to deal with the criticism received from the Committee on the Rights of the Child (and that are supported by many Swedish actors as indicated above) continue.</p>
<p>In connection with  the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict , there has been criticism levelled from various sources at the Swedish Armed Forces’ training concerning the protection of cultural property. Our comment on this is that the issue of any shortcomings in training on the requirements laid out in the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property and its Protocols should be followed up by the Swedish Armed Forces and the civilian agencies responsible for training, in line with the Total Defence International Law Ordinance, particularly in connection with training for peace operations.</p>
<p>In the section on Sweden’s implementation, we point out how crucial it is that Sweden’s efforts to ratify the Second Protocol to the Convention on the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict  and the Convention on Cluster Munitions  continue. We reiterate our proposals in Chapter 7 with reference to the ratification of Additional Protocol III to the Geneva Conventions .</p>
<p>In Section 4.6 we also make certain comments in connection with issues concerning air warfare, private military companies, ‘direct participation’, ‘the war on terror’ and ‘unlawful combatants’. With regard to private military companies, we highlight our assessment that Sweden should actively support the Montreux Document on private military and security companies, and where the ‘war on terror’ and ‘unlawful combatants’ are concerned, all  persons participating in hostilities should, in our view, be given protection either under international humanitarian law or human rights. We reject the idea, therefore, that there is a legal vacuum leaving scope to treat certain people without regard for such protection.</p>
<h2>International humanitarian law and customary law (Chapter 5)</h2>
<p>In this chapter we present and analyse the customary law study conducted by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The background to the study is that the states represented at the 26th International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent in December 1995 asked the International Committee of the Red Cross to draw up a report on the rules of customary law that are applicable in international and noninternational armed conflicts, and to disseminate the report to states and expert international bodies. This work was to be carried out with the help of experts in international humanitarian law from various parts of the world and representing different legal systems, as well as in consultation with experts from governments and international organisations. The ICRC accepted the assignment and ten years later, in 2005, it published the study, in which 161 rules of customary law are presented, with over 5 000 pages of comments and background material.</p>
<p>Section 5.2 contains a detailed account of the study’s implementation, purpose, focus and structure, methods and material, and general findings. The section also contains an account of how the study was received and of the ICRC’s continued work on the study.</p>
<p>In Section 5.3 we give our general assessment of the study and an account of what we have based our analysis of the study’s rules on. We stress that we did not interpret our terms of reference in such a way as to mean that we were expected to conduct an independent analysis of all the issues that the customary law study may give rise to. What was relevant within the context of our work was a more general evaluation of the study’s approach, a general assessment of the study and of individual rules, as well as of the evidential value of the material gathered and the reliability of the conclusions reported. For this purpose, we have not only read the study itself and the material upon which it is based. We have also read a large number of publications in which the study, and its conclusions, are discussed and, in many cases, called into question. Our assessment of individual rules has also been conducted taking into account known Swedish opinio juris  (i.e. the conviction that a legal obligation exists for a certain practice) concerning rules of international humanitarian law, primarily based on Sweden’s commitments under treaties. The aim of this review is to investigate the extent to which the study’s results contain new obligations for Sweden under international humanitarian law, and if so, what is required to ensure that Sweden fulfils these obligations.</p>
<p>In our view, we can support the principles contained in the study concerning the range of state practice, as well as the criteria for assessing the state practice described in the study. We also consider that the study’s assessment of state practice has essentially been conducted in conformity with the general criteria described in the introduction to the study. Therefore, we proceed from the assumption that there is good reason to accept that the 161 rules contained in the study represent customary law.</p>
<p>In the assessment of what constitutes customary law, we have proceeded from a broad conception of state practice, covering not only concrete acts of state behaviour, but also positions taken at diplomatic conferences, acceptance of treaty rules at such conferences and statements made in the United Nations or in other international fora. We note that in such cases the element of state practice ( usus ) in most cases merges with the manifestation of an opinio juris .</p>
<p>When evaluating the individual rules, we have mainly focused on assessing the extent to which there is reason to take account of the study and its results when shaping national practice. However, this approach does not allow for a clear dividing line to be maintained between policy and opinio juris , and the emphasis has therefore been placed on providing a basis for future Swedish policy  with regard to the rules proposed. In this case, we have taken our cue from conceptions of justice that appear to be appropriate and desirable from a Swedish point of view.</p>
<p>When assessing the 161 rules, we did consider, however, that a Swedish opinio juris  exists in cases where the material content and scope of a rule corresponds with a treaty provision Sweden is bound by, as Sweden – by entering into the treaty – has shown a readiness to be legally bound by the rule in question in relation to every other state.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have found that Sweden has long been pushing for the same rules to apply in non-international and international armed conflicts. We have therefore proceeded from the assumption that the rules contained in the study that are applicable to international armed conflicts according to Swedish opinio juris  also apply to non-international armed conflicts (where stated in the study), unless there are special reasons otherwise.</p>
<p>Concerning the rules whose material content does not correspond to any treaty provision that Sweden is bound by, we have assessed each rule against the background of the Swedish practice that we ourselves have compiled. It should be stressed that this practice is largely of a general nature leaving room for various interpretations, and that for a number of rules there is no Swedish practice that either supports or contradicts the customary law status of the rule in question.</p>
<p>If a rule lacks support in Swedish opinio juris  and is not considered to be a necessary regulation, we have made the assessment that there is no Swedish support for the proposed rule being international customary law. In these situations, we have chosen to proceed from an overall assessment of the rule based on the reasons given in the study.</p>
<p>In Section 5.4 the study’s 161 rules are presented. The presentation and the comments are, like the study itself, divided into six sub-sections: The Principle of Distinction, Specifically Protected Persons and Objects, Specific Methods of Warfare, Weapons, Treatment of Civilians and Persons Hors de Combat, and Implementation. In each sub-section, we begin by placing the rules in their context by providing a short background description and by giving overall views on the area of regulation. We then present and comment on each rule individually.</p>
<p>Under the heading The Principle of Distinction , 24 rules are presented, divided under six sub-headings: Distinction between Civilians and Combatants, Distinction between Civilian Objects and Military Objectives, Indiscriminate Attacks, Proportionality in Attack, Precautions in Attack, and Precautions against the Effects of Attacks. In our view, all of these rules represent the application of fundamental principles in international humanitarian law and have undoubtedly customary law status. All of these rules – or at least their main features – are also supported by treaties Sweden has ratified. We note in particular that the term ‘combatant’ is sometimes used in a broader sense than it generally has, which has been indicated in our report through the use of the translation ‘stridande’ (‘belligerents’) and not ‘kombattant’ (‘combatant’) in these contexts (see Rule 1).</p>
<p>Under the heading  Specifically Protected Persons and Objects , 21 rules are presented under eight  sub-headings:  Medical and Religious Personnel and Objects, Humanitarian Relief Personnel and Objects, Journalists, Protected Zones, Cultural Property, Works and Installations Containing Dangerous Forces, and The Natural Environment. Almost all of the rules in this group are covered by agreements that Sweden has ratified, including the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocol I, the Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land (annex to IV Hague Convention) and the Rome Statute, all of which are largely seen to reflect existing customary law. Some of the rules are considered to have customary law status in the practice of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The study makes extensive references to state practice. Swedish state practice also provides extensive and explicit support for many of the rules. Certain formulations in some of the rules in this sub-section may, on first impression, make the rules appear more controversial than they are. We comment in particular on the criticism targeted against Rule 31 (respect for and protection of humanitarian relief personnel), previous Swedish statements concerning protection for journalists (Rule 34), and the lack of treaty support concerning protection for the natural environment (Rules 43–45).</p>
<p>Under the heading Specific Methods of Warfare , 24 rules are presented under five sub-headings: Denial of Quarter, Destruction and Seizure of Property, Starvation and Access to Humanitarian Relief, Deception, and Communication with the Enemy. Almost all of the rules in this main group have equivalents in agreements that Sweden has ratified, including the St Petersburg Declaration, the Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare from 1925, and the Geneva Conventions (and their Additional Protocols), all of which are regarded as reflecting existing customary law. However, we have made the assessment that Rules 64 (prohibition against concluding an agreement to suspend combat with the intention of attacking by a surprise the enemy relying on that agreement) and 66 (right to non-hostile contact with the enemy) lack equivalents in Sweden’s treaty-based obligations. In our view, the majority of the rules are relatively uncontroversial for Sweden. However, the rules must be read in the light of what is said in the comments on the rules. Without this, some of the rules may be interpreted as incomplete or more farreaching than was intended. We comment in particular on criticism levelled against Rules 55 and 56 (on humanitarian relief).</p>
<p>Under the heading Weapons , 17 rules are presented under eleven sub-headings: General Principles on the Use of Weapons, Poison, Biological Weapons, Chemical Weapons, Expanding Bullets, Exploding Bullets, Weapons Primarily Injuring by Non-detectable Fragments, Booby-traps, Landmines, Incendiary Weapons, and Blinding Laser Weapons. All of these rules are based on the fundamental principles on the prohibition of weapons that are indiscriminate and cause unnecessary suffering or superfluous injury. These principles are based, in turn, on the abovementioned principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions in attack. Almost all of the rules are included in treaties that Sweden has ratified, including the St Petersburg Declaration, the Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare from 1925 and the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects from 1980 and its Protocols, and Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions. The practice described in the study is less extensive concerning several rules than for the majority of the rules in the study. The weapons rules have also been the subject of criticism due to excessively weak support in state practice, especially with regard to non-international conflicts. However, in light of the reasons presented in the study and the material provided, we do not consider it necessary to give any dissenting opinion to that expressed in the study, or to question in more general terms the study’s conclusions. We comment in particular on certain issues concerning prohibitions in armed conflict that do not apply in peacetime (Rule 75 on riot-control agents and Rule 77 on expanding bullets) and the admissibility of 12.7 millimetre ammunition (Rule 78 on exploding bullets).</p>
<p>Under the heading  Treatment of Civilians and Persons Hors de Combat , 52 rules are presented under eight  sub-headings:  Fundamental Guarantees, Combatants and  Prisoner-of-War  Status, The Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked, The Dead, Missing Persons, Persons Deprived of Their Liberty, Displacement and Displaced Persons, and Other Persons Afforded Specific Protection. The rules in this main group reflect a fundamental idea in international humanitarian law on the protection of and respect for civilians and persons hors de combat, an idea that has also been expressed in more general terms through the customary law rules in the first part – The Principle of Distinction.</p>
<p>All of these rules – or at least their main features – correspond to rules in treaties that Sweden has ratified, including the Regulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land, and the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols. The rules contained in this main group relate to issues that have long been regarded as customary law. As they correspond with similar rules in the area of human rights, many of these rules have long stood out as having a natural place in Swedish law. The continued applicability of human rights in armed conflicts – irrespective of the type of conflict – supports some of the rules. We comment in particular on the issue of what ‘torture’ means (Rule 90), the issue of protection for ‘voluntary’ human shields (Rule 97), the issue of limiting the obligation to release and repatriate prisoners of war after the cessation of active hostilities (Rule 128) and the issue of an age-limit for children (Rules 135, 136 and 137).</p>
<p>Under the heading Implementation , 23 rules are presented under five sub-headings: Compliance with International Humanitarian Law, Enforcement of International Humanitarian Law, Responsibility and Reparation, Individual Responsibility, and War Crimes. Most of the rules in this main group – or in any case their main features – are included in treaties that Sweden has ratified, including the Hague Conventions and the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols. In our view, the study’s rules on the implementation of international humanitarian law are largely uncontroversial and refer to circumstances that have long been considered customary law, at least in relation to states. We comment in particular on the issue of whether reprisals can be allowed (Rules 145 and 148), the issue of what ‘serious violations’ means (Rule 156) and the associated issue of prohibitions of statutes of limitation (Rule 160).</p>
<p>In the final section (5.5) we stress that the exact scope of customary law will always be subject to differing opinions, but that it is our view that there is no reason to repudiate the assessments made by the ICRC in the study. Most of the rules in the study – at least where international armed conflicts are concerned – are essentially also included in treaties by which Sweden is bound. Moreover, there is every indication that Sweden’s position in the issues dealt with by the study is essentially in harmony with the assessments made in the study. The rules that can be claimed to go beyond Sweden’s current obligations in international conflicts  are Rules 43 and 44 (protection of the natural environment), Rule 64 (prohibition against agreement to suspend combat with the intention of attacking by surprise), Rule 66 (right to non-hostile contact with the enemy), Rule 86 (blinding laser weapons), Rule 145 (reprisals), Rule 149 (c) and (d) (state responsibility for violations of international humanitarian law) and Rule 154 (superior’s orders). However, none of these rules are of such nature that we consider there to be reason for Sweden to repudiate the study’s assessment that they have customary law status. In our view, it should also be possible to base Swedish practice on these rules. Concerning non-international conflicts, we express the view that Sweden – both with regard to the findings of the study and for reasons of expediency – should, as a rule, apply and otherwise maintain the same rules as in international conflicts. States that are not engaged in warfare also have an obligation – alone or together with others – to take action to ensure that the rules of international humanitarian law are respected. Against this background, we recommend that Sweden supports the rules contained in the study.</p>
<h2>Peace operations (Chapter 6)</h2>
<p>In our terms of reference it is stated that, when identifying the rules of international law that apply for armed conflicts, occupation and neutrality, we should highlight the applicability of international humanitarian law in  peace-support  operations . Therefore, in Chapter 6 we give an account of some of the fundamental issues raised by peace operations in relation to international humanitarian law and elements of human rights. However, in the course of the inquiry we were informed that the aim is for the issue of legal grounds for the use of force and coercion on the part of Swedish military personnel and police officers in peace operations to be dealt with by a special inquiry. For this reason, we do not look at this subject in detail.</p>
<p>In our report, we highlight the fact that in the overwhelming majority of peace operations in which Sweden has participated, the force has been tasked with maintaining peace after the cessation of hostile activities. The use of force and coercion during such operations may not extend beyond what is allowed under human rights.  Over the past two decades, Swedish forces have also participated in peace operations where armed hostilities are still ongoing between various warring groups. Despite its presence in a conflict area, a peace operation does not necessarily have to be caught up in the armed conflict; instead, it can have more limited tasks, such as facilitating the passage of humanitarian relief or protecting the civilian population through its presence. In these situations, the peace operation is to observe the rules of international humanitarian law , but as the operation is not participating in hostilities, its own use of force must still be limited to what is permitted under human rights. Only if the peace operation becomes directly involved in the hostile activities – either by using force to separate the warring groups or by participating in hostile activities on the side of one of the warring parties – does it have the right to use force under the rules of international humanitarian law.</p>
<p>We also highlight  that Swedish law is largely lacking in explicit regulations for peace operations . However, when the Government makes the Swedish Armed Forces’ international force available for peace enforcement operations, it must be seen as implicit that the force is being made available with the powers that follow from the international rules governing the operation, and with the limitations that follow from Swedish laws and regulations, including Sweden’s obligations under international law. As the large majority of peace operations do not participate in any armed conflicts and international humanitarian law is consequently not formally applicable, human rights are one of the most important pieces of international regulation to be observed during operations. In our view, it must be seen as a natural starting point as far as Sweden is concerned that Sweden’s obligations under human rights conventions are to be respected not only on Swedish territory, but also beyond Swedish territory, in cases where Sweden exercises effective control over a territory or over people located outside of Swedish territory.</p>
<p>We also deal with the issue of taking people into detention  during peace operations, and recommend here that Sweden in future support the Danish initiative, ‘The Handling of Detainees in International Military Operations’, and take action to ensure that the issue is discussed at EU level, before being presented to the UN.</p>
<h2>International emblems in international humanitarian law (Chapter 7)</h2>
<p>In this chapter, we look at the assignment we received through supplementary terms of reference to propose legislative amendments necessary to enable Sweden to ratify Protocol additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Adoption of an Additional Distinctive Emblem (Protocol III), and to review the Act on the Protection of Certain International Distinctive Emblems of Medical Aid, etc. (1953:771) and propose suitable amendments. In the introductory section we give an account of the regulation of international emblems in the Geneva</p>
<p>Conventions and Additional Protocols, and in the Convention on the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, and describe customary law in the area. We then describe how these rules have been implemented in Sweden, as well as the rules in this area that are in place in other Nordic states.</p>
<p>In our considerations, we stress that the use of the emblems that are protected under the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols is reserved for the contracting states’ medical troops, the various organisations of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, and for certain other purposes stated in the treaties that have a link to medical and religious care. In armed conflicts, these emblems are used to distinguish protected religious and medical personnel, as well as other equivalent people and objects such as medical vehicles. Attacking these is regarded as a war crime in breach of international humanitarian law. Additional Protocol III offers the opportunity to use another emblem alongside those of the red cross, the red crescent and the red lion and sun, namely the red crystal , while the requirements for use have been made clearer and more precise and have been enlarged, partly by adding the new possibility of using another emblem, if a special need arises, other than the one a state or its national Red Cross or Red Crescent Society is using. By ratifying the Additional Protocol, Sweden can help to strengthen this protection for the red crystal and other emblems, which are given the same status as the red cross through the Protocol.</p>
<p>To facilitate a ratification of Additional Protocol III, we propose certain amendments to the Act on the Protection of Certain International Distinctive Emblems of Medical Aid, etc. In short, these amendments would mean that  the same protection applies to the red cross, the red crescent, the red lion and sun and the new emblem of the red crystal; that  Swedish military medical and religious personnel are permitted to temporarily use an emblem other than the red cross if it can strengthen their protection; that  the Swedish Red Cross Society is permitted to temporarily use an emblem other than the red cross if this is required to facilitate its activities; and that  Swedish medical and religious personnel taking part in operations under the auspices of the United Nations may, having been granted permission, use an emblem other than the red cross. Moreover, we propose that an information campaign be conducted in collaboration with the</p>
<p>Swedish Red Cross in connection with the ratification of the third Additional Protocol.</p>
<p>As a result of the review we have conducted of the Act on the Protection of Certain International Distinctive Emblems of Medical Aid, etc., we also propose certain amendments to the Act. In summary, these amendments would mean that  the Swedish Red Cross Society is given the direct right by law to use the red cross as an emblem for its activities; that  certain clarifications are made concerning the possibility of Swedish civilian medical services to use the red cross; that  the Act is supplemented with protection for the emblems designating dangerous facilities and certain cultural property; that the Government is given the possibility of delegating the consideration of applications for permission to use all emblems specified in the Act; and that  the penal provisions are made more precise and clear.</p>
<h2>Training and information (Chapter 8)</h2>
<p>A fundamental prerequisite for international humanitarian law to be respected is knowledge of its contents. The importance of such knowledge is expressed in several key treaties in the area, in the form of training and information requirements. Part of our remit was to monitor the extent to which and the way in which Swedish training in international law is currently relevant in terms of content against the background of existing convention commitments. This part of the remit is dealt with in this chapter. To begin with, we give an account of the training and information requirements that apply under international law. In the following section (8.2) we look at the training and information currently provided in Sweden in this area. As documentation for our report, we have gathered information in various ways from government agencies, institutions and organisations, e.g. through the surveys shown in Annex 6. In Section 8.3 we present various views on the need for training and information that agencies and certain other parties have provided us with.</p>
<p>In Section 8.4 we present our own considerations concerning training and information. There, we stress that training and information are of fundamental and decisive importance if international humanitarian law is to have an impact in practice. The requirements international law places on the training of military staff and civilians are not specified; rather, it is down to each state to make its own assessment based on its own military and civilian organisation. However, it is our view that Sweden should have high ambitions when it comes to how the treaty-based and customary law requirements concerning training and information are met.</p>
<p>In our review, we have not found any circumstances to suggest that there are any immediate shortcomings in the military sector  that need to be addressed in order for us to live up to international requirements in the area, even though it has not been possible for us to obtain a full picture of training as there is no central system for follow-up and feedback on training in international law. However, we recommend that the task of the international law advisers in the Swedish Armed Forces’ war organisation be expanded from covering the application of the rules of international law in wartime and in neutrality to also include the application of other rules of international law that have a bearing on military operations, primarily human rights and other legal rules that may apply in peace operations.</p>
<p>When it comes to the civil defence sector , we note that it is clear from the survey we have carried out that the requirement concerning ‘satisfactory training and information’ stated in the Total Defence International Law Ordinance (1990:12) has been of limited effect in causing the agencies responsible, under the Ordinance, for monitoring to provide special information or special training for their staff on the rules of international law that are the focus of the Ordinance. The majority of agencies with monitoring responsibilities provide no special information on or training in international humanitarian law whatsoever. It is also clear that the training in and dissemination of information on international humanitarian law, etc. required by the Ordinance have had lower priority since the beginning of the 1990s and that the international law competence that had previously been built up has been largely lost. Several agencies are very uncertain about whether there is currently a need for special information on or training in international humanitarian law and, if so, what the contents should be. In light of this, we have considered whether there is reason for us to propose amendments to the provision on training, or associated provisions, contained in the Total Defence International Law Ordinance. However, as we see it, it is not the provisions themselves that pose problems, rather it is more a question of how we can, in an appropriate manner, achieve a situation in which relevant agencies receive the support they need when it comes to assessing the need for training and implementing this training.</p>
<p>This development suggests that it is no longer enough to require each agency to be able – on its own and without help – to assess the need for training in international law within that agency and also implement this training. The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency  (Myndigheten för samhällsskydd och beredskap, MSB) already has a coordination responsibility under Section 20 of the Total Defence International Law Ordinance. According to its instructions, this agency also has an overarching responsibility for issues concerning civil defence. Furthermore, the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency has an important role in developing relevant agencies’ planning for heightened alert under the provisions contained in the Emergency Management and Heightened Alert Ordinance (2006:942). In light of this, we consider that it is natural that the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency be given more precise instructions to assist other agencies in the civil defence sector in assessing the need for training in international law, take action to ensure that all agencies concerned receive training and information corresponding to their needs and provide resources for implementing the training needed. We refrain from submitting proposals for what form such instructions should take, but stress that the task definitely goes far beyond what follows from the coordination responsibility that the agency has under the Total Defence International Law Ordinance and that one prerequisite for the task being performed well is, therefore, that the agency receive special resources for this.</p>
<h2>Is a Swedish international humanitarian law manual needed? (Chapter 9)</h2>
<p>The term ‘manual’ is used to denote a number of different publications of varying status. After an introductory section on our remit, we present an overview in Section 9.2 of various forms of international and national manuals.</p>
<p>We present our considerations in Section 9.3. We begin by reiterating that our terms of reference stress the fact that the primary object of a manual is that it should be of practical use. One condition for producing a manual is said to be that it provides</p>
<p>added value for the agencies concerned within the Swedish defence sector. A manual must be clear and user-friendly, and it should explain how military personnel are allowed to act in a way that is easy to understand, but that is nonetheless thorough. On this basis, we consider that, for decision-making at an operational level, there is room for more lucid and clear guidance that would best take the form of a manual.</p>
<p>The fact that the primary purpose of a manual is to provide guidance for military decision-making at an operational level does not mean that a manual cannot also fulfil other important functions and that its design cannot also be adapted to these. In our view, the international law advisers within the Swedish Armed Forces must also be seen as an important target group for a manual. A well-designed manual would doubtless also be very relevant for training and exercises in international humanitarian law. It goes without saying that officers who are to be able to use the manual in practical decision-making must be trained and drilled in its use. Besides this need, a manual can also be important in designing and implementing training in international humanitarian law at the different training stages of the Swedish Armed Forces. This also applies to other staff in the total defence service who are in need of knowledge about international humanitarian law. In summary, we find that a national manual on international humanitarian law meets a range of different needs that, taken together, are strong enough to justify a project to draft a manual.</p>
<p>It is stated in our terms of reference that if we find there is a need for a special national manual on international humanitarian law, we are also required to submit proposals on such a manual. We did not interpret this part of our remit to mean that we are expected to produce a complete and detailed proposal for a manual. What has been possible within the framework of the resources and time the committee has had at its disposal has simply been to present a draft of a Swedish manual on international humanitarian law (see Annex 7).  This draft may make it easier to assess the extent to which a manual is able to meet the needs mentioned above and function as input when deciding on an appropriate design.</p>
<p>We also look at the need for a manual for peace operations in view of the fact that participation in such operations now makes up a major part of the operational activities of the Swedish Armed Forces. The most common situation concerning peace operations in which a Swedish force is participating is that the operation does</p>
<p>not take part in armed conflict. The force is then not formally bound by international humanitarian law and therefore a manual in international humanitarian law would not provide any immediate guidance. In our view, however, there is an equally great need for clear and structured guidance concerning peace operations as there is concerning armed conflicts. There are strong arguments to suggest that the legal issues linked to the use of force and coercion in the context of peace operations in which a Swedish force is not participating in armed conflict are so important that a manual should be drawn up for this purpose too. As the aim is for the issue of legal grounds for the use of force and coercion by Swedish military personnel and police officers in peace operations to be dealt with by a special inquiry, we did not consider that it was part of our remit to consider in any detail how such a manual should be designed.</p>
<p>In summary, we state, among other things, the following:</p>
<p>A manual should not primarily be regarded as an account of positions taken in purely legal terms, rather as rules and guidelines for the actions of our own armed forces  in armed conflicts.</p>
<p>A manual should proceed from the assumption that the same provisions of international humanitarian law are to be observed in the implementation of military operations, irrespective of whether it is an international or  non-international  armed conflict .</p>
<p>A manual should not be limited purely to rules of international humanitarian law; it should also include rules based on human rights . The law of neutrality and occupation  should also be included in a manual. However, this was not covered by our inquiry remit in such a way as to give us cause to draw up a proposal on the regulation of these areas in a manual.</p>
<p>The Swedish Armed Forces should have formal responsibility for both the future drafting and publication of a manual. A manual should be published as a  staff publication within the Swedish Armed Forces, which would indicate that the rules stated in the manual are not formally binding, but that military commanders are obliged to observe the contents of the manual as guidelines. When drafting the manual, the Swedish Armed Forces should  consult the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, the Swedish National Defence College, and  the Total Defence Council for International Law , and carry out the work with the  assistance of academically active experts .  Experts from other states should also be consulted. The work to produce a</p>
<p>manual should also be carried out under the supervision of representatives of the ministries concerned .</p>
<p>Sweden has an interest in clarifying internationally  what is seen in Sweden as applicable international humanitarian law. To what extent this interest should be addressed with the help of regulations in a manual is something that should be assessed when there is a properly functioning manual in place.</p>
