<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Language is of fundamental importance for the individual’s ability to take part in the life of the community. Access to language is also essential for the individual to be able to study, to become informed and acquire knowledge. Being able to participate in the life of the community also requires access to a language that is common to the society and that everyone living in the country understands and can use.</p>
<p>Swedish has long been a stable language. However, as in many other countries, the language situation in Sweden has changed in recent years. It has become more multifaceted and the position of Swedish is no longer as self-evident as it was in the past.</p>
<p>Growing internationalisation is the factor that has had the greatest impact on the status of Swedish in Sweden. This has led, for example, to the increasing use of English in many areas, either replacing Swedish entirely or alongside Swedish. The fact that at least 150 different mother tongues are now spoken in Sweden also places the focus on issues involving the status of Swedish and other languages. Since 2000, five languages have been officially classified as national minority languages in Sweden. The circumstances described above give cause for establishing the status of Swedish and other languages and determining how these languages can best be safeguarded so as to preserve language diversity. The remit of the Language Act Inquiry should be seen in this light.</p>
<p>Remit of the Inquiry</p>
<p>The remit of the Inquiry has been to draft a Language Act regulating the position of the Swedish language. The remit has also included examining whether provisions on the national minority languages and Swedish sign language should be incorporated into a Language</p>
<p>Act. Shedding light on the issue of the Swedish language in international contexts has also been part of the remit.</p>
<p>According to our terms of reference, the Act should give a clear signal of the importance of the Swedish language. On the other hand, the Act should not deal with issues related to linguistic correctness or the use of language in various fields, apart from in public administration. Nor should sanctions be linked with the Act.</p>
<p>Basis for the proposal</p>
<p>The objectives given by the Riksdag for national language policy have formed a basis for the Inquiry. These objectives are:</p>
<p>• The Swedish language is to be the main language in Sweden.</p>
<p>• Swedish is to be a complete language, serving and uniting society.</p>
<p>• Public Swedish is to be cultivated, simple and comprehensible.</p>
<p>• Everyone is to have a right to language: to develop and learn Swedish, to develop and use their own mother tongue or national minority language and to have the opportunity to learn foreign languages.</p>
<p>The Language Act Inquiry proposals are also based on the action programme and proposal for a Language Act that the Committee on the Swedish Language presented in 2002 in the report Mål i mun  (Being able to express oneself) (SOU 2002:27). Account has also been taken in the report of the views of those to whom the legislative proposal was circulated for comment. In addition to this, the work of previous inquiries, including those concerning the national minority languages and Swedish sign language have largely formed the basis for the work of this Inquiry.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has also had extensive contacts with agencies and representatives of organisations and interest groups.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Language Act</p>
<p>The Act will prescribe the status and use in Swedish society of Swedish and other languages. Its provisions are designed with a view to the need for the Act to safeguard both the Swedish language and language diversity in Sweden.</p>
<p>Contents of the Language Act</p>
<p>The purpose of the Act is given in an introductory provision. This is followed by provisions on the status of the Swedish language and its use in public administration and international contexts. The Act also contains provisions on the national minority languages and Swedish sign language. In addition, the Act contains provisions on the responsibility of public authorities for the individual’s access to language.</p>
<p>The Swedish language</p>
<p>The Act establishes that Swedish is the principle language in Sweden. This means that Swedish is the common language in society, which everyone living in Sweden must have access to and be able to use in all sectors of society. According to the Act, public authorities are to have particular responsibility for Swedish being used and developed.</p>
<p>The national minority languages and Swedish sign language</p>
<p>Through accession to conventions, Sami, Finnish, Meänkieli (Tornedal Finnish), Romany chib and Yiddish are national minority languages in Sweden. According to the Inquiry’s proposal, the status of these languages will be incorporated into the Language Act. It is also proposed that public authorities be particularly responsible for protecting and promoting the minority languages.</p>
<p>The Act will also give public authorities particular responsibility for protecting and promoting Swedish sign language.</p>
<p>The use of language in public administration</p>
<p>According to the proposal, the Act is to stipulate that the language of courts of law, administrative agencies and other bodies carrying out tasks in public services be Swedish. National minority languages may be used when appropriate. The provision also contains a reference to the legal right of individuals, in certain cases, to use national minority languages and to provisions on the right in Sweden to use another Nordic language.</p>
<p>According to the proposal, the language of public services is to be cultivated, simple and comprehensible. In other words, courts of law, administrative agencies and other public bodies carrying out tasks in public services are to be obliged to use clear language in their contacts with the general public.</p>
<p>A special provision is proposed on the issue of the development of Swedish terminology. This means that authorities are to have particular responsibility for ensuring that Swedish terms are accessible and are used and developed in each authority’s functional area.</p>
<p>Sweden in international contexts</p>
<p>A provision on Swedish as Sweden’s official language in international contexts is proposed in the Act.</p>
<p>Provisions are also proposed on the need to safeguard the status of Swedish as an official language in the European Union and to ensure that those representing Sweden use Swedish when interpretation is available, unless there are special grounds making it more appropriate to use another language.</p>
<p>Public authorities’ responsibility for the individual’s access to language</p>
<p>According to the proposal, public authorities are to be responsible for the individual’s access to language. Each person living in Sweden is to be given the opportunity to learn, develop and use Swedish. People belonging to a national minority and people requiring sign language are to be given the opportunity to learn, develop and use the minority language or Swedish sign language. People with a mother tongue other than those mentioned above are to be given the opportunity to develop and use their mother tongues.</p>
