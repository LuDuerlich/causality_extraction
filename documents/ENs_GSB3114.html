<p>1 Should the powers to provide international legal assistance within the field of freedom of the press and freedom of expression be increased?</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The detailed constitutional protection for freedom of expression contained in the Swedish Freedom of the Press Act ( Tryckfrihetsförordningen  – TF) and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression ( Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen  – YGL) is unique from the international perspective. In several cases, Sweden has had to decline the provision of international legal assistance because the assistance required would have violated one of the legal principles of freedom of the press and freedom of expression established by the constitution. Such principles include, among other things: the provision of an exclusive penal and tortious liability for certain individuals in specified freedom of the press and freedom of expression offences (the so-called ‘list of freedom of the press offences’); a right in principle to provide and obtain information for publication (communication and procurement right); and a special trial procedure when liability is alleged for freedom of the press and freedom of expression offences. It is part of the Committee’s terms of reference to deliberate on whether the powers to provide international legal assistance within the field of freedom of the press and freedom of expression should be increased.</p>
<p>How great is the problem?</p>
<p>There is no documentary base providing any accurate information about the number of cases where the provision of international legal assistance on the part of Sweden has been impeded by TF and</p>
<p>YGL or what effects this has had on Sweden’s international relations with other countries. However, it is clear that Sweden has in seven cases in recent years rejected requests for international legal assistance owing to TF or YGL. This has probably also occurred in previous cases. It is also clear that in Sweden there is a so-called ‘white-power environment’ that produces CD discs and other material that may be subject to TF or YGL, that this environment has international contacts and that the Swedish producers of whitepower music on disc were among the world leaders during the 1990s.</p>
<p>Points of departure</p>
<p>The provision of international legal assistance must be deemed to be unlawful according to the constitution in those cases where the assistance requested may be deemed to constitute a step aiming at intervention against abuse of the constitutionally protected freedom of the press and freedom of expression and the intervention violates one of the rules contained in the constitutional laws that may be deemed to apply for the statement/utterance. When measures against the suspected perpetrator are excluded owing to TF or YGL, measures against, for instance, the aggrieved party and witnesses that may be deemed to constitute intervention against the perpetrator are also excluded.</p>
<p>When do the principles of freedom of the press and freedom of expression apply?</p>
<p>A fundamental precondition for a conflict to arise between a request for international legal assistance and a legal principle of freedom of the press or freedom of expression is that such principle may be deemed to apply to the statement/utterance in question. For such a principle to apply, it is required that the statement/utterance falls within the ambit of the formal, territorial and material scope of the constitutional laws, that is to say that the statement/utterance satisfies the formal, territorial and material requirements of the constitutional laws. If any of these prerequisites are not satisfied, TF or YGL do not apply and the constitutional laws consequently do not present an impediment to the provision of legal assistance.</p>
<p>In order for the formal requirements  to be satisfied, it is required that the media is of the technical nature referred to in the constitutional laws. As regards written material, it is required among other things that it is produced with a printing press or through stencilling, photocopying or similar technical means, and a database should be arranged so that only those who run the operation can alter its content.</p>
<p>If the matter relates to a medium, the technical nature of which is as referred to in the constitutional laws, certain further requirements are imposed for the media to fall within the formal scope of the constitutional laws. For instance, as regards written material that is produced through stencilling, photocopying or similar technical means, it is also required among other things that it is reproduced or is intended to be reproduced and that it has been disseminated or is intended to be disseminated to others than those who are within a small, private group. The same also applies to technical recordings that are disseminated or are intended to be disseminated through the release of copies (and thus not through public playing/showing).</p>
<p>The territorial requirement  entails the following. Where the act that has given cause for the request for legal assistance, for example the provision of information for publication, has occurred in Sweden, there is no special problem in determining whether the constitutional protection applies. This can be discerned directly from TF and YGL. The outcome depends upon whether the media is released in Sweden: if the media is not released in Sweden, protection only applies (in the form of the prohibition against censorship and impeding measures) for production (e.g. printing) that occurs in Sweden and for (restricted) communication and procurement freedom; if the media is released in Sweden, complete constitutional protection basically applies, but this varies somewhat depending upon among other things where the media was produced.</p>
<p>When the act that has given cause for the request for legal assistance occurred abroad, constitutional protection applies if the media is released in Sweden, regardless of the person’s link with Sweden. Constitutional protection then applies to the extent prescribed by TF and YGL for a medium of the kind involved that is released in Sweden. If the media is not released in Sweden, no other constitutional protection applies than the protection for the production process (as the provisions contained in Chapter 13, Article 6, second paragraph TF and Chapter 10, Article 2 YGL on the</p>
<p>protection of communication for media that is not released in Sweden require, in order to be applicable, that the provision of the information takes place in Sweden).</p>
<p>The material requirements  entail the following. If an offence falls outside the material scope of application, the constitutional laws do not apply and in that case they do not constitute an impediment to Sweden granting a request for international legal assistance. If an offence falls within the material scope of application but is not included in the list of freedom of the press offences or among the offences that are punishable for communication or procurement, it is not punishable within the scope of application of the constitutional laws, but is excluded from liability, and Sweden can in that case not provide international legal assistance regarding such an offence when the constitutional laws are applicable. The ambit of the material scope of application is not entirely clear.</p>
<p>Offences that clearly fall outside the material scope of application include child pornography offences, fraud, dishonest conduct, swindling, falsification offences and procuring. Even offences concerning the rights of originators, offences against the prohibition of certain commercial advertisements, offences against the prohibition of publication of credit information and offences concerning the methods for the procurement of information fall outside the material scope of application.</p>
<p>Of course, the offences that are included in the list of freedom of the press offences clearly fall within the material scope of application. The Committee considers that even the following other offences fall within the material scope of application of the constitutional laws: grave violation of integrity and grave violation of women’s integrity, certain cases of maritime or air traffic sabotage, certain cases of airport sabotage, outrageous conduct towards a public servant, improper activity at election, threat against a superior, seduction of youth, bribery and misuse of office. The following acts, which in certain other countries constitute offences, may also be deemed to fall within the material scope of application of TF and YGL: depiction of so-called bestiality, heresy, denial of the holocaust and offences violating the integrity of private life.</p>
<p>The list of freedom of the press offences has a requirement of double criminality, i.e. that it is also punishable according to ordinary law. This requirement may be deemed to relate to Swedish  law, i.e. the Swedish Penal Code. This requirement, together with the principle of special trial procedure, with its requirements for the</p>
<p>participation of the Chancellor of Justice (JK) and a jury, means that legal assistance relating to intervention owing to an offence according to a foreign law corresponding to an offence within the Swedish list of freedom of the press offences can never be provided according to current Swedish law when TF or YGL applies. The same applies regarding matters of communication and procurement offences, offences that comprise unlawful publication together with offences against any of the provisions referred to in Chapter 1, Sections 8 to 9 TF, concerning among other things copyright and corresponding provisions in the YGL, because in these cases reference is made in a corresponding way to Swedish law.</p>
<p>Should any measure be implemented?</p>
<p>It cannot actually be deemed to have been established that there is any pronounced practical need to increase powers to provide international legal assistance within the field of freedom of the press and freedom of expression, but the legal situation regarding powers to provide such assistance within the area can hardly be deemed to be entirely clear and indeed various opinions are conceivable and have been advanced. Increasing international cooperation may also be expected to result in increasing numbers of matters concerning international legal assistance. It is therefore important to clarify the legal situation regarding powers to provide such assistance. This should be done through the introduction into the constitution of a rule on the provision of international legal assistance.</p>
<p>Should all freedom of the press and freedom of expression principles be afforded the same weight in this context?</p>
<p>As regards current law, the Committee has adopted the position that all freedom of the press and freedom of expression principles are of the same weight and, consequently, that the provision of international legal assistance must be deemed unlawful according to the constitutional law in those cases where the assistance requested may be deemed to constitute a step aiming at intervention against abuse of the constitutionally protected freedom of the press and freedom of expression and the intervention violates one of the rules contained in the constitutional laws that may be deemed to</p>
<p>apply for the statement/utterance. However, the Committee considers that with the aim of increasing powers to provide international legal assistance in the field of freedom of the press and freedom of expression, some deviations from the principle for a special trial procedure may be accepted. It should also be possible to accept a relaxation of the requirement according to the principle of a special list of freedom of the press offences that an act should be punishable according to Swedish  law, providing that the act constituting the offence in foreign law corresponds to an offence according to TF or YGL.</p>
<p>The Committee’s proposal</p>
<p>A new rule on international legal assistance should be introduced into Chapter 14 TF and a reference to this included in Chapter 11 YGL. These rules mean that international legal assistance may be provided in certain cases where TF or YGL are applicable to the statement/utterance or communication/procurement that forms the basis of the request. The assistance can then be provided regarding an act that constitutes an offence against foreign law if a corresponding act is liable as a freedom of the press or freedom of expression offence or a communication or procurement offence. The assistance can be provided although the procedural rules for the trial in the applicant country will not correspond to the special Swedish procedural rules according to TF or YGL, with JK and jury. Assistance can also be provided on matters concerning an act that constitutes an offence against a foreign law corresponding to an act constituting an offence against one of the provisions referred to in Chapter 1, Sections 8 and 9 TF concerning inter alia copyright. JK should always make a statement of views before assistance may be provided, and in matters of political offences the assistance may only be provided with the consent of the Government. A review must always be conducted of whether the procedural rules applied are acceptable. The procedural rules must, in any event, satisfy the requirements of the European Convention for it to be possible to provide legal assistance.</p>
<p>A supplement should be made to Chapter 13, Section 6, second paragraph TF and Chapter 10, Section 2 YGL in order to make it clear that a precondition for the protection for communication and procurement of media that is not released in Sweden to apply</p>
<p>according to these statutory provisions is that the communication or procurement took place in Sweden. Through such a supplement, it will be made clear that international legal assistance can be provided in relation to a matter involving the communication or procurement for media that is not released in Sweden, provided the communication or procurement took place abroad.</p>
<p>2 Review of list of offences</p>
<p>On 1 January 2003, the list of the freedom of the press offences contained in TF was extended – with an impact also on YGL – for four new offences; unlawful threat, threat to public servant, interference in a judicial matter and civil liberties offences. The list of offences contained in TF includes 18 offences after this extension. The terms of reference of the Freedom of the Press and Freedom of Expression Committee include conducting a review of the list of offences.</p>
<p>The Committee interprets its terms of reference in this respect to mean that it should deliberate on whether some of the offences included in the list of offences prior to the extension in 2003 should be deleted. The Committee proceed on the basis that it is not intended that any offence should be dealt with in the way that the child pornography offence was dealt with, i.e. be excluded from the scope of the application of the constitutional laws by redefinition so that the offence would fall under the provisions of an ordinary law statute when it is committed within media protected by the constitution. Consequently, the Committee proceeds on the basis that if any offence is to be deleted from the list of offences, it should thereafter be excluded from liability if it is committed within a constitutionally protected media.</p>
<p>It is not a purpose in itself that the list of offences should be short. The aim must be that it should include those acts that there is reason to penalise as freedom of the press and freedom of expression offences.</p>
<p>The Committee considers that no offence should now be deleted from the list of offences. The reasons for this are the following.</p>
<p>1) Freedom of the press offences in the nature of wartime offences and the like</p>
<p>(high treason, instigating war, sedition, treason, treachery, negligence harmful to the country and spreading rumours endangering the security of the Realm)</p>
<p>These offences may indeed appear to be irrelevant under peaceful conditions, but may be of importance in adverse times. They constitute a legislation passed in view of wartime conditions and the like intended to have effect in adverse times when it is quite conceivable that perpetrators would use media protected by constitutional law to achieve their aims. The fact that several offences have been included in the excepted cases, when, besides the individual person responsible, the communicator may also be punished, indicate that the legislator to date has viewed these offences very seriously. If the offences are deleted, they will be excluded from liability if they are committed within media protected by constitutional law. What should be deliberated upon is whether these offences can be more clearly defined in the Penal Code.</p>
<p>2) Freedom of the press offences regarding secret information</p>
<p>(espionage, unauthorised dealing with secret information and negligence with secret information)</p>
<p>The criminalisation of these acts is important for the protection of national security. The fact that two offences have been included in the cases exempted when, besides the individual responsible, the communicator may also be punished, indicates that the legislator to date has viewed these offences very seriously. If the offences are deleted, the disclosure of secret information of importance to national security would be excluded from liability if it occurs within media protected by constitutional laws.</p>
<p>3) Freedom of the press offences towards other public interests</p>
<p>(inciting unlawful behaviour, agitation against a national or ethnic group and unlawful depiction of violence)</p>
<p>It should also be possible in the future to punish those who within media protected by constitutional law incite or try to deceive the public into committing offences, neglect their civic duties or</p>
<p>disrespect public authority, i.e. commit incitement of unlawful behaviour . The rules for the processing of freedom of the press and freedom of information cases with the JK, jury and the instruction to rather acquit than convict ensure that the incitement of unlawful behaviour provision is applied without threatening the freedom of expression. It should be considered whether this offence can be more clearly defined in the Penal Code.</p>
<p>It should also be possible in the future to punish agitation against  for example a national or ethnic group  and unlawful depiction of violence  that is committed within media protected by constitutional law.</p>
<p>4) Freedom of the press offences against individuals</p>
<p>(defamation and insulting behaviour)</p>
<p>Defamation  is the most common freedom of the press and freedom of expression offence. The European Convention requires that legal protection is provided against violation of an individual’s private and family life. It should also be possible in the future to punish defamation committed within media protected by constitutional law.</p>
<p>It is actually difficult to contemplate cases where a statement/utterance within media protected by constitutional law is directed to the party affected in the manner required for insulting behaviour  to exist. However, set against the background of the requirements of the European Convention for protection of an individual’s private and family life and the extension of the constitutional law protection to cover new forms of computer communication, there may be a need to be able to refer violations of integrity that do not constitute defamation under the insulting behaviour provision.</p>
<p>3 Information about origin for technical recordings produced abroad</p>
<p>According to YGL, technical recordings shall be furnished with details of who has commissioned the production of the recording and also regarding when, where and by whom the recording is produced. This obligation, which among other things is important for the opportunity to trace someone who can be held responsible</p>
<p>for a freedom of expression offence in the recordings, rests with the party who produced the copies.</p>
<p>A corresponding obligation also applies to recordings that are produced abroad. For such recordings, the provisions applicable to the person who commissions the production of the recording (the producer) apply to the importer. Such recordings shall thus be furnished with inter alia details of who the importer is. However, the obligation to furnish the recordings with this information does not rest with the importer but the person who produces the copies. However, as regards imported recordings, the person who produces the copies is located abroad and is thus hardly accessible to the Swedish authorities.</p>
<p>MGU (Freedom of Expression Law Commision – Mediegrundlagsutredningen  SOU 2002:28) proposed that the regulation of details of origin for technical recordings that are produced abroad should be replaced by a new provision, which require the importer to furnish the recordings with details of who has released them for dissemination and when they were brought into the county. However, the Government considered that it was unclear how the proposal related to the prohibition contained in the EC Treaty against quantitative import restrictions and measures having corresponding effect.</p>
<p>The Freedom of the Press and Freedom of Expression Committee shall, set against the background of that stated above, propose an appropriate solution to the problem with details of origin for technical recordings produced abroad.</p>
<p>The Committee considers that it is possible that the European Court of Justice (ECJ) should assess MGU’s proposal for regulation as a measure with corresponding effect but that in this case it must be deemed to be a permitted exceptional case as the purpose with the regulation is that we should be able to maintain our protection of freedom of expression laid down in constitutional law and be able to prosecute freedom of expression offences. These reasons must be deemed to be at least equally compelling as those reasons that the ECJ has accepted in other contexts. Nor does the exemption go further than necessary. The Committee thus considers that the solution proposed by MGU does not violate the EC law prohibition on quantitative import restrictions and measures having corresponding effect.</p>
<p>The Committee has not been able to find any other solution to the problem with details of origin for technical recordings produced</p>
<p>abroad. Consequently, the solution proposed by MGU should be implemented.</p>
<p>This solution entails the following. The provisions contained in Chapter 3, Section 13 YGL on details of origin shall not apply to technical recordings that are produced abroad and released for dissemination in Sweden. Instead, a special rule on details of origin for such recordings shall be introduced in Chapter 10, Section 3 YGL. According to the new rule, the recording should be furnished with details of who, here in Sweden, has released them for dissemination and when the copy was brought into Sweden. This obligation is imposed on the importer. A special rule shall be introduced in Chapter 4, Section 2 of the Implementation Act whereby the obligation to show details on imported recordings shall, whenever possible, be conducted in the same way as in relation to recordings produced in Sweden. Otherwise the obligation shall be satisfied by the details being affixed to a cover, sleeve or similar object.</p>
<p>4 Joint processing of freedom of the press and freedom of expression cases</p>
<p>Since 1 January 2003, cases concerning freedom of the press and freedom of expression offences that are related with each other can be entertained by any of the district courts that is a competent court. The same also applies for freedom of the press or freedom of expression cases relating to private claims owing to such offences and also for cases where the action is brought exclusively for the confiscation of printed material or technical recordings. The cases shall be processed as one action unless there are extraordinary reasons for not doing so.</p>
<p>The terms of reference of the Freedom of the Press and Freedom of Expression Committee include deliberating on whether powers should be introduced for the Supreme Court, upon the request of a party or a court, to decide to consolidate for joint processing at one court such cases as are pending at different courts.</p>
<p>The Committee considers that there is value in having a local assessment of freedom of the press and freedom of expression cases. A questionnaire has also shown that there have only been a few cases where the application of a rule of the kind now in question could apply. The procedural economic gains that may be made are</p>
<p>also small. Having regard to this, the Committee has accepted that such a rule should not be introduced.</p>
<p>The Committee considers that the merger of counties gives cause to review the Ordinance on the competence of certain district courts to entertain freedom of the press and freedom of expression cases. The Committee also points out that the ongoing work with altering the district court structure in the County of Stockholm may not be allowed to entail it becoming unclear which court in the future will be the freedom of the press and freedom of expression court.</p>
<p>5 Certain problems in application</p>
<p>Print-on-demand production of technical recordings without details of origin</p>
<p>It is often difficult to determine whether YGL applies to technical recordings that are produced by print-on-demand (production of individual copies on order), as these recordings usually do not have the prescribed details of origin and nor is it indicated by a copy found whether it is part of an edition or not.</p>
<p>A possible amendment of the fundamental preconditions for the application of YGL to technical recordings is far too great an issue to be deliberated on now as a possible solution to these problems. The issue will be dealt with in the future work in conjunction with the question of ensuring a more technology independent constitutional law protection for freedom of expression. The Committee limits itself to reporting its view on what, according to the current legislation and practice, applies regarding the preconditions for YGL to become applicable to technical recordings without details of origin.</p>
<p>It follows from the prohibition against censorship that the constitutional law protection applies already during the production process. Consequently, it is not only the verified dissemination that determines the issue of the existence of constitutional law protection.</p>
<p>YGL applies to technical recordings without details of origin that are produced by print-on-demand operations, subject only to the precondition that the orders are received or can be expected to be received to such an extent that an edition comprising at least some ten identical copies are produced or are intended to be produced during a period of about one month at the most. When a sufficient</p>
<p>number of recordings have not yet been ordered or produced when the issue of constitutional law protection arises, the starting point should be that the recordings do not fall within the ambit of the constitutional law protection as print-on-demand operations only involve recordings being produced on order. For constitutional law protection to then apply, it should be indicated that the circumstances are such that it can be expected that at least some ten orders will be received within a period of one month at the most. A producer who wishes to be sure of constitutional law protection should produce a sufficient edition when orders start to be received. The mere fact that a technical recording has been advertised for sale does not mean that it falls within the ambit of YGL.</p>
<p>Certain consequential problems</p>
<p>One consequence of the issue of the scope of YGL being difficult to determine and may require extensive evidence is that actions in freedom of the press and freedom of expression cases may be dismissed following several years of proceedings and that in some cases it may be unclear for a considerable time whether JK or a public prosecutor is competent.</p>
<p>The Committee considers that these problems cannot be resolved either by a rule providing that the accused shall be compelled to  no later than during the preparatory stage of the proceedings challenge  the application of YGL in order to have that issue considered or by a rule providing that, for example, the Supreme Court should be able to make a binding decision  on the matter. One practical implication of such solutions would be that if it only became clear to the court that YGL was not applicable following the preparatory stage of the proceedings in the case or the binding decision, the court would nevertheless be compelled to erroneously entertain the case as a freedom of expression case with among other things a jury and perhaps also at the wrong forum. This could possibly be to the disadvantage of the accused as special rules of responsibility without requirements for ordinary intent apply in freedom of expression cases. An obligation for the accused to present a challenge would also mean that the issue of constitutional protection could be answered in different ways in separate cases regarding one and the same medium owing to the accused persons acting differently.</p>
<p>Rules on a parallel competence  for JK to investigate and bring an action at the same time against the same person for both a freedom of the press or freedom of expression offence and corresponding Penal Code offence would mean that the issue of liability could possibly be determined more rapidly than today. However, in the opinion of the Committee, it is not clear that the problem is so great that there is reason to make an already complicated field of law even more complicated by introducing rules on parallel competence. The Committee therefore refrains from presenting any proposal regarding this.</p>
<p>In order to ameliorate the effects of the difficulties that exist, one might possibly deliberate upon the introduction of a time limitation rule  whereby the service of prosecution papers for freedom of the press and freedom of expression cases would constitute in relation to the accused a suspension of the limitation period restriction as regards a corresponding Penal Code offence. This rule could possibly be formulated so that it also covers the reverse situation, i.e. that the service of prosecution for a Penal Code offence would also in relation to the accused suspend the limitation period regarding the corresponding freedom of the press and freedom of expression offence. However, it must be noted that a manifest disadvantage with such a rule is that it would entail the issue of liability remaining undetermined for an indefinite period. The Committee considers that there is not sufficient justification to introduce such a rule on time limitations.</p>
<p>A public prosecutor is entitled to implement those measures required to enable him to assess whether there is reason to assume that constitutional law protection exists. As soon as he concludes that there are such reasons, he should hand the matter over to JK for consideration. This does not need to be laid down in a special rule.</p>
<p>New dissemination of a technical recording by public playing /showing</p>
<p>It is only public playing/showing of technical recordings for which the time limit  of freedom of expression offences have already occurred  according to YGL that are dealt with. The Committee considers that it is clear that the dissemination by public playing or showing of a technical recording for which the time limit for a freedom of expression offence has already elapsed shall be regarded in the same</p>
<p>way as dissemination by the release of copies of such a ‘time-barred recording’, i.e. the dissemination shall not be deemed to be a new freedom of expression offence but shall be excluded from liability. The reason for this is that the protection according to YGL is linked to certain media – radio and television broadcasts, databases and technical recordings – and that public playing or showing of a technical recording is not a ‘medium’ but a ‘means’ of dissemination. New dissemination of a ‘time-barred recording’ is excluded from liability.</p>
<p>The prohibition of refusal to forward written material and technical recordings contained in Chapter 6, Section 4 TF and Chapter 3, Section 10 YGL</p>
<p>This became a pertinent issue in conjunction with the 2002 election, when Posten AB did not distribute certain election material to households. The constitutional law rule prohibiting refusal to forward only applies to the extent that there is a public law obligation to convey written material or technical recordings according to provisions outside the constitutional laws. Posten AB’s obligation today to ensure that everyone in Sweden can have addressed dispatches conveyed is more extensive than the obligation which the Government Postal Agency had at the time of TF’s entry into force (1950). The overall opportunities to reach a large group of recipients with the same communication is also significantly greater now than around 1947 to 1949. These changed circumstances mean that a refusal to forward today would not have such extensive effects as at the time TF was passed. The conclusion of the Committee is that there is no cause now to propose any amendment of the constitutional law provisions concerning prohibition of refusal to forward. There are reasons in another context to deliberate upon a special regulation of the obligation to convey unaddressed election material and the like.</p>
<p>The rule on web transmissions contained in Chapter 1, Section 6 YGL</p>
<p>The Committee proposes that the wording of YGL’s rule on web transmissions contained in Chapter 1, Section 6, first paragraph, second sentence should be adjusted so that it is clarified first that</p>
<p>what is encompassed by the rule – and what was thus intended – is the provision to the public on special request of web transmissions that comprise direct broadcast or playing of previous recordings that start at times that the sender decides, second that among other things unmoderated chatrooms fall outside the rule. An amendment should also be made to the database rule, which exempts from the scope of the database rule web transmissions falling within the ambit of Chapter 1, Section 6, first paragraph, second sentence YGL.</p>
