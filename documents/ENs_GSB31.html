<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Statements by witnesses, parties and other persons providing evidence (witnesses) are an essential element of the efficient administration of justice. The occurrence of serious forms of threats and violence towards witnesses and their relatives therefore constitutes a major impediment to the work in combating crime. If the public cannot offer witnesses sufficient protection from such attacks, there is a risk that they will opt not to cooperate with the police, which in its turn means that serious crimes may remain unresolved. Threats and violence against employees within the public legal services and other exposed groups also constitute an ever greater problem.</p>
<p>We have in Sweden for many years viewed attempts to sabotage legal proceedings by influencing witnesses through violence or threats as very serious. The same also applies to attacks against other vulnerable categories of persons. The police obviously play an important role in the work with protecting and helping vulnerable persons. However, there is currently no national system of rules regarding the work of the police regarding protection of persons subject to serious threats. This means that the security measures that can be implemented vary throughout Sweden. In order to achieve uniformity, the work of the police should therefore be coordinated nationally. This primarily involves the introduction of uniform provisions concerning protective measures, working methods and routines.</p>
<p>Set against this background, we have been given the assignment to formulate a national programme for the protection of witnesses and others, and to submit proposals on matters related to such a programme. A proposal by the National Police Board (RPS) on a programme of action for the protection of witnesses, from December 2000, formed a basis for our work.</p>
<h2>Our proposals A national programme for personal security A new act</h2>
<p>We propose that  a national programme for personal security is introduced. The programme should be governed by a special act. In this way, a uniform model for personal security work will be established throughout Sweden.</p>
<p>Certain fundamental issues will be covered by the act such as the preconditions for the application of the programme, the procedure for decision-making and the right to appeals.</p>
<h2>Persons who may be accepted into the programme</h2>
<p>The programme is aimed at covering a narrow group of people.</p>
<p>In the first instance, it is intended that it will be applied regarding witnesses who participate in preliminary investigations or trials concerning serious or organised criminality, and closely related persons. ‘Witnesses’ here means both the aggrieved party and witnesses, but also suspects and the accused. Experience has shown that it is regarding the latter group that the more complicated protection issues arise.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the programme may be applied concerning employees within the public legal services, for example police officers and closely related persons.</p>
<p>Finally, the programme can also be applied concerning other persons if there are special reasons. For instance it may apply to politicians, journalists and other vulnerable groups.</p>
<h2>Preconditions for the application of the programme</h2>
<p>A primary precondition for a person being accepted into the programme is that there is a manifest risk of criminality that is directed against his or her or a closely related person’s life, health, liberty or freedom.</p>
<p>In order for a witness to be accepted it is in addition required that: 1) the information provided by the witness is assessed to be of significance to the possibility of achieving sufficient cause to prosecute and a conviction, 2) there is a link between the risk of crime and the information that the witness provide, 3) the witness consents to undergoing the programme and is considered to comply with the conditions that are imposed, 4) the witness is entitled to permanently stay in Sweden, and 5) other security measures are considered insufficient.</p>
<p>In order for the programme to be applied concerning other persons than witnesses it is required that the preconditions under 3 to 5 are satisfied. As regards employees within the public legal services it is also required that there is a link between the risk of a crime and the service.</p>
<h2>Responsibility for processing</h2>
<p>The protection of threatened persons is mainly a police issue. The police should therefore have the main responsibility for the programme.</p>
<p>However, the prison and probation service should also have certain responsibility for the programme. This applies to those persons against whom a sentence of imprisonment is being enforced. However, the police should have responsibility for inmates who are spending time outside the institution pursuant to Section 34 of the Act on Correctional Treatment in Institutions (KvaL).</p>
<p>The police and the prison and probation service should cooperate with each other and with other public bodies that are affected by a personal security matter. The work of public authorities outside the programme can be very important for the programme to succeed. This may, for example, concern financial support by the social welfare services, medical assistance by the health care services and protection of personal data within the population registration service.</p>
<h2>Acceptance</h2>
<p>An application for acceptance into the programme may be made by a person who applies for protection under the programme, a public authority investigating a crime related to the acceptance or the prison and probation service. The issue of acceptance may also be taken up by the police on their own volition.</p>
<p>An application for acceptance should be made to a policy authority. If the preconditions are satisfied, acceptance should be granted.</p>
<p>The police may impose conditions for the implementation of the programme, with which the individual is liable to comply.</p>
<h2>Content of the programme</h2>
<p>A person who has been accepted into the programme should receive assistance with the security measures that are considered necessary and possible to implement, for example protected housing.</p>
<p>The individual should also obtain assistance with contacts with the public authorities and other matters required to implement the programme.</p>
<h2>Exit</h2>
<p>A police authority may decide on exit from the programme, if any of the preconditions for applying it no longer exists.</p>
<h2>Appeals</h2>
<p>A decision rejecting an application for acceptance into the programme or a decision on exit from the programme may be appealed against to the RPS.</p>
<h2>Secrecy</h2>
<p>In order to ensure that the work with the personal security programme functions, the secrecy legislation must be formulated in an appropriate way. Details of those protected under the programme and similarly information about police working methods and routines may not end up in the wrong hands. We therefore propose that new provisions are introduced into the Secrecy Act.</p>
<h2>Future cooperation with other countries</h2>
<p>An important element of personal security work is to move the threatened person far away from the threat itself. However, Sweden is a rather small country, and it is therefore not always easy to achieve sufficient security by a move within the country.</p>
<p>There are currently no routines for exchanges between Sweden and other countries, as it is normally a precondition for international cooperation that the countries that participate have a fully developed national programme of action. When the Swedish programme is adopted, opportunities will therefore be opened for cooperation with other countries.</p>
<h2>Financial compensation to threatened persons</h2>
<p>A person subject to serious threats is not only exposed to human suffering but is also often adversely affected by financial problems. The person threatened perhaps must move to another district, which can involve additional costs for housing and moving expenses and also reduced income in conjunction with changing job.</p>
<p>We therefore propose that those who are subject to measures in the new programme should be entitled to compensation from the Government, so-called personal security compensation.  It should also be possible to pay such compensation to other persons who are at risk of being exposed to criminality directed at their life, health, liberty or freedom, provided there are extraordinary reasons.</p>
<p>Personal security compensation should be granted to a reasonable extent for expenses, lost earnings, disruption of business operations and loss in connection with disposal of property caused by measures to prevent crime.</p>
<p>Matters concerning personal security compensation should be considered by the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority.</p>
<h2>Procedural issues</h2>
<p>Various procedural problems can arise in conjunction with the processing of cases and matters at court when one of the parties has protected personal data.</p>
<p>One of the problems is the difficulty for the plaintiff in choosing the right forum when secrecy applies regarding the defendant’s address details. In order to resolve this problem we propose that special forum rules should be introduced for such situations. On the part of the general courts, a general forum rule will be introduced. As regards enforcement in family cases, a special forum rule on the part of the county administrative courts will be introduced into the Parental Code.</p>
<p>Another procedural issue concerns the need for measures aimed at preventing that a witness, owing to fear of reprisals, changes statements previously made or refrains from providing such statements at a main hearing. In this respect we propose that the RPS and the Office of the Prosecutor-General (RÅ) are given the assignment of formulating guidelines for the video recording of questionings with witnesses who are at risk of being exposed to criminality directed against life, health, liberty or freedom.</p>
<h2>Financial consequences</h2>
<p>International experience shows that protective programmes are very costly, as effective security work entails great expense. Moreover, the costs for a programme tend to increase year by year depending on an increasing number being accepted into the programme but few leaving it.</p>
<p>We have estimated that our proposal will entail costs for the Government of an estimated 50 million kronor for the first year, of which 40 million kronor is referable to the programme and 10 million kronor to the new form of compensation. In time, as more persons are brought into the programme, it is expected that these costs will increase by some millions each year.</p>
<p>Some of the costs of the programme are already covered by the costs that the police currently incur for personal protection work. The difference is balanced by substantial savings in the form of non-occurring costs for the public and for individuals.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>Our proposals do not require very extensive preparations. It is also important that it is possible to commence the personal security programme as soon as possible. We therefore consider that it should enter into force on 1 January 2005.</p>
