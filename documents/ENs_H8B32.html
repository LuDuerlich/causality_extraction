<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Under Swedish law, marriages are monogamous. A person who is already married is not permitted to enter into a new marriage. However, polygamous marriages are permitted in many other countries. As a main rule, foreign polygamous marriages are not recognised in Sweden if at least one of the parties was a Swedish citizen or if Sweden was their habitual place of residence when the marriage was entered into. However, if it is a matter of a situation in which the parties had no such ties to Sweden when the polygamous marriage was entered into and then move here, some authorities, such as the Swedish Tax Agency, have to date considered such marriages entered into abroad as valid. Against this background, there are foreign polygamous marriages in Sweden that are legally recognised in some contexts.</p>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s overarching remit is to investigate how a strong and fit-for-purpose regulation against foreign polygamous marriages can be guaranteed. The Inquiry is to propose how recognition of foreign polygamous marriages can be prevented in Sweden or how foreign polygamous marriages in other ways can be prevented from existing here. The remit also includes considering legislative amendments concerning other foreign marriages not recognised in Sweden under the Act on Certain International Legal Relationships in respect of Marriage and Guardianship (1904:26 p.1), including if the existing requirements concerning ties should be maintained for non-recognition.</p>
<h2>Stricter rules on foreign polygamous marriages – a main rule on  non-recognition regardless of ties</h2>
<p>Polygamous marriages involving persons without ties to Sweden are currently not covered by the recognition ban in Chapter 1, Section 8a, first paragraph, point 2 of the Act on Certain International Legal Relationships in respect of Marriage and Guardianship, which entails that a foreign marriage is not recognised if one of the parties was already married at the time the marriage was entered into. It is not clear whether such marriages can instead be denied recognition with reference to public order.</p>
<p>In practice, the foreign polygamous marriages that are relevant for recognition in Sweden exclusively concern men who are married to several women. It is discriminatory that men are permitted to enter into marriages with several spouses. Polygamous marriage involves a view of marriage that is incompatible with the principle of equal treatment of spouses, upon which Swedish law is based, and gender equality requirements. Moreover, polygamous marriages are foreign to the Swedish legal order from a systematic perspective and can result in application problems that are difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>Against this background, legislation on foreign polygamous marriages should be made stricter. The Inquiry proposes that marriages entered into by a person who is already married should, as a rule, not be recognised in Sweden – even if the parties had no ties to Sweden when the marriage was entered into. The same should apply to marriages entered into despite one of the parties in question being a partner in a registered partnership.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposal remedies the lack of clarity concerning the application of public order and ensures greater protection against the existence of legally valid polygamous marriages in Sweden.</p>
<p>The proposal means that foreign polygamous marriages are regulated in accordance with what already applies to foreign child marriages and forced marriages. In the Inquiry’s view, this kind of system is the most appropriate measure for ensuring stricter legislation on foreign polygamous marriages. It has a number of advantages compared with other potential measures focused on preventing marriages from continuing to exist in Sweden, such as a system of forced dissolution corresponding to that which applies to polygamous marriages entered into under Swedish law (cf. Chapter 5, Section 5, third paragraph of the Marriage Code).</p>
<p>The rule the Inquiry proposes concerning non-recognition should be combined with the possibility to make exceptions so as to avoid unreasonable consequences for the persons affected and to live up to Sweden’s obligations under European law. Having considered various solutions and particularly taken into account the need to guarantee the economic rights of individuals, and above all women, the Inquiry proposes that it should be possible to make exceptions from the recognition ban if there are exceptional grounds for doing so.</p>
<h2>The requirement concerning ties should also be removed for cases regarding relatives – but retained for proxy marriages</h2>
<p>Marriages between relatives</p>
<p>The provision regulating foreign polygamous marriages also covers cases regarding relatives, i.e. marriages that would have come under Chapter 2, Section 3 of the Marriage Code if they had been entered into in Sweden (Chapter 1, Section 8a, first paragraph, point 2 of the Act on Certain International Legal Relationships in respect of Marriage and Guardianship). Under existing law, such marriages are not, as a main rule, recognised if at least one of the parties had ties to Sweden when the marriage was entered into. If no such ties exist, there is no explicit recognition ban.</p>
<p>Marriages between relatives, regardless of origin, can be considered objectionable from the perspective of the Swedish legal order, and cohabitation between the relatives concerned is not normally considered acceptable. There are therefore reasons for expanding the recognition ban in the Act on Certain International Legal Relationships in respect of Marriage and Guardianship. The Inquiry therefore proposes that the requirement concerning ties should be removed, meaning that the existence of such marriages is combated in all situations. However, it should be possible, as an exception, to recognise a foreign marriage between relatives that is covered by the provision on non-recognition if there are exceptional grounds for doing so.</p>
<p>Proxy marriages</p>
<p>Proxy marriages are marriages entered into without the presence of both parties. Such marriages are common occurrences in large parts of the world, but cannot be validly entered into in Sweden (Chapter 4, Section 2 of the Marriage Code).</p>
<p>Under existing law, a marriage entered into under foreign law is not recognised if the parties were not present at the same time when the marriage was entered into and at least one of them had ties to Sweden at the time (Chapter 1, Section 8a, first paragraph, point 4 of the Act on Certain International Legal Relationships in respect of Marriage and Guardianship).</p>
<p>As a lack of consent can more easily be masked when one of the parties is not present at a marriage ceremony, there is a link between the question of coercion and the Marriage Code’s requirement that the parties are present. Although the starting point of the Inquiry is that there is reason to combat marriages entered into involuntarily even where there are no ties to Sweden, it would be too far-reaching a measure to remove the requirement concerning ties. Proxy marriages can be entered into voluntarily without the parties being personally present at the same time for reasons that have nothing to do with a lack of consent. Therefore, the Inquiry considers that proxy marriages should continue to be covered by the provisions in Chapter 1, Section 8a of the Act on Certain International Legal Relationships in respect of Marriage and Guardianship only if at least one of the parties had ties to Sweden through citizenship or habitual residence at the time the marriage was entered into. It should therefore continue to be the case that marriages entered into involuntarily in cases where there are no ties to Sweden should be combated using the ban on recognition of forced marriages that is contained in the same section.</p>
<h2>Other assessments and proposals concerning the regulation of foreign marriages</h2>
<p>No other amendments to the Act on Certain International</p>
<p>Legal Relationships in respect of Marriage and Guardianship</p>
<p>The ban on the recognition of child and forced marriages (Chapter 1, Section 8a, first paragraph, points 1 and 3) does not contain any requirements concerning ties to Sweden. The provisions on child marriage were made stricter in 2019 and the Inquiry has made the assessment that there is no reason to propose any legislative amendments in this regard. Nor has the Inquiry found any reason to make any legislative proposals concerning forced marriage.</p>
<p>Examinations by the authorities</p>
<p>The issue of recognising a foreign marriage can be examined in different contexts and by different authorities. As a rule, a decision by one authority, such as registration of a marriage in the population register by the Swedish Tax Agency, is not binding in other contexts. However, a spouse wishing to have the question of a marriage’s validity in Sweden definitively settled has the possibility to begin proceedings to establish whether or not the marriage is valid (see Chapter 14, Sections 1 and 2 of the Marriage Code).</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that there is no reason to change this system for how matters concerning the recognition of foreign marriages are examined.</p>
<p>The Inquiry however proposes an amendment concerning the provision in Chapter 5, Section 5, third paragraph of the Marriage Code. This provision gives the prosecutor the possibility to begin proceedings on the forced dissolution of certain marriages, including those entered into when one of the parties was already married. It was introduced in view of marriages entered into under Swedish law. In practice it is not applied in relation to foreign marriages. Moreover, as this is an optional provision, its scope of application is very limited. Those foreign marriages that the provision applies to are only those that in special cases may be recognised on exceptional grounds according to Chapter 1, Section 8a of the Act on Certain International Legal Relationships in respect of Marriage and Guardianship. The Inquiry therefore proposes that Chapter 5, Section 5 of the Marriage Code should be made clearer so that the provision on the prosecutor’s right to begin proceedings only applies to marriages entered into under Swedish law.</p>
<p>A clearer children’s perspective in the Act on International Paternity Questions (1985:367)</p>
<p>Provisions on the paternity of children in international situations are contained in the Act on International Paternity Questions (1985:367). Section 2 of the Act on International Paternity Questions regulates the applicable law for the issue of paternity directly based on foreign law, in the form of legal paternity presumptions based on marriage. A man who is or has been married to a child’s mother is to be considered the child’s father when it follows from the law in the state in which the child had their habitual residence at birth or, if no one is to be considered the child’s father under that law, when it follows from the law in a state of which the child became a citizen at birth. However, if the child obtained habitual residence in Sweden at birth, the issue must always be assessed under Swedish law.</p>
<p>The design of the provision means that the man in the marriage is not considered to be the child’s father in Sweden if he is not considered to be married to the child’s mother under the provisions of the Act on Certain International Legal Relationships in respect of Marriage and Guardianship.</p>
<p>From a children’s perspective, there is reason to apply the provision in Section 2 of the Act on International Paternity Questions in such a way that paternity based directly on foreign law applies even if the marriage itself is not recognised in Sweden, but is valid in the country where the child had their habitual residence at birth. The same applies in situations where paternity follows from the law in the foreign state of which the child became a citizen at birth.</p>
<p>To ensure application of Section 2 of the Act on International Paternity Questions that is compatible with the best interests of the child, the Inquiry proposes that a new provision should be included in this Section clarifying that the question of whether a man is or has been married to the child’s mother must, in this context, always be assessed under the law of the state that applies for presumption of paternity.</p>
<h2>Better information to persons concerned</h2>
<p>The provisions on recognition of foreign marriages can be difficult to understand, especially for persons who have recently moved to Sweden. Against this background, the government should consider giving the Swedish Tax Agency the task of producing standardised and easy-to-understand information about the recognition of foreign marriages in Sweden that can be given to persons concerned. This information should be given to individuals when issues concerning foreign marriages arise, primarily by the Swedish Tax Agency and the Swedish Migration Agency, but also by other authorities when necessary.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional regulations</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the legislative amendments enter into force on 1 July 2021. Older provisions on recognition in the Act on Certain International Legal Relationships in respect of Marriage and Guardianship should however apply to marriages entered into before entry into force.</p>
