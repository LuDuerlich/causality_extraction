<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Committee on Threats and Violence against Elected Representatives initiated its work during autumn 2004 and will complete it during April 2006. The task of the Committee is to examine the level of crimes against elected representatives, to discuss the implications of this type of crime to democracy, and to analyse what type of support and assistance is given to elected representatives against whom crimes are committed.</p>
<p>This summary accounts in brief for the main conclusions of the report to be submitted by the Committee.</p>
<h2>On Democracy and Ethics</h2>
<p>The Committee wishes to emphasize the importance of the internal as well as the public discussion held by the political parties and by the elected representatives on the rules and criteria governing the democratic process. It is of further importance that the elected representatives show a large degree of respect for their role as decision-making authorities and that they in carrying out their duties are seen as exemplary servants of democracy. Elected representatives should dedicate a large amount of their energy to external processes in dialogue with citizens, activities that should also be prioritized in their time-schedules. In addition it is essential that the procedure for payment of fees for so called pastime politicians at the county and municipal levels is set up in a way as to prevent that the representatives decline to accept assignments or to take part in meetings with the citizens due to economic reasons or due to that they are putting their employment at risk.</p>
<p>It is the view of the Committee that the political parties play an important role in the strengthening of democracy and in counteracting crimes committed against elected representatives as well as in assuming responsibility when crimes are all the same committed the representatives.</p>
<p>The Committee has taken the initiative to conclude an agreement between the political parties in Parliament during 2002–2006, on their obligations in this regard. It is of importance that the agreement is fulfilled and that the work continuous also after the Committee has fulfilled its assignment.</p>
<p>The Committee considers that elected representatives should take harassment, threats and violence against themselves with great seriousness, and that a zero tolerance policy should be established. When incidents occur, they should as a rule be reported to the person responsible for security at the Parliament, the county or the municipality. Incidents should also be reported to the police.</p>
<p>Education and dissemination of information are considered important methods for strengthening democracy and for counteracting the prevalence of harassment, threats and violence against elected representatives. As part of its assignment, the Committee has, on its own initiative and in cooperation with others, developed educational material and a proposal on how to conduct information and educational activities. The Committee urges persons and bodies that have an interest and responsibility in this context, the political parties, authorities at county and municipal level, the Police, primary and secondary schools, and others to use these materials to disseminate knowledge and to contribute to an in-depth discussion on the prevalence of crime against elected representatives, how best to handle such incidents and on how to counteract and to prevent their occurrence and with the objective to strengthen democracy.</p>
<h2>The responsibility of the Mass media and the Media strategies of elected representatives</h2>
<p>Mass media today plays a central role as a forum for political dialogue in society. While it is the function of mass media to scrutinize those in power, mass media itself also has the power to influence developments in society. The power wielded by mass media therefore also needs to be scrutinized. Considering the role of mass media in society, the Committee therefore urges the media to fulfil its duty to scrutinize its own powers with the utmost seriousness and to initiate a fundamental discussion on its ethical rules and the follow-up and control of the application of these.</p>
<p>The Committee furthermore urges the political parties to review their media strategies and to consider how different forms of media exposure of elected representatives may lead to the risk that crimes may be committed against them that is beyond what can be considered necessary for the fulfilment of their democratic mandate. The media strategies should include an assessment on the handling of potentially controversial political issues with regard to the involvement of mass media. The strategies should also address the question to what extent it may be considered appropriate or not to make use of mass media in situations when crimes occur against elected representatives.</p>
<h2>In brief on considerations with regard to criminal justice related issues that the Committee was asked to review</h2>
<p>The prevalence of crime against elected representatives committed due to the fulfilment of the representatives’ public functions is so high that it may be seen as a threat against the system of political representation as such. This should be counteracted by a strengthening of the criminal justice protection of the democratic right to perform such political functions. Considering that it is essential that the criminalized area does not infringe on the discussion or critical views expressed on issues argued within the political debate, there should be no increase in the type of acts that are criminalized. The strengthening of the criminal justice protection should instead be achieved through an amendment or an addendum to the Penal Code. The Committee would in this regard like to suggest that, from a legal technical perspective, the solution that will best reflect the aim of such a provision, i.e. the protection of the system of political representation, should be formulated through an addendum to the Penal Code, Chapter 29, § 2. To the quoted provision should be added as a justified ground for an increase in the severity of the penalty that a crime is committed against an elected representative.</p>
<h2>Increased possibilities for support and protection of elected representatives</h2>
<p>Elected representatives subjected to crime or at risk of falling victims to crime today receive the same support and assistance through the criminal justice system as victims of crime in general. In order for preventive work and follow-up measures to be functional, however, action plans for the handling of these issues need to be developed by the political parties, the municipalities, the county administration, the Parliament, the civilian police and the Prosecution Authority.</p>
<p>Measures to be undertaken should not be justified solely through reference to the interest of the individual crime victim, but also through reference to overall interests of more of a democratic character. Against the background of the last-mentioned end, the government should appoint a delegation tasked with following the longer term developments concerning the implications of this type of crime to democracy. The assignment should among other issues include assuring that the work carried out in this area by and in cooperation between interested parties is undertaken in a functional systematic manner. It should further be included to investigate the need for increased knowledge about the democratic implications and to facilitate additional research on this issue. For the purpose of continuing the discussion on the issue of crimes perpetrated against elected representatives and in order to keep track of developments the National Police Board should be tasked in the appropriation notice with a duty to report back on these questions. In order to facilitate the continuous coverage of issues related to crime against elected representatives a new criminal code designation should be introduced.</p>
<p>To make it possible to consider interests of a more individual nature, organisations concerned should introduce organisational routines. Within each political party, the municipalities, the counties, the police and the Prosecution Authority there shall be at least one contact person carrying the overall responsibility for questions concerning crimes against elected representatives, committed due to their political assignments.</p>
<p>The responsibilities of the contact persons shall include both preventive measures, such as education, the establishment of action plans with regard to the questions at hand and follow-up measures,</p>
<p>such as the dissemination of information, curative support and contacts with other interested organisations and public authorities.</p>
<p>Each political party, municipality, county and police authority should establish plans of action on the handling of issues related to crimes against elected representatives. In order to indicate that the issues in question are taken seriously and are given priority, the plans of action should be introduced on the initiative of the mentioned actors.</p>
<p>The plans of action should indicate that elected representatives are entitled to the following support and assistance measures:</p>
<p>Elected representatives shall be entitled to curative support. The responsibility therefore should rest with the respective political party. Such measures should among other things include providing professional help to the victims and others affected, to facilitate networking and to promote other types of social assistance.</p>
<p>Elected representatives shall be guaranteed a safe environment in the exercise of their assignments. The political parties, the counties, the municipalities and the police shall maintain their current level of responsibility for the localities and sites where elected representatives perform their functions.</p>
<p>Routines shall be established within each political party, municipality, county, and police authority for the handling of incidents that have occurred, internally as well as externally. The routines should be both of a preventive and a follow-up character.</p>
<p>The political parties, municipalities, counties and police authorities shall establish routines for the dissemination of information, internally as well as externally.</p>
<p>Between the political parties that have appointed elected representatives with assignments within municipalities or counties and the municipalities, counties and police authorities, plans of action should be established that indicate the following:</p>
<p>jointly established routines for the handling of contacts between the different actors and information on the persons responsible for the proper functioning of these.</p>
<p>It should also hear be the responsibility of the municipalities and the counties to undertake the first contacts that are to lead to the initiation of the work on the plans of action.</p>
<p>The police shall as a rule undertake a threat and risk assessment at the occasion of reports by elected representatives on a crime committed against them due to their assignments. The assessment should amongst other serve as the basis for the provision of relevant measures to support the crime victim and to indicate the risk of repeated criminality.</p>
<p>The entitlement to receive support and assistance for elected representatives should not be expressed through the adoption of laws.</p>
<p>Criminal investigations into offences committed against elected representatives should be led by a prosecutor.</p>
