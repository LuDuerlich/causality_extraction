<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>My assignment was to present proposals on how passenger rights on public transport can be strengthened in Swedish legislation. The remit included proposing provisions on compensation and assistance in case of delays and disruption to public transport services. Under the terms of reference, particular importance was to be attached to the needs of passengers with disabilities. The terms of reference also stated that current and proposed European Community regulations in this area were to be taken into account. Finally, my assignment involved conducting a review of the regulatory framework for administrative sanctions against passengers who fail to fulfil their obligation to pay a fare on public transport.</p>
<h2>Act concerning passenger rights on local and regional public transport</h2>
<p>My proposal for an Act concerning passenger rights on local and regional public transport is to be applied on local and regional public transport by bus, boat, tram, taxi, underground and train.</p>
<p>The Act is to be constructed to as to serve as a complement to the European regulation on train passengers and the proposed European regulations on travel by bus and coach, and by sea and inland waterways. The Act is to apply to forms of transport that Sweden is permitted to, and chooses to, exclude from the scope of the European regulations.</p>
<p>Public transport by tram, taxi and underground is not covered by Community law, but it is proposed that it be covered by national legislation. Coordinated demand responsive public transport, for example special transport services and patient transport services, is also to be included in the scope of the Act.</p>
<p>The Act is to have mandatory application in favour of passengers. This means that contractual terms that deviate from the provisions contained in my legislative proposal are only to apply if they are to the advantage of passengers.</p>
<h2>Right to information</h2>
<p>In the case of passengers’ right to information, I propose that responsibility be divided between transport operators and interchange managers. This information is to be provided in the most appropriate form. When providing information, particular emphasis is to be given to the needs of people with disabilities or reduced mobility.</p>
<p>Before a journey begins, the transport operator is to provide passengers with information concerning their statutory passenger rights, contractual terms, ticket pricing, timetables, route networks, disruptions, vehicles and the accessibility of interchanges, as well as how to contact the responsible transport operator. During the journey, the transport operator is to provide information on the next interchange and any disruptions.</p>
<p>To enable transport operators to provide information on the accessibility of interchanges, I have proposed that interchange managers be obliged to provide such information to the Government or other authority appointed by the Government. This obligation is also to include disruptions in the accessibility of interchanges.</p>
<p>Interchange managers are to provide coordinated information at the interchange concerning timetables for services that stop at or depart from the interchange. Managers of fully accessible interchanges are also to be obliged to provide coordinated information at the interchange concerning statutory passenger rights, disruptions to services and at the interchange, and the accessibility of the interchange. ‘Coordinated information’ means that information is to be presented in an integrated and crossmodal fashion.</p>
<h2>Rights in case of delays</h2>
<p>If an interruption to transport services lasts, or is estimated to last, longer than 60 minutes, I have proposed that the transport operator is to arrange replacement transportation. In certain exceptional cases of such interruption to transport services, the transport operator does not have to organise replacement transportation. Replacement transportation can use vehicles owned by the transport operator or another transport operator, or it can mean that another mode of transport is used. Transport operators are not obliged to organise replacement transportation if information concerning satisfactory alternative routes is provided to passengers. Special consideration is to be given to the possibilities for people with disabilities or reduced mobility to use the replacement service.</p>
<p>When the departure time of transport services is delayed by more than 20 minutes, I propose that passengers should have the right to reimbursement for transportation using another transport operator or a taxi. The maximum cost of alternative transportation that can be reimbursed under the National Insurance Act (1962:381) is 1/40 of the base amount, or currently around SEK 1 000.</p>
<p>A passenger whose arrival is delayed by more than 60 minutes is to have the right to be reimbursed up to twice the price of their ticket or twice their out-of-pocket cost. This applies only if the passenger did not make use of the possibility of reimbursement for alternative travel using a different transport operator or a taxi. Passengers are to be reimbursed within three months of their application for reimbursement. Passengers are to be reimbursed in cash if they so desire.</p>
<p>Under my proposal, transport operators will be exempt from liability for delays in certain situations. This covers situations where the delay is caused by weather conditions or other circumstances that the transport operator could not have avoided even if it had taken all measures that might reasonably be expected. The transport operator is also exempt from liability for delays if it has informed passengers within a reasonable period of time that delays may occur. Despite this limited liability, the transport operator always has a responsibility to ensure transportation. However, this does not have to take place within a fixed time period.</p>
<p>Under the terms of my proposal, passengers will not be entitled to reimbursement for consequential damage.</p>
<h2>Rights of people with disabilities</h2>
<p>As far as possible, passenger rights are to be regulated across the board. However, in certain areas I have proposed special rights for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>Under my proposal, transport operators of local and regional public transport may not deny a passenger the right to board on grounds of disability or reduced mobility if the passenger has a valid ticket or intends to purchase a ticket on board. An exception to this provision may only be made if the journey would breach applicable safety provisions or on the grounds of the size or design of the vehicle.</p>
<p>I have also proposed that transport operators are to assist passengers with disabilities or reduced mobility, free of charge, when getting on or off public transport.</p>
<p>An escort is to be offered at the fully accessible interchanges designated by the authority responsible for public transport in the county. The provision of escorts is the responsibility of the interchange manager. An escort is to be offered to all passengers who consider themselves in need of one. Escorts are to be available to a reasonable extent throughout the day and should be bookable in advance. Passengers are to have access to an escort at their desired time as long as they have booked at least two hours in advance. An escort is also to be available without prior booking and, under my proposal, the maximum waiting time should be 30 minutes.</p>
<p>To clarify the modes of transport for which an interchange manager is to provide information and the modes of transport between which escorts are to be offered, I consider that when the authority responsible for public transport designates fully accessible interchanges, it is also to define the geographical area covered by the interchange.</p>
<h2>Complaints, claims and limitation</h2>
<p>Transport operators are to establish a system for dealing with customer complaints.</p>
<p>In order for a passenger to exercise the proposed rights in case of delays, he or she must submit a claim within a reasonable period of time. Notifications submitted within one month after the day on which the journey was made or was due to be made must always be considered to have been submitted in good time.</p>
<p>In order to avoid the risk of a transport operator being subject to sanctions over an extended period of time after a journey, I have proposed a provision on limitation. A passenger’s right to claim reimbursement due to a delay will be lost if no claim is submitted against the transport operator within one year from the date on which the journey was made or was due to be made.</p>
<h2>Supervision and market law sanctions</h2>
<p>The Swedish Consumer Agency is to supervise whether the consumer rights provisions of the proposed legislation are followed with regard to the right to information and the special rights for people with disabilities and reduced mobility.</p>
<p>Transport operators and interchange managers are to be liable under market law, under penalty of a fine, to provide the relevant information pursuant to my legislative proposal. Proceedings may be brought in the Market Court by the Consumer Ombudsman, among others. In more minor matters, the Consumer Ombudsman should be able to impose fines.</p>
<p>Similarly, I have proposed sanctions in market law against any transport operator that denies a person the right to travel on grounds of disability or reduced mobility, does not fulfil the right to assistance when getting on or off public transport, or does not have a system for dealing with complaints. The same applies to any interchange manager that refuses to provide an escort at interchanges.</p>
<h2>Penalty fares on public transport</h2>
<p>Under my proposal, public transport operators should decide the size of the penalty fare for passengers who fail to fulfil their obligation to pay a fare for public transport. It is currently the Swedish Transport Agency and, ultimately, the Government that decide the size of such penalty fares.</p>
<p>Under my proposal, a penalty fare can be charged of any person who is unable to present a valid ticket on board a mode of transport or in a railway, tram or underground transport area only accessible to members of the public who have paid a fare. Previously, a penalty fare could only be charged of any person who could be considered a passenger. This requirement necessitated difficult decisions. My proposal clarifies when a penalty fare may be charged. The same change has been proposed in the provision concerning expulsion from public transport and police assistance.</p>
<p>The penalty fare is to be set at a level that is reasonable with regard to the cost of ticket controls and ticket prices. A public transport operator is not to charge a penalty fare if the lack of a valid ticket can be deemed excusable in view of the person’s age, state of health, lack of knowledge of local conditions or other circumstances. A system of this kind is already in use and, in my view, works well. I do not, therefore, propose any changes to these aspects.</p>
