<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The electricity sector is gradually changing, and almost five years have elapsed since the electricity market was reformed. The reform entailed exposing electricity production and trading to competition, while network services, which are a natural monopoly, continue to be regulated and supervised. During the period following deregulation, it has been argued in several different contexts that the body of regulations applying to the supervision of network services is inadequate and does not permit effective supervision. An overhaul is required in order to clarify whether there are grounds for making this body of regulations more stringent, as well as for implementing amendments to the Swedish Electricity Act and making its wording more exact in order to render the supervision of network companies more effective.</p>
<p>The commission’s task has been to analyse the need for amendments to existing regulations, and to define in more exact terms the supervision carried out by the supervisory authority, i.e. the Network Authority. The task also includes reviewing the need for further regulations in order, on the one hand, to define network services clearly, and, on the other, to encourage a levelling out of network tariffs between customers in urban and rural areas. This preliminary report includes proposals for such constitutional amendments.</p>
<h2>More efficient supervision</h2>
<p>We propose a new orientation for supervision. Our proposal is that the assessment of the reasonableness of network tariffs should in future be based on an comparision of the network companies’ revenues in relation to his performance. The assessment of the reasonableness of tariffs shall no longer be based primarily on the network companies’ expenses. Instead, the new method incorporates an assessment of the performance of the network companies, and of whether the revenue is reasonable in relation to this performance. The assessment of performance should be based on the objective conditions governing network services and how these services are being implemented by the operators.</p>
<p>In practise, supervision should be performed as follows: the Network Authority reviews the network company’s revenues in the light of the objective conditions governing the company’s ability to provide efficient network services. This supervisory method will mean that the burden of proof will primarily rest on the company, which must motivate a high network tariff. In time, this supervisory method will probably be far less resourceintensive than the method currently in use.</p>
<h2>Special members of general administrative courts</h2>
<p>The Network Authority’s decisions can be appealed. In order for the county administrative court and the administrative court of appeal to have access to satisfactory source material on which to base their decisions, we propose that the courts should, besides the legally ratified members, include one member with specialist knowledge of network services and one financial expert.</p>
<h2>Defining the limits between network services and competitive operations</h2>
<p>The Swedish Electricity Act stipulates that a legal entity operating network services may not concurrently pursue activities involving production of or trading in electricity. In order to ensure that this distinction between network services and competitive operations is maintained in practise, we propose that a ban be introduced both on having joint boardroom majorities and on having joint managing directors for network companies and electricity trading or production companies.</p>
<p>Besides emphasising the need for a distinction between these operations, this regulation is also designed to prevent network services from subsidising other operations, resulting in higher network tariffs as a consequence.</p>
<p>There is also a risk of subsidies being involved if expenses for collaboration between companies, e.g. shared premises, are charged to the network company alone or impact on the company to too great an extent. The same risk exists if goods or services are not purchased at market prices.</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that supervision aimed at ensuring that subsidies are not advanced by network companies is wholly dependent on effective supervision of the reasonableness of network tariffs. It is clear that subsidies must not affect the network tariff. A firm and effective supervisory function would oblige network companies to apply low tariffs, decreasing or eliminating the scope for non-profitable activities.</p>
<h2>Levelling out the tariffs</h2>
<p>Generally speaking, network tariffs are higher in rural areas than in urban ones. A levelling out of tariffs between rural and urban areas would entail obliging urban customers to accept raised tariffs with a view to supporting rural areas.</p>
<p>It is primarily the opportunity for more extensive joint reporting that has an impact on the levelling out of network tariffs. The principal rule in force at the moment, whereby each area is accounted for separately and the network concession holder can apply for an exemption, has meant that it is the concession holder who takes the initiative as regards joint reporting, and thus also the possibility of levelling out tariffs.</p>
<p>Today’s regulations have also meant that the process of levelling out tariffs has proceeded slowly. In order to even out tariffs to a greater extent, we propose a new principal rule whereby areas that are close to each other geographically shall be accounted for together, provided they do not constitute an unsuitable area. In order to avoid drastic tariff increases for certain customers, we suggest that the levelling out process should span a five-year period. The advantage of this rule is that the possibility of joint reporting is no longer dependent on an application being lodged by the concession holder. While maintaining pricing stability, this should make the restructuring processes more dynamic and thus accelerate the process of levelling out prices between urban and rural areas.</p>
<h2>Limitations on the Network Authority’s supervisory responsibility</h2>
<p>In order to define the limits for supervision and avoid interpretation problems, we propose certain amendments to the Swedish Electricity Act.</p>
<p>The forms of foreign trading in electricity and the need for central information about this trading have changed in many essential respects since the introduction of the provisions of the Swedish Electricity Act regarding the reporting of import and export contracts. There is no reason for the provisions to remain in force, and we propose that they be removed.</p>
<p>The Network Authority’s supervision should not cover the provisions in Chapter 7 regarding municipal electricity companies, or the provisions in Chapter 11 regarding the suspension of electricity transmission.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a clarification is required of the fact that the provisions of Chapter 10 regarding liability for damages arising due to the effect of electricity do not fall under the supervision of the Network Authority.</p>
<h2>New rule about quality requirements</h2>
<p>We propose that a new rule be introduced whereby network concession holders shall ensure that the transmission of electricity maintains sufficiently high quality standards. Disputes relating to quality shall be reviewed by the Network Authority following a request from the customer. It shall be possible to appeal against the decision of the authority to the general administrative courts.</p>
<h2>Time limits</h2>
<p>Time limits should be imposed on the right to report network companies and to begin supervising them. Furthermore, a rule should be introduced for when the supervision process should be terminated. We propose that a request for a review pursuant to the Swedish Electricity Act shall have been received by the Network Authority within two years. The supervision process must have begun within twelve months of the closing of the financial year in order for the Network Authority to have the right to issue an injunction relating to a certain financial year. In addition, an injunction shall have been issued within two years following the start of the supervision process, unless there are special reasons for doing otherwise.</p>
