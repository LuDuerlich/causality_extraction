<h1>Summary in English</h1>
<h2>More and better jobs – a matter of survival to Sweden and Europe!</h2>
<p>Two of the basic components of the EU Lisbon Treaty are more jobs and better jobs. The emphasis in Sweden is on the former goal. This is not surprising, since the number of presently unemployed people in the Swedish labor force amounts to 846 000 full-year equivalents, an increase by 68 000 since last year. Political initiatives to speed up economy and recruit those otherwise excluded, comprise government loans, reduced interest rates, massive educational and training programs, support to small enterprises, promotion of enterprises with a social emphasis, and coaches for jobseekers.</p>
<p>More jobs are a necessary requirement for a working life to become more “inclusive” than it is to-day. All people being willing and able to maintain a job should be allowed to do so, based on their abilities and living conditions. Both young and old. Men and women. Foreigners and native born. People with and without disabilities. Newly unemployed and long-term absent.</p>
<p>Increased inclusion can restore the identity and self-respect of people, give goal and meaning to their lives, provide friends and acquaintances, and lead to tangible assets. It also gives the day, week, year and life structure and contents.</p>
<p>Creating jobs is essential, however not sufficient. If we train and coach people to take jobs that are harmful, mentally and/or physically, an “inclusive” working life can lead to more exclusion in the long run, and to more people on sick leave or in premature retirement.</p>
<p>Thus, we must strive for a working life that is both inclusive (i.e., more jobs) and sustainable (i.e., better jobs), and which offers conditions of work that satisfy human needs – jobs that are friendly to life. Several current trends may obstruct the road to this combined goal: an increasing employment insecurity, an ageing work force, work intensification, increasing emotional demands on the workers, and difficulty making ends meet in the puzzle of our lives.</p>
<p>We need more research to support this endeavour, part of which could be conducted in the three centers for working life research (in Stockholm, Gävle and Uppsala, Sweden) that were recently established by the Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research.</p>
<p>But a successful and healthy working life also requires an investment in compulsory basic training in leadership and work environmental issues at technical and economical universities. If we succeed, we will get a generation of managers who know not only how to avoid threats to health in working life but also how to promote salutogenic and “life-friendly” factors.</p>
