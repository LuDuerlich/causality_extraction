<p>The remit</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit has been to review the offences in Chapters 14 and 15 of the Penal Code concerning original and certain other documents. The review was aimed at clarifying the changes that may be necessary in view of developments in information technology. According to the terms of reference our proposals should be formulated on the basis of also being applicable as regards developments in information technology that may be expected to take place in the foreseeable future. The proposals should also be characterised by general considerations in which known and conventional concepts are used as far as possible and appropriately. The proposals shall also imply effective, but at the same time well-defined criminalisation. As far as possible they should build further on the current regulatory framework. We have also taken into consideration Article 7 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (ETS 185).</p>
<p>Our remit also included making a linguistic review of the provisions covered by the remit for the purpose of achieving a general modernisation of the language.</p>
<p>The main features of our proposals are described below.</p>
<p>Adaptation of the original document concept</p>
<p>It may be questioned to what extent documents in an electronic environment have the status of original documents as defined in the Penal Code. We have found that legislation is needed to remove this uncertainty and also to otherwise adapt the original document concept to IT developments. Legislation measures are also needed to fulfil the requirements under Article 7 of the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime concerning criminalisation of computer-</p>
<p>related forgery. The adaptation should build on the current regulatory framework in which protection under criminal law against forgery consists of technology-neutral regulation based on a definition of original document covering both paper-based and electronic documents.</p>
<p>We have found that the term original document should be retained as the designation of the documents and marks that may be subject to forgery. The definition of original document in Chapter 14 Section 1, second paragraph of the Penal Code should be both clarified, specifying directly in the law text what the requirements are for documents and marks to have the status of originals, and extended for the purpose of adaptation to the use and development of information technology.</p>
<p>In our proposal the term original document shall refer to:</p>
<p>Hence, for an electronic document to be afforded the status of original document, apart from it being of significance as proof, it must also specify the issuer and be possible to verify reliably. By means of this necessary condition in the adapted regulation we have taken account of the central significance that specifying the issuer has for the traditional original documents on paper. While we have taken into consideration the special conditions prevailing in the electronic environment. New identical electronic documents can be very simply produced from an electronic document. Such duplication is a natural part of information processing with computers. There are therefore some differences between what can be described as an original and a copy in a paper-based environment on the one hand, and in an electronic environment on the other. In order to avoid misunderstandings and to create a system that is better adapted to the electronic environment, we have removed the “character of an original” requirement of paper-based original documents and instead set up a specification of issuer requirement, which can be reliably verified.</p>
<p>Authentication of a paper-based original document must still proceed on the basis of a unique physical item. If this specimen does not originate from the issuer specified, the original document is false. In electronic environments authentication should, however, be based on digital data. We therefore propose that the authenticity of an original document in an electronic environment be determined on the basis of the information content represented by digital data. If this content originates from the specified issuer the original document is authentic, if not it is false.</p>
<p>Manipulations with documents that are not original documents</p>
<p>We have found that it is necessary, for certain specially urgent cases, to impose a penalty for the use of a false electronic document , even if the document does not qualify for the status of original document. We have therefore proposed a special penal provision for these cases. The provision is intended to prevent a person from falsely publishing an electronic document, for example an email message, as originating from a specified issuer for the purpose of wrongfully deriving a benefit or escaping an obligation in a legal or financial matter. The proposed penalty for the crime is a fine or a maximum of six months imprisonment.</p>
<p>Manipulation of technical records or other automatic registration of actual circumstances, such as tachographs and speed cameras, should no longer be considered as falsification of documents. A technical record cannot in fact be authenticated in the customary way (cf legal case NJA 1991 page 739). We have therefore proposed a new penal provision for manipulation of technical records . The penalty for the crime is a fine or a maximum of two years imprisonment.</p>
<p>Submission of false information</p>
<p>There is uncertainty concerning whether the requirement in Chapter 15, Section 10 of the Penal Code for a “written deposition” precludes criminal liability in cases where the information is submitted in electronic form. We consider that this uncertainty should</p>
<p>be removed through legislation. We have therefore submitted a proposal for a partly amended wording of the provision.</p>
<p>There is a need to impose a penalty for drawing up false documents, for example invoices or receipts, in a legal or financial matter, even if the documents do not qualify for the status of original documents. A separate provision which imposes a penalty for drawing up a false document  and use of a false document  also provides a clearer regulation than current law. We have therefore submitted a proposal for such a new penal provision. The penalty is a fine or a maximum of six months imprisonment or, if the crime is serious, imprisonment for a maximum of two years.</p>
<p>The crime of misuse of original document in Chapter 15, Section 12 covers certain acts with documents that are not original documents. In order to achieve a clear and adapted regulation which also classifies the crime adequately we have proposed a new provision, misuse of a document.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the uncertainty concerning applicability of the penalty in an electronic environment, in recent years a number of special penal provisions have been introduced, for example in Section 5 of the Act on Self-service via the Internet (2004:115) in social insurance administration and Chapter 19, Section 11 a, third paragraph of the Swedish Land Code. The new regulation is modelled on the provisions on untrue or negligent affirmation (Chapter 15, Section 10) and false certification (Chapter 15, Section 11). Our proposals will render these provisions redundant. They should therefore be abolished.</p>
<p>Costs and implementation</p>
<p>The proposals are expected to be possible to finance within the existing financial framework. We do not propose any transitional provisions.</p>
