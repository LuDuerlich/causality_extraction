<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Terms of reference</h2>
<p>The Inquiry on Clinical Research began its work in spring 2007. In February 2008 it submitted an interim report entitled Världsklass! Åtgärdsplan för den kliniska forskningen  [World class! An action plan for clinical research] (SOU 2008:7). In the interim report, the Inquiry outlined the conditions for clinical research and presented proposals for an action plan.</p>
<p>The action plan covers the following areas: quality control and priority setting, recruitment and careers, infrastructure and the health perspective and implementation of research. The Research Bill A Boost to Research and Innovation  (Government Bill 2008/09:50) utilized several of the Inquiry’s proposed measures and it is now possible that these will be implemented under the increased funding frameworks allocated to universities and research councils.</p>
<p>Several challenges remain if Swedish clinical research, and thus also health and medical care, is to regain the prominent position we have previously enjoyed. This is especially evident in the international evaluation that the Inquiry conducted jointly with the Swedish Research Council and the Academy of Finland. On the basis of this evaluation, the Inquiry now presents additional proposals, which along with the previous action plan, should be viewed as the Inquiry’s total of measures to strengthen clinical research.</p>
<h2>The proposals in brief</h2>
<p>• Strengthen the link between education and research and create more positions that combine research and clinical work.</p>
<p>• Form University Medical Centres (UMC) integrating education, research and health care, under the joint management of local and central government. It is proposed that UMCs preferably operate as limited companies.</p>
<p>• To close the gap between new research findings in health care and facilitate implementation, a fund for applied clinical research and clinical trials will be established, and a national cooperative group will be formed.</p>
<p>• Provide increased infrastructure support to facilitate the use of biobanks and health care quality and patient data registers. Target new investments in translational research environments for rapid knowledge transfer.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Clinical research is a prerequisite for high-quality health and medical care. It is the link between the laboratory and the patient. The Inquiry’s definition of the concept of clinical research is based on research that presupposes health care structures and resources and that aims to solve a health problem or identify factors leading to better health. This broad definition includes rather than excludes different types of medical research activities and reflects a more integrated view of medical research.</p>
<p>Compared with other countries, the quality of Swedish clinical research over the past 10–15 years has declined. Various explanations are offered. Research-trained health care professionals point to a lack of time for research, little credit and recognition for research and a lack of positions that combine research and medical care. The business sector points to a shortage of clinical investigators and a declining interest in clinical trials collaborations. The health care authorities highlight the difficulties in providing scope for and implementing research findings in a shrinking economy. The universities call for leadership at the university hospitals/local government that will emphasise and promote research.</p>
<p>The challenges facing Swedish clinical research range from the local to the global and can be summarised in the following five points. A new public health perspective is placing new demands on research. International competition is becoming more intense. Demands on health services are marginalising research. High retirement rates are expected among health professionals conducting research. Cooperation between health services, academia and industry needs to be improved.</p>
<h2>Demands for action</h2>
<p>Medical research is long-term and thus its success and setbacks do not have an immediate impact on health services or the rest of society. The declining quality of clinical research that we are experiencing at present stems from developments over a number of years. Sweden is losing a body of knowledge and development potential as a result of retirements and the lack of time for research among younger clinical researchers. To date, these difficulties have been overcome by the commitment and initiatives of individuals. This is untenable in the long run; Sweden must use its research and health service facilities to drive development forward and create structural solutions that will provide hope for the future.</p>
<p>Over the years, various measures have been taken to improve conditions for clinical research. However, the most important problems have not been resolved and a sense of resignation is therefore widespread among the country's clinical investigators. It is important to point out that the situation does not stem from disinterest or ignorance on the part of those in positions of responsibility in the health services and at universities. It is more a matter of the issue being complicated by the involvement of multiple parties having setting different priorities.</p>
<p>Current forms of responsibility and funding, and current attitudes, no longer work. These need to change if we want clinical research to be characterised by high quality and competitiveness. The incentives for change are obvious. The link between clinical research and good health and medical care is strong and measures are therefore necessary to ensure that Swedish patients can be guaranteed the best possible care and treatment. Strong and competitive pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are also prerequisites for this development. In addition, health economics research has found that health-related research is economically efficient. A review of the literature highlighting the economic value of research in medicine and related areas shows this to be the case. Preliminary data from Sweden also point in the same direction.</p>
<p>The problems that have been solved have mainly been solved at the local level through cooperation between county councils and universities. The results have been good and the process important but the steps have been too small. The Inquiry considers that it is now time for some major changes to the system that focus on the issue of responsibility and research funding.</p>
<h2>Competitive advantages</h2>
<p>In an international perspective, Swedish clinical research has clear competitive advantages: a high proportion of health care professionals with research training, assets in the form of health data registers, quality registers and biobanks, patients that are keen to take part in research projects and a stable public health care system. Sweden also has a long tradition in the area and for many years clinical research has contributed to the strong position that Swedish industry occupies today. All of these factors are competitive advantages that many other countries lack. For this reason, Swedish clinical research should not be satisfied with being good enough. It has the potential to be at the forefront, which is a prerequisite if we want to develop the best health and medical care and a strong pharmaceutical and biotech Swedish industry.</p>
<h2>The international evaluation</h2>
<p>To provide a broader base for proposals on how to develop clinical research, the Inquiry conducted a joint international evaluation with the Swedish Research Council and the Academy of Finland. International expert groups has evaluated clinical research at six Swedish and five Finnish universities with medical faculties. The evaluation group’s analysis and proposals concur fully with what the Inquiry has previously identified and focused its measures on. These can be summarised in the following points:</p>
<p>• weak recruitment and career opportunities for young researchers,</p>
<p>• weak cooperation between health care at university hospitals and medical faculties,</p>
<p>• lack of  longer-term funding, and of clinical treatment research in particular,</p>
<p>• lack of mobility and internationalisation, and</p>
<p>• weak innovation systems and cooperation with industry.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has chosen to focus on a limited number of proposals for measures that are deemed to be particularly important to help Swedish competitive advantages make their full impact.</p>
<p>Central government, local government and the industry are all actors that greatly benefit from clinical research and are therefore jointly responsible for its development and quality. The proposed measures are based on all actors taking this responsibility – not only through a general consistency of views but above all through active cooperation. We also consider that increased cooperation between research funding institutions is essential to bridge the gap between research and the implementation of research findings in health care.</p>
<p>Several parties are jointly responsible for the implementation and funding of each proposed measure. However, as research is mainly a central government responsibility, the Government has overall responsibility for driving the process.</p>
<h2>Recruitment measures</h2>
<p>Clinical research in Sweden is on the verge of a generational shift. Every year for the next ten years, 250 clinical investigators will retire. The same is expected in other health professions. To maintain high-quality health care, research and education, this loss of knowledge and experience must be replaced. The need for active researchers is therefore great and rejuvenation of the country’s clinical researchers is also necessary. Younger people do not find a research career attractive. It is fundamental for the quality of future research that young academically talented students considering a research career can look forward to good and clear career prospects. Business sector representatives regard the lack of new and committed researchers in health and medical care as the most serious threat to the continued strong development of Swedish industry. The international evaluation points to the need for recruitment measures and several international analyses deem that recruitment and better career opportunities are the two most important measures needed to strengthen clinical research.</p>
<p>The interim report proposed investments in research schools, integrated specialist and research education and recruitment services for young active clinical researchers. The Inquiry now proposes:</p>
<h2>Stronger link between education and research</h2>
<p>To recruit young researchers and strengthen the research perspective and desire for renewal in the health service, research needs to be given a clearer role in education, both in undergraduate programmes and specialist and further training. Educational positions at university hospitals should be more clearly research-related than is the case today.</p>
<h2>More positions</h2>
<p>The faculties and health care authorities must together extend their investments in positions that include both research and clinical work. It must also be possible for researchers with biomedical and other undergraduate education to obtain research positions in clinical research programmes.</p>
<h2>Leadership with research</h2>
<p>At university hospital with a joint responsibility for research and health care, the leadership should have experience of both research and clinical work.</p>
<h2>University hospitals – the hub for clinical research</h2>
<p>The university hospitals are responsible for providing health care and conducting research and education. More than 90 per cent of all clinical research originates from university hospitals. They offer a hospital environment with access to research-trained staff, proximity to academia, patients, patient data and advanced equipment. This research includes research activities at other medical institutions with links to universities and university hospitals.</p>
<p>The university hospitals provide health care at all levels and account for more than 30 per cent of Sweden’s health and medical care. This means that university hospitals are very large and hardto-manage health care organisations. Due to their extensive remit to provide health and medical care, university hospitals today are perceived and run more like regional hospitals with responsibility for advanced and highly specialised care.</p>
<p>Health and medical care, and research and education at university hospitals must be managed in an integrated way. Today’s university hospitals have no clear research mandate that is integrated into their operations, and research has to take a back seat to short-term health care demands for efficiency. The problems stem from dual ownership for university hospital operations. This gap must be closed.</p>
<p>The Inquiry identifies several threats to the research that is intended to be conducted at university hospitals. Lack of time for research is the main problem. This means that research clinics will not be allowed time to do research and health and medical care will not be prepared to conduct clinical studies. The lack of research staff means that the major research investments now allocated to universities and strategic research areas cannot be used, and will not have a full impact on health care.</p>
<p>The starting point for our proposals is improving the prospects for university hospitals to carry out their research and health care tasks in an integrated way. The proposals aim to sharpen the research focus and thereby raise the quality of both medical research and health and medical care.</p>
<h2>Establish University Medical Centres (UMC)</h2>
<p>To integrate health care, research and education operations, the Inquiry proposes that university hospitals in county councils and regions with medical faculties reorganise into six University Medical Centres (UMCs). Taking into account the conditions of each region, a UMC should have a more limited health care remit than existing university hospitals. This will enable cooperation between health care, research and education to be more effective. At the same time, UMCs must undertake regional cooperation in education and research and serve as regional knowledge centres and nodes for knowledge transfer and cooperation.</p>
<p>Unlike the present organisation, a UMC is a coherent organisation under one management with joint responsibility for the three tasks. The university hospitals today are run by two parallel organisations, the county council and medical faculty, with different strategies and planning horizons. A UMC under one common management assigns research a clear place in the organisation and health care and its needs will serve as the driving force for research.</p>
<p>A common organisation will not dissociate clinical research from health care. It will create opportunities to develop translational research environments that enhance cooperation and make recruiting young clinical researchers easier. With more efficient knowledge flows, research findings can be implemented more quickly in health and medical care. In addition, a coherent UMC will be an attractive cooperation partner for external funders and industry. This will strengthen the innovation process and enable effective use of research results in health care.</p>
<p>Research activities at UMCs will be expected to increase, and following the monitoring and evaluation of their tasks and objecttives this will warrant the allocation of research resources by central government. At present central government allocates ALF funds amounting to SEK 1.5 billion to county councils and their university hospitals. To enhance the quality of research at UMC research funding must increase. The Inquiry considers that an increase of SEK 500 million is realistic when all the UMCs have been established.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has considered various models of how a UMC should be governed and organised. Regardless of the choice of operational structure or who is the owner, the overall objective must be that county councils and central government together create UMCs that function as a hub not only for clinical research but above all for knowledge-driven health care.</p>
<h2>The legal form of University Medical Centres</h2>
<p>Effective cooperation in research and education already exists between the partners but there is little to indicate that, within the framework of the current activities, efforts are being made to expand cooperation to cover the entire remit. The Inquiry therefore considers that the very extensive cooperation required to create and run a UMC demands a more robust structure than today’s management as government authorities.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that ALF county councils and central government preferably together, in each county council/region, establish University Medical Centres as limited companies. The proposal means that what is today referred to as a university hospital will go from being an entity under administrative law to being a limited company with the central government and county councils as part owners.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has also examined other models for governance and found that research would not be guaranteed by central government ownership either, since the primary activity is still health care. It has also considered whether UMCs could operate as foundations. The main disadvantage is that a foundation is an inflexible and rigid organisation. From the research point of view, a county council-owned UMC run as a limited company does not differ significantly from the current organisation and is not particularly likely to guarantee the role of research.</p>
<p>The responsibility for UMCs – if run as limited companies – and their entire remit would automatically be that of its board and management. Through the board and executive management, the company would be given full responsibility for planning, governance and operation of UMCs. One organisation that incorporates all areas of activity gives clarity and transparency. This enables various forms of cooperation. The inter-relationship and influence of county councils and central government is guaranteed through owner agreements, articles of association and owner directives.</p>
<p>In the county councils/regions where the limited company form is not considered possible, a change still needs to be introduced to enable the establishment of a UMC. Having analysed the alternatives, the Inquiry considers that management as a public authority with county councils as owners but with new joint leadership and a greater focus on research is the second best alternative for creating UMCs.</p>
<h2>Use of research findings</h2>
<p>If research findings are to be of benefit, funding of the entire research chain – from explorative research-oriented activities to implementation in health care – are essential. Today, implementation of research findings is a bottleneck and a neglected area for which none of the research funders involved feels any responsibility. Clinical studies and scientific evaluations of new methods lack support, as does epidemiological follow-up. The number of nonsponsored researcher-initiated clinical studies has gradually declined over the past ten years, which is mainly due to increased costs and the lack of obvious funders.</p>
<p>Industry also has an important role to play in implementation given its commitment to innovation and it would like to see more opportunities for cooperation with universities and health care to enable development of new innovations.</p>
<p>Cooperation between various research funders contribute to strengthening the impact of clinical research. A joint national resource for implementation and innovation should therefore be created bringing together various government agencies, like the Swedish Research Council and the Swedish Agency for Innovation Systems – and the county councils, academia, foundations, industry and patient organisations.</p>
<h2>Fund for clinical treatment studies</h2>
<p>The Inquiry therefore proposes that a long-term fund for clinical treatment studies be built up with annual funding of SEK 500 million. Central government should contribute SEK 250 million and the remaining from The Swedish research Council, Vinnova, the County Councils and Research Foundations. The funders should appoint a committee responsible for planning, preparation and monitoring. The committee should be placed at the Swedish Research Council’s Scientific Council for Medicine and Health.</p>
<h2>Platform for cooperation</h2>
<p>To facilitate cooperation and the implementation of clinical treatment studies, a common interface is required for the client and the provider. The Inquiry therefore proposes that a national cooperation organisation be set up for academic medical treatment research and clinical trials in Sweden (SAMS). SAMS will be a network centre for, clinical research and clinical trials centres, and universities. The organisation should be led by a board of directors comprising researchers from all the university hospitals.</p>
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Clinical research requires access to technologically advanced equipment, IT support, biobanks and health care quality and health data registers. This is costly infrastructure of national and often international interest that can be used by various research groups. It is therefore essential to organise and optimise Swedish resources to ensure their full efficiency in combination with European and other international infrastructure investments. In its interim report, the Inquiry emphasised that new resources and better national coordination are required.</p>
<h2>Need for further actions</h2>
<p>Current investments in biobanks, health care quality and patient data registers and IT support are inadequate. It is the task of the responsible agencies to coordinate these resources and make them accessible to major national research initiatives.</p>
<p>Extensive and coordinated investments are being made in the EU within the framework of the European Advanced Translational Research Infrastructure in Medicine (ESFRI). Further national investment in our unique infrastructure resources is required to enable Sweden to be involved and make use of these European infrastructure resources.</p>
<h2>New focus on the research environment</h2>
<p>Translational research is about creating a knowledge flow between basic research, clinical research and health and medical care The overall purpose of this is to achieve the best possible benefits for the patient. A development that creates translational research environments in which researchers with various educational backgrounds and expertise can collaborate is therefore necessary. This can more easily take place within the context of university medical centres where education, research and health care are integrated into different subject areas and specialisations.</p>
<h2>Funding and priorities</h2>
<p>The Inquiry does not consider that it is possible to fund these mea- sures using the current funds available in the central government budget or by reprioritising these funds. Realising the proposals for the reorganisation of university hospitals and establishing a fund for treatment research therefore requires additional resources.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has identified a limited number of issues of decisive importance for clinical research and its impact on clinical outcome and health care. It is therefore essential that they all will be suppor- ted and carried through.</p>
