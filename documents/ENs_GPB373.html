<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Our task</h2>
<p>The task of this commission was to come up with proposals for the legislative regulation of compulsory administration of network concessions. The directives make it clear that the regulations shall guarantee the continued supply of electricity. We have interpreted this part of our task to mean that we were to propose rules that allow for more efficient intervention in the event of mismanagement or irresponsible actions on the part of a network company. Our supplementary directives also specified that we were to analyse the need for changes to the regulations concerning network tariffs for regional power lines and propose such changes. Our task has also been to consider whether special rules are needed for certain non-Swedish network areas, such as Bornholm and Åland, which are connected to the Swedish electricity system, which is also their main supplier of electricity.</p>
<h2>Special administration</h2>
<p>The existing possibilities of intervening against irresponsible network companies mainly involve formal injunctions carrying a penalty for failure to comply, as well as the withdrawal of network concessions. The possibility of withdrawing a network concession, however, is in practice limited by the fact that the law does not specify how the continued power supply is to be guaranteed if the concession is withdrawn.</p>
<p>This report outlines proposals for a completely new law concerning the special administration of certain electrical facilities. We used the Swedish Act on the Administration of Housing (Bostadsförvaltningslagen, 1977:792) as the starting point for our work. We have, however, made major adjustments to this law to fit the special conditions applying to network operations. Network operations basically comprise two kinds of function, and although both are vital, their nature is different. Network operations include the obligation to ensure the physical transmission of high-quality electricity, as well as the obligation to perform the measurements and calculations on the electricity transmitted necessary to ensure that the electricity trade can function efficiently and that balance responsibility on the electricity market can be economically regulated. Mismanagement in the latter case may injure other players in the electricity market and form an obstacle to efficient competition. In more serious cases, this could pose a threat to the functioning of the electricity market.</p>
<p>Conditions governing intervention and the object of special administration</p>
<p>Our legislative proposal states that one of the requirements for intervention is that the facility owner fails in important ways to fulfil the duties pursuant to the Swedish Electricity Act (Ellagen,1997:857), or to the provisions or terms and conditions for the concession stipulated on the basis of this Act. Bearing in mind the fact that a decision concerning special administration entails a major intervention for the individual after an authority decision, we have also proposed a further prerequisite for applying the law, which is that there should be an existing threat to the electricity supply or to the functioning of the electricity market. By formulating such a prerequisite for the application of the law, we believe that it is possible in practice to intervene in the event of mismanagement while at the same time ensuring the rule of law.</p>
<p>The proposal specifies that the object of special administration may be any electrical facilities used for the transmission of high voltage power provided that they involve network operations conducted on the basis of a concession.</p>
<p>Forms of intervention</p>
<p>The network authority shall submit an application for special administration to the county administrative court. We have chosen to propose the introduction of two forms of intervention, an administrative injunction and compulsory administration. Special administration is a collective term used to refer to both administration forms.</p>
<p>Administrative injunction</p>
<p>An administrative injunction is the milder form of special administration. With the co-operation of the county administrative court, it can be used to enforce a form of administration that is based on collaboration between the facility owner and an administrator. The facility owner shall receive an injunction to hand over the administration to an administrator within a given delay, thus ensuring satisfactory administration. A written administration agreement shall be submitted to the county administrative court for approval. This agreement shall normally apply for a period of three years. Once the administration agreement has been approved, the county administrative court’s dealings with the case cease and the network authority shall instead monitor all compliance with the agreement.</p>
<p>Compulsory administration</p>
<p>The same basic prerequisite shall apply to administrative injunctions and to compulsory administration, although the latter measure is a more far-reaching form of intervention. In order for compulsory administration to apply, conditions must be such that it can be assumed that an administrative injunction would not be sufficient to ensure satisfactory administration. An administrator shall be appointed by the court in connection with decisions concerning compulsory administration. The administrator’s position is that of legal representative of the facility owner and the facility owner shall in principle be totally separated from all administration. The administrator’s contacts with the facility owner shall be kept to a minimum. The administrator should in principle be able to implement any measure that is considered conducive to appropriate administration and these measures are then binding on the owner of the facility. The administrator should however not be empowered to transfer the facility or to raise larger loans without the permission of the county administrative court. The primary task of an administrator shall be to ensure that the facility is satisfactorily managed. The administrator shall make every effort to ensure that the shortcomings and mismanagement that led to the decision concerning compulsory administration are eliminated. The administrator’s duties also include ensuring that the facility is improved as required. At the general level, these duties also include ensuring that the facility yields an adequate return.</p>
<p>The facility owner’s financial responsibility is not limited to the capital tied up in the facility and the return on this capital. At the request of the administrator, the county administrative court shall be empowered to decide that the facility owner shall pay certain sums required by the administrator in order to carry out necessary tasks. The Network Authority shall additionally be able to pay certain sums in advance.</p>
<p>Decisions concerning compulsory administration should normally apply for several years. The county administrative court shall be able both to extend this period and to decide that such administration should cease ahead of time.</p>
<p>All such administration shall be supervised by the county administrative board and the administrator shall report on the assignment to both the county administrative board and the facility owner. The facility owner can put in a claim for damages if the administrator is negligent.</p>
<p>The administrator’s fees shall primarily be paid from the return yielded by the facility. If necessary, the Network Authority shall be obliged to pay these fees in advance.</p>
<p>Redemption</p>
<p>In the event that compulsory administration is considered to be of no use, it shall be possible for the state to redeem the facility. This may occur, for example, in cases where it proves impossible to raise the necessary capital to repair and improve the facility or to guarantee its functions. One of the prerequisites for redemption should be that it is impossible to achieve a satisfactory form of administration. The administrator should in such a case be empowered to raise the question of the sale of the facility with its owner and of redemption with the Network Authority.</p>
<p>Judicial review</p>
<p>Apart from reviewing whether special administration should be implemented, the county administrative court should also be the legal body of most of the issues regulated by this legislative proposal. We propose that cases relating to this law should be concentrated to one county administrative court. Bearing in mind the location of the Network Authority, we propose that this court should be the Södermanland County Administrative Court. Since a decision concerning intervention pursuant to the proposed law involves substantial values and the county administrative court is the first instance, and since cases relating to this law are not expected to be commonplace, we propose that the cases concerned should not be subject to the regulations governing review permits. Bearing in mind the serious consequences to the electricity supply, amongst others, that may be expected if the prerequisites for applying this law are met and if it takes too long to intervene, cases relating to this law should be prioritised for review by the court.</p>
<p>Other legislation</p>
<p>In connection with the new law, we propose changes to chapter 2, paragraph 18, item 2 of the Swedish Electricity Act (1997:857) concerning the withdrawal of network concessions. We also propose that two new paragraphs be introduced into the Electricity Act. One involves ensuring that the network concession requirement does not present an obstacle to special administration. The other involves stating that the administrator’s task should cover all obligations entailed by the Swedish Electricity Act. In addition, a new regulation should be introduced in the Swedish Act on Confidentiality (Sekretesslagen,1980:100) limiting the insight of external parties into the financial position of individual companies or persons in cases relating to this law.</p>
<h2>Regional networks</h2>
<p>The function of the power line</p>
<p>The possibility for network companies to apply to the Network Authority for an exemption to allow them to report on certain parts of the electricity network in a manner other than that entailed by the granted network concession is being introduced. It shall be possible to grant exemptions for power lines running either wholly or partly outside the concession area, which can then be included in the area’s reporting. Correspondingly, it should be possible to include an area concession line in a regional network after submitting an application. A basic prerequisite for granting an exemption is that the new reporting unit created constitutes an organisationally and technically cohesive unit. The proposal allows greater account to be taken of the function of the facilities in the electricity network. Exemptions granted should only cease to apply when one of the concessions involved expires or if other particular reasons exist.</p>
<p>Step-down transformation</p>
<p>It is proposed that the regulation in chapter 4, paragraph 8, item 2 should cease to apply. This regulation stipulates that any assessment of the network tariff for a regional line should consider the concession holder’s costs for step-down transformation of voltage collectively for the entire country within each normal voltage interval when an equal number of step-down transformations have been performed to reach this voltage interval. This change means that the network concession holder’s entire operations, except for costs for connection to the national grid and other regional lines, if any, shall be assessed collectively for all the concession holder’s regional power lines throughout the entire country. The simplification of the paragraph entails the removal of regulations providing detailed specifications of how the network companies’ costs shall be assessed.</p>
<p>Multi-point deliveries</p>
<p>The commission has particularly considered the possibility of introducing a special regulation of the network tariff for regional network customers to whom electricity is transmitted from several connection points. The commission’s view, however, is that the problems arising in connection with this issue should be solved within the framework of applicable bodies of regulations. We therefore refrain from proposing amendments in this regard.</p>
<p>Directly connected to a transformer</p>
<p>A regulation is introduced into the Swedish Electricity Act whereby the network tariff for a customer who is directly connected to a transformer at the regional power line level may be formulated on the basis of the network tariff for higher voltage with a supplement for the step-down transformations of voltage. In addition, a similar regulation is proposed for the network tariff applying to persons running a so-called non concession-bound network who are directly connected to a transformer in a local network.</p>
<p>Bornholm and Åland</p>
<p>We do not believe that there are any reasons for introducing special regulations concerning network tariffs for the connecting of Bornholm’s and Åland’s electricity networks with the Swedish electricity network.</p>
