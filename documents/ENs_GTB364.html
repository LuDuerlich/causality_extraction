<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Swedish Government has appointed a commission, led by an investigator. As part of the commission that is now being presented, a review and evaluation of the Waste Tax Act (1999:673), LSA, will be carried out. The commission will follow developments within the EU and devote particular attention in its analysis to EC legal prerequisites, in particular to the rules on state aid. The commission will analyse the impact that taxation of waste has on different types of waste and different forms of waste management, and the extent to which taxation of waste has contributed to achieving the goals that have been set within waste policy.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, in accordance with the given directives, the commission will submit a proposal as to how a tax on waste that is incinerated can be legally formulated, and will also assess the suitability of introducing a tax of this kind, or whether other economic policy instruments should be recommended instead. This part of the commission, which concerns taxation of waste that is incinerated, has been given priority in an interim report.</p>
<p>In this final report, the commission is now presenting its review and evaluation of LSA. In addition, an account is given of some considerations concerning the issue of whether waste should be a fuel that is entitled to green certification in accordance with the green certification system for electricity. However, this section is introduced by a short summary of the commission’s proposals in the interim report, after which, the proposals contained in the final report are presented.</p>
<p>The commission’s interim report – “en BRASkatt?” – taxation of incinerated waste (SOU 2005:23)</p>
<p>In the interim report named in the heading, the commission submitted proposals as to how a tax on waste that is incinerated can be legally formulated. The commission also assessed whether it would be appropriate to introduce a tax in the proposed form.</p>
<p>The commission chose a legal solution that consisted of the waste’s fossil carbon element being incorporated as a fuel that is liable to taxation in the Excise Duty on Energy Act (1994:1776). When waste is used as fuel, its fossil element will thus be taxed similarly to other fossil fuels, which means among other things that energy tax and carbon dioxide tax is levied on the waste’s fossil element. Furthermore it represents a substantial move in the direction of electricity production, at the same time as the special reduction rules for energy intensive industries will apply automatically.</p>
<p>When assessing suitability, the commission found in every case overwhelming reasons in favour of introducing a tax in line with the proposed legal solution.</p>
<p>Result of the commission’s review and evaluation of the Waste Tax Act (1999:673)</p>
<p>The tax’s policy effect</p>
<p>Disposal has previously been the cheapest method of dealing with waste. Due to the waste tax, among other things, disposal has become more expensive, which has led to material recycling, incineration and biological treatment becoming more economically viable. Statistics from the Swedish Tax Agency show that the amount of waste that is conveyed into and that remains in the waste plants has continuously decreased since the tax was introduced. Statistics from the Swedish Association of Waste Management (RVF) and the industry show that energy recovery and material recycling (incl. material recycling using biological methods) of waste have increased. As a result of the waste tax, among other things, waste has thus been directed from disposal to material recycling or energy recovery.</p>
<p>The results that the commission has presented show that disposal of waste has decreased substantially  during the five years</p>
<p>that the Act has been in force. The reduction has however taken place during the same period as the disposal ordinance has been in force, partly with its stricter requirements for the actual form of disposal, partly with its prohibition on disposal of sorted combustible waste and organic waste. During the same period the so-called acceptance criteria have also been considerably tightened. This means that it might be difficult to attribute all (or even a large part of) the reduction in disposal to the waste tax. Regardless of what the relationship actually is, substantial changes in the disposal pattern have de facto taken place during the period that the tax has been in force. The only way that the commission can interpret this is that the tax has had a policy effect in the way that was intended on its introduction.</p>
<p>The tax in an EU perspective</p>
<p>Since the commission’s directive was drafted, the EU commission has arrived at the decision that the various tax exemptions in LSA do not in any way constitute state aid. It is precisely the issue of aid of this kind that is, as also mentioned by way of introduction, something of a principal issue in the directive and receives particular emphasis there. The EU commission’s decision has in part placed the issue in a different light. The commission’s position can now to some extent be considered to be based on the fact that there is a decision from the EU commission with the implication that the structure that LSA has cannot lead in any way to the tax exemptions being considered as state aid. The tax exemptions are thus considered to be a consequence of the tax’s "nature and general scheme".</p>
<p>An important point of departure during the commission’s review of LSA has been if possible to try to uphold the principles that govern the formulation of the act, which has also resulted in it receiving the requisite acceptance in respect of state aid.</p>
<p>The tax’s to be or not to be:</p>
<p>Disposal has been decreasing during the entire period that the tax has been in force. The commission has not been able to find any grounds that the tax has stagnated as a policy instrument and that</p>
<p>it is therefore no longer needed. On the contrary, it seems appropriate that the tax remains in place in order to support the ban on disposal of organic and combustible waste, to continue to move other waste away from disposal, and to contribute to reducing the generation of waste that is disposed.</p>
<p>With regard to the way in which the tax is constructed, it is however important that the act is continuously evaluated in the way that has now taken place. It is naturally of particular importance that existing tax exemptions in the act are regularly reviewed with the aim of examining their continued eligibility. This approach is appropriate from both an environmental point of view and an EU perspective.</p>
<p>The tax’s future formulation</p>
<p>The commission has thoroughly reviewed the way in which the tax currently functions in practice. During this review both the Swedish Tax Agency and the industry have had the opportunity to give an account of their experiences of the tax’s actual application. On the basis of this review, the commission has come to the conclusion that the tax should be applied as it is today. Application is working well, and after a running-in period the parties involved seem to have adapted well to the classification that now prevails in the taxation. The commission’s position primarily means that the so-called net disposal method shall continue to be applied in the future, but also in general that the forms for collection of waste tax shall remain unchanged.</p>
<p>The system of different forms of tax exemption for, for example, different kinds of waste is working well and can be assumed to contribute to the tax having the intended effect. During the review the commission has tested the relevance of the existing tax exemptions and has proposed certain changes with the aim of, if possible, increasing the tax’s policy effect.</p>
<p>The largest change that is proposed is that in future the tax should be differentiated. This should take place by making the tax on sorted combustible waste and organic waste higher than for other waste. These waste categories are included in the disposal ban. However, it is possible for disposal to take place by means of a dispensation, or through an exemption from the ban. A higher tax on these categories supports the disposal ban, at the same time as</p>
<p>the dispensations will probably be held back to some extent. One anticipated effect is that it should be possible to dismantle the dispensation procedure more quickly than without this differentiation. A more drastic alternative, which however is not recommended by the commission, would be to scrap the possibility of dispensation.</p>
<p>In addition to the reasons given above for an increased tax rate on the categories mentioned, an increase is principally necessary in order to balance the introduction of any tax on incineration of waste that might be introduced. In the opinion of the commission, the higher tax rate should be set at SEK 470 (52 €) per tonne. It will be possible to continue to tax other waste at SEK 370 (41 €) per tonne. The commission has consequently not been able to substantiate that there are reasons to additionally increase the tax rate for other waste in relation to the current tax rate.</p>
<p>A minor differentiation is also proposed through discontinuing tax exemption for contaminated soil from soil remediation and for contaminated dredged material. These types of waste should instead be taxed at a lower tax rate of SEK 90 (10 €) per tonne. The reason behind this change is that in the course of conducting the enquiry it transpired that development is currently taking place with regard to the treatment of contaminated earth, which can be expected to persist and increase if the tax signals that the tax exemption is starting to be questioned.</p>
<p>In general, the commission proposes that tax exemption for composting and reactor-based digestion is restricted to the extent that tax exemption should only apply if the principal treatment is completed within one year. However, exemption from this can be made for composting of parkand garden waste that can be permitted a longer treatment period without being subject to tax.</p>
<p>Finally, the commission is proposing certain minor adjustments to some of the tax exemptions for so-called industry-specific waste.</p>
<p>Green certificates for waste incineration</p>
<p>Although not specifically indicated in its directive, the commission, for particular reasons, has drawn attention to the issue of green certification and waste incineration and has found cause to</p>
<p>consider whether waste incineration shall be entitled to green certification for electricity production.</p>
<p>Within the parameters of its task, the commission has accordingly defined certain issues that are of particular importance in terms of the principal assessment of whether additional waste categories should be entitled to green certification, or whether general changes from a waste policy perspective should be made to the green certificate system. The commission has therefore taken into consideration the proposal regarding a tax on waste that is incinerated that the commission submitted in its interim report, and the significance of a tax such as this for production of electricity from waste.</p>
<p>The green certificate system currently includes, among others, some biofuels which are specified in the ordinance (2003:120) on green certification. In relation to the so-called. RES-E-directive’s definition of biomass the ordinance has a more limited area of application. One issue is whether this area of application should be expanded to more generally allow the renewable proportion of waste entitlement to green certification. In recent judicial application, the renewable proportion of household waste has been considered to be included in the ordinance, which was probably not the original intention. An additional issue is therefore whether this relationship should remain.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the aim of the green certificate system and the waste policy goals, along with the commission’s proposal on a tax on incineration of waste, the commission considers that § 4 of the ordinance on green certification should be supplemented in the following two respects.</p>
<p>Animal by-products categories 1 and 2 shall be entitled to green certification, and</p>
<p>the concept of refined forms in the provision shall only relate to biological material that is refined with the aim of extracting energy from them. The renewable proportion of mixed household waste shall therefore not be entitled to green certification.</p>
<p>Consequences of the proposals</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>In this final report, the commission has not proposed any dramatic changes to an already existing tax and tax structure. It is therefore quite natural that the consequences of the proposals will not be too extensive. The budgetary consequences of the commission’s proposal are specified in table 1 below. It should be noted in this context that the calculation of the tax on sorted combustible and organic waste is static in as much as for 2008 and 2009 it is based on unchanged amounts being deposited. If the tax acts in the way intended however, the amounts will decrease.</p>
<p>Budgetary consequences</p>
<p>The periodised net revenues for the public sector will be relatively low with regard to contaminated earth and dredged material. The state will receive tax revenues, but, along with the municipalities, will incur increased tax expenses for disposal of contaminated earth and dredged material. The state will incur increased expenses of SEK 16 million (1 772,100 € )  while municipalities will incur increased expenses of SEK 2 million (221,500 € ) . For the increased tax on sorted combustible waste and organic waste, the municipalities might incur increased tax expenses of SEK 6 million (664,500 € ) .</p>
<p>Table 1 Periodised net effects for public sector 2007–2009 and permanent net effect, millions of Swedish krona (euro)</p>
<p>Differentiated tax rates and increased administration</p>
<p>According to the Swedish Tax Agency, a differentiation of the proposed model will not result in any serious obstacles for application and collection. The introduction will naturally involve some programming work etc., with some relatively minor expenses as a consequence. These are calculated provisionally at about SEK 80,000 (8,800 € ) .</p>
<p>For those who are in possession of waste (and those who are liable to tax) the submission of some additional information may be required. However. it concerns waste, the quantity and status of which should be well known by involved parties, among others, due to the fact that documentation exists showing that the waste is covered by dispensation, or alternatively that it is exempted from the disposal ban.</p>
<p>Other consequences</p>
<p>Other consequences of the proposals for, for example, households and trade and industry, as well as local government etc, are deemed to be extremely minor, and are therefore not referred to here.</p>
<p>Entry into force</p>
<p>It should be possible for the changes proposed by the Commission to enter into force on the 1 st  January 2007.</p>
