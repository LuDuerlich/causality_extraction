<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The purpose of the commission is to objectively analyze the socalled waste incineration tax currently imposed on incineration of household waste. The commission has, in accordance with the given directive, investigated whether the waste incineration tax provides cost-efficient steering toward the objectives of the current Swedish waste, energy, and climate policies and whether the tax can be made more effective in this regard.</p>
<p>Since no data that could enable an econometric analysis of the effects of the tax is available, the analysis is mainly based on a valuation of the incentive effects of the tax, and on interviews and discussions with industry representatives. Consequently, the findings are qualitative. However, this is only a minor problem since the tax seems to have had only small effects.</p>
<p>In the development of the presented proposition, the commission has considered for example previous relevant investigative efforts, the new framework directive on waste, and the rules of Community law regarding state aid.</p>
<p>The commission proposes an abolishment of the tax on incineration of household waste, and that no other tax or policy instrument is implemented in its place. The reason for this proposition is that the tax does not steer toward the objectives that motivated its implementation. In order to compensate the SEK 226 million revenue loss, the commission suggests a general increase of the carbon dioxide tax by about SEK 0.83/kg carbon dioxide.</p>
<h2>The waste market</h2>
<p>The waste market is quite extensive; 1 700-1 800 businesses together generate approximately SEK 35 000–40 000 million in yearly revenues. The market can be broken down into a number of submarkets with a variety of characteristics. The operations range from small scale to large scale, and the companies are more or less vertically integrated. While some sub-markets are largely monopolized, others are exposed to competition. While some companies both collect and manage many types of waste, others focus only on collection or management of certain categories of waste, such as hazardous waste.</p>
<p>Sweden’s 290 municipalities are responsible for the collection, transportation, recycling, and disposal of household waste, with the exception of the types of products that are covered by the statutory producer responsibility, i.e., packaging materials, waste paper, automobiles, tires, electrical and electronic products, and batteries. Nevertheless, the municipalities do participate in the collection of batteries and electrical and electronic products. Waste that falls under the producer responsibility can be produced by both households and businesses/organizations. The producer responsibility concept mainly implies that parties that manufacture or import affected products are also responsible for the re-use, recycling, or other environmentally friendly management of the resulting waste.</p>
<p>The municipalities are also responsible for developing a municipal waste management code, which consists of a waste plan and regulations concerning municipal waste management. Management of waste that falls under the responsibility of the municipalities is financed through fees imposed on affected property owners, and hence generally not via the municipal tax.</p>
<p>The municipals are free to decide how they want to organize their waste management. When it comes to household waste, where the municipalities carry the responsibility, it is common that private companies are involved in collection and transportation, while public companies tend to manage the treatment. There are 53 wholly-owned municipal companies and 18 regional companies in waste management. Most of the Swedish waste incinerators and landfills are owned by municipalities, who together with the municipal companies and the three big energy companies Fortum, Vattenfall, and E.ON own the entire waste incineration capacity.</p>
<p>The five largest actors in household waste incineration are: Fortum, SYSAV, Renova, Tekniska Verken Linköping, and Vattenfall.</p>
<p>The Swedish Environmental Code defines household waste as the “waste generated by households and comparable waste from other sources.” Comparable waste refers to waste from industries, business enterprises, and other similar activities that in a waste context is comparable to waste generated by households. Waste generated by personnel cafeterias, restaurant waste, and bathroom waste are some examples of this category.</p>
<p>Waste generated by industries, stores, and building and construction companies is often referred to as commercial waste. In contrast to household waste, commercial waste is waste generated as a result of business activities. Commercial waste is not regulated by law, and is sometimes called industrial waste, process waste or something similar depending on where the waste is generated. Commercial waste is mainly managed by private companies when it comes to collection and recycling, while municipally-owned actors are involved in a significant part of recycling through incineration or biological treatment and disposal by deposition.</p>
<p>The amount of household waste generally increases proportionally with an increase in private consumption. The amount of treated household waste in Sweden was 4.7 million metric tons in 2007. This figure includes:</p>
<p>• Waste in bins and bags.</p>
<p>• Bulky waste.</p>
<p>• Hazardous waste.</p>
<p>• Comparable waste from for example stores, offices, industries, and restaurants.</p>
<p>• The share of the household waste that falls under producer responsibility.</p>
<p>Forty-nine percent of this total amount was material recycled, 46 % was incinerated with energy extraction, and 4 % was deposited. One percent is hazardous waste. In addition to the 2.2 million metric tons of household waste that was incinerated, Sweden incinerated 2.3 million metric tons of other types of waste (mainly industrial waste).</p>
<h2>The goals of waste management policy</h2>
<p>The area of waste management is very heterogeneous, and is strongly affected by a large number of waste, climate, and energy policy targets. It is in some cases not clear whether these targets are based on socio-economic efficiency or on some other criteria. The relationship between ends and means is often unclear.</p>
<p>The so-called waste hierarchy constitutes the political base of the EU waste management policy. The waste hierarchy implies that waste should first of all be prevented from being created in the first place. However, once it has been created, it should primarily be reused. If this is not possible, it should, in order of preference, be recycled, incinerated, or deposited. The waste hierarchy goes far back in time and has a strong intuitive appeal. It may for example seem unreasonable to incinerate waste that could be re-used or recycled. Hence, it is hardly surprising that material recycling has gained such strong political support. However, it must not be forgotten that material recycling is a resource and energy intensive activity, making a determination of its socio-economic value an empirical matter.</p>
<p>The socio-economic efficiency of the waste hierarchy is reduced mainly by two aspects:</p>
<p>• Predetermined quantitative targets dictating the same recycling rate regardless of product imply significant variation in the marginal costs of recycling, both within and among countries. This is especially true for lightweight materials, such as  non-rigid plastic, and for materials in small amounts, since these may be sensitive to transport costs.</p>
<p>• A high ambition level in terms of separation and  re-use of household waste causes rapidly increasing marginal costs. This implies that a too strict application of the waste hierarchy may lead to unnecessarily high socio-economic costs (especially transportation costs).</p>
<p>The extent to which a too strict application of the waste hierarchy is consistent with effective environmental policy and efficient resource management is obviously a politically very controversial and emotionally sensitive issue, while from an economic perspective it is a mere empirical matter. The conclusion reached by the commission based on a number of studies is that from a socio-economic perspective, the allocation between deposition, recycling, and incineration is not an “either/or” trade-off, but rather a “both/and” kind of question. Since deposition of combustible waste is prohibited in the EU, the only options left for this kind of waste are incineration and material recycling.</p>
<p>Collection of recyclable materials is (as almost all other processes) resource demanding, and in addition energy intensive, and also entails increasing marginal costs. The marginal costs of waste incineration on the other hand are fairly constant. This necessitates a careful comparison of (1) the effects of increased material recycling and (2) the effects of waste incineration on resources and the environment. Type of waste and spatial aspects such as high transportation costs, especially in some regions, are some of the factors that affect marginal cost. Quantitative targets for recycling levels can easily lead to very high marginal costs. There are therefore both socio-economic and environmental policy-related reasons why great care must be used when setting the level of ambition for material recycling.</p>
<h2>The goal of the existing tax</h2>
<p>The introduction of the waste incineration tax, which constituted a part of the so-called green tax exchange, had many purposes. The most predominant was to promote the kind of waste management that was considered environmentally and socio-economically advantageous. However, the tax was also intended to stimulate attainment of the declared objectives of Sweden’s energy, climate, and environmental policies.</p>
<p>From the government’s statement in the proposition, it can be concluded that they (the government) presuppose that re-use, material recycling, and biological treatment of household waste is generally more beneficial than incineration. However, these methods of waste management cannot generally compete economically with waste incineration. One of the purposes with the tax was therefore to make the method of incineration relatively more expensive compared to the other methods and thereby stimulate re-use and material recycling. In addition, household waste contains fossil material, and the waste incineration tax therefore implies a price on the CO emissions resulting from incineration.</p>
<p>From an energy policy perspective, and in accordance with the EU Co-generation of Heat and Power (CHP) Directive, steering of waste for incineration must be done according to the incineration hierarchy; i.e., high-effect co-generation is better than loweffect co-generation, which in turn is better than pure heat production. The tax was therefore designed with strong incentives for incineration of waste in combined power and heat plants.</p>
<h2>Waste policy instruments</h2>
<p>Some characteristics of household waste are of importance in analyses of policy measures:</p>
<p>• It is heterogeneous (it consists of about ten main components).</p>
<p>• Its composition is expensive and economically unreasonable to measure continuously. The composition of bin and bag waste is normally estimated based on  so-called pick-analyses. Due to personal integrity reasons, these analyses can be difficult to perform at the household level.</p>
<p>• The variance is large. The composition varies with municipal waste management, season, water content, types of buildings in the area, etc.</p>
<p>• The statistical uncertainty is relatively high since the numbers of measurements and  pick-analyses are relatively low and since the import and export statistics are undeveloped. Estimations of the energy content of waste are based on mathematical formulas derived from the contents of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and ash in sub-components of waste.</p>
<p>• Estimations of the fossil and biological contents of waste suffer from similar weaknesses.</p>
<p>Looked at from an incentive and therefore an instrument perspective, some aspects are unique to household waste:</p>
<p>• The amount of waste increases roughly proportionally to an increase in private consumption. Thus, the amount of waste is largely determined by the development of private consumption. One explanation to this is that an average household rarely lets the type of packaging decide which product to buy, and another is that it does not usually determine what proportion of its budget should be spent on consumption.</p>
<p>• With the exception of households in a  single-family house, and to a certain degree housing associations, it is difficult to use economic incentives to affect the amount of household waste or how households handle their waste (except through a depositrefund system).</p>
<p>• Economic incentives that affect the volume or weight of household waste, such as a volumeor  weight-based waste collection fee, may have negative external effects such as improper and/or illegal burning of waste and illegal dumping of waste. One indication of this is that a weight-based waste collection fee has been shown to reduce the amount of collected waste in Swedish single-family housing areas by about 20 % while other registered waste flows have not increased.</p>
<p>• Moral incentives combined with short distances and high accessibility to recycling stations (with  so-called sidewalk collection as an extreme case) could be expected to be more meaningful, and therefore more appropriate, than economic incentives as instruments to affect waste management among households. The opportunities for waste sorting are strongly related to the design of the waste collection service.</p>
<p>• Access to storage space, transportation options, etc. may restrict the choices available to households.</p>
<p>These aspects make the choice of instruments very complicated. In fact, the difficulty and probably also the impropriety of influencing households directly with economic incentives (with the exception of a deposit-refund system) constitute the main problem in waste management policy. Managing waste in a socio-economically efficient manner has the characteristics of a public good, which implies weak economic incentives at the individual level. The costs of waste management are usually included in housing rents, and the presentday level of technology makes the transaction costs of measurement and fee determination at the individual level very high. In terms of the waste incineration tax, the distance is great between those whom the tax is imposed on (the waste incineration plants) and those who in the end actually pay the tax (households).</p>
<p>The heterogeneity of household waste also implies that the information needed to design optimal taxes and/or regulations is missing; in fact, even if this information did exist, we would still be stuck with a significant problem of monitoring and controlling household behavior. As long as households can not be monitored and debited individually, the basic economic incentive problem remains.</p>
<p>However, the difficulties involved in using economic incentives to influence waste management among households are largely compensated for by the households’ norm-based willingness to contribute to more environmentally friendly waste management through waste sorting. It is mainly the responsibility of the municipalities to effectively take advantage of and administer this social capital. The anger and public disappointment that arise when waste sorted out for recycling is sent to incineration, purposely or accidentally, illustrate how quickly trust capital can be eroded.</p>
<h2>The design of the waste incineration tax</h2>
<p>The waste incineration tax is based on the fossil carbon content of household waste. However, the heterogeneity of household waste makes any reliable continuous carbon measurement economically unreasonable. For this reason, the figure used to calculate fossil carbon content of household waste has simply been set to 12.6 % of the weight. The resulting amount of carbon in waste is subject to both CO and energy taxation. The nominal CO tax in 2008 was SEK 3 709 per metric ton of fossil carbon, which corresponds to SEK 1 011 per metric ton of CO or about SEK 467 per metric ton of waste. The energy tax in 2008 was SEK 155 per metric ton of fossil carbon, which corresponds to SEK 42 per metric ton of CO or about SEK 20 per metric ton of waste.</p>
<p>The gross incineration tax revenue in 2007 was SEK 370 million. Gross tax revenue here means the taxes paid according to filed tax returns minus the tax reductions related to combined power and heat production but not minus refunds of taxes paid for heat delivered to industries. The latter amounted to about SEK 144 million in 2007, thus resulting in net revenues of SEK 226 million.</p>
<p>No energy or CO tax is charged when household waste is incinerated and consumed to produce taxable electrical power. If the efficiency of electricity generation is at least 5 %, there is a tax relief for fuel (waste) consumed to produce heat at combined power and heat plants. At this level of efficiency, there is a CO tax relief of 19%. The tax relief then increases gradually as the efficiency level increases, and reaches 79% at an efficiency level of 15%. As far as the energy tax, there is complete exemption at electricity efficiency levels above 5%. Counted in money, this means that in 2008 the CO tax and the energy tax totaled SEK 487 per metric ton of household waste for incineration plants without production of electricity, while the CO tax (there is no energy tax) in combined power and heat production is only about SEK 98 per metric ton if the efficiency of electricity generation is 15% – hence a very large reduction (80%).</p>
<p>No tax reduction is granted for heat production at plants that do not combine power and heat production. However, when industrial companies buy heat from a waste incineration plant, the plant (as with other types of fuel) pays the lower industrial tax rate for that heat; i.e., a 21% CO tax. The plant can also use this rate for fuels used to produce heat for professional agriculture, aquaculture, and forestry.</p>
<p>All in all, 95% of all incinerated household waste is subject to the mentioned tax reductions or tax exemptions. The net average tax is about SEK 90/ton. This means that the ability of the household waste incineration sector to adjust to the tax reduction regulations is extremely good.</p>
<h2>Target achievements of the waste incineration tax</h2>
<p>The commission’s analyses lead to the conclusion that no significant steering effects of the waste incineration tax can be seen – with one exception: it clearly allocates household waste to combined power and heat production instead of to heat-only production, while the tax exempt commercial waste is allocated to plants for heat-only production. In addition, the tax has had only small effects, if any, on the amount of generated household waste, on the degree of material recycling, and so far also on the volume of combined power and heat production. As an instrument to achieve Sweden’s waste-, environmental-, energy-, and climate-policy objectives, the tax is therefore not very effective.</p>
<p>The waste incineration plants generally perceive the tax as extremely difficult to handle, both from an optimization and an accounting perspective: 1. The tax is hard to adjust to due to its relatively complicated tax reduction model. On the other hand, nearly all plants have an efficiency of electricity generation that is higher than 15% except for in the summer months when the consumption of heat is low. In addition, the extent of the tax reduction indicates that the  tax-driven production optimization works very well. 2. A correct account of the tax is impossible in practice since the tax burden is really a  time-continuous function of the efficiency of electricity generation, which can only be approximated. This is particularly difficult during summer months with low heat consumption. 3. The basis for the tax reduction is impossible to account for accurately. Household waste is commonly incinerated together with commercial waste. The plants liable for the tax have to rely on information from the waste suppliers and then keep track of when the different shipments are burned. Household waste is oftentimes delivered mixed with commercial waste, especially in connection with  long-distance transports. The respective proportions of household and commercial waste are consequently difficult to determine. From a tax audit point of view, it is fair to say that the evidence gets, literally, burnt up. 4. The extra work that the tax calls for is quite extensive relative to the revenue it generates.</p>
<p>Tax-driven transports where commercial waste (which is not taxed) is shipped to heat-only plants and household waste is shipped to combined power and heat plants do occur. Although the extent of these transports is difficult to back up with statistics, the tax does create economic space for an increase of transport distances equal to about 250-300 km.</p>
<p>The commission finds that the existing waste incineration tax appears to be a purely fiscal tax; i.e., it almost entirely lacks steering effects. The only clear effect of the tax (other than increased waste reception and management fees) is a reallocation of waste among different incineration plants at the cost of increased transportation costs, which implies increased environmental stress.</p>
<p>Another not insignificant problem with the tax is that the grossly simplified estimation of carbon content in household waste, combined with the scope of application of the definition of such waste according to environmental law, imply that sorted wood waste (e.g., scrapped furniture) from households ends up being taxed. Consequently, the market value of this kind of wood waste decreases, in turn resulting in sales difficulties. It is obviously principally inappropriate that the CO tax is imposed on a pure biofuel.</p>
<h2>The commission’s proposition</h2>
<p>The commission proposes that the household waste incineration tax be abolished. The reason is that the tax does not serve as an instrument to reach the targets that motivated its implementation. Therefore, the commission proposes that the tax be abolished without replacing it with another tax or policy instrument. To compensate for the SEK 226 million in lost revenues, the commission proposes a general increase of the CO tax by about SEK 0,83 per kg CO .</p>
<p>The commission has been instructed to analyze alternative policy instruments. Based on previous investigations and analyses of alternative tax measures, the commission concludes that a reformation of the waste incineration tax aimed to improve its level of target achievement is not possible without incurring unacceptably high socio-economic costs. Therefore, from an efficiency standpoint this  well-intended  (and politically attractive) tax appears to in the end fall short of a  well-defined  target.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the waste incineration tax lacks significant steering effects (with the exception of its effects on waste transportation patterns, which has never been stated as a policy objective), it can not be argued that its abolishment calls for a compensating instrument to be implemented.</p>
<p>It is in this context also important to point out that it is the commission’s belief that no new instrument should be implemented without first objectively and thoroughly analyzing both its target and the effectiveness of the means. Such a time consuming, and to some extent research intensive, analysis of the entire Swedish waste management policy has not been possible to carry out within the very restricted resource and time frame available to the commission. Rather, the task of the commission has been to develop a position regarding whether the Swedish waste incineration tax should be abolished and, if so, whether it should be replaced with a different policy instrument.</p>
<p>An unbiased analysis of the entire waste policy should be preceded by research that sheds light on economic-institutional aspects in terms of municipality behavior, market analyses, environmental effects of different municipal waste-collection fees and waste-collection systems, and socio-economic analyses of various waste policy objectives. It is the opinion of the commission that, based on our current level of knowledge, motives for further steering in the area of waste management are lacking.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposition Consequences in terms of energy policy</h2>
<p>Since the incineration tax primarily steers the allocation of waste between combined power and heat production and heat-only production, the most important question is whether other instruments are needed in order to secure a continued high combined power and heat production and to take advantage of the possibilities of producing electricity through efficient combined powerand heatproducing processes when Sweden makes additions to its waste incineration capacity.</p>
<p>The primary incentive effect of an abolishment of the tax would be that transportation cost minimization would then become profitable by only considering the technical characteristics of different incineration plants. Both household waste and commercial waste could be incinerated where it is most appropriate technically and in consideration of the involved transportation costs. A reallocation of waste within the framework of the existing incineration capacity would be expected; an increased share of commercial waste would be incinerated in combined power and heat plants and an increased share of household waste would be incinerated in heat-only plants. The resulting increase in energy efficiency would be expected to result in a small increase in the combined power and heat production.</p>
<p>The incentives provided by the tax to invest in new combined power and heat production capacity are difficult to estimate. Without a tax, these kinds of investments depend primarily on the expected development of electricity prices and on the supply of competitively priced waste fuel. Today it is profitable, even without tax incentives, to build combined heat and power instead of heatonly plants. Thus, almost all new plants have a turbine, and, moreover, several existing heat-only plants have converted or are converting to combined heat and power. The commission’s opinion is hence that there are currently no reasons for further steering toward combined power and heat production after the tax has been abolished. However, if a need were to arise, then the already existing electricity certificate system (although comparatively weaker) could be used to control the flow of waste.</p>
<h2>Consequences in terms of environmental policy</h2>
<p>Since it cannot be determined whether the tax has been positive or negative from an environmental or a climate point of view, it cannot be determined whether an abolishment of the tax would have positive or negative environmental effects.</p>
<p>An abolishment of the waste incineration tax would affect the relative prices of different fuels. Household waste would become relatively cheaper compared to commercial waste, biofuels, and fossil fuels. However, due to technical and legal reasons, it is difficult for plants that were not built to perform waste incineration to convert to this activity. The commission concludes that the share of all household waste that is incinerated would not change with an abolishment of the tax.</p>
<p>An abolishment of the waste incineration tax would eliminate a large proportion of the microeconomic incentives to “tax optimize” where to ship different kinds of waste for incineration. Waste transportation would decrease as a consequence, since the economic incentives to steer household waste toward combined power and heat production and commercial waste to heat-only production would no longer exist. The waste would instead, regardless of type, go to the plant with the nearest location and with the technical ability and capacity to accept the waste.</p>
<h2>Consequences in terms of waste policy</h2>
<p>An abolishment of the waste incineration tax would affect the relative prices of different household waste treatment alternatives. The available statistics show, however, that the tax has not had any significant effects on material recycling. The commission therefore concludes that an abolishment of the tax would not have any significant effects in this regard.</p>
<p>It also needs to be emphasized that the policy objectives stated for material recycling of household waste have already been achieved, suggesting that further stimulation of material recycling can not be motivated from a waste policy perspective. Before deciding whether to increase material recycling further, the marginal cost of doing so needs to be analyzed. This is necessary in order to weigh the marginal cost against the environmental loss/gain that would result from increased material recycling.</p>
<p>Our knowledge about municipal behavior is limited. It is therefore difficult to assess to what extent an abolishment of the tax would be transferred back to the households. However, it seems likely that some municipalities would use the resulting budget space to increase activity, and primarily to finance measures to increase waste sorting by households. An abolishment of the tax may therefore very well affect recycling to the same extent as possible alternatives to the tax. We may in favorable terms describe this development as a promotion of research, development, and demonstration within the highly politically prioritized area of renewable energy.</p>
<h2>Cost reductions for households and businesses</h2>
<p>Despite the speculations above, it can be expected that an abolishment of the waste incineration tax would reduce the households’ waste costs somewhat, either as a direct effect of reduced municipal waste collection fees or indirectly through lower rent increases.</p>
<p>As a consequence, their disposable incomes would increase. If this in turn would lead to increased consumption, the amount of household waste would increase accordingly. However, in the big picture, this increase can be regarded as negligible.</p>
<p>An abolishment of the waste incineration tax would most likely reduce the administrative costs for the affected businesses and for the Swedish Tax Agency. The total cost decrease is estimated at SEK 10–13 million per year.</p>
<p>Abolishment of the tax would imply a significant simplification for the affected incineration plants.</p>
<h2>Effective date</h2>
<p>It should be possible to abolish the tax on 1 January 2010.</p>
