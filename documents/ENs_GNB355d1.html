<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The remit</h2>
<p>My terms of reference require me to investigate the need for coordinating the legislation applying to radio and television broadcasting and telecommunications and in this context to consider whether further legislation is needed in order to safeguard freedom of expression, availability and diversity and to counteract harmful restraints on trade. I am also to propose ways in which the ongoing work with reference to matters of convergence should be conducted.</p>
<p>My deliberations are to be based on a description of the development of electronic information services. Against this background I am to chart and analyse the extent to which the existing legislation is applicable to electronic information services and the way in which the legislation affects their design, use and distribution. In this connection I have chosen to interpret the expression “electronic information services” in a broad sense, focusing on the development and provision of services and infrastructure within the framework of IT, telecommunications and media activities. Services connected with physical data carriers, however, fall for the best part outside this account. It is further stated in the terms of reference that I am to observe and take into consideration the work in progress within the EU. In addition I have found it beneficial, both for the progress of the inquiry and to continuing work with reference to matters of convergence, to give a special account of the treatment of these questions in a number of countries.</p>
<h2>The convergence phenomenon</h2>
<p>Convergence as a phenomenon can be described in various ways, depending on the perspective which is being discussed, and with varying degrees of complexity. The conditions which, in the context of technical progress, are leading to the convergence of infrastructures, services and apparatus are fundamental. To this are added the market movements whereby agents in different sectors are involving themselves with one or more neighbouring sectors. In terms of my remit, it is relevant to describe the effects of convergence in relation to network convergence, convergence of services, apparatus convergence and market convergence.</p>
<p>Network convergence : Network convergence implies the possibility of different, traditionally separate infrastructures for the distribution of services of different kinds being integrated so as to carry “each other’s” services. Above all this concerns, one the one hand, infrastructures intended for private communication, such as telecommunications and mobile telephony networks, and on the other, infrastructures intended for one-way transmission of information to the general public, e.g. terrestrial networks, cable networks and satellite systems for sound radio and/or television broadcasting.</p>
<p>Service convergence : Service convergence means the amalgamation, in various respects, of services of different kinds. Above all it concerns communication services , conveying information between users (e.g. telephony, fax, video conferencing and e-mail) and, secondly, content services , in which a provider supplies or procures a certain content for others to make use of (e.g. radio and television broadcasting, information databases and web sites on the Internet). In addition, service convergence also implies information previously associated with a particular medium coming to be supplied through alternative media (e.g. books on CD, rental video cassettes and video-on-demand, and newspapers and magazines and electronic services on the Web).</p>
<p>Apparatus convergence : Apparatus convergence refers to the amalgamation of different types of apparatus used for different types of service, as for example when telephones and radio receivers can also be used for receiving text and moving images, television receivers and mobile phones can be used for information processing, like computers, and computers themselves can serve as television receivers.</p>
<p>Market convergence:  Convergence of networks, services and apparatus makes it both possible and interesting and, to some extent, necessary for business enterprises formerly active in a particular sector to involve themselves in various ways in one or more neighbouring sectors. This can, for example, mean telecommunications enterprises entering the media market by producing/supplying/purveying content services, media enterprises investing in infrastructure, and IT enterprises acting in the telecommunications and media markets by offering communications equipment and producing content services. To this are added new enterprises which grow up independently of the traditional sectors and provide multimedia services of various kinds.</p>
<p>The legal consequences of convergence are revealed by the increasing difficulty, against this background, of distinguishing between the IT, telecommunications and media markets which used to be relatively clearly segregated: one and the same service can, for example, come under different, possibly several, regulatory instruments, depending on the medium or channel of communication used for conveying it to the recipient or on the manner in which the recipient obtains the service. This has to be viewed against the background of the regulatory instruments of these sectors being framed on different premisses, with different underlying motives and with different authorities in charge. In addition, technical progress is also creating new types of services and phenomena and new possibilities of conducting telecommunications and media activities whose subjection to the existing regulatory systems may not be very practical or convenient. This not only changes the ability of the existing regulatory instruments to serve their purpose, it also affects the basic preconditions and assumptions of existing law.</p>
<h2>European Community law</h2>
<p>European Community law has a great impact on national law. The legislative activities of Member States are in principle affected in two ways. For one thing, the Member States have to take active measures to give effect to the directives issued by the European Community institutions, and secondly, they must refrain from passing legislation which is contrary to European Community law.</p>
<p>In the telecommunications sector, European Community law is fairly comprehensive and detailed in its de-regulation of the telecommunications market and with regard to harmonisation of, for example, conditions governing access to and use of publicly available telecommunications networks and services. In the broadcasting sector, for example, the “Television without Frontiers” directive regulates the free movement and content of television broadcasting services. In addition, technical issues in the broadcasting sector come under the directive on standards for the transmission of television signals. As regards the regulation of the information society by European Community law, a number of different measures have been taken to harmonise the legislation of Member States in this field and to promote the development of the information society. They include technical standards and regulations, databases, data protection, conditional access, electronic commerce and copyright.</p>
<p>Within the EU, extensive work is in progress on guidelines for adjusting the legal framework to the progress of convergence. Since December 1997 the Commission has issued a Green Paper, a working document and a communication on convergence. In its communication the Commission states that it intends to develop proposals for action on regulatory reform. Infrastructure regulation is to be given a more horizontal approach, i.e. the same rules are to apply regardless of infrastructure. Proposals for the regulation of content services will mean either adjustments to existing regulations or the proposal of new regulations altogether. In addition, special measures are planned with regard to the regulation of both content and infrastructure, and the Commission is to issue a Communication on the general consultation concerning its radio spectrum Green Paper. Work on convergence issues, together with the review of telecommunications regulations in progress during 1999 and work with the radio spectrum Green Paper, are expected to lead to proposals for amendments to European Community law on the communications sector within the next two years.</p>
<h2>Conditions in some other countries</h2>
<p>The report contains a general review of the treatment of convergence issues in thirteen other countries. For each country an account is given of the legislation applying to telecommunications and media respectively, of the authorities active in these fields and of particular measures taken in response to convergence. Convergence issues are being observed in all the countries dealt with, albeit in different ways and to differing extents. Certain countries have passed legislation which, in various ways and to various degrees, is adapted to a convergence development. This is the case, for example, with Denmark, Germany, Italy, Canada, the USA and New Zealand. Government inquiries are in progress or have been completed in Norway, France, the Netherlands, the UK, Australia, Japan and New Zealand. In Finland the authorities are awaiting measures at EU level before taking any concrete initiatives.</p>
<h2>Swedish law and its applicability in a convergence perspective</h2>
<p>The analysis of Swedish law embraces 17 statutes and shows that convergence is leading to problems of demarcation and interpretation. The root cause of these problems is the ways in which the respective fields of application of the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression (1991:1469), the Radio and Television Act (1996:844) and the Telecommunications Act (1993:597), are limited, among other things in relation to one another. The problems occurring can be summarised in the following four perspectives.</p>
<p>Firstly , convergence means that the same type of service and the same content can be differently regulated, depending on what is provided on each occasion, in what manner it is provided (as a transmission to the general public or by individual request), what receiving equipment is used and, in certain respects, the identity of the provider.</p>
<p>Secondly , convergence means that the Telecommunications Act, the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression and the Radio and Television Act can be both alternately and simultaneously applicable within the context of the same range of services, and also to what the recipient may perceive as one and the same service. This also means that one and the same activity can similarly, either alternately or simultaneously, be governed by several regulatory structures, each with its own particular stipulations regarding the manner in which the activity is to be conducted and each enforceable by different authorities.</p>
<p>Thirdly , the development described means that, in relation to the Radio Communications Act (1993:599), it is becoming increasingly difficult to draw a line between frequency use of relevance to the freedoms of expression and information and other frequency uses. This, furthermore, has to be viewed against the background of both the national frequency allocation plan and the frequency allocation plan which follows from the the Radio Regulations linked to the International Telecommunications Convention, laying down the frequencies reserved for radio applications of different kinds.</p>
<p>Fourthly , there is uncertainty in several respects regarding the way in which terms, definitions and delimitations are to be interpreted and applied. This accentuates the effects of the problems described above. These uncertainties relate above all to the implementation of the main rule of the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression concerning transmissions intended for the general public, the definition of sound broadcasting, television and searchable text TV under the Radio and Television Act, and the delimitation of the Telecommunications Act in relation to the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression and, indirectly, as a consequence, also in relation to the Radio and Television Act. This affects not only the line of demarcation between the Telecommunications Act on the one hand and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression and the Radio and Television Act on the other, but also, in several respects, the application of other statutes. In addition to the uncertainties applying in these respects, convergence also entails problems of application in relation to other specialised legislation in the media sector.</p>
<h2>Co-ordination of legislation concerning radio broadcasting, television and telecommunications activities</h2>
<p>In view of the consequences of convergence for the application of existing law, my conclusion is that the legislation involved here is in need of co-ordination. This applies above all to the relation between the Telecommunications Act on the one hand and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression and the Radio and Television Act on the other. In addition, consideration must be paid to the other problems of implementation which convergence entails.</p>
<p>The purpose of co-ordination should be to remedy these problems and, if possible, to develop a regulatory structure which, in a better way than at present, will promote development and at the same time constitute a more effective instrument for achieving the policy aims existing in this connection. In view of the problems of demarcation entailed by convergence, one aim should be to achieve as extensive a horizontal regulation of telecommunications, sound broadcasting and television activities as possible. In doing so, consideration must be paid to the limitations imposed on the scope for legislation in various respects by overriding rules and international commitments. Above all these comprise the limitations entailed by the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression and Sweden’s obligations under the European Community law and, as regards the use of radio frequencies, by the international Telecommunications Convention and the Radio Regulation.</p>
<p>It is my belief that the best opportunities for horizontal regulation exist in the infrastructure  context. In certain respects, however, a general implementation of this kind will probably require an amendment of constitutional law. Opportunities for horizontal regulation of services , however, appear to be less good. This applies above all in relation to notification and permit requirements connected with cable transmissions of radio and television programmes. Opportunities for a horizontal regulation of services appear, however, to be slightly better in the case of mobile telephone services and wireless transmission of radio and television programmes. Content  as a special regulatory field is of no importance in relation to a co-ordination of the provisions of the Telecommunications Act and the Radio and Television Act, the reason being that regulation of content comes completely outside the scope of telecommunications policy aims, so that the Telecommunications Act contains no provisions that are liable to come into conflict with the provisions of the Radio and Television Act in this respect.</p>
<p>Instead the question of the impact of convergence on content regulation and the need for measures of co-ordination must above all be viewed in relation to the application fields of individual regulatory instruments. This applies primarily to the application fields of the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression and the Radio and Television Act. The precondition for remedying these problems is above all a review of prevailing conceptual structures and definitions, so that each field of application will agree with the purpose referred to.</p>
<h2>The need for further legislative measures</h2>
<p>In addition to considering the need for a co-ordination of the legislation applying to the telecommunications and media sectors, my remit also includes considering, against the background of convergence, the need for further legislation in order to safeguard freedom of expression, accessibility and diversity, and in order to counteract harmful trade restraints. There are several possible aspects to be considered in this connection. Those which I find cause to consider more closely here can be referred to questions concerning control of important resources, ownership concentrations and other forms of co-operation, as well as governmental responsibilities in the telecommunications and media sectors.</p>
<p>I have not found sufficient cause, within the scope of the present inquiry, to propose concrete legislative measures, bearing in mind, among other things, the work now in progress within the EU and the uncertainty which prevails concerning the more exact direction to be taken by convergence. In addition, various official bodies are currently investigating questions which are in several ways relevant to this context. On the other hand, a close watch should be kept on further developments in these fields. With regard to availability and diversity, I feel there is special cause for a closer investigation ,  not only of the demands made by convergence on the design, scope and funding of public service in the digital future and the means by which this is to be achieved (it is my opinion that the importance of public service in the media sector will increase), but also of the extent to which electronic media can be eligible for press subsidies and the changes which this may necessitate to the Statute of annual Press Subsidies (1990:524).</p>
<h2>Points of departure for continued work</h2>
<p>In further work with reference to convergence issues, special attention must be paid to the limitation proposed by overarching rules and international obligations on the scope for legislation. Above all this concerns the limitations entailed by the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression and Sweden’s obligations under European Community law and, as regards the use of radio frequencies, by the international Telecommunications Convention and the Radio Regulation. In relation to the EU, this applies particularly to the intensive work of which convergence issues, in various perspectives, are currently a subject within the European Commission. The ultimate purpose of that work, of course, is to establish a common platform for the treatment of convergence issues throughout the Union. This means that work in Sweden with reference to convergence issues will to a great extent have to be related to developments over which we ourselves do not have full control but which, on the other hand, we are in a position to influence.</p>
<h2>Proposal for the conduct of ongoing work</h2>
<p>Given the complexity of the issues and the cross-border nature of convergence, I consider it very important indeed that continuing work on convergence issues should be co-ordinated. In addition to the work which is taking place under the aegis of current official investigations and the initiatives and measures which my conclusions may otherwise occasion within the domain of each of the government departments concerned, I therefore propose that continued work be co-ordinated within the framework of an inter-ministerial advisory committee, possibly with a parliamentarian ingredient. The task of this advisory committee, in an overarching perspective and with reference to current policy aims, should among other things be to prepare supportive documentation for a choice of co-ordination strategy and implementation plan in which consideration is paid, among other things, to the work of current Government Commissions and activities within the EU.</p>
