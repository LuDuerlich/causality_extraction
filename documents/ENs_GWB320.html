<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Committee’s remit has been to follow case law developments and the effects of patents in the biotechnology area for health and medical care and research. The remit can be roughly divided into three parts. The first part  is mainly concerned with the patent authorities’ application of the fundamental patentability requirements of novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability. This part also includes an analysis of the absolute product protection for patents on inventions that involve gene sequences. The second part  deals with the ethical issues concerning biotechnology inventions and patents on them. Questions concerning human dignity and personal integrity as well as questions relating to human stem cells, particularly embryonic stem cells, are thereby of central interest to the Committee. The third part  concerns access to patented biotechnology inventions for research and development and in health and medical care. Central issues here include how the experimental use exemption in patent law and the licence system function in these areas.</p>
<p>The Committee’s remit includes that possible recommendations and proposals for actions primarily shall be on European level. However possible actions for facilitating access to patented technology in the health and medical care sector shall primarily be on national Swedish level.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Biotechnology is in an expansive phase and already now plays an important part in a range of industries. In a communication to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions, the European</p>
<p>Commission has pointed out that life sciences and biotechnology are widely recognised to be, after information technology, the next wave of the knowledge-based economy, see Life sciences and biotechnology – A strategy for Europe, COM (2002) 27 final. This communication also stresses that biotechnology involves several difficult questions. It also points out that biotechnological inventions require high capital investment, long development cycles and a comprehensive regulatory approval process. As regards patents it states that effective patent protection is a crucial incentive to research, development and innovation. Moreover the disclosure of information in patent publication contributes to the overall development of biotechnology. However, in view of the rapid scientific progress, legislation on intellectual property needs to be monitored very closely, however.</p>
<p>To achieve a consistent approach within the EU regarding patent protection for biotechnological inventions, the Directive 98/44/EC on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions was drawn up. The Directive was implemented in Swedish law on 1 May 2004. The legislative amendments resulting from implementation did not entail any extension of patent protection for biotechnological inventions. The legislative amendments rather constituted a clarification of the practice already applied.</p>
<p>When Directive 98/44/EC was implemented the Government noted that there was broad consensus that the possibility of effective patent protection in the biotechnology area constitutes an important incentive for developing new and improved medicines, for example. At the same time, however the Government noted that there was critique concerning the design and effects of the patent system. There were fears that patent protection, if it became too extensive and too strong, would risk counteracting its purpose and inhibit development of and access to new knowledge and technology. In the light of this, the Government stated that there was a need to follow case law developments as regards the application of both fundamental patentability conditions and the limitations of the extent of protection. The Government also stated that special measures for coordinating and facilitating the making of licence agreements should be considered in order to facilitate access to diagnostic tests on reasonable terms. The Government also stated that the effects of the development of the patent system for research should be followed closely.</p>
<p>In January 2005 the Government decided to set up a committee to carry out the tasks mentioned here. The committee took the name The Committee on Patent Protection for Biotechnological Inventions.</p>
<h2>The fundamental patentability requirements</h2>
<p>The fundamental patentability requirements novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability are central requirements when examining a patent application. Effective application of these requirements assumes that the patent authority’s examiners have the requisite knowledge of the area of technology in question and can determine the current position of the technology.</p>
<p>Fears have been expressed in the patent law debate that the fundamental patentability requirements are applied far too uncritically by the patent authorities, leading to an imbalance in the patent system in which the patent holder obtains patent protection which is unjustifiably extensive in relation to the significance of the invention to science and technology. In the biotechnology area, criticism has been mainly aimed at patents for genes, where the examination with regard to inventive step and industrial applicability in some cases has been regarded as unsatisfactory. In this context the critics have pointed out that too generous an application of the inventive step requirement risks giving rise to a patent thicket, i.e. many individual patents linked to one and the same phenomenon, which may make access to the phenomenon in question, such as a gene, more difficult. Moreover the critics have argued that insufficient examination with regard to the industrial applicability requirement may lead to the granting of patents for inventions that are speculations rather than concrete contributions to science and technology.</p>
<p>The Committee notes that there was a marked increase in the number of patent applications for human gene sequences in the years 1998–2001, after which the number of such applications fell sharply. The increase at the end of the 1990s is thought by many commentators to have been due to a belief on the part of many biotechnology actors that a patent application for an invention involving a gene sequence did not need to be well-founded in any real sense as regards industrial applicability. A large number of patent applications for genes were accordingly lodged, mainly with the</p>
<p>EPO. Another contributory reason for the increase in applications during this period is thought to be that the mapping of the human genome within the HUGO project would soon be published, thereby thwarting any possibilities of patenting human genes.</p>
<p>In the first years of the twenty-first century a number of events took place that according to many patent experts led to the drastic fall in the number of patent applications for human genes. In the first place there was the publication of the human genome, which made patents on human genes more or less impossible. In the second place the United States Patent and Trademark Office, USPTO, issued guidelines in 2001 on the application of the utility requirement in the US patent legislation for patentable inventions. In these, the USPTO stated that such utility must be specific, substantial and credible. A similar statement was made by the EPO in an opposition case that attracted a lot of attention, the ICOS decision (EP 0630405) of 2002.</p>
<p>The Committee has followed the development of EPO case law in the biotechnology area in recent years and can note that this has taken a restrictive course as regards application of the patentability requirements of inventive step and industrial applicability. In several rulings the EPO Appeal Chambers have stressed the requirement that those applying for patents must be able to give a concrete explanation of how the invention can be industrially applied. On several occasions the EPO has stated in this context that vague indications of possible medical use for a chemical substance do not meet the industrial applicability requirement.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the Committee the application of the fundamental patentability requirements in both the EPO and the Swedish Patent and Registration Office (PRV) is appropriate and this application creates the conditions for maintaining balance between public and private interests in the biotechnology area. Current case law also creates the conditions for clarifying what in the context of patents constitutes the dividing line between discovery and invention.</p>
<h2>Absolute product protection</h2>
<p>A patent claim that protects a product covers all conceivable uses of that product. This means that the patent gives the holder the sole right to use the patented product commercially. The protection is not restricted to one specific use and is therefore usually called absolute product protection. A patent for a chemical compound therefore covers all uses of the chemical compound in question. Consequently the protection is not restricted to the use or uses specified in the patent application. Patents that protect gene sequences and microorganisms can also give absolute product protection as in patent law contexts they are treated in the same way as traditional chemical compounds.</p>
<p>It is only possible to obtain a patent for a chemical compound with absolute product protection when the invention refers to a previously unknown chemical substance. The idea behind absolute product protection is to create effective patent protection for an invention that entails making a chemical substance available to the general public for the first time. Known chemical substances can be granted product protection for new uses in methods for medical treatment or in diagnostic methods, but such patents are restricted to these areas of use. In prevailing patent law doctrine, use-bound product patents (also known as purpose-bound product patents) for previously unknown chemical compounds have been regarded as far too easy to circumvent. An actor who for example markets a chemical substance commercially under such circumstances would be able to traverse an alleged patent infringement by saying that the substance in question is only being marketed for other uses than are covered by the patent on the substance in question.</p>
<p>Hence absolute product protection implies that all use of a chemical substance falls within the patent’s scope of protection. However, it is possible to get a patent for an invention involving the use of a known chemical substance for another use than specified by the product patent holder in the patent application. Such patents can also be obtained by someone other than the holder of the product patent for the substance. This is on condition that the new use fulfils the patentability requirements. Utilisation of such an invention, however, requires the consent of the product patent holder.</p>
<p>Absolute product protection constitutes a central issue as regards the scope of the patent protection for gene sequences and as regards the fears that protection in this area may be too broadbased and strong. Both the EPO and PRV apply absolute product protection for gene sequences and microorganisms. National patent legislation in France, Italy, Luxembourg, Switzerland and</p>
<p>Germany, however, applies restrictions on patenting human or other naturally occurring gene sequences.</p>
<p>In its interim report  Oinskränkt produktskydd för patent på genteknikområdet (Absolute product protection for patents in the genetic technology area), SOU 2006:70, the Committee has made the assessment that Sweden should not at present aim for a transition to  use-bound  product protection for patents on gene sequences. The Committee stated in the interim report that there was no evidence of any adverse trend in the genetic technology area due to absolute product protection. Moreover, the Committee established that it was doubtful whether  use-bound  product protection for product patents on gene sequences would have any practical advantages over absolute product protection. The Committee considered that weakening protection for inventions involving gene sequences under such circumstances was not justified.</p>
<p>During the remainder of its work the Committee has continued to follow developments in absolute product protection in the area of genetic technology. In doing this the Committee has studied the consultation responses on its interim report received by the Ministry of Justice. The continued work of the Committee has not, however, given rise to different assessment as regards the choice of product protection than that made in the interim report.</p>
<p>A question with some association to absolute product protection is the possibility of obtaining patents based on medical indications for a specific chemical substance.</p>
<p>In the opinion of the Committee, Section 2, fourth paragraph of the Swedish Patents Act should be clarified to ensure that the possibility of obtaining patents based on the first and the second and the following medical indications is clearly pointed out in the Patents Act.</p>
<h2>Ethical considerations in biotechnology</h2>
<p>Both the EPC and national legislation prohibit the granting of patents on inventions whose commercial exploitation would be contrary to public order or morality. When implementing Directive 98/44/EC on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions a non-exhaustive list of uses that shall always be considered to be contrary to public order or morality was introduced in Section 1 c, third paragraph of the Patents Act. This list includes processes for cloning human beings, processes for modifying the germ line genetic identity of human beings, the use of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes and processes for modifying the genetic identity of animals which are likely to cause them suffering without any substantial medical benefit to man or animal.</p>
<p>The Committee has primarily studied EPO case law regarding the exception from patenting on ethical grounds. Moreover, the Committee has evaluated the effects of the amendments to the Patents Act due to the implementation of Directive 98/44/EC on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions. This evaluation has had in view the protection of fundamental principles of human dignity and integrity.</p>
<p>A further question for the Committee in this respect has been whether measures are needed to develop cooperation between the agencies concerned as regards the basis for assessing ethical issues in patent cases referring to biotechnological inventions.</p>
<p>Case law from the EPO reflects a restrictive application of the exception from patenting on ethical grounds, which is in line with the intentions behind this exception from patenting. Developments in biotechnology in recent years have, however, meant new challenges with regard to assessing whether an invention for which a patent has been applied is contrary to public order or morality. Inventions involving chimera and hybrid technology may raise complicated ethical issues in this context. The same applies to inventions involving human embryonic stem cells (for more on this, please see below). As regards the EPO’s examination of patent applications with respect to the exception from patenting on ethical grounds, the EPO must ascertain what constitutes an overall European concept of morality. As far as inventions involving human embryonic stem cells are concerned, this assessment is complicated by the fact that the EPC states have different opinions on what is ethically acceptable in patenting such inventions. The EPO’s handling of an ongoing patent case concerning embryonic stem cells should therefore be monitored by the Government. The same applies to the EU’s work on biotechnology involving chimeras and hybrids within the framework of the Chimbrids project.</p>
<p>As regards the clarifications in the Patents Act resulting from the implementation of Directive 98/44/EC on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions, the Committee notes that the provisions in Section 1 b and 1 c of the Patents Act mean that the definitions for patents on inventions involving human biological material have been made clearer. The clear statement in Section 1 b of the Patents Act that the human body in its various stages of formation cannot constitute a patentable invention implies a concrete expression of the principle of human dignity.</p>
<p>The Committee notes, however, that patents on inventions involving biological material are still an ethically sensitive issue for many people. One factor that makes dealing with ethical issues concerning patenting biotechnological inventions difficult is that these inventions are very complicated to understand for nonexperts in biotechnology. Additionally, patent legislation is not the easiest of things for laymen to understand. Therefore the Committee sees a need for information to the public on biotechnology in general and the implications of the patent system. Such information creates conditions for better understanding of the pros and cons of the patent system as regards biotechnological inventions, something that is central to public confidence in the patent system.</p>
<p>Regarding the relationship of the patent system to the principle of human dignity, there is concern that biotechnological patents give their holders over-comprehensive protection to the detriment of both the individual and society in general. In the opinion of the Committee, however, strict adherence to the fundamental patentability requirements is a precondition for a granted patent being compatible with the contribution of knowledge to society that the invention expresses. The development of case law shows that the EPO now applies patentability criteria to biotechnological inventions in an appropriate way. According to the Committee, current EPO practice, which is characterised by restrictiveness, creates the conditions for patents with a balanced scope of protection.</p>
<p>Regarding the relationship of the patent system to respect for personal integrity, the Committee believes that the patent system constitutes only a part of a greater complex around both biotechnological research and development and the use of biotechnological inventions, which may imply an attack on personal integrity. The Committee does not deem it appropriate or even practically possible to take measures within the framework of the patent system to prevent the risk of violations of integrity within this complex.</p>
<p>Even though the patent system is not ethically neutral, it offers a blunt and inexpedient tool in ethical questions. A patent does not constitute a right to practise an invention. Instead a patent constitutes a time-limited right to prevent others from commercially using the patented invention. A decision of a patent authority to reject the patent application for a certain invention does not constitute a prohibition against or obstacle to commercial exploitation of the said invention.</p>
<h2>Patents on inventions that involve stem cells</h2>
<p>A stem cell is an immature cell that can be developed (differentiated) into a certain form of body cell, such as liver cells, bone cells, heart cells etc. The development potential of a stem cell varies. One form of stem cells, adult stem cells, occur in the human body as a store of immature cells intended to replace body cells that have been lost as a consequence of different kinds of wear and tear. These adult stem cells can develop into a limited number of body cell types. For example, there are blood stem cells that can be differentiated into all types of blood cells but not into any other type of cell, such as liver cells. Another form of stem cell is the embryonic stem cell. These stem cells have a greater development potential than adult stem cells and can be differentiated into more or less all forms of body cells. Embryonic stem cells are taken from a blastocyst, i.e. a fertilised egg cell that has been dividing for about a week.</p>
<p>The great development potential of embryonic stem cells has made them interesting for medical research and there are hopes that with the help of therapies based on such stem cells it will be possible in the future to cure or alleviate serious diseases and conditions that are incurable today.</p>
<p>However, the use of human embryonic stem cells raises difficult ethical questions, for example regard for human dignity. The production of such stem cells ultimately assumes the destruction of a blastocyst, which some people see as ethically unacceptable. These people have the view that, in the right circumstances, the blastocyst could have developed into a human being. At present it is mainly fertilised eggs left over from IVF treatment, i.e. artificial insemination of childless couples, that are used in research into embryonic stem cells. These eggs, which are donated to research by the man and woman, would otherwise have been destroyed. Other people, therefore, have no major objections to using donated fertilised eggs left over from IVF treatments in stem cell research in order, if possible, to develop new methods of treatment for currently incurable diseases.</p>
<p>As far as the patent system is concerned, the question arises of how to treat patent applications for inventions involving, in some way, human embryonic stem cells. Patents may not be granted for inventions the commercial exploitation of which would be contrary to public order or morality. A particular example of inventions that shall always be regarded as contrary to public order and morality is the use of embryos for industrial or commercial purposes.</p>
<p>The Committee notes that at European level there is at present uncertainty as to how the term “use of embryos for industrial or commercial purposes” is to be interpreted. All EU and EPC states are probably in agreement that inventions that require direct access to blastocysts cannot be patented due to the exception from patenting on ethical grounds. However, as a rule the inventions for which patent applications are made do not require any direct access to blastocysts, only to embryonic stem cells as such, i.e. the stem cells that the invention requires a supply of can be taken from an existing stem cell line. Some countries, among them Sweden, are of the opinion that inventions involving embryonic stem cells can be patented, if these stem cells can be taken from cell lines already existing in companies or hospitals. Other countries do not see any difference between an invention that requires a direct supply of blastocysts and inventions that are based on existing cultures of embryonic stem cells. These latter countries believe that what is crucial is that a blastocyst must unavoidably be destroyed at some earlier point in order to be able to establish the cultures of embryonic stem cells that are to supply the necessary embryonic stem cells.</p>
<p>In its work the Committee has followed the ethical discussions concerning embryonic stem cell technology and the patent law developments in this area. A case is currently pending before the EPO Enlarged Board of Appeal, G 2/06, which takes into account the issues just mentioned. The opinion of the Board of Appeal in this case will be of major significance for future possibilities of patenting inventions involving human embryonic stem cells. According to information from the EPO a decision is expected some time during 2008. The Government should monitor the outcome of this case and thereafter come to a decision on whether there is reason to make adjustments in Swedish patent legislation. In this respect, the Committee draws the Government’s attention to the fact that in the future embryonic stem cells may be extracted in other ways than at present. Alternative methods may be somatic nuclear transfer of unfertilised eggs, chimera technology, parthenogenesis technology or reprogramming of somatic cells.</p>
<h2>The experimental use exemption in patent law and patents on research tools</h2>
<p>In most European countries a patent does not hinder anyone investigating or experimenting on a patented invention. This is evident from the experimental use exemption in patent law. The purpose of this exemption is to enable researchers to understand the structure of an invention and to carry out experiments aimed at ascertaining whether the invention can be improved or used in a way other than it was patented for. The experimental use exemption thus facilitates research and further development of science and technology.</p>
<p>Research tools are inventions that are used as tools or aids in various experiments or research measures. In biotechnology, various proteins, cell lines, experimental animals etc may constitute important research tools. These inventions can be patented in the same way as other inventions. The predominant view in Europe is that patented research tools must be treated in the same way as other types of inventions when applying the experimental use exemption, i.e. experiments on  a patented research tool are allowed. On the other hand experiments with  a patented research tool are not allowed if the use is covered by the patent. One important exception is the Belgian patent law, where the experimental use exemption covers actions both on  and with  a patented research tool.</p>
<p>A fear that has been expressed in the debate on patented research tools is that the holders of such patents may prevent researchers from gaining access to research tools that are important for biotechnological, particularly biomedical, research. This could lead to serious delays in research and development of new and improved medicines, for example.</p>
<p>At the same time the patent system is an important incentive for those who specialise in developing new and improved research tools. Without the possibility of patents it is highly likely that considerably fewer research tools would have become available to researchers.</p>
<p>The Committee has examined whether the present formulation of the experimental use exemption constitutes a suitable balance between public and private interests and whether there is any distortion of this balance as regards patented research tools.</p>
<p>As regards the experimental use exemption the Committee notes that the present formulation is satisfactory. Measures on but not with a patented invention is an appropriate restriction that creates conditions for continued research on the patented product while protecting justified interests, for example those of actors who develop new and improved research tools.</p>
<p>Infringement proceedings due to alleged breaches of the provisions regulating the experimental use exemption in patent law are rare. The same applies to situations where someone is refused access to a patented research tool. On the basis of the studies carried out in both Europe and the USA the Committee can state that this is partly because the licensing system seems to work well and partly because patent holders often have no interest in taking action against infringements on the part of researchers at universities and other higher education institutions. As regards the latter circumstance, researchers at universities and other higher education institutions seem to a great extent to be unaware of the content of patent law. The use of patented inventions that may be doubtful from the point of view of patent law thus seldom takes place knowingly. Patent holders are usually keen to have good relations with researchers at universities and other higher education institutions, and therefore they seldom have cause to intervene against these researchers’ use of patented inventions so long as the research is not transformed into a product that can be commercialised.</p>
<p>One area, however, where there seems to be some lack of clarity as to whether the experimental use exemption of patent law is applicable is clinical trials with patented chemical substances. More concretely, the issue concerns whether human trials using a patented chemical substance constitute an experiment on  or with  the substance in question. In the opinion of the Committee it is important that this question is discussed and clarified at European level.</p>
<p>Thus the Committee has not been able to establish any concrete signs that biotechnological patents are an obstacle to important basic research at universities and other higher education institutions. Unawareness of the patent system among researchers at universities and other higher education institutions, however, is something that should be addressed. Ignorance of the novelty requirement in patent law may mean that a researcher cannot patent a potentially valuable invention, if the researcher has published the invention in a scientific journal, for example. As far as Sweden is concerned the Committee believes that it is important that universities and other higher education institutions involve intellectual property law, especially patent law, in the context of postgraduate higher education to a greater extent than today.</p>
<p>As regards patented research tools, the Committee has not been able to find indications that researchers are denied access to such tools in such a way that the balance between private and public interests risks being upset. There are, however, fears for the future regarding whether the patent system offers effective measures to restrain abuse of patents on research tools. In the view of the Committee, certain forms of abuse can probably be prevented with the help of competition law. In certain circumstances patent law affords the possibility of applying to a court for a compulsory licence. The Committee is doubtful to what extent these provisions could be used by a researcher refused access to a patented research tool and has therefore considered proposing certain extensions to the compulsory licence provisions. However, the Committee’s remit only covers the biotechnology area and an extension of the compulsory licence provisions should not be made without first examining the effects of such an extension on other areas of technology. The question of which situations would merit the granting of a compulsory licence should therefore preferably be dealt with as part of a wider review of patent law or as part of the framing of a Community patent system.</p>
<h2>Access to patented biotechnological inventions in research</h2>
<p>Even if the patent fundamentally implies a possibility to prevent others from exploiting an invention commercially, it is in the interest of most patent holders to grant others the right to use the invention. In this context it is important that the transaction costs of granting and acquiring rights to patented biotechnological inventions are kept to a minimum. Otherwise the existence of a patent threatens to make continued research and development in the biotechnological area more difficult.</p>
<p>The main instrument for granting rights to others to use a patented invention is a patent licence. Apart from this, the Committee has analysed the existence of patent pools and clearing houses in the biotechnological area. Moreover, the Committee has examined how material transfer agreements are used when transferring biological material.</p>
<p>As regards the licensing system the Committee notes that overall this works well in the biotechnological area. In 2006 the OECD drew up guidelines for how licensing agreements in the areas of research and health and medical care should be drawn up with regard to genetic inventions. In the opinion of the Committee, these guidelines constitute a valuable aid, not least for universities and higher education institutions and the health care sector.</p>
<p>As regards patent pools and clearing houses, these solutions for facilitating access to patented inventions have not as yet had much impact in the biotechnological area. This is largely because these arrangements are more complicated to use than the licensing system. Patent pools and clearing houses may also be questionable from a competition law perspective. However, it cannot be ruled out that these arrangements may come to have a greater significance in the future, since biomedical research is showing a tendency to become more complicated. In this context the Committee has noted an increased tendency among biotechnological actors to create open sources, i.e. databases with genetic information accessible to everyone, instead of patenting individual genes. This trend is probably linked to a realisation on the part of these actors that in the future biotechnology will be a matter of studying genetic networks rather than studying individual genes.</p>
<p>As regards abuse of the exclusive right a patent confers, the Committee recalls that competition law constitutes an important control mechanism and an important complement to the compulsory licence provisions of patent law.</p>
<p>Access to biological material is an important factor and sometimes even a requirement for biotechnology research being undertaken at all. Even if the biological material is not subject to any patent rights, it may be important to regulate the treatment of cases where a person who receives a sample of biological material develops an invention based on the material in question. For example, the person who supplied the researcher with the material may want to be sure of being able to use the invention in question. In material transfer agreements such matters can be regulated together with other important circumstances, such as the rules governing treatment of publication of research results. In the opinion of the Committee there is a need to draw the attention of researchers at universities and higher education institutions to the effects that these agreements may have on various research projects. Moreover, efforts should be made at the European level to create a standard agreement for biological material transfers corresponding to that which already exists in the USA.</p>
<h2>Patented inventions in the health and medical care sector</h2>
<p>Patent systems are an important incentive for research in and development of new and improved medicines. It is in the public interest for such research and development work to be undertaken. At the same time there is an interest in ensuring that the development of medicines is not hindered or delayed unnecessarily by the patent system and that the health and medical care sector can gain access to patented inventions on reasonable terms.</p>
<p>As regards the question of whether there is a risk that the patent system hinders or delays the development of new medicines, the Committee notes that manufacturers of medicinal products as a rule investigate which patented inventions they must have access to when a pharmaceutical project is being planned. In this respect the Committee has not been able to find any indications that pharmaceutical projects are discontinued to any disconcerting extent as a consequence of access to patented inventions being denied. It is difficult to express any opinion on how common it is for pharmaceutical projects never to have started because of denied access to patented inventions, since the pharmaceutical companies are reluctant to provide such data.</p>
<p>Patent applications for new or improved medicines are as a rule submitted at a relatively early stage of development of the medicinal product in question. The granting process is therefore usually completed by the time it is relevant to launch the medicinal product on the market, and there are no indications that the patent authorities’ processing of patent applications delays public access to new and improved medicinal products.</p>
<p>As regards research in and development of new and improved biotechnology products for the health and medical care sector, the Committee’s understanding is that the patent system currently maintains a reasonable balance between private and public interests. In the studies carried out in Europe and the USA no indications</p>
<p>have yet been found that the patent system obstructs the development of such products.</p>
<p>Future developments in biotechnology, however, will probably mean greater challenges than before for pharmaceutical companies and other biotechnology actors. It is probable that biotechnology research will be based to an increasing extent on systems biology, where an organism is studied as a fully integrated system of events involving genes, proteins, cells and pathways. In light of this it cannot be ruled out that biotechnological inventions in the area of health and medical care will in the future require access to more patented inventions than today.</p>
<p>The Committee has analysed the cost and accessibility aspects of biotechnological inventions in the area of health and medical care.</p>
<p>Biological medicinal products are copies of or similar to endogenous substances. Normally the term biological medicinal products is reserved for proteins and other large molecules developed using biotechnology. One example of a biological medicinal product is insulin. Development and manufacture of biological medicinal products is usually more expensive and more complicated than is the case with medicinal products based on small molecules. As an increasing number of biological medicinal products will be introduced in future the costs for society for medicinal products will probably rise. It is difficult to assess how great these increases will be. In a forecast made in 2006 the National Board of Health and Welfare predicted that the annual rise in the total costs for society for medicinal products will be 1–4 per cent up to 2010. In forecasts from the individual health care regions annual cost increases of 6 per cent are mentioned.</p>
<p>Advances in biotechnological pharmaceutical research may also mean that more illnesses will be possible to treat in the future than can be treated today. This will probably also have upward impacts on the costs for society for medicinal products. It should, however, be pointed out that new and improved medicinal products at the same time may have a cost-saving effect for the society. Effective methods of treatment may mean shorter sick leave periods and reduced suffering for individual patients. Moreover, modern medicinal products can in some cases replace surgical procedures and other expensive methods of treatment, which ultimately means reduced costs for the society.</p>
<p>A fear that has been put forward in the debate on patented medicinal products is that holders of such patents charge excessive prices under the protection of the patent. The significance of the patent system for the price of medicinal products is difficult to assess. Patented medicinal products are more expensive than generic preparations, i.e. copies of medicines, which reach the market after the patent on the original medicinal product has expired. The manufacturer of these copies of medicines has not, however, had the development costs that the manufacturer of the original medicinal product must try to cover through sales of the product in question. Another factor that is also of significance is that some medicinal product projects must be abandoned at the research stage for various reasons. The costs of these discontinued projects must be spread among the products that do reach the market. The price asked by the generic manufacturer for the copy cannot be compared out of hand with the price charged by the manufacturer of the original during the life of the patent.</p>
<p>The Committee has not found any indications that holders of medicinal product patents abuse their exclusive rights by charging unreasonable prices for patented medicinal products. If such a situation were nevertheless to arise, in the view of the Committee measures exist under both competition law and patent law that could be effective.</p>
<p>A separate question examined by the Committee is access to genetic and diagnostic tests in the health and medical care sector. This type of biotechnological invention has been much discussed since the company Myriad Genetics used its patent for a genetic test for a certain type of breast cancer in an aggressive way. The company required that all tests should be performed at specially designated laboratories and it was also alleged that it charged an unreasonable price for the test in question. However, the Committee can state that on the whole, access to patented genetic and diagnostic tests in the health and medical care sector can be regarded as satisfactory. Of the approximately 100 genetic tests used at Swedish hospitals it is mainly Myriad Genetics’ genetic test for the form of breast cancer concerned that has been a problem. In the USA, where about 600 genetic tests are used in hospitals and clinical chemical laboratories, access has been shown to be a problem in fewer than ten cases of patented genetic tests.</p>
<p>If more cases like the Myriad case were to arise, the Committee deems that such situations can be dealt with in the first place by</p>
<p>competition law measures and possibly with the help of compulsory licences under patent legislation.</p>
