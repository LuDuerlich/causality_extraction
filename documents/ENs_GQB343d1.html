<p>Our assignment</p>
<p>Our task has been to propose how two EC Directives that have been adopted by the Council of the European Union (the Council) in 2000 shall be implemented in Sweden.</p>
<p>The purpose of the two EC Directives is to combat discrimination.</p>
<p>The Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of race or ethnic origin deals with discrimination on the grounds of race or ethnic origin.</p>
<p>The Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation deals with discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orientation.</p>
<p>The EC Directives shall apply to all persons, as regards both the public and the private sectors, including public bodies. Protection against discrimination shall comprise both direct and indirect discrimination. Moreover it shall cover harassment and also an instruction to discriminate against a person.</p>
<p>Both of the EC Directives shall be applied in what is termed within the EU as the field of ‘ employment and occupation’ . This is a broad concept, which covers not only circumstances at the workplace but also related areas. The Directives cover:</p>
<p>N  conditions for access to employment,</p>
<p>N  conditions for access to self-employment, N  conditions for access to occupation,</p>
<p>N  access to vocational training and advanced vocational training, N  access to retraining,</p>
<p>N  access to practical work experience,</p>
<p>N  employment and working conditions, including dismissals and pay,</p>
<p>N  membership of and involvement in an organisation of workers or employers, or any organisation whose members carry on a particular profession, including the benefits provided for by such organisations.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the Directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of race or ethnic origin shall apply in the following areas of society that lie outside the field of employment and occupation:</p>
<p>N  social protection, including social security and healthcare, N  social advantages,</p>
<p>N  education,</p>
<p>N  access to and the supply of goods and services which are available to the public, including housing.</p>
<p>On 31 January 2002, the Swedish Government issued terms of reference for a Parliamentary Committee with numerous tasks in the field of discrimination (Cohesive Discrimination Legislation, Dir. 2002:11). The task of submitting proposals for protection against discrimination for legal persons and protection against discrimination on grounds of age, which were originally intended for our Committee of Inquiry, shall instead be included in the assignment for the Parliamentary Committee.</p>
<p>Current Swedish legislation</p>
<p>In Sweden, there is already legislation that partly corresponds with the requirements of the Directives.</p>
<p>Within criminal law, there is a provision concerning unlawful discrimination contained in Chapter 16, Section 9 of the Penal Code. This provision is primarily aimed at businessmen and their employees and prohibits them from discriminating in the conduct of their business against anyone on grounds of the persons race, colour, national or ethnic origin, religious belief or homosexual orientation. The provision also covers discrimination in the public sector by officials and elected persons of public authorities and local government. It also covers discrimination in access to public events.</p>
<p>Within labour law there are three laws from 1999 that prohibit discrimination in working life on grounds of ethnic affiliation and also discrimination against people with disabilities and discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. These provisions are orientated towards employers and protect jobseekers and employees. Furthermore, there is the Equal Treatment of Students at Universities Act (2001:1286), which provides protection against discrimination on all the grounds mentioned and also against discrimination on grounds of sex.</p>
<p>The protection against discrimination found in the current Swedish legislation is rather far reaching at workplaces and in higher education. There is also some protection against discrimination in trade. However, there is no legislation for a large part of the ambit of both the EC Directives and, in the new areas of society to be covered by legislation according to the Directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of race or ethnic origin, the position is even worse.</p>
<p>Proposals for three new acts with prohibitions against discrimination</p>
<p>One of the first questions on which a position had to be adopted has been how we could best formulate our statutory proposals. We have chosen to propose three new acts which will replace the three current acts in the field of labour law and which will also apply to the other areas of society that are subject to the Directives. The Equal Treatment of Students at Universities Act shall, according to the proposal, apply as before but should be amended to correspond with the requirements contained in the two EC Directives.</p>
<p>We propose</p>
<p>N  an Act on Prohibition against Discrimination on grounds of Ethnic affiliation, Religion or Belief,</p>
<p>N  an Act on Prohibition against Discrimination on grounds of Disability, and</p>
<p>N  an Act on Prohibition against Discrimination on grounds of Sexual orientation.</p>
<p>These Acts will cover all natural persons, irrespective of nationality and residence.</p>
<p>The three Acts shall contain four prohibitions against discrimination, namely prohibition against direct discrimination , prohibi-</p>
<p>tion against indirect discrimination , prohibition against harassment  and prohibition against an order or an instruction to discriminate .</p>
<p>The prohibition against direct discrimination shall apply not only on the grounds of a person’s own affiliation to any of the protected groups. It shall also be prohibited to discriminate against anyone owing to ties with another person who belongs to these groups.</p>
<p>The prohibition against harassment shall be directed towards everyone who is subject to the prohibitions against direct and indirect discrimination. The prohibition shall furthermore apply, among other things, between employees. This means that an employee may not harass another employee or a person who is undertaking work experience or training at the workplace. Besides the prohibition against harassment, there shall also be an obligation at workplaces and within the education services for employers and schools respectively and others who conduct education to investigate and implement measures against harassment.</p>
<p>The prohibition against orders or instructions to discriminate is primarily targeted at internal directions on the part of those responsible within operations against whom the prohibitions are directed. It shall not be permitted for any responsible person to order or instruct his/her subordinates to commit discrimination. Should such discrimination occur, a special sanction shall apply.</p>
<p>Scope of application of the new Acts</p>
<p>It is proposed that for all three Acts, the four prohibitions against discrimination – in accordance with the Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation requirements – shall apply within</p>
<p>N  working life,</p>
<p>N  employment offices, etc.,</p>
<p>N  in connection with access for carrying on business operations, N  in connection with access for carrying on a profession, and</p>
<p>N  in connection with membership of and involvement in an organisation of workers or employers, or any professional organisation.</p>
<p>As we have mentioned, the Directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of race or ethnic</p>
<p>origin also requires legislation in fields of society that are not related to employment and occupation. The Act on Prohibition against Discrimination on the grounds of Ethnic affiliation, Religion or Belief has been formulated so that the four prohibitions on discrimination shall apply for the full ambit of the Directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of race or ethnic origin.</p>
<p>To some extent we have chosen also to allow both of the other Acts to cover areas that are not covered by the Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation and therefore not required by EU law. The protection against discrimination within the education services and in connection with access to and provision of goods/services and housing that are available to the public is therefore similarly worded in the three statutory proposals.</p>
<p>The proposed protection against direct and indirect discrimination within the education service primarily applies to the fundamental right to receive education, i.e. the right to gain access to education and also to be permitted to complete it.</p>
<p>The protection against discrimination in trade shall, according to the proposal, apply when a person supplies goods, services, real property or housing to the public or procures the same from the public. It shall also apply when someone arranges public meetings or public performances.</p>
<p>It is our view that social protection, including social security, healthcare and social benefits should also be covered by all of the three Acts. However, in the time that has been available to us it has not been possible to put forward proposals concerning such protection in the two Acts where it is not required under the EC Directives. The provisions in these areas are therefore only contained in the proposal for the Act on Prohibition against Discrimination on the grounds of Ethnic affiliation, Religion or Belief. In this Act there is a proposal for protection against discrimination that will apply when someone makes a decision or implements measures within the following activities:</p>
<p>N  within social insurance and other benefits systems, N  within healthcare or other medical services,</p>
<p>N  within the social services, etc.,</p>
<p>N  within unemployment insurance, and</p>
<p>N  on matters concerning state study support.</p>
<p>Support and adaptation measures for people with disabilities</p>
<p>The Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation requires that an employer implements reasonable adaptation measures in order to enable people with disabilities to gain access to, participate in or have a career in employment and occupation or to undertake education.</p>
<p>In the 1999 Act concerning Prohibition of Discrimination in Working Life of People with Disabilities, the prohibition against direct discrimination has been combined with the requirement that an employer implements reasonable support and adaptation measures in connection with employment, promotion and education for promotion. We have formulated the proposal for the Act on Prohibition against Discrimination on the grounds of Disability so that this provision is extended to apply in other situations when an employee would otherwise be deemed to be disfavoured.</p>
<p>Another issue is whether the protection of people with disabilities against being disfavoured owing to inadequate access should be introduced in other areas of society than employment/occupation and higher education. This shall be investigated by the Parliamentary Committee and is not covered by our proposals.</p>
<p>Prohibition against victimisation</p>
<p>In accordance with the requirements contained in both of the EC Directives, we propose a prohibition against victimisation of a person who has reported or in another way pointed out discrimination or participated in an investigation about discrimination.</p>
<p>Invalidity</p>
<p>The Acts shall be mandatory. There should thus be no obligation to comply with discriminatory contractual provisions. We also propose that it should be possible to adjust or declare invalid contracts that are discriminatory in a way that infringes the Acts. It shall also be possible to declare invalid the termination of a contract or other such legal act that occurs in a discriminatory manner. The same shall apply to provisions that are applied at a workplace and to provisions that are applied within an organisation that is prohibited from discriminating according to the Acts.</p>
<p>Damages</p>
<p>A person who violates the prohibitions against discrimination and victimisation contained in the Acts shall, according to the proposal, pay damages both for the violation that the discrimination involves and for the financial loss that arises for the person discriminated against. A person who neglects his/her obligation to investigate and implement measures against harassment shall also pay damages for the violation that the failure involves. The EC Directives impose requirements on damages being effective, proportionate and dissuasive. The amounts of the damages should be determined taking into account the practice found in the field of labour law as regards the amount of the sums. However, generally viewed, the amounts should be high.</p>
<p>Supervision of the new Acts</p>
<p>It should be an obligation of the Ombudsman against Ethnic Discrimination (DO), the Disability Ombudsman (HO) and the Ombudsman against Discrimination because of Sexual Orientation (HomO) to ensure compliance with the Acts. The proposals involve a substantial extension of the field of supervision for all three Ombudsmen. The extension of the area for the DO is particularly great.</p>
<p>Legal proceedings</p>
<p>The legal procedures shall occur according to that applicable in the Swedish legislation on procedural law. This means that discrimination in the field of labour law shall be dealt with in accordance with the Labour Disputes (Judicial Procedure) Act (1974:371) in the same way as today. Cases concerning invalidity or damages outside the field of labour law shall be considered within the framework of the procedure for contentious cases at a public court and discriminatory decisions by authorities shall, as applies today, be subject to appeal within the administrative law system.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Ombudsmen are given the right to bring an action both as a party for the individual and as a representative for him/her in the same way as the Ombudsmen can bring actions in labour law disputes under the Acts currently applicable.</p>
<p>In labour law cases, the same rules on limitation shall apply as according to the legislation currently applicable. In other cases, we propose that an action must be instituted within two years.</p>
<p>Evidential issues</p>
<p>According to both of the EC Directives, special rules are required to provide a relaxation of evidence for a person who considers that he/she has been discriminated against. If the person establishes facts from which it may be presumed that there has been discrimination, it shall be for the respondent to prove that this is not the case.</p>
<p>The principles for how the burden of proof shall be distributed are rooted in the practice of the European Court of Justice and already apply when considering disputes that relate to the Equality Act, the three Labour Law Discrimination Acts from 1999 and the Equal Treatment of Students at Universities Act.</p>
<p>We put forward proposals for provisions concerning how the consideration should be dealt with.</p>
<p>Entry into force</p>
<p>The Member States shall, according to the Directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of race or ethnic origin, adopt the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the Directive by 19 July 2003 and, according to the Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation, by 2 December 2003.</p>
<p>We propose that the three new Acts on prohibition against discrimination should enter into force on 1 July 2003.</p>
