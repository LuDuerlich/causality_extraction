<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>I have been charged by the Government with the task of reviewing and analysing the issue of attitudes to persons with disabilities (dir 1997:24). According to my terms of reference, I shall inter alia describe the way in which people with disabilities experience attitudes and treatment in contacts with authorities and other public bodies, and what opportunities they have to assert their interests. I shall also review and analyse to what extent factors in the organisation, management and structure of operations and the qualifications of staff members can contribute to better attitudes and improvement in services.</p>
<p>I have provided an opportunity for persons with disabilities to give an account of their experiences. By means of interviews, letters, discussions, seminars and meetings with disabled people’s organisations, immigrant organisations and others with knowledge of these issues, I have obtained a picture of the situation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have to draw the conclusion that there are considerable deficiencies in attitudes to persons with disabilities. Many feel violated, controlled and called in question. This experience is a recurrent theme in almost all the statements I have obtained. The same pattern emerges regardless of the type of disability, life situation, and the support, service and assistance that is being sought. I am aware that efforts may be made to dismiss this picture by resorting to arguments that the sample of respondents was not representative, or that I have in altogether too one-sided a way taken up the problems instead of pointing out possibilities. However, I consider that the pattern in these statements has been confirmed by so many that it is impossible to dismiss.</p>
<p>It was evident at an early stage of the enquiry that attitudes to people were to a very high degree shaped by external factors. The values of the individual as well as the disabled person’s own expectations of what they are entitled to naturally play a role. But attitudes and behaviour have also been affected by working conditions, unclear and complicated systems of rules, which are often</p>
<p>changed, lack of resources, and the changes in values that have taken place in the wake of the economic crisis. Accordingly, attitudes to persons with disabilities are a political issue and an expression of the collective attitudes of society. That is why I have also described attitudes in this perspective.</p>
<p>The importance of changes in the wider society for attitudes is confirmed by a survey that I carried out among employees who in the course of their work meet people with disabilities. They are affected by cuts and employers’ demands to cope with the same work in a shorter time and with fewer resources and this can affect attitudes in some cases. Many feel that laws and rules are unclear and that politicians do not give clear information on what is applicable.</p>
<p>There is a lack of clarity in the political message on the attitude of the community to people with disabilities and on how the community deals with and meets the needs for service, support, and accessibility that many people with disabilities have. The gap between ideal and reality is evident in my material. When people realise that laws and rules do not live up to their promises, they feel deceived and lose faith in society’s ability to meet citizens’ needs and safeguard their interests. This creates distrust towards authorities, which leads in turn to distrust towards politicians.</p>
<p>The gap between ideal and reality is particularly clear with regard to contempt of court. There are cases where principals do not comply with judgements on the right to measures or assistance according to the Act concerning Support and Service for Persons with Certain Functional Impairments (LSS) or the Social Services Act (SoL). This is unacceptable. In practice, this means that the person does not get the measures or assistance that they are entitled to. This has been an ongoing issue for many years. During this time, a number of proposed solutions have been examined, without this resulting in any concrete measures. I regard contempt of court as a matter of attitudes and therefore take it up in this final report.</p>
<p>In the light of the stock of knowledge that I have now acquired, I consider that the position of the individual must be reinforced in a number of respects. This is the case; for example, with regard to the right to full participation and influence, where clear political directives are required that persons must not be excluded or treated in a violating way because they have a disability. It is, of course, also important to improve behaviour and treatment among employees and decision-makers by increasing their com-</p>
<p>petence in matters relating to the goals and aims of disability policy and the ethical aspects of attitudes.</p>
<p>I have recommended nine ways to develop behaviour and treatment towards persons with disabilities. These include proposals intended to improve collective attitudes and those directed at individual attitudes. Together, they aim at changing attitudes and treatment, improving the position of the individual in relation to authorities and other public bodies and making people better equipped to participate in the life of the community on their own terms.</p>
<p>%STABLISH A STATUTORY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE</p>
<p>An addition to be made to Chapter 1, Article 2, of the Constitution Act to the effect that laws and other statutory provisions should be drafted in such a way that all people can achieve full participation and equality in society regardless of such conditions as gender, age, disability, race, sexual orientation, ethnic, linguistic or religious affinity. This proposal is a statement of intent and has primarily a normative character.</p>
<p>0UT A STOP TO CONTEMPT OF COURT</p>
<p>A new way to counteract contempt of court is proposed. This proposal aims at preventing situations that can lead to court decisions not being enforced. It is proposed that the county administrative boards be given an increased supervisory role and powers to instruct municipalities and county councils to expand their services so that the individual can be offered the measure that she or he is entitled to. The County Administrative Board shall also be able to instruct the municipality or county council to execute court decisions giving the individual right to a particular measure within a reasonable period of time. It shall be made possible to impose a conditional fine on the council if it fails to do so.</p>
<p>#REATE CLARITY AROUND ADVICE AND SUPPORT</p>
<p>The Act concerning Support and Service for Persons with Certain Functional Impairments (LSS) is an act that provides certain persons with disabilities with the right to a number of provisions specified in the act. Some of these provisions involve the provision of advice, and other personal support, "advice and support". The measure has raised expectations, but at the same time created confusion, both for employees and for those requiring the measures. The legislation is unclear and opinions differ as to what is</p>
<p>included in advice and support, and how it differs from habilitation and rehabilitation. The legislation needs to be clarified.</p>
<p>%XPAND THE RIGHT OF ACCESS TO PUBLIC INFORMATION</p>
<p>The right to specially-adapted public information for persons with disabilities is a question of democratic rights. The opportunities for obtaining such information in an accessible form are limited today which means that many cannot make full use of and perform their civic rights and duties. The Democracy Commission should be charged with making proposals as to how the right to specially-adapted public information can be reinforced, among other ways by the use of new technology.</p>
<p>)NTRODUCE A NEW FUNCTION FOR HANDLING POINTS OF VIEW AND CRITI CISM OF ATTITUDES</p>
<p>Every relevant authority should create an independent instance that is separate from the ordinary activity, where the individual can turn with points of view or criticism of the authority’s attitude. This activity is intended to examine and take action on the various points of view and criticisms of attitudes that emerge in an objective way.</p>
<p>$EVELOP USER SUPPORT CENTRES</p>
<p>A trial activity with user support to persons with disabilities should be initiated under the auspices of the disabled people’s organisations. The purpose should be to test how such support, based on experiences and conditions of users can be designed, organised, administered and financed.</p>
<p>)NCREASE COMPETENCE</p>
<p>A national competence development programme around issues relating to attitudes to persons with disabilities should be worked out. This programme shall be clearly based on the principles of disability policy. A competence development council including representatives of the relevant authorities and the disabled people’s organisations shall be associated with the programme to create a common view in these issues, disseminate and win acceptance for it in the field.</p>
<p>The status of research in disability should be raised and resources reinforced. The Social Science Research Council, SFR, should be instructed to develop a long-term strategy for how disability research is to be evaluated, developed, stimulated and developed.</p>
<p>2EVEAL PREJUDICES</p>
<p>The disabled people’s organisations should be given the opportunity to carry out initiatives to use humour and satire to reduce prejudices and counteract negative attitudes to people with disabilities.</p>
