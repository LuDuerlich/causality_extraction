<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The pension reform, generous tax rules and major information initiatives, etc. are expected to lead to older people working for longer in pace with an increasing average life expectancy. However, despite some positive tendencies in older people’s employment, the changes have been modest. Sweden still has a de facto  normal retirement age of 65 years. The number of hours worked is increasing among older people, but far too slowly.</p>
<p>This is not sustainable. When we live longer, we must work for a longer period, otherwise pension levels will be too low, the dependency burden untenable and welfare funding threatened.</p>
<p>More and more older people are in a good position to have a longer working life. An increasing number also want to work for longer, but are confronted by various obstacles in regulatory systems, agreements and working life. The Commission of Inquiry therefore proposes a package of measures that includes initiatives to improve the working environment, to strengthen opportunities for older people to preserve and develop their skills, increase information, strengthen the financial incentives, combat age discrimination, etc.</p>
<p>These initiatives will help to ensure a higher, actual retirement age. However, several initiatives will only take effect in the long term and others should be expected to have a modest impact.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the actual retirement age and the number of hours worked among older people need to be increased, even in the short term. Otherwise the problem may worsen relatively quickly with regard to confidence in the pension system and the funding of welfare. The labour supply of older people can be sufficiently and immediately affected only via measures that affect the age limits governing existing regulations, which also shape the norms for the point at which people should leave working life.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes the introduction of a recommended retirement age,  which follows the development of average life expectancy. This recommended retirement age is a clear, non-choice alternative for the retirement of older people who wish to achieve an acceptable pension level. The age limits of the public pension system and related systems will be linked to the recommended retirement age. The proposals mean, inter alia,  the following:  The  61-year age limit for the earliest age at which people are entitled to draw their old-age pension will be raised to 62 years in 2015, and according to current forecasts, to 63 years in 2019.  The  65-year age limit for the guarantee pension, sickness compensation and other benefits will be raised to 66 years in 2019, according to current forecasts.  The age limit referred to in the Employment Protection Act will be raised from 67 to 69 in 2016.  The  55-year age limit for occupational and private pensions will be raised in 2017 to 62 years.</p>
<h2>The work first principle is also necessary for older people</h2>
<p>Many people still consider that early retirement, or by 65 at the latest, increases welfare. These values are largely based on old ideas and myths.</p>
<p>The belief is that older people become healthier, happier and live longer if they stop working early. There is also, even among otherwise educated people, a widespread and fixed belief that older people should give way to young people in the labour force, in order, among other things, to reduce youth unemployment.</p>
<p>The Commission ’ s analyses and the reports on which it bases its findings indicate that studies that are designed to seek to establish causal relationships do not provide any clear support to show that early retirement on average improves health, reduces mortality or increases the quality of life for older people.</p>
<p>Nor do economic theory or empirical studies provide any support to show that people who continue to work crowd out younger people from the labour market.</p>
<p>Work means so much more than a salary, even for older people. A meaningful job is important for the individual’s self-determination, our experience of a quality of life and belonging. Having a job is not just a matter of supporting oneself, but is equally about being part of a working community.</p>
<p>Early retirement can be regarded as a historical remnant that entails a waste of human capital. It is out of keeping with the times for well-educated and healthy people in their sixties to permanently leave the labour market with a public pension, occupational pension or retirement pension, and quite often on terms that make it difficult for them to continue working, even if they wanted to.</p>
<p>It is high time to undertake a systematic review of our views on retirement age and to implement a broad reform for a longer working life and for better welfare for older people.</p>
<h2>Developments are not sustainable</h2>
<p>Older people are becoming increasingly healthy, more alert and well-educated. The financial incentives for continuing to work are generous. Extensive initiatives are being implemented to provide information about the need to work for a longer period when we live longer.</p>
<p>Despite this, some 80 per cent draw their pension at 65, or earlier. Although there are certain positive tendencies, employment among people of around 60 and older is not increasing in pace with greater average life expectancy. New analyses indicate that the idea of 65 years as the normal retirement age is more firmly established in Sweden than in other countries, despite a considerable number of reforms aimed at encouraging longer working life.</p>
<p>Increasing numbers of people want to work for longer, but many are obviously not able to continue to work as long as they actually want because of different obstacles in regulatory systems, agreements and working life.</p>
<p>These developments are not sustainable. One of the most important motives for reforms promoting a longer working life is to provide citizens with greater opportunities to adapt their work and retirement to their own conditions and wishes.</p>
<p>If working life is not extended, pension levels will sink lower and lower as time goes by, which will undermine confidence in the pension system. The dependency burden for those who are working will become untenable. It will be difficult to maintain an acceptable standard of welfare. There is a risk that there will be a lack of labour in different sectors of the labour market.</p>
<h2>Longer working life, and differences in average life expectancy</h2>
<p>Despite radical changes in society and increasing prosperity, differences between different socioeconomic groups with regard to illhealth and average life expectancy remain static, or are growing. These developments are not unambiguous, however. Health improvements in the past 25 years have been somewhat more marked in the group of people with short educations, than for those with longer educations. The distribution of life expectancy has declined dramatically and Sweden has one of the lowest distributions in the world.</p>
<p>There may be a risk that measures to promote a longer working life may contribute to a weakening of the redistribution qualities of the pension system. Well-educated people will be able to continue to work with high salaries, which will give them higher pension levels for a longer period as a pensioner. People with lower educational levels have poorer working conditions and lower salaries; they often leave working life early and have a shorter average life expectancy.</p>
<p>An analysis of the net benefits of the pension system throughout people’s lives has been made on behalf of the Commission. The preliminary results show that in Sweden too, there are negative correlations between lifetime earnings and mortality, even if other factors are taken into consideration. There are many elements of the pension system that even out the differences between people with small, and those with large lifetime earnings. When fewer and fewer people die prematurely and an increasing number of people live longer, it appears reasonable to assume that the redistribution elements of the pension system are reinforced. The effects of a longer working life and the differences in average life expectancy cannot be assessed with any certainty on the basis of current knowledge. Measures to promote a longer working life need to be monitored closely through scientific evaluations.</p>
<h2>Strengthening the conditions and resources of older people to work for longer</h2>
<p>Most important for raising the actual retirement age, i.e. the exit age at which people, on average, leave working life, is to reduce the number of people who prematurely stop supporting themselves through work, for example, because of reduced work capacity. Strengthened initiatives are therefore needed to improve the conditions and resources of people so that they are able to work for longer.</p>
<p>Efforts to improve the work environment</p>
<p>Greater initiatives are needed to reduce the number of people who are not able to work a full working life. Despite improvements in the working environment, a considerable proportion of all employees still state that they have strenuous and monotonous jobs and experience deficiencies in their working environment. Between 20 and 30 per cent of all employees experience physical work environment problems. Partially new work environment problems are becoming increasingly extensive, such as stress and psychosocial pressure. There is reason to assume that, to a certain extent, work environment problems contribute to premature exit from working life. Nonetheless, relevant information about this needs to be improved. The Commission therefore proposes a broad, long-term initiative for the work environment, based on a greater element of development and evaluation of work environment efforts in terms of strengthening the resources of the Swedish Work Environment Authority, providing greater resources to research and the development of knowledge, and training managers and safety representatives:  Strengthening  on-going development efforts at the Swedish Work Environment Authority.  Efforts for the development and  follow-up of systematic work environment initiatives.  Efforts for supervision and monitoring methods.  Training for safety representatives and managers.  Programmes to disseminate knowledge about how work places can be adapted to an older work force.  New functions and resources for research on the connections between work environment, health and work capacity and for an evaluation of work environment p0licy.  Resources for intervention studies.</p>
<p>Continued measures to combat age discrimination</p>
<p>International research indicates that effective legislation and its application in combating age discrimination have a positive effect on the employment of older people. Research on age discrimination is limited in Sweden. The few studies that exist indicate that discrimination of older people in working life may be extensive and even more severe than discrimination that is connected with ethnic origin. More than one-quarter of employees over the age of 50 state in questionnaires that they have been discriminated in the labour market because of their age. Eight out of ten people say that their age is an obstacle if they want to change jobs. The Commission considers that protection against age discrimination needs to be strengthened:  Strengthened legislation to combat age discrimination.  The incidence of age discrimination should be examined and reported regularly.  Discrepancies in laws, rules and agreements applying to the treatment of older people and age limits governing existing regulations with regard to retirement should be identified and proposals for measures presented.  A review of the Discrimination Act should be implemented in a few years, aimed at ensuring that the Act has had its full impact concerning the rules against discrimination that are linked with age (regarding older people).  A research initiative to increase knowledge about age discrimination.</p>
<p>Better conditions for older people who wish to upgrade their skills</p>
<p>Older members of the labour force are increasingly well-educated today. However, their knowledge can, with time, become out of date if it is not upgraded. It may be financially difficult to take leave of absence and study. People approaching retirement age (often even from 50 years of age) are often excluded from further professional development at their jobs. This may contribute to their performance, with time, not corresponding to their salary costs. This, in turn, leads to difficulties in keeping or getting a job, changing one ʼ s work tasks or seeking new jobs. The Commission proposes measures aimed at facilitating people’s ability to maintain and develop their knowledge and skills, throughout their working lives:  Higher age limits and more generous terms for financial support for students.  The development of a range of courses offered that are adapted to the demands of older people.  Resources to the Swedish Public Employment Services for career advice to older people.  Greater opportunities for employment training programmes for older people (for people approaching the age of sixty or older?).</p>
<p>Contracted occupational pensions that contribute to a longer working life</p>
<p>Occupational pensions that have been contracted play an important role in giving citizens good financial security when they grow older.</p>
<p>The Government Commission for Longer Working Life and Retirement Age considers that the defined benefit occupational pensions, which will apply for a long period in the future, will play a key role for the labour supply and pension behaviour of older people. The age rules of occupational pensions and other rules encourage early exit from working life and make it more difficult to continue to work.</p>
<p>It is the social partners that settle terms of employment in collective agreements. The social partners play a vital role in opportunities for older people to work for longer. The Commission considers that successful initiatives for a longer working life for older people are conditional on all the actors helping to achieve the necessary changes together. It is important that the constructive talks that the Commission has had with experts and researchers on the rules for, and information on occupational pensions, are deepened:  Three party talks with the main organisations in the labour market should be initiated.  Ways in which contracted vocational pensions and the legislation with regard to vocational pensions can be developed to help promote a longer working life should be systematically examined in these talks.</p>
<p>Greater opportunities for flexible working hours</p>
<p>More flexible working hours are considered to make it easier for older people to work for a longer period. Ordinary working schedules may be felt to be demanding for older employees. For people with reduced work capacity, a reduction in working hours may be a good alternative to drawing their pensions prematurely and completely ending their gainful employment. Many older people state in the Swedish Pensions Agency ’ s questionnaire that greater opportunities to work part time during the last years before retirement and after would increase their interest in a longer working life.</p>
<p>Certain fundamental issues regarding working hours are regulated in the Working Time Act. Working time issues are, however, normally determined in collective agreements in the labour market. The individual is usually not entitled to request flexible working hours, but the employer and employee may settle this in a special agreement. Within some agreement areas there are opportunities for partial retirement.</p>
<p>According to the review of knowledge undertaken on behalf of the Commission, there is no agreement in research on whether or not flexible working hours contribute to increasing the number of hours worked among older people. It is therefore not suitable to consider legislation for the right to flexible working hours for older employees. However, the Commission considers that the question should be discussed further in joint talks between the Government and the main organisations in the labour market:  Three party talks with the main organisations in the labour market should be initiated.  How can agreements and working hours, etc. and the legislation concerning this be changed in order to give older people greater opportunities for flexible working hours?</p>
<p>Information needs to be developed</p>
<p>Today’s pension system means that the individual must take greater responsibility for his or her financial security during old age. This requires that citizens largely understand the relation between their income from work throughout their lives, average life expectancy and the pension level. It is particularly important for more people to understand how large the financial benefits are of working longer and postponing drawing their pensions.</p>
<p>From an international perspective, Sweden has very high ambitions with regard to information efforts. The Government Commission for Longer Working Life and Retirement Age considers that, despite, this, further measures are needed:  A new Internet portal for information on longer working life and retirement.  An assignment to the Swedish Pensions Agency to increase the level of knowledge about the pension system among people who are approaching retirement age and regularly measure their knowledge.  Development of the website minpension.se so that people approaching retirement age can calculate how their disposable incomes will be affected for the rest of their lives by alternative pension decisions.</p>
<p>Assignments and research resources to the Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy (IFAU) to increase knowledge of how pension information affects the labour supply among people of 60 years of age, or older.</p>
<h2>The age limits need to be adjusted</h2>
<p>What determines actual retirement age (the age of exit from the labour force) is primarily the age limits governing existing regulations and providing the norm for public and contracted pensions and related public compensation systems. The Commission’s proposals to strengthen people’s conditions and resources for working longer will contribute to a higher, actual retirement age. However, several initiatives will only take effect in the long term and others should be expected to have a modest impact.</p>
<p>The actual retirement age and the number of hours worked among older people, however, needs to be increased even in the short term. Otherwise the problem may worsen relatively quickly with regard to confidence in the pension system and the funding of welfare. The labour supply of older people can be sufficiently and immediately affected only via measures that have an impact on the age limits governing existing regulations that also form the norms for the point at which people should leave working life.</p>
<p>The age limits in the public pension system and related systems should therefore be adjusted and automatically adapted to an increased average life expectancy.</p>
<p>New recommended retirement age that reflects average life expectancy</p>
<p>The income-related pension and the premium pension with a flexible retirement age and the lifetime earnings principle provide the opportunity to earn pension rights regardless of age, and great freedom to combine work with a pension. This is one of the foundations of the pension system, and must be upheld. Each individual is able to adapt their exit from working life to their own conditions and wishes.</p>
<p>The Commission considers, however, that the state should be clear about the retirement age that will provide an acceptable level of pension. A recommended retirement age  should therefore be introduced into the public pension system. This recommended retirement age is a strong alternative to current notions of retirement age in terms of the individual’s financial security, the national economy and the pension system:  The recommended retirement age is a  non-choice alternative for older people who are not able, or do not wish to analyse the effects of different retirement dates and to make decisions of their own.  It will govern age limits in the pension system and other related insurance systems.  It is to be adjusted annually to the development of average life expectancy for people of 65 years of age.  It is to be calculated by the Swedish Pensions Agency, established by the Government as of 2015, and applied from the beginning of 2019.  It can be used as a reference for age limits in  non-public systems.</p>
<p>An increase in the 61-year age limit for the earliest point at which an old-age pension can be drawn</p>
<p>People in general are short-sighted in their financial decisions. There is a risk that older people choose to retire early because they do not fully understand the private-financial consequences in the longer term. Many of those who retire early discover, however, after a number of years as a pensioner, that their incomes are low compared with those of younger people and in relation to what is needed to maintain an acceptable standard of living.</p>
<p>Since the pension reform was decided, average life expectancy is estimated to have increased in 2014 by 2.4 years. The age limits for the flexible retirement age should be adapted to this increase in average life expectancy. Raising the age limit should take place relatively quickly in order to fund offensive initiatives for the work environment, further professional development, etc. The Commission considers that the lowest age limit for when an old-age pension can be drawn should be raised in 2015:  The  61-year age limit for a pension should be raised to 62 in 2015.  After that, the age limit should be raised in line with the recommended retirement age, which according to forecasts will be 66 in 2019.</p>
<p>The 65-year age limit for a guarantee pension will follow the recommended retirement age</p>
<p>The norm that older people are to retire at 65 will be maintained by retaining the 65-year rule in both the public and contracted regulatory systems. Around 30 per cent of all newly granted pensioners, half of all women, have a retirement age of 65 through their guarantee pensions. All those who are supported via various social insurance schemes, such as sickness compensation, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, etc. have a retirement age of 65 in practice. In addition, an estimated 70 per cent of all employees have contracted occupational pensions and these are normally automatically disbursed at 65 years of age.</p>
<p>It is reasonable for increasing numbers of citizens to work for longer when we live longer. It would be seen as unfair for people who have worked full time for most of their lives to have to work for longer when they are older in order to finance an increasing number of retirement years for people who have worked part time and/or a shorter period of their lives. As time goes by, there will also be too serious complications in the pension system if the 65year age limit for guarantee pensions is retained, at the same time as other age limits are raised to keep pace with the recommended retirement age. The Commission considers that the 65-year norm can only be changed if the 65-year age limit for guarantee pensions is adjusted:  The  65-year age limit for guarantee pension decided in 2019 will be raised with the recommended retirement age, which according to forecasts will be 66 in 2019.  Older provisions will apply to guarantee pensions that were decided for the period before 2019.</p>
<p>Guarantee pensioners to also benefit from continued work</p>
<p>On the whole, the financial incentives for working longer and postponing drawing one’s pension from the public pension system, including the effects of taxes and benefits, are appropriately designed. For people with low income-related pensions, however, the incentives to work for a longer period are weak. Many of these people would probably want to improve their financial situations by continuing to work. For reasons of fairness, the financial benefits should also be strengthened for people with lower pension levels:  Incomes earned after the age of 65/the recommended retirement age should not be able to affect the guarantee pension or the housing supplement.  People with fewer than 40 years of residence must be able to “work to collect” more insurance years after the age of 65.</p>
<p>Increase in the age limit referred to in the Employment Protection Act to 69 years of age</p>
<p>Under the Employment Protection Act, an employee is entitled to remain in his or her employment with full employment protection until the end of the month of his or her 67 th  birthday.</p>
<p>The major improvements in the health, cognitive capacity and education of older people gradually raises the age when, based on the best knowledge, natural ageing can be regarded, on average, as considerably reducing the work capacity of an older person. The increase in average life expectancy means that more and more people must also work after 67 in order to obtain an acceptable pension. Raising the age limit may help increase the labour supply among people of 67 or older.</p>
<p>There are, of course, some risks associated with raising the age limit, such as employers who may be inclined to terminate a job before an employee’s 65 th  birthday so as to avoid having too many people continuing to work until they are 69. These and other risks can be reduced if the rules for giving notice are modified. According to the Commission, the advantages of raising the age limit referred to in the Employment Protection Act outweigh any disadvantages:  It is proposed to raise the age limit applying to the Employment Protection Act to 69 in 2016.  The age limit will subsequently be adapted to the recommended retirement age.  If the employer wants an employee who has had his or her 69 th  birthday to leave the job, the employer must give the employee who is over 69 written notice of this at least one month beforehand. In the event of a changeover in operations, however, notice of termination of employment will apply, but in such cases, the employee will not be entitled to a notice period longer than a month and will have limited right of priority to re-employment.  An appropriate government agency should be tasked with following up the effects of abolishing the rules on notice of termination of employment.</p>
<p>Other age limits will be changed as a result</p>
<p>The age limits in related social systems are also important components in norm formation on when older people should be considered ready to leave working life. When the age limits of the pension system are gradually raised, it will be necessary to ensure that the age limits for insurance protection for people in gainful employment follow suit. Peculiar effects may otherwise arise when some systems are linked to the recommended retirement age, while others retain the 65-year age limit.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the age limit of 65 years in social insurance and related social benefits in normal cases be adjusted upwards in pace with the increase in average life expectancy. The age limits of 65 in other legislation should be adapted to the increase in average life expectancy in special procedures, if there is nothing to indicate otherwise:  The age limit for sickness compensation that is newly granted as of 2019, together with the age limit for sickness benefit qualifying income in the sickness insurance system, unemployment benefit, occupational injury life annuities, sickness benefit in special cases, maintenance support for elderly persons and the age limit for social security contributions will be adapted to the recommended retirement age, which according to the forecasts will be 66 in 2019.  Older provisions will apply to benefits in the form of sickness compensation and insurance cases that were decided or refer to the period before 2019.  Occupational aids and extended occupational life injury annuities will be linked to the age applying to the Employment Protection Act.  The continued right to protection of the sickness benefit qualifying income, the disability allowance, car support, unemployment benefit after the introduction of the recommended retirement age and coordination between pensions and unemployment benefits should be examined further.  Initiatives with regard to the attendance allowance should be followed up before a change in the age limit can be considered.</p>
<p>The 55-year age limit in the Income Tax Act is to be raised</p>
<p>Employer costs for pensions to employees are deductable under the Income Tax Act, provided that the pension is not disbursed earlier than at 55 years of age. Vocational pension agreements therefore normally have 55 years as the lowest age for drawing a pension. The same requirement applies to private pension savings.</p>
<p>The 55-year age limit in the Income Tax Act was introduced in 1951, when average life expectancy was much shorter, most employees had a low educational level, the age of entrance into working life was lower and the demands of working life different. Pension income that is deposited in funds within the framework of the provisions of the Income Tax Act is treated more favourably than other savings, in terms of taxes. According to the Commission, there is now no underlying reason to subsidise such an early exit from working life as 55 years. There are, moreover, few people who actually make use of this possibility to draw their pensions at 55. The age limit of 55 gives the wrong signal to the labour market, now that more older people need to work for longer. The Commission proposes that this age limit be raised:  It is proposed to raise the  55-year age limit in the Income Tax Act to 62 in 2017. This means that it will not be possible to disburse vocational pensions or private pensions to people who are younger than 62.  Special rules on exemptions will apply to certain private pension deposits and private pension savings and disbursements that have already begun.</p>
<h2>The consequences of the proposals</h2>
<p>The effects of these proposals will primarily depend on the labour market situation in which they are implemented. The Commission’s assessment is based on a labour market that is balanced in supply and demand. The effects may be considerably more rapid and greater if the measures are implemented at the same time as Sweden recovers from the economic downturn of recent years.</p>
<p>A higher retirement age extends working life</p>
<p>Evaluations of changes in retirement age in other countries indicate that the average age for drawing the old-age pension and the proportion of people remaining in the labour force rises by 20–50 per cent of the higher retirement age. Experience also shows that a certain amount of overflow to other social insurance systems may occur. With reasonable assumptions on the effect of increased age limits and overflow to other social insurance, the Commission considers that its proposals will considerably increase the labour supply among older people:  The number of people in the labour force between the ages of  60–70 is expected to increase by 40 000–50 000 people in 2020.  It is estimated that the dependency burden, i.e., the ratio between the number of people who are not employed of 15 years and older and the number of employed people will be stabilised to about 0,8 in about 2030.</p>
<p>Improved public finances</p>
<p>Even in the short term, public finances and the financial balance of the pension system will be strengthened as a result of a longer working life. Some of this income should be used to fund the Commission’s proposals for measures to promote a longer working life:  Public finances are expected to be strengthened by some SEK 100 million in 2015 and by SEK 3 700 million by 2020 as the median alternative.  The increased employment of older workers is estimated to have a levelling effect on the pension system’s balance during the years  2018-2030.  The costs of the Commission’s proposals for a better work environment, skills etc. are estimated at some SEK 200 million in 2015 and SEK 400 million in 2020.  The costs of extending the right to sickness benefit, unemployment benefits and other benefits are estimated at some SEK 100 million in 2015 and SEK 2 300 million in 2020.  The Commission also gives an account of the impact in a high and a low alternative.</p>
<p>The consequences for individuals</p>
<p>Increased employment is expected to increase disposable income among people between the ages of 60 and 70 by up to 18 percent in 2015–2019. Income distribution is expected to even out somewhat as a result of the fact that financial standards, in relative terms, will be raised for older people.</p>
<p>Typical case estimates show that an increased age limit for sickness benefits and unemployment benefits will improve financial standards for the people involved, both before and after retirement.</p>
<p>The regulatory amendments for guarantee pensioners means that one year more of gainful employment increases disposable income by some SEK 7 000 per year. With the current rules, continuing to work provides only marginally higher incomes.</p>
<p>Financial equality is considered to be positively affected, primarily through the proposal for guarantee pensions.</p>
<p>Other consequences</p>
<p>The proposed regulatory amendments will lead to some transitional costs for employers and companies, but they are considered to be modest. The Commission proposes a gradual introduction, which means that the administrative consequences for the agencies involved are considered to be manageable.</p>
<h2>Follow-up and evaluation</h2>
<p>Assessments of the proposals’ effects are uncertain. Some effects are less difficult to predict, such as the effects of raising the lower age limit for drawing the old-age pension. For these regulatory amendments, it is reasonable to assume a considerable impact on labour supply. The proposal on a recommended retirement age is more difficult to assess. There is no experience of similar proposals from other countries.</p>
<p>The proposed initiatives to improve the work environment, to strengthen opportunities for older people to preserve and develop their skills, increase information, etc. will contribute to a higher, actual retirement age. Several initiatives, however, will only take effect in the long term and others should be expected to have a modest impact.</p>
<p>This uncertainty means that it will be necessary for the package of measures to promote a longer working life to be carefully monitored and evaluated scientifically:  An expert group should lead efforts on  follow-up and evaluation.  This group should have the resources to assign tasks to agencies and researchers.  The main task is to follow up and present annual reports on the effects of the proposals on labour supply and public finances.  The task should also include following the distributional effects of the proposals, their consequences for the health and quality of life of older people and other social effects.</p>
<p>The different proposals of the Commission are interdependent. The funding of the Commission’s proposals on the work environment, etc. is conditional on older people working for longer as a result of the regulatory amendments. The increase in the age limit for sickness benefit, sickness compensation and other social benefits can only be funded if the introduction of a recommended retirement age significantly extends working life.</p>
<p>If the follow-ups and evaluations show that the measures to promote a longer working life do not lead to sufficient reinforcement of public finances, the Government should quickly examine more forceful measures to ensure a longer working life.</p>

<h2>Uppföljning och utvärdering Summary</h2>
<p>The pension reform, generous tax rules and major information initiatives, etc. are expected to lead to older people working for longer in pace with an increasing average life expectancy. However, despite some positive tendencies in older people’s employment, the changes have been modest. Sweden still has a de facto  normal retirement age of 65 years. The number of hours worked is increasing among older people, but far too slowly.</p>
<p>This is not sustainable. When we live longer, we must work for a longer period, otherwise pension levels will be too low, the dependency burden untenable and welfare funding threatened.</p>
<p>More and more older people are in a good position to have a longer working life. An increasing number also want to work for longer, but are confronted by various obstacles in regulatory systems, agreements and working life. The Commission of Inquiry therefore proposes a package of measures that includes initiatives to improve the working environment, to strengthen opportunities for older people to preserve and develop their skills, increase information, strengthen the financial incentives, combat age discrimination, etc.</p>
<p>These initiatives will help to ensure a higher, actual retirement age. However, several initiatives will only take effect in the long term and others should be expected to have a modest impact.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the actual retirement age and the number of hours worked among older people need to be increased, even in the short term. Otherwise the problem may worsen relatively quickly with regard to confidence in the pension system and the funding of welfare. The labour supply of older people can be sufficiently and immediately affected only via measures that affect the age limits governing existing regulations, which also shape the norms for the point at which people should leave working life.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes the introduction of a recommended retirement age,  which follows the development of average life expectancy. This recommended retirement age is a clear, non-choice alternative for the retirement of older people who wish to achieve an acceptable pension level. The age limits of the public pension system and related systems will be linked to the recommended retirement age. The proposals mean, inter alia,  the following:  The  61-year age limit for the earliest age at which people are entitled to draw their old-age pension will be raised to 62 years in 2015, and according to current forecasts, to 63 years in 2019.  The  65-year age limit for the guarantee pension, sickness compensation and other benefits will be raised to 66 years in 2019, according to current forecasts.  The age limit referred to in the Employment Protection Act will be raised from 67 to 69 in 2016.  The  55-year age limit for occupational and private pensions will be raised in 2017 to 62 years.</p>
<h2>The work first principle is also necessary for older people</h2>
<p>Many people still consider that early retirement, or by 65 at the latest, increases welfare. These values are largely based on old ideas and myths.</p>
<p>The belief is that older people become healthier, happier and live longer if they stop working early. There is also, even among otherwise educated people, a widespread and fixed belief that older people should give way to young people in the labour force, in order, among other things, to reduce youth unemployment.</p>
<p>The Commission ’ s analyses and the reports on which it bases its findings indicate that studies that are designed to seek to establish causal relationships do not provide any clear support to show that early retirement on average improves health, reduces mortality or increases the quality of life for older people.</p>
<p>Nor do economic theory or empirical studies provide any support to show that people who continue to work crowd out younger people from the labour market.</p>
<p>Work means so much more than a salary, even for older people. A meaningful job is important for the individual’s self-determination, our experience of a quality of life and belonging. Having a job is not just a matter of supporting oneself, but is equally about being part of a working community.</p>
<p>Early retirement can be regarded as a historical remnant that entails a waste of human capital. It is out of keeping with the times for well-educated and healthy people in their sixties to permanently leave the labour market with a public pension, occupational pension or retirement pension, and quite often on terms that make it difficult for them to continue working, even if they wanted to.</p>
<p>It is high time to undertake a systematic review of our views on retirement age and to implement a broad reform for a longer working life and for better welfare for older people.</p>
<h2>Developments are not sustainable</h2>
<p>Older people are becoming increasingly healthy, more alert and well-educated. The financial incentives for continuing to work are generous. Extensive initiatives are being implemented to provide information about the need to work for a longer period when we live longer.</p>
<p>Despite this, some 80 per cent draw their pension at 65, or earlier. Although there are certain positive tendencies, employment among people of around 60 and older is not increasing in pace with greater average life expectancy. New analyses indicate that the idea of 65 years as the normal retirement age is more firmly established in Sweden than in other countries, despite a considerable number of reforms aimed at encouraging longer working life.</p>
<p>Increasing numbers of people want to work for longer, but many are obviously not able to continue to work as long as they actually want because of different obstacles in regulatory systems, agreements and working life.</p>
<p>These developments are not sustainable. One of the most important motives for reforms promoting a longer working life is to provide citizens with greater opportunities to adapt their work and retirement to their own conditions and wishes.</p>
<p>If working life is not extended, pension levels will sink lower and lower as time goes by, which will undermine confidence in the pension system. The dependency burden for those who are working will become untenable. It will be difficult to maintain an acceptable standard of welfare. There is a risk that there will be a lack of labour in different sectors of the labour market.</p>
<h2>Longer working life, and differences in average life expectancy</h2>
<p>Despite radical changes in society and increasing prosperity, differences between different socioeconomic groups with regard to illhealth and average life expectancy remain static, or are growing. These developments are not unambiguous, however. Health improvements in the past 25 years have been somewhat more marked in the group of people with short educations, than for those with longer educations. The distribution of life expectancy has declined dramatically and Sweden has one of the lowest distributions in the world.</p>
<p>There may be a risk that measures to promote a longer working life may contribute to a weakening of the redistribution qualities of the pension system. Well-educated people will be able to continue to work with high salaries, which will give them higher pension levels for a longer period as a pensioner. People with lower educational levels have poorer working conditions and lower salaries; they often leave working life early and have a shorter average life expectancy.</p>
<p>An analysis of the net benefits of the pension system throughout people’s lives has been made on behalf of the Commission. The preliminary results show that in Sweden too, there are negative correlations between lifetime earnings and mortality, even if other factors are taken into consideration. There are many elements of the pension system that even out the differences between people with small, and those with large lifetime earnings. When fewer and fewer people die prematurely and an increasing number of people live longer, it appears reasonable to assume that the redistribution elements of the pension system are reinforced. The effects of a longer working life and the differences in average life expectancy cannot be assessed with any certainty on the basis of current knowledge. Measures to promote a longer working life need to be monitored closely through scientific evaluations.</p>
<h2>Strengthening the conditions and resources of older people to work for longer</h2>
<p>Most important for raising the actual retirement age, i.e. the exit age at which people, on average, leave working life, is to reduce the number of people who prematurely stop supporting themselves through work, for example, because of reduced work capacity. Strengthened initiatives are therefore needed to improve the conditions and resources of people so that they are able to work for longer.</p>
<p>Efforts to improve the work environment</p>
<p>Greater initiatives are needed to reduce the number of people who are not able to work a full working life. Despite improvements in the working environment, a considerable proportion of all employees still state that they have strenuous and monotonous jobs and experience deficiencies in their working environment. Between 20 and 30 per cent of all employees experience physical work environment problems. Partially new work environment problems are becoming increasingly extensive, such as stress and psychosocial pressure. There is reason to assume that, to a certain extent, work environment problems contribute to premature exit from working life. Nonetheless, relevant information about this needs to be improved. The Commission therefore proposes a broad, long-term initiative for the work environment, based on a greater element of development and evaluation of work environment efforts in terms of strengthening the resources of the Swedish Work Environment Authority, providing greater resources to research and the development of knowledge, and training managers and safety representatives:  Strengthening  on-going development efforts at the Swedish Work Environment Authority.  Efforts for the development and  follow-up of systematic work environment initiatives.  Efforts for supervision and monitoring methods.  Training for safety representatives and managers.  Programmes to disseminate knowledge about how work places can be adapted to an older work force.  New functions and resources for research on the connections between work environment, health and work capacity and for an evaluation of work environment p0licy.  Resources for intervention studies.</p>
<p>Continued measures to combat age discrimination</p>
<p>International research indicates that effective legislation and its application in combating age discrimination have a positive effect on the employment of older people. Research on age discrimination is limited in Sweden. The few studies that exist indicate that discrimination of older people in working life may be extensive and even more severe than discrimination that is connected with ethnic origin. More than one-quarter of employees over the age of 50 state in questionnaires that they have been discriminated in the labour market because of their age. Eight out of ten people say that their age is an obstacle if they want to change jobs. The Commission considers that protection against age discrimination needs to be strengthened:  Strengthened legislation to combat age discrimination.  The incidence of age discrimination should be examined and reported regularly.  Discrepancies in laws, rules and agreements applying to the treatment of older people and age limits governing existing regulations with regard to retirement should be identified and proposals for measures presented.  A review of the Discrimination Act should be implemented in a few years, aimed at ensuring that the Act has had its full impact concerning the rules against discrimination that are linked with age (regarding older people).  A research initiative to increase knowledge about age discrimination.</p>
<p>Better conditions for older people who wish to upgrade their skills</p>
<p>Older members of the labour force are increasingly well-educated today. However, their knowledge can, with time, become out of date if it is not upgraded. It may be financially difficult to take leave of absence and study. People approaching retirement age (often even from 50 years of age) are often excluded from further professional development at their jobs. This may contribute to their performance, with time, not corresponding to their salary costs. This, in turn, leads to difficulties in keeping or getting a job, changing one ʼ s work tasks or seeking new jobs. The Commission proposes measures aimed at facilitating people’s ability to maintain and develop their knowledge and skills, throughout their working lives:  Higher age limits and more generous terms for financial support for students.  The development of a range of courses offered that are adapted to the demands of older people.  Resources to the Swedish Public Employment Services for career advice to older people.  Greater opportunities for employment training programmes for older people (for people approaching the age of sixty or older?).</p>
<p>Contracted occupational pensions that contribute to a longer working life</p>
<p>Occupational pensions that have been contracted play an important role in giving citizens good financial security when they grow older.</p>
<p>The Government Commission for Longer Working Life and Retirement Age considers that the defined benefit occupational pensions, which will apply for a long period in the future, will play a key role for the labour supply and pension behaviour of older people. The age rules of occupational pensions and other rules encourage early exit from working life and make it more difficult to continue to work.</p>
<p>It is the social partners that settle terms of employment in collective agreements. The social partners play a vital role in opportunities for older people to work for longer. The Commission considers that successful initiatives for a longer working life for older people are conditional on all the actors helping to achieve the necessary changes together. It is important that the constructive talks that the Commission has had with experts and researchers on the rules for, and information on occupational pensions, are deepened:  Three party talks with the main organisations in the labour market should be initiated.  Ways in which contracted vocational pensions and the legislation with regard to vocational pensions can be developed to help promote a longer working life should be systematically examined in these talks.</p>
<p>Greater opportunities for flexible working hours</p>
<p>More flexible working hours are considered to make it easier for older people to work for a longer period. Ordinary working schedules may be felt to be demanding for older employees. For people with reduced work capacity, a reduction in working hours may be a good alternative to drawing their pensions prematurely and completely ending their gainful employment. Many older people state in the Swedish Pensions Agency ’ s questionnaire that greater opportunities to work part time during the last years before retirement and after would increase their interest in a longer working life.</p>
<p>Certain fundamental issues regarding working hours are regulated in the Working Time Act. Working time issues are, however, normally determined in collective agreements in the labour market. The individual is usually not entitled to request flexible working hours, but the employer and employee may settle this in a special agreement. Within some agreement areas there are opportunities for partial retirement.</p>
<p>According to the review of knowledge undertaken on behalf of the Commission, there is no agreement in research on whether or not flexible working hours contribute to increasing the number of hours worked among older people. It is therefore not suitable to consider legislation for the right to flexible working hours for older employees. However, the Commission considers that the question should be discussed further in joint talks between the Government and the main organisations in the labour market:  Three party talks with the main organisations in the labour market should be initiated.  How can agreements and working hours, etc. and the legislation concerning this be changed in order to give older people greater opportunities for flexible working hours?</p>
<p>Information needs to be developed</p>
<p>Today’s pension system means that the individual must take greater responsibility for his or her financial security during old age. This requires that citizens largely understand the relation between their income from work throughout their lives, average life expectancy and the pension level. It is particularly important for more people to understand how large the financial benefits are of working longer and postponing drawing their pensions.</p>
<p>From an international perspective, Sweden has very high ambitions with regard to information efforts. The Government Commission for Longer Working Life and Retirement Age considers that, despite, this, further measures are needed:  A new Internet portal for information on longer working life and retirement.  An assignment to the Swedish Pensions Agency to increase the level of knowledge about the pension system among people who are approaching retirement age and regularly measure their knowledge.  Development of the website minpension.se so that people approaching retirement age can calculate how their disposable incomes will be affected for the rest of their lives by alternative pension decisions.</p>
<p>Assignments and research resources to the Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy (IFAU) to increase knowledge of how pension information affects the labour supply among people of 60 years of age, or older.</p>
<h2>The age limits need to be adjusted</h2>
<p>What determines actual retirement age (the age of exit from the labour force) is primarily the age limits governing existing regulations and providing the norm for public and contracted pensions and related public compensation systems. The Commission’s proposals to strengthen people’s conditions and resources for working longer will contribute to a higher, actual retirement age. However, several initiatives will only take effect in the long term and others should be expected to have a modest impact.</p>
<p>The actual retirement age and the number of hours worked among older people, however, needs to be increased even in the short term. Otherwise the problem may worsen relatively quickly with regard to confidence in the pension system and the funding of welfare. The labour supply of older people can be sufficiently and immediately affected only via measures that have an impact on the age limits governing existing regulations that also form the norms for the point at which people should leave working life.</p>
<p>The age limits in the public pension system and related systems should therefore be adjusted and automatically adapted to an increased average life expectancy.</p>
<p>New recommended retirement age that reflects average life expectancy</p>
<p>The income-related pension and the premium pension with a flexible retirement age and the lifetime earnings principle provide the opportunity to earn pension rights regardless of age, and great freedom to combine work with a pension. This is one of the foundations of the pension system, and must be upheld. Each individual is able to adapt their exit from working life to their own conditions and wishes.</p>
<p>The Commission considers, however, that the state should be clear about the retirement age that will provide an acceptable level of pension. A recommended retirement age  should therefore be introduced into the public pension system. This recommended retirement age is a strong alternative to current notions of retirement age in terms of the individual’s financial security, the national economy and the pension system:  The recommended retirement age is a  non-choice alternative for older people who are not able, or do not wish to analyse the effects of different retirement dates and to make decisions of their own.  It will govern age limits in the pension system and other related insurance systems.  It is to be adjusted annually to the development of average life expectancy for people of 65 years of age.  It is to be calculated by the Swedish Pensions Agency, established by the Government as of 2015, and applied from the beginning of 2019.  It can be used as a reference for age limits in  non-public systems.</p>
<p>An increase in the 61-year age limit for the earliest point at which an old-age pension can be drawn</p>
<p>People in general are short-sighted in their financial decisions. There is a risk that older people choose to retire early because they do not fully understand the private-financial consequences in the longer term. Many of those who retire early discover, however, after a number of years as a pensioner, that their incomes are low compared with those of younger people and in relation to what is needed to maintain an acceptable standard of living.</p>
<p>Since the pension reform was decided, average life expectancy is estimated to have increased in 2014 by 2.4 years. The age limits for the flexible retirement age should be adapted to this increase in average life expectancy. Raising the age limit should take place relatively quickly in order to fund offensive initiatives for the work environment, further professional development, etc. The Commission considers that the lowest age limit for when an old-age pension can be drawn should be raised in 2015:  The  61-year age limit for a pension should be raised to 62 in 2015.  After that, the age limit should be raised in line with the recommended retirement age, which according to forecasts will be 66 in 2019.</p>
<p>The 65-year age limit for a guarantee pension will follow the recommended retirement age</p>
<p>The norm that older people are to retire at 65 will be maintained by retaining the 65-year rule in both the public and contracted regulatory systems. Around 30 per cent of all newly granted pensioners, half of all women, have a retirement age of 65 through their guarantee pensions. All those who are supported via various social insurance schemes, such as sickness compensation, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, etc. have a retirement age of 65 in practice. In addition, an estimated 70 per cent of all employees have contracted occupational pensions and these are normally automatically disbursed at 65 years of age.</p>
<p>It is reasonable for increasing numbers of citizens to work for longer when we live longer. It would be seen as unfair for people who have worked full time for most of their lives to have to work for longer when they are older in order to finance an increasing number of retirement years for people who have worked part time and/or a shorter period of their lives. As time goes by, there will also be too serious complications in the pension system if the 65year age limit for guarantee pensions is retained, at the same time as other age limits are raised to keep pace with the recommended retirement age. The Commission considers that the 65-year norm can only be changed if the 65-year age limit for guarantee pensions is adjusted:  The  65-year age limit for guarantee pension decided in 2019 will be raised with the recommended retirement age, which according to forecasts will be 66 in 2019.  Older provisions will apply to guarantee pensions that were decided for the period before 2019.</p>
<p>Guarantee pensioners to also benefit from continued work</p>
<p>On the whole, the financial incentives for working longer and postponing drawing one’s pension from the public pension system, including the effects of taxes and benefits, are appropriately designed. For people with low income-related pensions, however, the incentives to work for a longer period are weak. Many of these people would probably want to improve their financial situations by continuing to work. For reasons of fairness, the financial benefits should also be strengthened for people with lower pension levels:  Incomes earned after the age of 65/the recommended retirement age should not be able to affect the guarantee pension or the housing supplement.  People with fewer than 40 years of residence must be able to “work to collect” more insurance years after the age of 65.</p>
<p>Increase in the age limit referred to in the Employment Protection Act to 69 years of age</p>
<p>Under the Employment Protection Act, an employee is entitled to remain in his or her employment with full employment protection until the end of the month of his or her 67 th  birthday.</p>
<p>The major improvements in the health, cognitive capacity and education of older people gradually raises the age when, based on the best knowledge, natural ageing can be regarded, on average, as considerably reducing the work capacity of an older person. The increase in average life expectancy means that more and more people must also work after 67 in order to obtain an acceptable pension. Raising the age limit may help increase the labour supply among people of 67 or older.</p>
<p>There are, of course, some risks associated with raising the age limit, such as employers who may be inclined to terminate a job before an employee’s 65 th  birthday so as to avoid having too many people continuing to work until they are 69. These and other risks can be reduced if the rules for giving notice are modified. According to the Commission, the advantages of raising the age limit referred to in the Employment Protection Act outweigh any disadvantages:  It is proposed to raise the age limit applying to the Employment Protection Act to 69 in 2016.  The age limit will subsequently be adapted to the recommended retirement age.  If the employer wants an employee who has had his or her 69 th  birthday to leave the job, the employer must give the employee who is over 69 written notice of this at least one month beforehand. In the event of a changeover in operations, however, notice of termination of employment will apply, but in such cases, the employee will not be entitled to a notice period longer than a month and will have limited right of priority to re-employment.  An appropriate government agency should be tasked with following up the effects of abolishing the rules on notice of termination of employment.</p>
<p>Other age limits will be changed as a result</p>
<p>The age limits in related social systems are also important components in norm formation on when older people should be considered ready to leave working life. When the age limits of the pension system are gradually raised, it will be necessary to ensure that the age limits for insurance protection for people in gainful employment follow suit. Peculiar effects may otherwise arise when some systems are linked to the recommended retirement age, while others retain the 65-year age limit.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes that the age limit of 65 years in social insurance and related social benefits in normal cases be adjusted upwards in pace with the increase in average life expectancy. The age limits of 65 in other legislation should be adapted to the increase in average life expectancy in special procedures, if there is nothing to indicate otherwise:  The age limit for sickness compensation that is newly granted as of 2019, together with the age limit for sickness benefit qualifying income in the sickness insurance system, unemployment benefit, occupational injury life annuities, sickness benefit in special cases, maintenance support for elderly persons and the age limit for social security contributions will be adapted to the recommended retirement age, which according to the forecasts will be 66 in 2019.  Older provisions will apply to benefits in the form of sickness compensation and insurance cases that were decided or refer to the period before 2019.  Occupational aids and extended occupational life injury annuities will be linked to the age applying to the Employment Protection Act.  The continued right to protection of the sickness benefit qualifying income, the disability allowance, car support, unemployment benefit after the introduction of the recommended retirement age and coordination between pensions and unemployment benefits should be examined further.  Initiatives with regard to the attendance allowance should be followed up before a change in the age limit can be considered.</p>
<p>The 55-year age limit in the Income Tax Act is to be raised</p>
<p>Employer costs for pensions to employees are deductable under the Income Tax Act, provided that the pension is not disbursed earlier than at 55 years of age. Vocational pension agreements therefore normally have 55 years as the lowest age for drawing a pension. The same requirement applies to private pension savings.</p>
<p>The 55-year age limit in the Income Tax Act was introduced in 1951, when average life expectancy was much shorter, most employees had a low educational level, the age of entrance into working life was lower and the demands of working life different. Pension income that is deposited in funds within the framework of the provisions of the Income Tax Act is treated more favourably than other savings, in terms of taxes. According to the Commission, there is now no underlying reason to subsidise such an early exit from working life as 55 years. There are, moreover, few people who actually make use of this possibility to draw their pensions at 55. The age limit of 55 gives the wrong signal to the labour market, now that more older people need to work for longer. The Commission proposes that this age limit be raised:  It is proposed to raise the  55-year age limit in the Income Tax Act to 62 in 2017. This means that it will not be possible to disburse vocational pensions or private pensions to people who are younger than 62.  Special rules on exemptions will apply to certain private pension deposits and private pension savings and disbursements that have already begun.</p>
<h2>The consequences of the proposals</h2>
<p>The effects of these proposals will primarily depend on the labour market situation in which they are implemented. The Commission’s assessment is based on a labour market that is balanced in supply and demand. The effects may be considerably more rapid and greater if the measures are implemented at the same time as Sweden recovers from the economic downturn of recent years.</p>
<p>A higher retirement age extends working life</p>
<p>Evaluations of changes in retirement age in other countries indicate that the average age for drawing the old-age pension and the proportion of people remaining in the labour force rises by 20–50 per cent of the higher retirement age. Experience also shows that a certain amount of overflow to other social insurance systems may occur. With reasonable assumptions on the effect of increased age limits and overflow to other social insurance, the Commission considers that its proposals will considerably increase the labour supply among older people:  The number of people in the labour force between the ages of  60–70 is expected to increase by 40 000–50 000 people in 2020.  It is estimated that the dependency burden, i.e., the ratio between the number of people who are not employed of 15 years and older and the number of employed people will be stabilised to about 0,8 in about 2030.</p>
<p>Improved public finances</p>
<p>Even in the short term, public finances and the financial balance of the pension system will be strengthened as a result of a longer working life. Some of this income should be used to fund the Commission’s proposals for measures to promote a longer working life:  Public finances are expected to be strengthened by some SEK 100 million in 2015 and by SEK 3 700 million by 2020 as the median alternative.  The increased employment of older workers is estimated to have a levelling effect on the pension system’s balance during the years  2018-2030.  The costs of the Commission’s proposals for a better work environment, skills etc. are estimated at some SEK 200 million in 2015 and SEK 400 million in 2020.  The costs of extending the right to sickness benefit, unemployment benefits and other benefits are estimated at some SEK 100 million in 2015 and SEK 2 300 million in 2020.  The Commission also gives an account of the impact in a high and a low alternative.</p>
<p>The consequences for individuals</p>
<p>Increased employment is expected to increase disposable income among people between the ages of 60 and 70 by up to 18 percent in 2015–2019. Income distribution is expected to even out somewhat as a result of the fact that financial standards, in relative terms, will be raised for older people.</p>
<p>Typical case estimates show that an increased age limit for sickness benefits and unemployment benefits will improve financial standards for the people involved, both before and after retirement.</p>
<p>The regulatory amendments for guarantee pensioners means that one year more of gainful employment increases disposable income by some SEK 7 000 per year. With the current rules, continuing to work provides only marginally higher incomes.</p>
<p>Financial equality is considered to be positively affected, primarily through the proposal for guarantee pensions.</p>
<p>Other consequences</p>
<p>The proposed regulatory amendments will lead to some transitional costs for employers and companies, but they are considered to be modest. The Commission proposes a gradual introduction, which means that the administrative consequences for the agencies involved are considered to be manageable.</p>
<h2>Follow-up and evaluation</h2>
<p>Assessments of the proposals’ effects are uncertain. Some effects are less difficult to predict, such as the effects of raising the lower age limit for drawing the old-age pension. For these regulatory amendments, it is reasonable to assume a considerable impact on labour supply. The proposal on a recommended retirement age is more difficult to assess. There is no experience of similar proposals from other countries.</p>
<p>The proposed initiatives to improve the work environment, to strengthen opportunities for older people to preserve and develop their skills, increase information, etc. will contribute to a higher, actual retirement age. Several initiatives, however, will only take effect in the long term and others should be expected to have a modest impact.</p>
<p>This uncertainty means that it will be necessary for the package of measures to promote a longer working life to be carefully monitored and evaluated scientifically:</p>
<p> An expert group should lead efforts on  follow-up and evaluation.</p>
<p> This group should have the resources to assign tasks to agencies and researchers.</p>
<p> The main task is to follow up and present annual reports on the effects of the proposals on labour supply and public finances.</p>
<p> The task should also include following the distributional effects of the proposals, their consequences for the health and quality of life of older people and other social effects.</p>
<p>The different proposals of the Commission are interdependent. The funding of the Commission’s proposals on the work environment, etc. is conditional on older people working for longer as a result of the regulatory amendments. The increase in the age limit for sickness benefit, sickness compensation and other social benefits can only be funded if the introduction of a recommended retirement age significantly extends working life.</p>
<p>If the follow-ups and evaluations show that the measures to promote a longer working life do not lead to sufficient reinforcement of public finances, the Government should quickly examine more forceful measures to ensure a longer working life.</p>
