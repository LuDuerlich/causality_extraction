<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The assignment</h2>
<p>The Swedish Inquiry on Gambling has been assigned the task of proposing long-term sustainable Swedish gaming regulations. The assignment has included</p>
<p>• proposing a tightening and modernisation of gaming regulations with the purpose of strengthening the protective intentions on which Swedish gaming regulation is based,</p>
<p>• charting the extent to which certain types of gambling may be considered to provoke gaming addiction, with the most problematic types being permitted only under stringently regulated conditions, and</p>
<p>• to assess whether any considerations of EC law, or technical or other reasons would impede the tightening of current regulations and, in that case, to propose a partially new system including operators not currently covered.</p>
<p>The assignment has also included issues of care and treatment, as well as research on gambling addiction.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>What questions and issues does the current regulations face?</p>
<p>Sweden's lottery market is regulated and operators are limited to the government, equestrian sports operators and non-governmental organisations. The business community is, in principle, excluded from lottery operations and the proceeds from lotteries are reserved for public purposes and those serving the common good.</p>
<p>The changes in Sweden and further afield that have affected Swedish lottery regulations since the 1990s primarily involve Sweden's accession to the EU in 1995 and the growth of the Internet.</p>
<p>Technical developments involving the Internet mean that about 2,000 foreign websites are accessible for monetary gambling. This trend has entailed gaming from Sweden on foreign websites, with the consequence that it has not been possible to uphold the protecttive intentions of Swedish lottery regulations.</p>
<p>Sweden's accession to the EU entailed EC law becoming applicable in Sweden. Lotteries are not harmonised under EC law, but are, instead, subject to national regulations in all 27 EU member countries. In a number of cases, the European Court of Justice has tested issues of agreement between national regulations and EC law. The agreement of the Swedish Lotteries Act (1994:1000) with EC law has been questioned by, among others, the European Commission in two ongoing encroachment cases against Sweden.</p>
<p>Against the background of the current structure of Swedish gaming regulations and the prerequisites indicated in the directives for future gaming regulations, the Swedish Inquiry on Gambling has been required to consider a number of issues of principle when preparing its proposals.</p>
<p>Issues of principle</p>
<p>Firstly  Inquiry shall propose a partially new lottery system, in which it shall be possible for new operators to secure permits. Historically, Swedish gaming policy has been based on the government playing a highly active role in gambling, as legislator, gaming regulator and owner of gambling operators, while all surplus proceeds have been reserved for public purposes and those serving the common good. According to its directives, the Inquiry shall propose which forms of gambling could be opened up to new operators. To determine which forms of gambling could be opened up in this way, the Inquiry's directives require it to chart the most problematic forms of gambling from the point of view of gambling addiction, with the intention that these be controlled within government-owned gaming monopolies, and to take into consideration technical developments and the international competition that exists in Internet gaming, as well as the requirements of EC law. Each component issue mentioned above has been subject to assessment by the Inquiry.</p>
<p>Secondly , proposals shall agree well with EC law. Lotteries are not harmonised under EC law and each EU member country has its own national gaming regulations. The requirements imposed by EC law on national regulations have been tested by the European Court of Justice in several rulings.</p>
<p>Thirdly , the Inquiry's proposals shall not lead to increased gambling. This issue is not addressed further in the directives. The Swedish Inquiry on Gambling has assessed this issue as follows. One of the purposes of a partially new permit system with new operators is for gambling currently conducted through foreign websites to be channelled through operators with permits for organised gaming in Sweden. According to the Swedish Inquiry on Gambling Commission, a basic condition for being able to propose a partially new system on a national basis is that new operators be protected from competition from those not subject to the same requirements. This would probably entail a sharpening of the promotion ban included in the current Lotteries Act. This may lead to increased sales in the regulated Swedish gaming market. The Inquiry does not feel that such an increase would conflict with the directives' requirement that gambling should not increase.</p>
<p>Fourthly , according to the directives, the foundations of the current gaming regulations shall serve as a pattern in developing new regulations. Current regulations are based on the prohibitionary Lotteries Act building on the principle that all lotteries in Sweden require permits and that all permits are subject to public control. The foundations of the Act also build on its purpose to counteract crime and social and economic damage, to safeguard consumer protection interests and to channel surplus proceeds from gaming to public purposes and those that serve the common good. In addition, permission to organise lotteries may only be granted to government and government-controlled companies and non-profit organisations that serve the common good. Consequently, these foundations include the Lotteries Act being based on exclusive rights. Finally, the Lotteries Act is limited to Sweden as a country and includes a ban on the promotion of foreign gambling, among other things.</p>
<p>Fifth , the Inquiry shall propose framework legislation for lotteries. Historically, detailed rules in Swedish gaming regulations have been governed by legislation. Framework legislation requires that issues are largely delegated from the Riksdag to the government and its authorities. Framework lottery legislation meeting demands for efficient control requires that responsibility be largely delegated to a supervisory authority.</p>
<p>Sixth , the directives affirm that efficient supervision is of great importance for future regulation. Historically, the government has been the permitting authority for the national and government-controlled gambling companies (Svenska Spel and ATG). The supervision of these companies is conducted by the Swedish Gaming Board (Lotteriinspektionen). One requirement for efficient supervision involves effective possibilities for sanctions against operators. In achieving efficient supervision, it is also therefore necessary to address the issue of a new permit and supervision model.</p>
<p>These six particular conditions, which the Inquiry on Gambling has been required to take into account, illustrate the complexity of its task.</p>
<p>What approach did the Inquiry on Gambling take?</p>
<p>In taking a stance regarding the directives' prerequisites for future gaming regulations, the Inquiry on Gambling has found that these prerequisites can be summarised in the following four questions. 1. Which of the foundations on which Swedish gaming regulations are based should continue to serve as a model? 2. What requirements does EC law impose on national regulations? 3. What forms of gambling are most troublesome from the point of view of gambling addiction and should therefore be limited to monopoly operators? 4. What are the implications of technical developments in the area and do these or other factors necessitate the proposal of a new license model?</p>
<p>The Inquiry on Gambling also ascertained that by answering these four questions, it would address all of the prerequisites stated in its directives. The answers to these questions will thus form the basis for the standpoints adopted vis–à–vis future regulations.</p>
<p>As is clear from the questions, the answers are interdependent. In part, the answer to questions 1 and 2 could be that the regulations basically agree with EC law, but also, in part, that they do not. The answers to questions 3 and 4 could be that additional forms of gambling should be brought under monopoly operations or that this should only apply to certain forms, affecting what is subject to licensing. The standpoints to be adopted by the Inquiry on Gambling will be dependent on future political stances.</p>
<p>How did the Inquiry on Gambling answer the questions?</p>
<p>Following the examination and assessment of all prerequisites in the directives, the Inquiry on Gambling has adopted the following standpoints in relation to the four questions.</p>
<p>Questions 1 and 2 : In the assessment of the Swedish Inquiry on Gambling, the foundations of current gaming regulations are in agreement with EC law and may therefore serve as a model for future gaming regulations. From this, it follows that Swedish regulations, based on exclusive rights, can continue to be considered compatible with EC law.</p>
<p>Question 3 : In the assessment of the Swedish Inquiry on Gambling, the most problematic forms of gambling covered by current lottery regulations are automatic gaming machines, casino games and interactive Internet gambling (Internet poker, Internet bingo and Internet scratch cards).</p>
<p>Question 4:  The Swedish Inquiry on Gambling affirms that new technology entails international competition in Internet gambling and that approximately 2,000 foreign websites can be accessed for monetary gambling. The technological trend brings with it a problem of control for Swedish gaming regulations, with gaming on foreign websites beyond public control. As a result, it is not possible to maintain the protective intentions of the Swedish gaming regulations.</p>
<p>Given the above-stated assessments regarding the foundations of current gaming regulations and the requirements of EC law on national regulations, the Inquiry on Gambling has found that Swedish gaming regulations may be considered compatible with the requirements of EC law.</p>
<p>The Inquiry on Gambling was also required to take into account how future regulations should confront the issues of control faced by current regulations when gambling on foreign websites takes place beyond the control of Swedish law.</p>
<p>The Swedish Inquiry on Gambling has identified three possible courses of action to choose between for future gaming regulations.</p>
<h2>Three alternatives for future regulations</h2>
<p>• Alternative 1  entails maintaining and tightening current gaming regulations.</p>
<p>• Alternative 2  entails opening up Internet gaming to new operators.</p>
<p>• Alternative 3  entails opening up a certain form of gaming to new operators.</p>
<p>The Inquiry on Gambling has assessed the different alternatives as follows:</p>
<p>Alternative 1</p>
<p>The Inquiry on Gambling has found that the foundations of the current gaming regulations, that is, both their objectives and purposes, are in agreement with EC law. Against this background, it is the assessment of the Inquiry on Gambling that EC law does not require the Swedish gaming market to be opened to new operators. However, maintaining existing regulations would require a restricttive gaming policy with the overarching objective of counteracting gambling addiction and criminality.</p>
<p>Alternative 2</p>
<p>The technological trend and the Internet entail international competition in Internet gaming, with the prominent forms of gambling being Internet casinos, Internet poker, Internet bingo and betting with odds. The technical trend has brought with it a problem of control for Swedish gaming regulations.</p>
<p>Taking into account only the technological trend and Internet gambling, and consequently the issue of international competition, one might consider tackling the control issues that have arisen by opening up Internet gambling to new operators.</p>
<p>As is apparent from the directives, however, the most problematic forms of gambling shall be restricted to the most controlled formats. In the assessment of the Inquiry on Gambling, the most problematic forms of gambling include automatic gambling machines,</p>
<p>Internet casino and interactive games (Internet poker, Internet bingo and Internet scratch cards).</p>
<p>Permitting new operators of Internet-based forms of gambling would require Internet poker and Internet bingo, at least, to be opened for licensing. In the Inquiry on Gambling's assessment of its directives, one of the basic requirements for the Inquiry is that the most problematic forms of gambling should be subject to the strictest control. Given the Inquiry on Gambling's assessment that interactive Internet-based forms on gambling (including Internet poker) should be included among the most problematic forms, the Inquiry finds no reason to propose that Internet gambling be opened for licensing.</p>
<p>Alternative 3</p>
<p>An alternative approach in confronting the issue of uncontrolled gambling on foreign websites could be to open up one type of gambling to new operators.</p>
<p>Given the combined prerequisites of the directives to be taken into account in the assessment of what forms of gambling could be opened to new operators, the Inquiry on Gambling has found that betting on sports competitions, the Swedish selection rounds to the Eurovision Song Contest and the Eurovision Song Contest itself are the Internetbased forms of gambling that could be opened. However, the Inquiry on Gambling has found that such an opening would be too limited to be attractive to new operators. Since a broader opening of Internet gambling is out of the question given the Inquiry on Gambling's assessment of the most problematic forms of gambling, the Inquiry has instead considered whether any form of gambling should be opened up for new operators, including betting agents.</p>
<p>The Inquiry on Gambling has found that the form of gambling that could be considered for licensing in a partially new permit system is betting (odds and pools), with the exception of betting on horse racing, and that it should be possible to provide this form of gambling through betting agents and via the Internet.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry on Gambling's choice of alternative</h2>
<p>In reviewing the directives' three directions for future gaming regulations, the conclusion is that there are two alternative choices for future gaming regulations – to retain the current system, or to open up one form of gambling.</p>
<p>Since the choice of model is based on political standpoints, the Inquiry on Gambling has elected to present two alternative proposals for future gaming regulations.</p>
<p>Alternative 1</p>
<p>This alternative involves retaining and tightening current gaming regulations. According to this alternative, no proposal is made to open the market for new operators. However, maintaining existing regulations would require a gaming policy with the overarching objective of counteracting gaming dependency and criminality. These requirements, stipulated by the government in its directives to the Inquiry on Gambling, form the basis of the proposal presented for new gaming regulations.</p>
<p>Alternative 2</p>
<p>To confront the problem of uncontrolled gambling on foreign websites, a second alternative should also be considered. This suggests opening up for new operators. Permits shall cover betting (odds and pools), with the exception of betting on horse races. Permits would convey rights to provide these forms of gambling at betting agencies or via the Internet. The partially new permit model would be regulated through the new Lotteries Act proposed by the Inquiry. The purpose of the new Lotteries Act and other regulations would thereby also cover the new operators. According to the new Lotteries Act, a ceiling would be set on winnings for all forms of gambling, for example.</p>
<p>It is the assessment of the Inquiry on Gambling that a basic requirement for being able to propose a license system for the business community on a national basis is that licensees be afforded protection within the national system. Proposing a national system in which certain forms of gambling are opened to the business community would require legislation, as far as possible, to guarantee the national market. Proposing a national license while also allowing foreign gambling companies with permits from other countries to offer gambling via the Internet would not serve any purpose. Under such conditions, there would be no incentive to apply for a license in Sweden if licensing conditions are more favourable in another country. Consequently, in the Inquiry on Gambling's assessment of the situation, the ban on promotion included in the legislation (38 § Lotteries Act) must be made more effective.</p>
<h2>Future gaming regulations</h2>
<p>For gaming regulations to be sustainable in the long term, they must be in agreement with EC law and the implementation of the government's gaming policy must be feasible.</p>
<p>In the view of the Inquiry on Gambling, gaming regulations that are sustainable in the long term should necessitate new lottery legislation building on the basic structure of the current Lotteries Act, thereby verifying the agreement of the regulations with EC law (High Administrative Court 2004 ref. 95). A new Lotteries Act should be supplemented with provisions designed to strengthen the protective intentions of the Act, such as marketing rules, age limits, statutory regulation of the public and government-controlled companies and a new permit and supervisory organisation.</p>
<p>The new Lotteries Act should be reworked as framework legislation with a clear division of responsibilities between the Riksdag, the government and the supervisory authority. The Act should state all principal regulations for lotteries, while the government should assume responsibility for gaming policy by means of instructions in the form of an ordinance. It is proposed that the name of the Swedish Gaming Board (Lotteriinspektionen) be changed to the Swedish Gaming Market Supervisory Authority (Spelmarknadsinspektionen) and that it be given a clear role as the permit and supervisory authority for all lotteries in Sweden requiring permits. Consequently, the new framework legislation will also regulate permit allocations for new operators.</p>
<p>According to the new Act, the most problematic forms of gambling will be restricted to Svenska Spel, these being casino games, automatic gaming machines and interactive games. Consequently, non-governmental organisations will no longer have opportunities to organise interactive games on the Internet. No other changes are proposed in the current division of the market between Swedish operators.</p>
<p>As its second alternative, the Inquiry on Gambling proposes a partially new model for the allocation of permits according to which businesses may also obtain licenses.</p>
<p>This model shall cover betting (odds and pools), with the exception of betting on horse races, both via the Internet and at betting agencies. According to this proposal, Sweden would open up for new operators to organise betting in a national market. The objective of opening up for new operators is to channel gambling to forms that are subject to Swedish permits and control. For it to be possible to propose such an opening, the Inquiry on Gambling stipulates that this be on the condition that the promotions ban included in the Lotteries Act be tightened. Otherwise, it will not be possible to achieve the objectives of the government's policy. Necessary additional restrictions would include blocking IP addresses and domain names for lotteries not organised in accordance with the Lotteries Act, and blocking payment services for stakes in such lotteries.</p>
<p>With this proposal, the Inquiry on Gambling makes the assessment that Svenska Spel should no longer conduct the forms of gambling opened up to other operators.</p>
<p>Maintaining existing regulations (Alternative 1) would require a gaming policy with the overarching objective of counteracting gambling addiction and criminality.</p>
<p>According to the prerequisites stated in the directives for the Inquiry and that will be accounted for below, the proposals included in alternatives 1 and 2 are largely equal except as they regard the partially new system. Consequently, the report contains one legislation proposal and outlines one solution. In the event that the government decides to proceed by retaining the current system, this can be achieved by implementing all chapters except chapter 15, which deals with the opening up the market to new operators. The responsibilities covered in chapter 15 would instead remain with Svenska Spel.</p>
<h2>The proposals in more detail</h2>
<p>Alternative 1</p>
<p>A new Lotteries Act – framework legislation</p>
<p>Introduction of a new Lotteries Act. This Act would be based on the current Lotteries Act, albeit reworked as framework legislation. All monetary gambling shall be statutorily regulated by the new Act. The practical legal solution is based on a clear division of responsibility between the Riksdag, the government and authorities.</p>
<p>All principle provisions regarding lotteries are to be stated in the Act. The Act would delegate to the government a broadened mandate to implement gaming policy by means of instructions in the form of ordinances. It is also proposed that authorities be given increased regulatory powers.</p>
<p>A partially new permit system for new operators would also be regulated by the new Lotteries Act.</p>
<p>Statutory regulation of national and government-controlled companies</p>
<p>The operations of the government-controlled companies (Svenska Spel and ATG) are regulated by the Act. The government would lose its opportunity to allocate permits with the support of 45 § of the Lotteries Act.</p>
<p>New permit and supervisory authority</p>
<p>A new model for supervision and the allocation of permits would be introduced. All allocations of permits and supervision of lotteries would be centralised to a single authority, the Swedish Gaming Board (Lotteriinspektionen), whose name is proposed to be changed to the Swedish Gaming Market Supervisory Authority (Spelmarknadsinspektionen).</p>
<p>The role of the county administrative boards as a supervisory authority would cease. The role of the municipalities as the supervisory authority for local lotteries would also cease. However, the municipalities' role as the registration authority for local lotteries would be a requirement.</p>
<p>Allocation of permits to non-government organisations</p>
<p>The consideration of whether a lottery may be assumed to provide applicants with reasonable surplus proceeds shall be made taking applicants' total lottery operations into account.</p>
<p>Opportunities for non-government organisations to organise lotteries and registration lotteries should be expanded.</p>
<p>Marketing rules</p>
<p>New general marketing rules shall be introduced. Accordingly, moderations shall be observed in all marketing of lotteries. Marketing may not particularly target or feature children or young people below the age of 25. It shall not be permitted to market interactive games and gambling on automatic gaming machines at all.</p>
<p>Age limit</p>
<p>A general age limit of 18 is proposed for participation in lotteries. Where there is special cause, it shall be possible to grant exceptions to this ban.</p>
<p>Agent permits</p>
<p>Agents assigned lottery sales shall be required to hold a special permit. To receive such a permit, agents are required to be suitable for conducting such operations.</p>
<p>In principle, permits may not be allocated to agents whose business operations hold permits to serve strong beer, wines or spirits in accordance with the Alcoholic Beverages Act (1994:1738).</p>
<p>Preventative measures required</p>
<p>Lottery organisers and agents shall undertake certain measures to prevent gaming dependency. Firstly, information on the risks of gambling shall be provided. Secondly, lottery organisers shall, among other measures, develop action plans to counteract risks associated with gambling.</p>
<p>Gaming security</p>
<p>The government or its assigned authority shall communicate instructions regarding requirements for technical equipment used by organisers for their lotteries.</p>
<p>Sanctions</p>
<p>The sanctions system is to be made more efficient. Here it can be mentioned that injunctions and bans associated with fines shall take immediate effect unless otherwise decided. In addition, in connection with infractions of the Lotteries Act, the Swedish Gaming Market Supervisory Authority shall be able to combine a reprimand or warning with a fine. Furthermore, the Authority shall be able to impose fines on permit holders who are late in submitting details required by the Authority.</p>
<p>Specific to automatic gaming machines</p>
<p>To be able to combat illegal automatic gaming machines more effectively, a new definition of such devices is to be introduced.</p>
<p>Expert council on gaming dependency</p>
<p>Against the background of the Swedish Gaming Market Supervisory Authority's new duties, an advisory expert council on gaming dependency is to be established under the Authority's auspices.</p>
<p>Governance</p>
<p>The governance of AB Svenska Spel by its owners shall become more active by utilising the opportunities conveyed by the rules that apply to that type of corporate structure.</p>
<p>Alternative 2</p>
<p>Practical legal solution</p>
<p>It is proposed that the new Lotteries Act include a partially new permit model for certain lotteries. A permit system would be introduced whereby the basic requirements for securing a permit would be stated in the Lotteries Act.</p>
<p>What forms of gambling should licenses cover?</p>
<p>Permits shall cover betting (odds and pools), with the exception of betting on horse races.</p>
<p>One type of permit shall be allocated. Permits would convey rights to provide these forms of gambling at betting agencies or via the Internet.</p>
<p>Number of permits</p>
<p>No limit on the number of permits is proposed.</p>
<p>Permit authority</p>
<p>The permit allocation process and the supervision of a new permit model shall be the responsibility of the Swedish Gaming Market Supervisory Authority.</p>
<p>What requirements will be imposed?</p>
<p>A general condition is that permits to organise lotteries may only be allocated if it can be assumed that operations will be conducted in a healthy and safe manner  and generally in accordance with the regulations in the Lotteries Act and other ordinances regulating operations.</p>
<p>Particular requirements shall apply regarding applicants' suitability to conduct operations. Applicants shall be required to demonstrate that they are suitable to conduct such operations with regard to their personal, financial and other conditions. For companies, this assessment shall include the president and others with a decisive influence over operations.</p>
<p>In addition, gambling organisers shall identify, steer, report on and maintain control over the risks with which their gambling operations are associated. In this regard, gambling organisers shall ensure satisfactory internal control. Furthermore, gambling organisers' operations shall be conducted in such a way that it is possible to gain an overview of their structure, connections with other companies and positions.</p>
<p>In the new framework legislation substantial power of regulation will be delegated to the government or the Swedish Gaming Market Supervisory Authority. It shall be possible for the Swedish Gaming Market Supervisory Authority to issue a set of rules and regulations regarding the allocation of permits.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the government or its assigned authority be empowered to determine requirements for different forms of gambling, payment of winnings and other requirements on the organisation of betting.</p>
<p>Requirements for limited companies</p>
<p>Permits may only be allocated to a limited company or equivalent that is headquartered in the EES area.</p>
<h2>Other</h2>
<p>Tightened ban on promotions</p>
<p>The ban on promotions in the new Lotteries Act should be complemented in part by a regulation banning the mediation of stakes in unlawful lotteries, that is, such monetary transactions may be stopped by means of the retail codes used in the electronic card payment system and, in part by a regulation stating that communications companies may not mediate communications from their customers to domain names and IP addresses used for unlawful gambling services.</p>
<p>Taxes</p>
<p>Possible new operators in the Swedish gaming and lottery market shall for taxation purposes be covered by the Lottery Tax Act.</p>
<p>The current general exemption from lottery tax for government-owned gambling companies is to be abolished.</p>
<p>Poker</p>
<p>It is proposed that physical poker tournaments not be permitted.</p>
<p>Care and treatment</p>
<p>It is the view of the Swedish Inquiry on Gambling that it is not currently possible to assign responsibility for particular care and treatment of gaming dependency to the municipalities.</p>
<p>The Swedish Inquiry on Gambling concludes that, as a partial long-term solution, the National Institute of Public Health be awarded grants as partial financing for the development of evidencebased programs of care and treatment.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the National Institute of Public Health, in consultation with the National Board of Health and Welfare, the Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care (SBU) and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions, be given the task of</p>
<p>• supporting the development of programs for the care, treatment and other support for people addicted to gambling,</p>
<p>• establishing a national register of organisers of such operations,</p>
<p>• developing a plan for the evaluation of all care, treatment and other forms of support currently offered to gambling addicts in Sweden, and</p>
<p>• subsequently enter the evaluations made in the register.</p>
<p>Research</p>
<p>The Swedish Gaming Market Supervisory Authority should be given a special assignment to initiate research in particular areas (commissioned research), evaluate applications and allocate funds to others for research (basic research) of relevance to the Swedish gaming market.</p>
<h2>Financing</h2>
<p>The proposals of the Swedish Inquiry on Gambling entail a decrease in the government's revenues and an increase in its costs. Like earlier commissions, the Inquiry on Gambling proposes that the difference be absorbed by the government.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>The proposals of the Inquiry on Gambling require the develop- ment of attendant legislation. It is judged that these, like the pro- posals of the Inquiry on Gambling, must be announced in accordance with EU directive 98/34, and, accordingly, it is estimated that it will be possible for the new gaming regulations to enter into force on 1 January 2011.</p>
