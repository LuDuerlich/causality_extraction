<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>In its report, the Inquiry presents proposals for the legislative amendments and other measures that will be needed when the European Athens Regulation on the liability of carriers of passengers by sea in the event of accidents enters into force on 31 December 2012. The Inquiry has also produced material for the assessment of whether Sweden should accede to the Athens Convention relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea, which was drawn up within the United Nations International Maritime Organisation.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Athens Regulation and the Athens Convention is to strengthen the position of passengers when travelling by sea through provisions on the carrier’s liability and insurance obligation, among other things. The Convention has mostly been incorporated into EU law through the Regulation.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes amendments and additions to the Swedish Maritime Code, the Ship Safety Act and the Ship Safety Ordinance, to the effect that ships must be insured or that there must be some other security for the carrier’s obligations, and that the captain must carry a certificate of this on board the ship. The Inquiry proposes that Chapter 15 of the Swedish Maritime Code concerning the transport of passengers be amended and reorganised.</p>
<h2>Scope of application of the Athens Regulation</h2>
<p>All domestic transport by sea of passengers and luggage should be covered by the new rules</p>
<p>The Athens Regulation is to apply to international maritime transport and also transport in one Member State only on ships belonging to classes A and B. The Athens Regulation leaves it to the Member States to determine whether the Regulation should also apply to all domestic maritime transport, which in practice means ships of classes C and D. In Sweden, the waters are divided into an additional transport area – transport area E.</p>
<p>The Inquiry believes that it is crucial to strengthen the position of passengers and to maintain, as far as possible, a uniform level of protection and a coherent regulatory framework. The archipelago traffic in transport areas D and E carries between 35 and 40 million passengers each year. This means that a large number of passengers will be covered by the strengthened rights if the Regulation’s provisions are made to apply to all domestic traffic. The costs of carriers’ insurance premiums would probably increase as a result, which gives rise to concerns, as the ships that operate in transport areas C–D are mainly owned and run by smaller carriers with limited economic resources. Moreover, the traffic in these transport areas is largely seasonal, such as archipelago traffic. Weighing up the various interests, the Inquiry finds that the passengers’ needs for strengthened rights outweigh the consequences that increased costs may have for a number of carriers. The Inquiry therefore proposes that the provisions of the Athens Regulation apply to all domestic carriers of passengers by sea, i.e. ships of classes C, D and E.</p>
<p>Transport of a maximum of twelve passengers – exemptions from the insurance requirement</p>
<p>The Athens Regulation only covers passenger ships, i.e. ships that are permitted to carry more than twelve passengers. The Inquiry proposes that the compensation provisions in the Athens Regulation also apply to such ships under Swedish law. However, the Inquiry proposes that there be an exemption from the insurance requirement(see Article 4a of the Athens Convention).</p>
<p>Weighing up the various interests, passengers’ interests do apply to the same extent even if a small number of people are being transported. However, it can be assumed that the smallest carriers are particularly sensitive to the increased costs caused by an insurance obligation. In other contexts too, certain requirements may be waived for ships that can carry up to twelve people. This applies primarily with regard to supervision and security as the ships are small, travel in waters close to the coast and carry a small number of passengers. It is also difficult to estimate how many ships of this kind are used in traffic within Sweden’s borders. According to what the Inquiry has learnt, a very rough estimate would be 1 000–1 500 ships, perhaps more, that offer passenger traffic. The fact that this is a relatively large number of ships means that the supervisory bodies would face very difficult problems if they were to carry out effective checks – within their current framework of operations – to ensure that these ships had insurance certificates. The Inquiry therefore finds that it is not possible to require of ships that are permitted to carry a maximum of twelve passengers that they be insured in line with the Athens Regulation. However, there are no grounds for making concessions with regard to the basic provisions on liability amounts, advance payments, information or compensation for disabled people’s technical aids and for medical equipment in the Athens Regulation. Such an arrangement is certainly not entirely logical, as the point of the insurance obligation is to guarantee the right of passengers to compensation, but in the Inquiry’s view it entails a reasonable balance between the various legitimate interests.</p>
<p>Application to ships of classes A and B should not be postponed</p>
<p>Under the Athens Regulation, the Member States may also opt to postpone the application of the Regulation with regard to ships belonging to classes A and B. The Inquiry considers that the application of the Regulation should not be postponed as it is important that improved protection for passengers enter into force as soon as possible. Nor have any circumstances come to light during the course of the Inquiry’s work to indicate that this option should be used. Class A and B ships should thus be covered by the Athens Regulation from the day on which the Regulation begins to apply.</p>
<h2>Limitation of carriers’ liability</h2>
<p>The right of passengers to damages for personal injury and material damage is regulated in the Athens Regulation. Under the Regulation, carriers have a strict liability to pay compensation for personal injury up to 250 000 SDR, whereas liability in the event of errors or negligence is limited to 400 000 SDR. However, Member States may deviate from the provisions in the Regulation and maintain national rules on liability limitation if these provisions implement the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims. In Sweden, the rules contained in the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims have been implemented in Chapter 9 of the Swedish Maritime Code, and under these provisions, the liability of carriers for personal injury is limited to 175 000 SDR. Both the Regulation and the Convention provide the Member States with the freedom to increase the limitation amount for personal injury.</p>
<p>During the course of the Inquiry’s work, no major problems with the current regulations in Chapter 9 of the Swedish Maritime Code have come to light. The Inquiry therefore proposes that Sweden maintain this regulation, which also means that the overall scope of application of the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims is maintained.</p>
<p>Compensation for personal injury to a ship’s own passengers is currently limited to 175 000 SDR (Chapter 9, Section 5, point 1 of the Swedish Maritime Code). From the limited data to which the Inquiry has had access, it is clear that the current compensation levels are fully adequate for most incidents at sea. However, for major maritime accidents, Chapter 9 of the Swedish Maritime Code may limit the compensation due to passengers or their surviving relatives under the Athens Regulation. This suggests that the limitation amount should be raised. The limitation amount in Chapter 9 of the Swedish Maritime Code was established 16 years ago and cannot be considered to be in line with current requirements; this is illustrated by international efforts to increase (or remove) liability limits. The limit of 400 000 SDR in the Athens Convention was negotiated within the IMO, which means that individual countries should basically not apply other limits unless there are strong arguments for doing so. Uniform application within the EU and the States Parties to the Athens Convention is very important for both carriers and passengers and counteracts the lack of legal certainty for the injured party if a trip involves several countries and different compensation levels in different countries concerned in one and the same trip. An increase of the limitation amount to 400 000 SDR would also mean that the right of passengers to compensation under the Athens Regulation would be strengthened as it cannot be limited by a lower limitation amount under Chapter 9 of the Swedish Maritime Code. The Inquiry therefore proposes that the limitation amount in Chapter 9, Section 5, point 1 be increased to 400 000 SDR.</p>
<h2>Certification</h2>
<p>Under the Athens Regulation, a Member State may choose between allowing an authority or a recognised institution or organisation to establish that the insurance requirements have been met or some other financial security has been provided and to issue certificates for ships that meet the requirements. The ships that may apply for a certificate are Swedish passenger ships, passenger ships owned or used by the Swedish state and that are used exclusively for state purposes, and foreign ships that are not registered in any Member State.</p>
<p>Finansinspektionen (the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority) has been entrusted with the task of checking insurance or security and issuing certificates under Chapter 10 of the Swedish Maritime Code (certification for the transport of persistent mineral oil in bulk). There are many similarities between the task of establishing that the requirements for insurance or financial security have been met and issuing certificates under the Athens Regulation and under Chapter 10 of the Swedish Maritime Code. When issuing certificates under the Athens Regulation, an assessment must be made of the insurance commitment and whether the insurance company or security provider can be accepted as an insurance provider. This raises issues concerning the technical details of the insurance. Finansinspektionen has knowledge and experience of dealing with such issues. In the Inquiry’s view, the fact that Finansinspektionen currently deals with these types of matters under Chapter 10 of the Swedish Maritime Code, that its staff already have the necessary competence and well-established routines, that the costs are lower if similar responsibilities are coordinated in one place and that it is easier to calculate what fees to charge and keep an overview of this at one agency, are all factors in favour of entrusting Finansinspektionen with this task and not any other authority or recognised institution or organisation. In light of this, the Inquiry proposes that Finansinspektionen be appointed the competent authority to deal with certification under the Athens Regulation.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the costs of certification should be covered by the applicant – the carrier – by charging a fee that covers Finansinspektionen’s costs for processing certification matters. The Inquiry proposes that Finansinspektionen be authorised to issue more detailed regulations concerning certification and fees for the examination of certificate applications under the Athens Regulation. The Inquiry considers that the provisions of the Athens Regulation concerning certification should be supplemented.</p>
<h2>It must be established that the carrier has insurance</h2>
<p>Under the Athens Regulation, Member States must ensure, through their national legislation, that all ships approved to carry more than twelve passengers – regardless of state of registration – that call at or leave ports within their territory are insured or have some other financial security covering the ship’s liability for personal injury up to 250 000 SDR per passenger and incident. An insurance certificate must also be carried on board the ship. Each Member State thus has an obligation to ensure that the rules of EU law are implemented in an effective way. To achieve effective implementation, the Inquiry proposes sanctions when obligations are not met.</p>
<p>The obligation to insure the ship lies with the carrier, whereas the Regulation does not state which subject should be made responsible for carrying the certificate on board. The obligations of the captain under Chapter 6 of the Swedish Maritime Code are very similar to the obligation to carry a certificate on the ship, and the captain has the corresponding obligation under Chapter 10 of the Swedish Maritime Code. Therefore, in order to effectively ensure that the certificate is carried on board the ship, the Inquiry proposes that this obligation lie with the captain.</p>
<p>In light of the tasks of the Swedish Transport Agency under Chapter 10 of the Swedish Maritime Code and in accordance with the Inquiry’s proposals on the implementation of the Insurance Directive (see annex 5 ), the Swedish Transport Agency should be given the task of exercising supervision  under the Athens Regulation as well.</p>
<p>Supervision of foreign ships is carried out through inspection  and the control of certificates on board Swedish ships is also conducted though this unplanned supervisory procedure. The Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Transport Agency check, during an inspection, that all passenger ships entering or leaving ports in Swedish territorial waters have met the obligation to take out and maintain insurance or some other financial security. Inspections are to be limited to checking the ship’s certificate, unless there are reasonable grounds to assume that the insurance or security deviate considerably from the information on the certificate. The Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Transport Agency have the freedom in certain cases not to carry out checks concerning the insurance obligation.</p>
<p>Prohibition of use  is a sanction that has serious economic consequences for the carrier as the ship remains in port and it cannot continue its activities. The risk of having a prohibition of use imposed would thus provide the carrier with strong economic incentives to ensure that the ship meets the requirements concerning insurance or security, and that the certificate is carried on board. For this reason, the Inquiry proposes that a prohibition of use may be imposed on passenger ships that enter or leave ports in Swedish territorial waters if the ship lacks insurance or other financial security or if there is no certificate under the Athens Regulation on board.</p>
<p>A prohibition to enter a Swedish port is another effective sanction that represents an obstacle to transporting passengers by ship in Swedish territorial waters. This sanction would thus be an economic motive for carriers of foreign ships to fulfil their obligations under the Athens Regulation. In light of the fact that a ban on entering a Swedish port would effectively counter carriers not fulfilling their obligations, the Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Transport Agency ban ships not bearing the Swedish flag from entering a Swedish port if the carrier has not fulfilled its obligations to take out and maintain insurance or some other financial security for the ship. The same should apply if no certificate under the Athens Regulation is carried on board the ship. In line with Chapter 6, Sections 5 and 7 of the Ship Safety Act, the Government or the authority designated by the Government will be able to ban Swedish ports from receiving ships that have not fulfilled their obligation to have insurance, security or a certificate under the Athens Regulation.</p>
<p>Further, the Inquiry proposes that it be possible for a carrier that has not fulfilled its obligation to take out and maintain insurance or some other security, and a captain who has not taken on board a certificate under the Athens Regulation, to be sentenced to a penalty . The Inquiry considers that the provision in Chapter 8, Section 1 of the Ship Safety Act applies to those who intentionally or through negligence breach a prohibition imposed by the supervisory authority to enter a port due to failure to meet the obligation to take out and maintain insurance or some other security or to carry a certificate on board under the Athens Regulation.</p>
<p>As a supplement to the proposed provisions for implementing the Insurance Directive (see annex 5 ), the Inquiry proposes that a prohibition of use may be imposed on a ship that is not covered by insurance or other financial security or if the ship is not carrying on board any proof of insurance or financial security in line with Chapter 7, Sections 2 and 3 of the Swedish Maritime Code.</p>
<h2>A special electronic register of certificates under the Athens Regulation should not be established</h2>
<p>Under the Athens Regulation, a Member State may opt not to require that a ship entering or leaving a port within its territory must carry a certificate on board if the state instead keeps an electronic register of certificates issued that is available to all Member States.</p>
<p>There are several advantages of being able to check certificates via an electronic register. For carriers, such a system would mean that they would not need to carry a certificate on board the ship. For the supervisory authority too, it would be a more practical system if the checking of certificates did not necessarily need to be done on board the ship.</p>
<p>When conducting an inspection, the supervisory authority normally checks various different types of certificate on board a ship. Even if an electronic register of certificates under the Athens Regulation were introduced, the supervisory authority would still be obliged to go on board to check the other certificates that have to be carried on a ship. In order for the advantages of an electronic register to be fully exploited, the supervisory authority should therefore also be able to check other certificates via an electronic register. The Inquiry therefore considers that, at the current time, no special electronic register of certificates issued in line with the Athens Regulation should be established.</p>
<h2>A partly new and reorganised Chapter 15 of the Swedish Maritime Code</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a partly new and reorganised Chapter 15 of the Swedish Maritime Code. The changes are mainly linked to the Athens Regulation, which is to apply from 31 December 2012. It is proposed that the provisions that contain supplementary rules to the Athens Regulation with regard to the Regulation’s scope of application, captains’ obligations, competent authorities for certification and supervision, and sanctions in connection with the obligation of the carrier to provide information be incorporated into Chapter 15 of the Swedish Maritime Code (new Sections 17–22). This would mean that the current sections of Chapter 15 of the Swedish Maritime Code would be renumbered.</p>
<p>The Athens Regulation also means that the previously applicable rules concerning the carrier’s liability will become more limited in content and will regulate delays and non-contractual liability limitations, see Sections 23–36 (formerly Sections 17–28). Chapter 19, Section 1 of the Swedish Maritime Code will also be amended so that the provision no longer regulates statutory limitations concerning personal injury and material damage when the Athens Regulation – which regulates such issues – enters into force.</p>
<h2>Passengers’ right to information – supervision and sanctions in market law</h2>
<p>Carriers are responsible for passengers being provided with information about their rights under the Athens Regulation. The Inquiry proposes that the Swedish Consumer Agency supervise that this obligation is met. The Swedish Consumer Agency is also responsible for ensuring that corresponding information is given in the case of air transportation of passengers (see Council Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 and Section 13 of the Air Transportation Act).</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s view, the sanctions that may be imposed if the carrier does not provide this information should be taken from the market law area. The Inquiry proposes that the sanctions system of the Marketing Act (2008:486) – with the exception of Sections 29– 36 concerning market disturbance fees – apply to breaches of the Athens Regulation, in the same way as the issue is dealt with in the Air Transportation Act.</p>
<h2>Sweden should accede to the Athens Convention</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit includes producing material for the assessment of whether Sweden should accede to the Athens Convention .  In its work, the Inquiry was to consider, in particular, the fact that the Convention has already been largely incorporated into EU law through the Athens Regulation, and on this basis will apply in this country.</p>
<p>The Member States may accede to the Athens Convention once the EU has deposited its instrument of accession. In light of the fact that the EU in December 2011 deposited its instrument of accession, that the Convention has already essentially been incorporated into EU law, the importance of uniform application within the EU and the fact that the few articles that fall outside the scope of the Regulation cannot be considered to have any negative consequences for Swedish law, the Inquiry considers that the material indicates that Sweden should accede to the Athens Convention in its 2002 wording .  It is proposed that the provisions in the Athens Convention that have not been incorporated into EU law be implemented in Swedish law through transformation.</p>
<p>When a state ratifies the Athens Convention, it may decide to opt for the reservation contained in the IMO guidelines. A Council Decision of May 2011 states that Member States should make this reservation when acceding to the Athens Protocol. If Sweden chooses to make this reservation, the most obvious consequence would be that the liability of carriers in the event of a passenger’s death or personal injury is limited to the lower amount of either 250 000 SDR per passenger or a total of 340 million SDR per ship, if the incident was caused by war, civil war or terrorist acts, among other causes. A reservation also means that the insurance requirement in the Athens Regulation would be amended in line with the carrier’s liability. In the event of a reservation, the state (Finansinspektionen) is to issue an insurance certificate that reflects the carrier’s liability limitations and the limitations, requirements and exemptions that can be made in the insurance. The IMO guidelines were adopted primarily to solve the issue of compensation for terrorism-related damage within the framework of the Athens Convention. A reservation will probably mean that carriers’ costs for war insurance are reduced. Insurance and security providers also benefit from a reservation as they may otherwise have difficulties dealing with situations that arise. Taking account of these circumstances, the Inquiry considers that Sweden should make the reservation contained in the IMO guidelines.</p>
<p>The Brussels I Regulation on jurisdiction takes precedence over the provisions in the Convention until a Member State has acceded. Following accession the Convention takes precedence. In light of the above, the Inquiry proposes that a provision be added regulating jurisdiction with regard to cases concerning liability for personal injury or damage as a result of luggage going missing or being damaged in relation to a contracting State to the Protocol of 2002 to the 1974 Athens Convention relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea. The provision that should enter into force when the Convention becomes applicable in Sweden should be formulated in accordance with the Convention and should apply only if the matter is of a contractual nature. If the matter is linked to an EU Member State that has not acceded to the Athens Convention, the Brussels I Regulation shall continue to regulate jurisdiction (special rules apply in the case of Denmark).</p>
<p>The Convention’s rules concerning the recognition and enforcement of judgments will be incorporated into Swedish law on Sweden’s accession to the Athens Convention. During negotiations between the EU and the IMO on the text of the Protocol of 2002 to the Athens Convention, the EU secured the right to continue to apply the Brussels I Regulation between EU countries. The Brussels I Regulation is currently applicable in relation to other EU Member States, and in relation to Denmark the agreement between the European Community and Denmark on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters applies . In the Inquiry’s view, Sweden should make use of the option to apply the Brussels I Regulation in relation to EU Member States, and in relation to Denmark the agreement between the EU and Denmark should apply. The provision on recognition and enforcement of judgments that implements Article 17a should apply in relation to the contracting States to the Athens Convention that are not members of the EU.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the rules relating to the Athens Regulation enter into force at the same time as the Regulation on 31 December 2012. Similarly, the rules based on the Athens Convention should begin to apply at the time when the Convention enters into force in Sweden. It should therefore be left to the Government to decide when the legislative amendments are to enter into force.</p>
