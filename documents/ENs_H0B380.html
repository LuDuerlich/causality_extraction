<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Committee Terms of Reference (2011:87) state that the Inquiry is to propose a new form of fixed-term employment with a training dimension. A position of this kind will only be available to a person under the age of 23, for a maximum of 18 months. It presupposes an agreement being entered into between the employer and the employee on a training dimension. Salary and employment conditions are to be regulated in the customary manner by means of agreements and are not included in the Inquiry’s remit.</p>
<p>The terms of reference also state that the new form of employment is to make labour market establishment easier for young women and men, and in particular provide an incentive for smaller companies to employ. This employment form “must be attractive to employers so that they choose to employ, including being easy to understand and make use of.”</p>
<p>Various opportunities are already available today for both workplace-based learning and fixed-term employment These are regulated partly in legislation, and partly through collective agreements. The new form of employment is to supplement other opportunities.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Inquiry is to present proposals on a new form of employment with a training dimension for young people. The Inquiry notes that the requirement stating that employment must contain a training dimension means that the form of employment entails an undertaking that can be particularly difficult for small companies to cope with. The Inquiry therefore also presents proposals enabling municipal adult education to provide support when the training dimension is designed. Support of this kind also provides better opportunities to assure the quality of learning at the workplace. To encourage companies to use training positions and compensate employers for the training commitment, the Inquiry also presents proposals on economic incentives for employers.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals entail measures that can be of significance in both the short and long term. The introduction of a new form of employment provides immediate opportunities to enter into employment contracts containing a training dimension.</p>
<p>The proposal that municipal adult education can be involved in developing and supporting learning at workplaces in connection with a training position can, in the long term, lead to better cooperation between working life and the school system, where training to a great extent is designed in relation to the demands of working life, the individual’s need of skills development and the current desires of employers.</p>
<h2>Name of form of employment</h2>
<p>The terms of reference use the name ‘apprentice probationary employment’ ( lärlingsprovanställning ). If deemed appropriate, the Inquiry will propose a different name.</p>
<p>The Inquiry notes that the term ‘apprentice’ is used in many varied contexts. Traditionally, the term ‘apprentice’ is linked to vocational programmes that combine training with employment and which lead to a specific profession. The school system uses the term ‘apprentice’ for students in vocational programmes, whose training is largely carried out at a workplace. These apprentices are not employed. The term is also used by the social partners in the collective agreements that regulate training or the completion phase of training in a profession. The new form of employment will not have training for a specific profession as its goal. ‘Probationary employment’ is an established form of employment in the Employment Protection Act (1982:80) and in collective agreements. There are special conditions associated with the existing form of employment that are not proposed for the new form of employment.</p>
<p>To avoid further terminological confusion, the Inquiry considers that the new form of employment should have a different name. The Inquiry considers that the distinguishing characteristic of this new form of employment is the training dimension. Therefore, a suitable name would be ‘training position’.</p>
<h2>Covered or not covered by the Employment Protection Act</h2>
<p>The terms of reference state that the new form of employment should preferably be regulated by the Employment Protection Act.</p>
<p>The Employment Protection Act is the generally applicable act that includes provisions on fixed-term employment. The general rule in Swedish law is that employment should be for an indefiniteterm; only certain forms of fixed-term employment specified in the Employment Protection Act are allowed.</p>
<p>It is possible to deviate from the Act by means of collective agreements. In 2010, about 91 per cent of wage earners were covered by collective agreements (including application agreements, in Swedish called hängavtal ). The Inquiry notes that the parties to a great extent used the opportunity to deviate from the Act with respect to fixed-term forms of employment.</p>
<p>It is primarily small companies that are not covered by collective agreements. Under the terms of reference, the form of employment is to be designed so that it is applicable to the entire labour market, particularly taking into account the needs of small companies. It must be easy to understand and make use of this form of employment.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has analysed whether placing the form of employment in the Employment Protection Act or in a special act would have an impact on the extent to which it can be applied. The Inquiry has also analysed whether such placement would have an impact on simplicity.</p>
<p>Under many collective agreements – primarily within industries that have a tradition of apprentices – only the provisions in the collective agreements on fixed-term employment are to be applied.</p>
<p>Other collective agreements contain the phrase, “Regarding other fixed-term employment contracts, the following applies instead of that which is stated in Sections 5 and 6 of the Employment Protection Act”. The most common phrase in collective agreements is that the Employment Protection Act applies “with the following additions or amendments”.</p>
<p>Sweden’s international commitments make it clear that the state is to avoid interfering in existing collective agreements. It is difficult to assess whether a new form of employment would be directly applicable on a larger scale if it were placed in a special act rather than in the Employment Protection Act. If a regulation in a special act were to lead to it having a greater impact, it would entail greater interference in existing collective agreements. This argues in favour of placement in the Employment Protection Act.</p>
<p>Simplicity also argues in favour of placement in the Employment Protection Act. Since the Employment Protection Act is the generally applicable act that contains fixed-term employment, placing a new provision on a fixed-term employment in the Act means that permissible forms of employment are collected in a single act. The existing general provisions in the Employment Protection Act can then, to a great extent, also be applied to the new form of employment.</p>
<h2>Age limits</h2>
<p>According to its terms of reference, the Inquiry is to analyse the pros and cons of introducing a restriction regarding the earliest age at which an employee is to be permitted to enter into a contract concerning a training position.</p>
<p>The existing forms of employment in the Employment Protection Act do not state a minimum age. One reason for this could be that other provisions contain restrictions. Under the Work Environment Act, an individual is not allowed to work before the calendar year in which he or she reaches the age of sixteen or has completed compulsory schooling. Compulsory schooling ceases to apply at the end of the spring term of year nine, but no later than when a student reaches the age of 18. An individual under the age of 18 is a minor whose parents must give their consent for an employment contract to be valid.</p>
<p>One reason for introducing a minimum age for employment could be to prevent young people from working rather than studying at upper secondary school. There may be individual cases where it is feasible for an employer and an underage employee to enter into a contract concerning employment with a training dimension even though the opportunities for the underage person to work are limited due to relevant working environment regulations.</p>
<p>A training position can be an alternative for young people who do not wish to carry on with their studies. The Inquiry considers that it is better not to introduce a minimum age for training positions.</p>
<p>Under the terms of reference, the form of employment must be easy to understand and make use of. During the course of its examinations, the Inquiry’s attention has been drawn to the fact that the existence of various age limits in connection with measures for young people makes it difficult for employers to understand and make use of them.</p>
<p>The Inquiry is doubtful whether the age limit stated in its terms of reference – employment for individuals under the age of 23 – is the most appropriate. Instead, one of the existing age limits should be used. It is the Inquiry’s assessment that a more extensive review of age-related provisions should also be conducted so that the regulations are easier to understand and make use of. There may also be a need to review age limits from the perspective of lifelong learning.</p>
<h2>Similarities with probationary employment</h2>
<p>Under its terms of reference, the Inquiry is to base the design of the new form of employment on the current regulations on probationary employment in the Employment Protection Act. Probationary employment is a fixed-term employment that can be terminated at short notice without having to provide a reason. The Inquiry proposes that it should also be possible to terminate a training position at short notice without having to provide a reason.</p>
<p>A training position differs from other forms of employment in the Employment Protection Act in that it must include training. The employer may need to assess whether he or she can cope with the extra commitment that the requirement concerning a training dimension entails. The Inquiry therefore considers it reasonable to be able to terminate the employment without having to provide a reason. By using the same time limits as for probationary employment in the Employment Protection Act, the regulations are easy to understand.</p>
<p>A probationary employment is converted to indefinite-term employment if it is not terminated prior to the end of the probationary period. The forms of fixed-term employment ‘general fixed-term employment’ and ‘temporary substitute employment’ are also converted to indefinite-term employment after a certain period of time.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that a training position be converted to indefinite-term employment if it is not terminated prior to the end of the employment period. The reasoning behind such a conversion regulation is that after a period of training, the position is expected to lead to the employee gaining the knowledge and skills the employer is in need of, and the employment is then to be converted to indefinite-term employment.</p>
<h2>Rights of priority</h2>
<p>A training position is to be able to last a maximum of 18 months. The regulations in the Employment Protection Act give an employee the right of priority to re-employment after having been employed for a total of more than twelve months during the last three years, provided that the position was terminated or did not lead to continued employment due to a shortage of work. The right of priority also applies to fixed-term employment under Section 5 of the Employment Protection Act, although not to employees over the age of 67. The provisions on rights of priority are supplemented by a right for employees with fixed-term contracts to be informed as to whether or not they have the right of priority to reemployment once they have been employed by the employer for more than twelve months during the last three years.</p>
<p>Under the terms of reference, a training position must be attractive for employers so that they choose to employ. The regulations on the right of priority to re-employment are often given as a reason as to why employers choose not to employ in certain situations. One possible consequence of also allowing training positions to lead to the right of priority after twelve months employment is that employers only offer twelve month employment contracts to prevent the employee from gaining the right of priority. A right of priority after twelve months in a training position would also mean that after twelve months employment, an employer would have to give reasons as to why a position was terminated. In actual fact, this would mean that it would only be possible to terminate the position without having to provide a reason during the first twelve months.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that employees with training position contracts should not have the right of priority to re-employment.</p>
<p>If the position is converted to indefinite-term employment, or if the employee, under the Employment Protection Act, is later employed in a different capacity with the same employer, the Inquiry considers that the earlier training position period should also be credited towards the right of priority.</p>
<h2>Training dimension</h2>
<p>The new form of employment will differ from other forms of employment in the Employment Protection Act in that it will include a training dimension. It is up to the employer and the employee to agree on what the training dimension is to consist of.</p>
<p>Experience shows that the quality of workplace-based learning must be assured. Such quality assurance can be accomplished by means of a refined support structure. Programme planning, supervision, follow-up and documentation are important building blocks of the support structure that must be built around a training position.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the programme plan must be in writing. The plan is to include details about the goals of the training, various components and information on how the training is to be conducted and followed up. It must also indicate how large a proportion of the average working hours the training is expected to cover during different periods of the employment. The plan must also to specify who is responsible for supervision.</p>
<p>The employee and the employer must jointly agree on the goal of the training.</p>
<p>Requiring that the plan must contain a certain content provides a structure for the learning process. It also makes it easier for the employer to provide the agreed training dimension.</p>
<h2>Training according to programme plan</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that employment only be allowed as long as training as specified in the programme plan is being provided.</p>
<p>The basic premise is that training is to be provided throughout the entire employment period. In a training position, the training, the forms it takes and the goals set will vary between individuals and workplaces. It is likely that the extent of training will also vary during the employment period.</p>
<p>The training dimension is a part of the employment contract. The position is based on the employer and the employee being in agreement on the training dimension. Unlike both training at workplaces within upper secondary apprenticeship training programmes and apprenticeship training programmes under collective agreements, there will be no third party to take decisions on the training dimension or whether it is sufficient in terms of time and content. The employer is responsible for ensuring that the training is conducted in accordance with the employment contract.</p>
<p>If the agreed training is only scheduled for the beginning of an 18-month period, employment is only allowed during that initial period. If the plan calls for the training to be conducted during certain intervals, employment is considered permissible during the intervening periods as well.</p>
<p>If the employee does not feel that the training is provided in accordance with the agreed programme plan, the employee may request that a court declare that the employment is to apply until further notice. The employee may also seek compensation for any damage resulting from the agreement not being fulfilled.</p>
<p>An employer who wishes to avoid the employment being considered indefinite-term employment must ensure that the programme plan is clear and contains elements of training throughout the entire employment period.</p>
<h2>Support function</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s assessment is that employers who wish to offer employment with a training dimension to young people may have need of a support function. The majority of employers have a clear picture of what skills their company needs, but may still need support in expressing programme goals and identifying the opportunities for learning available at the workplace. Evaluations of the scheme with upper secondary school apprenticeship programmes and of projects sponsored by the Swedish National Board for Youth Affairs make clear that there is also a need of support to manage the social tensions that can arise when young people are faced with the rules and norms in effect at a workplace.</p>
<p>In order for employers to choose to make use of a training position and thus commit themselves to providing training according to a plan during the employment period, the Inquiry considers that an accessible support structure is necessary. Employers covered by collective agreements can probably receive support from employer organisations or, in some cases, from vocational training boards. When the employee is unemployed and registered with the Swedish Public Employment Service, the Employment Service can probably provide some support, e.g. via a validation procedure or matching. Municipalities can be involved regarding young people who receive income support. There are also private actors that employers can engage for such matters as assessing what skills and knowledge an employee has.</p>
<p>However, at present there is no other actor within a currently established activity that is as qualified to provide such expert and multifaceted support as municipal adult education. Municipal adult education conducts such activities as validation, drawing up individual study programmes, follow-up and issuing certificates to document and highlight outcomes of workplace-based learning.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that activities conducted within municipal adult education could be used as a support structure to design the training dimension of a training position.</p>
<h2>Municipal adult education</h2>
<p>To make learning at a workplace feasible, the training dimension of the employment must be adapted to the situation and interests of the employee, and to the employer’s need of skills and knowledge.</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that municipal adult education can be engaged in connection with a training position. It is necessary to amend the provisions on adult education so that a person under the age of 20 can be accepted as a student. It is proposed that a special government grant be introduced that can cover the costs when adult education accepts a student in connection with a training position. Accordingly, accepting these students will not affect the municipality’s resources. It is proposed that the provisions for municipal adult education be regulated in a special ordinance containing provisions on government grants. The provisions on selection in Chapter 3, Section 7 of the Ordinance on adult education (2011:1108) are not to be applied. The proposed ordinance is to make clear that the training is to contribute to providing students with training for ongoing vocational activities or planned vocational choices.</p>
<p>Government grants are also to be provided for training supervisors.</p>
<h2>Financial incentives for employers</h2>
<p>Taking responsibility for training within the framework of an employment position is a significant responsibility for an employer. The Inquiry proposes that support be provided to companies that employ people via a training position, including compensation to cover costs for supervision.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposal means that there is to be supervision for the training provided at the workplace. Municipalities are to arrange training programmes for supervisors, which is to be available to companies that have persons employed via a training position.</p>
<h2>Other matters</h2>
<p>The Inquiry considers that information campaigns are necessary to encourage use of the new form of employment.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes tasking the Institute for Labour Market Policy Evaluation to follow up and evaluate the new form of employment, which we propose calling a ‘training position’.</p>
