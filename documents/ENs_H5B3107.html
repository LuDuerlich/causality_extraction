<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit, starting points and approach</h2>
<p>Sverigeförhandlingen’s (The National Negotiation on Housing and Infrastructure) assignment has focused on negotiating and concluding agreements about increased housing construction through the development of new infrastructure. The negotiations have been based on reaching common interest in this outcome at national, regional and local level.</p>
<p>The basis of our approach is collaboration through appointed negotiators with a value-generating negotiating method based on benefits.</p>
<p>The value-generating negotiating method builds on benefits that arise in society as a result of coordination of the parties’ areas of responsibility. The benefits we expect are housing benefits, travel time benefits, labour market and business sector benefits, environmental benefits and social benefits.</p>
<p>An important aspect was the need for a formalised forum for the implementation phase. The forum will be responsible for the handling and follow-up of the agreements signed in the negotiations. This forum is called a ‘governing board’ and they are to be active until all the commitments are realised. It is only when the infrastructure and housing are in place that all benefits will fully arise.</p>
<h2>Sweden’s first high-speed railway</h2>
<p>We have the task of enabling the rapid implementation of Sweden’s first high-speed railway, which will run between Stockholm and Gothenburg/Malmö. The new railway aims to shorten the time required to travel by train between the country’s three metropolitan regions. It will also contribute to economic growth in the regions along the new railway and in the rest of Sweden, which means that the new railway should enable both competitive highspeed train traffic between the end destinations (320 km/h) and fast regional train traffic (250 km/h).</p>
<p>An express train should be able to travel between Stockholm and Gothenburg in two hours, and between Stockholm and Malmö in two and a half hours. The proportion of trains arriving on time on the newly constructed lines should reach at least 98 per cent.</p>
<p>The high-speed railway will release capacity on the existing Western and Southern main lines for a combination of more regional rail services, freight train services and improved punctuality. The railway will contribute to lower carbon dioxide emissions from transport and an increase in housing construction.</p>
<p>Construction should be based on an overall perspective, which is why the entire system, Stockholm–Gothenburg and Stockholm– Malmö, should be constructed rapidly and more or less simultaneously. Both routes should be completed around the year 2035, or as quickly as possible, taking into account technology and the legal planning process. The rapid rate of construction is motivated because of the need to quickly realise the benefits for the society, and because of the need to reduce costly provisional measures. In addition, rapid construction will contribute to Sweden meeting its climate targets.</p>
<p>In order to have a combination of high-speed trains and fast regional trains, along with a high level of punctuality, the number of stations and connection points must be limited.</p>
<p>We conclude that central or near central locations should be sought for stations in larger cities, provided costs do not become unreasonably high. This is to maximise the benefit of the investment, support the development of sustainable cities and increased economic growth. A station location that has good connections for local public transport, and is in a densely built-up and attractive urban environment that includes housing and offices, has the best conditions for gaining full benefit from the high-speed railway. Through good local connections, growth can be spread to a larger region and more towns. These growth effects will not appear spontaneously however, they require political leadership, local engagement and investment. This also applies to complementary and supporting investments, such as development of public service and location qualities, as well as education and skills enhancement measures.</p>
<p>With these conditions, towns and regions that receive improved accessibility thanks to high-speed trains gain the opportunity for increased growth and development towards a knowledge-based economy and greater sectoral breadth. The growth in the towns and regions benefits the entire population through the opportunity for increased wages, growth in the business sector and improved labour markets. The high-speed railway also links several major higher education institutions. This benefits both accessibility to higher education and research quality, with an increased exchange of knowledge, and not least increased international accessibility.</p>
<p>The high-speed railway will be constructed using modern and tried and tested technology, but in a way that makes it compatible with the rest of the rail network.</p>
<p>The investment cost of the high-speed railway is estimated at SEK 230 billion (June 2015 price level), with a margin of error of SEK 30 billion.</p>
<p>We propose that construction of the high-speed railway be financed via a dedicated appropriation. The appropriation would be financed via a loan from the Swedish National Debt Office.</p>
<p>The Government should instruct the Swedish National Debt Office to review the possibilities that part of the borrowing taking place in the form of ‘green bonds’.</p>
<p>To create transparency and clarity, work on the high-speed railway’s planning and construction should be conducted by an autonomous organisational entity. Such an entity could form part of an existing organisation or could take the form of a state-owned company.</p>
<p>It is our assessment that there are conditions for and interest in running commercial traffic on the high-speed railway. The assessment is that the commercial interest primarily concerns journeys between the terminals in Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö and the stations in the larger towns, such as Norrköping, Linköping, Jönköping, Borås and Lund. In our opinion there is also commercial interest in providing service at least to Arlanda, Uppsala, Gävle and Copenhagen. In our assessment, other stations along the highspeed railway will primarily be trafficked by wider regional procured traffic.</p>
<p>We have concluded agreements with municipalities and regions along the high-speed railway. The agreements include co-financing of the high-speed railway with a total amount of SEK 1.242 billion and they cover the construction of 92 270 new homes. Agreements have been signed with the following municipalities: Södertälje, Trosa, Nyköping, Norrköping, Linköping, Tranås, Jönköping, Värnamo, Hässleholm, Lund and Borås. We have also signed agreements with the following regions: Sörmland, Östergötland, Jönköping, Skåne and Västra Götaland.</p>
<p>The agreements regulate the placement of stations, commitments to spread the benefits in the regions, how the follow up is to be organised etc. All the agreements stipulate that a governing board must be appointed for each framework agreement. Together, the parties that entered into the agreement must protect the outcome of the negotiations. This is necessary until all parties have fulfilled their commitments. For this reason, the governing boards must be active throughout the implementation period and until all the commitments have been implemented. Progress should be reported to the Government on an annual basis.</p>
<p>We propose that the Government approve the agreements concluded about the high speed railway.</p>
<p>In addition to these agreements, we have signed a statement of intent with Härryda, covering 2 950 new homes. We have an agreement with Lund regarding public transport that covers 15 000 new homes. Of these, 5 000 are influenced by the high-speed railway. In total, this brings the number of new homes along the high-speed railway to 100 220.</p>
<p>In June 2016, the Swedish Transport Administration presented a socio-economic calculation for the high-speed railway. The calculation was based on forecasts of passenger and goods transport in 2040. It included assessments of the most central direct socioeconomic effects of the investment in the form of time gains for passenger and goods traffic and savings of travel and transport costs. In addition, changes of transport companies’ income and costs, as well as assessments of the socio-economic effects on air pollution, greenhouse gas and road safety are also included.</p>
<p>According to the calculations, the net present value ratio of the high-speed railway is -0.6, which means that it is not profitable. We have studied the profitability of other major railway and metro investments that are planned or have been implemented and found that they, too, have been unprofitable.</p>
<p>Our conclusion with regard to the socio-economic analysis is that the cost-benefit calculations used by the Swedish Transport Administration are primarily motivated from the perspective of the transport sector’s role as a provider of infrastructure. Next, with regard to the authority´s broader duty as social developer and to what economically transformative projects such as an investment in a new railway network for high-speed tracks entail, more comprehensive background material with analyses is required. It is a matter of being able to analyse at a deeper level how the conditions for economic growth, business sector development, matching efficiency in the labour market, productivity growth among businesses etc. can be expected to be impacted.</p>
<p>Part of our remit covered cycling in connection with the highspeed railway. Here, we have studied the possibility of cycling on the service roads of the high-speed railway and measures to increase the accessibility for cyclists at stations. Our recommendation is therefore that access for cyclists should be considered in the continued planning and building of the high-speed railway.</p>
<h2>Expanded railways in northern Sweden</h2>
<p>In 2015 and 2016, we conducted an analysis of the conditions for enhancing rail links between the high-speed railway and northern Sweden, linked to an examination of the conditions for an extensive level of co-financing from the business sector, municipalities and county councils. An interim report of the remit concerning railway infrastructure in northern Sweden was presented to the Government on 1 June 2016.</p>
<p>We consider that it will be possible to obtain co-financing from municipalities, county councils and the business sector. Regarding the business sector, we consider that it is primarily a matter of user fees that are paid when the benefits of the new infrastructure are actually utilised.</p>
<p>Based on our remit, the following are the measures we consider will provide the greatest benefit:  Increased capacity  Gävle–Härnösand.  Increased capacity  Umeå–Luleå.  Increased capacity  Stockholm–Arlanda–Uppsala.  Greater resilience, e.g. in the form of diversion opportunities for better restoration capacity.</p>
<h2>Expanded public transport, increased housing construction and bicycle objects in Sweden’s cities</h2>
<p>We have concluded agreements with municipalities and regions in Stockholm County, Västra Götaland County and Skåne County. In total, five framework agreements, covering 193 130 homes, have been signed with the municipalities of Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, Huddinge, Täby, Vallentuna, Österåker, Solna, Lund and Helsingborg, and with Stockholm County Council, Region Västra Götaland and Region Skåne.</p>
<p>These agreements cover the development of public transport objects at a total investment cost of SEK 38.4 billion, of which SEK 36.6 billion in public transport objects and SEK 1.75 billion in bicycle objects. The agreements regulate financing and development responsibilities, functions, timeframes, investment costs and continued collaboration via a governing board.</p>
<p>The agreement for Stockholm County covers four public transport objects at an investment cost of SEK 25.1 billion, 100 370 new homes and 30 bicycle objects at an investment cost of SEK 477.5 million. The agreed public transport objects are a new line on the underground between Älvsjö and Fridhemsplan, Spårväg Syd, an extension of the Roslagsbana to the City via Odenplan and a new underground station at Hagalund.</p>
<p>The agreement for Västra Götaland County covers four public transport objects at an investment cost of SEK 7 billion, 45 680 homes and 8 bicycle objects at an investment cost of SEK 241 million. The agreed public transport objects are a new tramway underneath the river Göta Älv in combination with a new BRT-line (Bus Rapid Transit), a cable car and two BRT lines.</p>
<p>The agreement for Skåne County covers twelve public transport objects at an investment cost of SEK 4.5 billion, 47 080 homes and 8 bicycle projects at an investment cost of SEK 1 billion. The public transport objects in the Malmö agreement are Malmöpendeln, and eight lines for city buses run on electricity, four of which are BRT lines. In Lund the agreement covers the tramway between Lund Central Station and ESS (European Spallation Source) in the urban district Brunnshög. The agreements with Helsingborg contain two new BRT lines. The lines run between Berga and Ättekulla, and between Västergård and Ramlösagården, and can in the longer term develop into tramways.</p>
<p>The development of public transport is expected to contribute to major travel time benefits and significant travel time savings, and are necessary to realise the planned housing expansion and thus also the opportunities to create dense and sustainable urban environments.</p>
<p>The development of bicycle infrastructure in the three counties will result in a total of 138 kilometres of new bicycle paths, about 10 000 new bicycle parking places, better intersection points, etc.</p>
<p>All the metropolitan agreements stipulate that a governing board must be appointed for each framework agreement. Together, the parties that entered into the agreement must protect the outcome of the negotiations. This is necessary until all parties have fulfilled their commitments. For this reason, the governing boards must be active throughout the implementation period and until all the commitments have been implemented. Follow-up of progress must be reported to the Government on an annual basis.</p>
<p>We propose that the Government approve the agreements signed with municipalities and regions in Stockholm County, Västra Götaland County and Skåne County, and that the congestion charge in Stockholm is altered in accordance with our earlier proposal to the Government. We also propose that the Government appoint a chair tasked with forming governing boards in accordance with the agreements and for the boards to be responsible for follow up, evaluation and reporting to the Government on the agreements’ implementation in accordance with the agreements. Furthermore, we propose that the Government instruct the Swedish Transport</p>
<p>Administration to provide resources for secretariats to the governing boards.</p>
<p>Our remit includes analysing and considering possible financing solutions for Östlig förbindelse, an Eastern link in Stockholm.</p>
<p>Studies by the Swedish Transport Administration and Stockholm County Council confirm that Östlig Förbindelse can be realised without intruding into the National City Park. They also show that it can be designed for efficient public transport, that traffic benefits for both road and public transport segments extend to the entire region, that the link would increase the resilience of the traffic systems, that it can be adapted to comply with technical developments and have a positive impact on regional development. Östlig Förbindelse would lead to increased CO2 emissions, but levels of NOx and particulate matter would be reduced.</p>
<p>Our basic premise is that those who benefit from the investment should contribute to the financing. User fees are one way to realise the benefits gained by road users when they use Östlig Förbindelse. Different funding alternatives for Östlig Förbindelse have been developed based on combinations of financing via appropriations, co-financing and/or via the users. These approaches have served as background material for the negotiations. However, no financing agreements have been entered into.</p>
<p>On 4 September 2017, we announced that the negotiations had been suspended. This was because the conditions for negotiating a financial solution for the construction of Östlig Förbindelse were not in place. The fact that it is not currently possible to reach an agreement on financing does not mean that there is no regional need of an Eastern link. Geographically, Östlig Förbindelse is in a part of Stockholm City and Nacka Municipality that is undergoing urban development. The physical planning process needs to continue so as not to hinder a future Eastern link.</p>
<p>We propose that the Government allows keeping SEK 300 million of the existing SEK 2 billion in the National plan for the transport system 2018–2029 for continued planning of Östlig Förbindelse to ensure an orderly phasing out. This allows the planning process to continue to the point where the resulting documentation can be used in the future. It also opens up for geographically adjusting the national interest corridor and allows relevant municipalities to continue with their urban development.</p>
<p>A bilateral Danish-Swedish study has been carried out in 2016–2017 within the framework of Sverigeförhandlingen. On 26 June 2017, an interim report regarding a permanent link was presented to the Government. The interim report contains a comprehensive forecasting and capacity report, background reports from the Swedish Transport Administration and a jointly developed project plan.</p>
<p>In brief, the analysis shows that there will not be capacity shortages across Öresund in the foreseeable future. This is provided that the shore-side capacity-enhancing adjustment measures are carried out. Such adjustment measures have been identified on both the Danish and Swedish sides and, in economic terms, are considered less demanding as compared with the costs of a new permanent link.</p>
<p>Even if Öresund Bridge itself has sufficient capacity after 2030, a new permanent link between Helsingborg and Helsingör would lead to shorter travel times and increased accessibility. This is in comparison with the ferry services.</p>
<p>Our proposal, based on the parties’ agreement and the abovementioned capacity forecast, is to continue implementing a bilateral cooperation and study project.</p>
<p>The proposal means that the Government should allocate an amount corresponding to DKK 5 million for the strategic analysis during 2018–2020.</p>
<h2>Negotiation as a method of building our society</h2>
<p>The model we used means that appointed negotiators start off from a value-generating negotiation based on benefits and, using a transparent approach, create long-term responsibilities as we jointly build our society.</p>
<p>As a result of the negotiations 285 400 new homes will be completed through the development of new infrastructure. Our approach has produced clear results in the negotiations carried out on behalf of the Government aimed at achieving increased housing construction linked to the development of new infrastructure. This indicates the usefulness of the model.</p>
<p>We see a need to develop methods regarding the benefits to society when investing in infrastructure. This is necessary to gain greater accuracy in assessments, causal links and estimates. Furthermore, we consider that agreements containing clear commitments and cross-party governing boards create a long-term responsibility to ensure that the agreement is implemented so as to achieve the expected results. The model should be well established and serve as a guide. This can be accomplished by the Government consistently using it in situations where a negotiator is appointed to speed up and influence the development of society.</p>
<p>We propose that the current negotiation model continue to be used in negotiations between the central government, municipalities and regions and that it shall be evaluated over the next 3–5 years. In addition, we also propose that development efforts be carried out concerning methods for calculating the benefits, so that the results can be used in future negotiations. The development efforts should involve the Swedish Transport Administration and SKL.</p>
<p>Sverigeförhandlingen has submitted six interim reports to the Government. They have mainly consisted of status reports, where the main conclusions are to be found in this report. Two of the reports contain legislative proposals.</p>
<p>Delrapport från Sverigeförhandlingen – Ett förhandlingsförslag om värdeåterföring (SOU 2015:60) contains proposals on how property owners who benefit from a public investment can return part of the increase in property values to society, so called land value capture. The law came into force on 1 April 2017.</p>
<p>railway, for example to give priority to high-speed train traffic and fast regional train traffic. It also contains proposals making it possible to sign framework agreements lasting longer than five years, for example when a company has made substantial invest- ments in new trains.</p>
