<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The assignment</h2>
<p>For several years there was criticism of the strong position of district heating companies in relation to their customers in Sweden, which led to the current legislation in the area. This legislation has been in force since 2008. Criticism has not diminished appreciably and the intention of the legislation to achieve a stronger position for customers has not been fully met. In addition, there seems to be a lack of public confidence in the district heating companies. Consequently, the Government set up the TPA (third party access) inquiry tasked with drawing up a regulatory framework for third party access to district heating networks. The purpose of such access is to further strengthen the position of district heating customers and to achieve a more effective heating market with lower district heating prices and environmental improvements.</p>
<h2>Aims of the proposal</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposal is aimed at creating conditions for competition in the district heating market as part of the heating market. Through the proposal the inquiry terms of reference that have governed the work of the Inquiry can be achieved in the long term, even if further measures may be required to fully meet the environmental objectives in particular.</p>
<h2>District heating markets</h2>
<p>District heating networks can in some respects be compared with the electricity and natural gas networks. All are conducted energy in which the infrastructure, i.e. the conducts, are a natural monopoly. The district heating markets are diverse, however, as regards size, production forms, production capacity, access to residual heat (most common as industrial waste heat) and other competitive aspects. An important contrast with the electricity and gas markets is also that the district heating markets are typically local and consequently the conditions they face vary greatly. Electricity and gas have other characteristics as energy forms, which enables trading nationally and across borders. District heating does not have the physical structure to establish a national, far less international, market.</p>
<p>District heating is produced by heating up water in a production facility of some kind. The heated water is distributed in a closed pipeline system to the buildings that are connected to the system. District heating is used primarily to meet the heating needs of buildings and for provision of domestic hot water. Production facilities for district heating can be either plants that only produce heat, or combined heat and power plants (CHP) that generate electricity as well as heat. In most district heating systems there are several different production facilities. District heating is distributed from these facilities to district heating customers. At present all these functions are managed in an integrated district heating company. Hence this company is responsible for production, distribution and sale of district heating and also has the ultimate responsibility in relation to the district heating customers. District heating can be produced in several different ways: CHP, heat only boiler (HOB) plants, with heat pumps or by using surplus heat from an industrial process, for example. Several different producers thus have an interest in gaining access to an existing district heating network to distribute the heat they produce. At present this is done through various forms of collaboration between the producer in question and the district heating company in a number of district heating networks in Sweden. Consequently no competition between the producers can exist.</p>
<h2>Third-party access to the district heating networks</h2>
<p>The current regulatory framework for district heating operations means that there is no right of access to a district heating network for anyone other than the owner of the network. An owner of a district heating network is, however, obliged to negotiate with an actor wishing to have access to the network owner’s pipeline system. However, there is nothing to prevent the network owner, after negotiation, from refusing access, even though the District Heating Act stipulates that “the district heating company shall endeavour to agree on access with a party that has requested access.” Hence, it is crucial for a producer of district heating to agree on access with the network owner, the district heating company, which also produces district heating.</p>
<p>By giving several producers access to the district heating network the conditions for competition can be created. The proposals presented in this report would give potential district heating producers such a right of access. In order to be able to introduce thirdparty access, certain further measures must be taken so that district heating systems in the future will also be characterised by safe and reliable operations with high security of supply and delivery. Customers should also be able to feel assured that the prices of district heating are reasonable, given the local conditions of production and distribution of district heating. Distribution of district heating, like the distribution of electricity and gas, always constitutes a natural monopoly. To ensure that district heating customers do not pay an unreasonable price for the distribution service the Inquiry proposes the introduction of price regulation of this service.</p>
<p>To create the conditions for competition in the production of and trading in district heating the Inquiry proposes the introduction of a separation requirement between distribution, production and trading. The district heating networks in which production also constitutes a natural monopoly are primarily the small networks. The district heating company in these markets is often a relatively small municipal energy company. It is not given that competition will arise in all markets. In the cases when competition does not arise it is not desirable to burden these companies with the additional administration that legal separation of production, distribution and trading entails. The separation requirement in these cases would mean an unnecessary administrative cost, which ultimately would be paid by the company's district heating customers, since efficiency gains resulting from competition would not arise. To avoid unnecessary additional costs a separation requirement will only apply when a competitive situation has in fact come into existence.</p>
<h2>Legal regulation</h2>
<p>The proposed legal regulation means that a new District Heating Act will be introduced to replace the current one. The Act is based on the current market situation with a vertically integrated district heating company that deals with all aspects of the district heating operations. For district heating companies that remain integrated, regulation will to some extent continue unchanged compared with the current District Heating Act. These district heating companies will, however, be subject to price regulation of distribution activities. For such price regulation to be practicable separate accounting of these operations will be required. The legislation entails an obligation for the network owners, that is today’s district heating companies, to allow access to producers or network owners wishing to distribute district heating production. Access must be allowed through connection of the network owner’s pipelines on reasonable terms which guarantee long-term security of delivery. If competition arises via access, the supervisory authority shall instruct the actors operating within the district heating network in question to carry out a legal separation between production, distribution and trading within the network. This obligation to allow access will replace the existing obligation to negotiate that is stipulated in the current District Heating Act. Experience has shown that the provisions concerning the obligation to negotiate with regard to access to pipelines has not had the intended effect. Nor has the possibility of mediation by the District Heating Board had the desired effect. The proposal thus entails the introduction of regulated third party access. Moreover, the proposal goes further in relation to the current District Heating Act. Third-party access is compulsory, with no network exempted. The obligation to separate operations within an integrated company also follows automatically when a competition situation arises, but there the supervisory authority has the possibility of making exceptions in so far as the costs of separation would be disproportionately large in relation to its benefit. For a competitive market as proposed by the Inquiry to function optimally, above all in terms of technology, the Inquiry has regarded it as necessary to introduce a system function responsibility for the district heating networks – a system operator responsibility. In cases where only one network owner operates on the market in question, this network owner will also be the system operator. In the cases where several network owners operate in the same market a joint responsibility for the system operator function will be prescribed. The network owners themselves can organise this responsibility either by procuring the system operator service or by forming a joint company for the purpose. The proposal also includes an expanded exemption from the municipal siting principle location for the municipal heating companies.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>One of the purposes of the new regulations is to create rules that facilitate the entry of new actors into the markets. In this way effective competition can be created. Effective competition benefits both the development of district heating as a heating alternative, which is regarded as positive from the environmental perspective, and district heating customers in the long-term. Regulated third-party access in accordance with the proposal appears to the Inquiry to be appropriate on the basis of the conditions now prevalent in the district heating sector. It is also necessary to enable the objectives in the terms of reference to be fulfilled and finally be balanced in such a way that public benefit is in reasonable proportion to the cost incurred by the actors concerned. The supervisory authority will be responsible for supervision of the Act. The supervisory authority will have an increased responsibility, which will probably require some additional resources. At the same time the duties of the District Heating Board, which was set up in 2008, will cease when the proposed District Heating Act comes into force. Some parts of the proposal submitted by the Inquiry in this report may entail increased costs for the district heating companies. The Inquiry’s assessment is that all in all the proposal will entail increased costs mainly for district heating companies and the supervisory authority. In the opinion of the Inquiry, the conditions of competition, and thus also the expected competitive outcome, will be different for different district heating markets. District heating customers will thereby also be affected in different ways depending on which district heating market they belong to. It is difficult to estimate in advance the long-term effects and consequences for each market affected. An evaluation of the effects of the reform and how the targets of the reform are met should therefore be carried out after about three years.</p>
