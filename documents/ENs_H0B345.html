<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Points of departure</h2>
<p>The Inquiry's terms of reference are to explore the incidence of violence, threats and violations affecting foreign women and their children who have been granted residence permits on the grounds of ties with a person resident in Sweden. We are also required to identify the needs of these vulnerable women for initiatives from public authorities and to present proposals on how these initiatives can be improved. In order to understand the problem complex, we have undertaken our own analysis of the legislation. This analysis has revealed a number of shortcomings. We will therefore also present proposals for amendments to the legislation.</p>
<p>Our task has its focus on women and the report therefore discusses these women extensively. Our point of departure, however, is that it is men’s violence and violations of women and children that are the problem. In our opinion, the issues dealt with in this Inquiry and our proposals for solutions must be based on an understanding of the fact that the violence and control that men exercise against women with temporary residence permits, like all other violence against women, is a question of women’s human rights and a Swedish gender equality problem. Our proposals have been presented on the basis of this fundamental principle.</p>
<h2>The children</h2>
<p>The situation of children accompanying their parents is complex and particularly problematic. It is often claimed by children’s organisations that children are invisible to the authorities and in the legislative process. We consider that this applies particularly to the migration process where there is a deferred examination of immigrant status. Our task, however, is to identify the needs of the affected women, even though the children accompanying their parents are also mentioned in our terms of reference. Our conclusion is that there are very strong grounds for a separate investigation that reviews the situation of children in the context of the two-year rule (the two-year rule means that a citizen outside the EU who comes to Sweden because of ties with a person resident in Sweden usually only receives a temporary residence permit during a probationary period of 2 years. See also below, under 'the two-year rule must be investigated further').</p>
<p>Several children’s organisations, such as End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes (ECPAT), the Office of the Children’s Ombudsman and Children’s Rights in Society (BRIS) have stated that the situation of these children is often considerably more complex than that of other children who are exposed to violence. These children are moved from their previous contexts, with their mothers as the only familiar point, to a foreign country with another language. Our review shows that it sometimes happens that these children are expelled after as long as three years in Sweden, even though they have been directly or indirectly exposed to violence during their stay in Sweden. From a children’s perspective, this is not acceptable. Children may be affected in several different ways. In the worst case, the child may be the primary target of a man committing crimes of violence or violations, such as sexual abuse. In other cases, both the woman and the child are exposed to violence or violations. Even in cases where the violence is only directed at the mother, the child may be exposed as a witness.</p>
<h2>The survey – methods</h2>
<p>Investigating the incidence of violence is a very difficult task, since in a large number of cases, it remains undetected. This applies particularly to women who stay in Sweden more temporarily and who may have language difficulties. We have made the assessment that it was pointless to try to reach these women directly via mail or telephone. Such an investigation could be dangerous for these women and give misleading answers. Instead, therefore, we have used questionnaires to find out the extent to which public authorities and women’s shelters have had contact with women and children who have temporary residence permits on the grounds of ties with a person resident in Sweden and who have been exposed to violence or violations. The answers to these questionnaires indicate how large the problem is. Apart from this, we have held in-depth interviews with four women who have been affected.</p>
<h2>The questionnaire</h2>
<p>The investigation was intended to give an answer to the following four questions: - How many women in Sweden with residence permits on the grounds of ties with persons resident in Sweden have been affected by violence? - How many accompanying children do these women have? - What country do these women come from? - To whom are these women referred for support and assistance?</p>
<p>The questionnaire was addressed to municipal social services, the police authorities, emergency clinics in health and medical care and non-profit women’s and crime-victim shelters in five counties. These were Västernorrland, Gävleborg, Värmland, Stockholm and Skåne. This means that the questionnaire covered 92 of Sweden’s 290 municipalities.</p>
<p>The meaning of the questionnaire was for the recipient to register, over a three-month period, the number of women that the organisation had met who had come to Sweden with temporary residence permits on the grounds of ties with a man, and where there was reason to assume that they had been exposed to violence. The number of accompanying children, the country of origin and the organisation/authority to which these women were referred for support and assistance were also to be registered.</p>
<p>Apart from this, an open question was posed in the questionnaire, in which the recipient was given the opportunity to formulate their own views.</p>
<p>The response rate is considered to be around 50 per cent.</p>
<p>The results showed that, over the three-month period, the recipients had met a minimum of 491 and a maximum of 1 040 women who had come to Sweden on the grounds of ties, and where there was reason to assume that they had been exposed to violence. For the Inquiry, the number of women was considerably larger than expected. The fact that there was an assumption of violence for so many women in a limited target group in only five counties in Sweden over a three-month period appears remarkable. Calculated for the whole of Sweden, and in view of the 50 per cent response rate, this would indicate that several thousand foreign women were involved per year. In addition to this, of course, are the undetected cases – women who have been exposed to violence without having contact with public authorities or shelters. It can be noted that, at present, over 10 000 women come to Sweden every year on the grounds of ties with a person resident in Sweden.</p>
<p>In addition, a minimum of 256 and a maximum of 980 children who have been living with these registered women are involved. Calculated on the same basis as above for the whole of Sweden per year, and in view of the response rate, this would also involve thousands of children who live together with women where there is reason to assume that they have been exposed to violence and who have been in touch with public authorities or shelters.</p>
<p>The countries from which these vulnerable women come are primarily Iraq, Iran, Brazil, Kosovo, Mongolia, Thailand and certain countries in Africa. The women are mainly referred to the social services for advice and support.</p>
<p>In the open question, the majority of recipients stated that there were major discrepancies in the statistics in this area, and that it is important for surveys to be made and for methods to be developed to reach this group.</p>
<h2>The in-depth interviews</h2>
<p>The Inquiry held in-depth interviews with four women. These interviews show that the situation of these four women differs, but that there are also certain common denominators. All the women met their husbands in their countries of origin and have said that there they felt that each of them was a loving person. Three of the women lived in stable circumstances in their countries of origin. All of them moved to Sweden because of their love for these men. What was felt to be hardest was that the violence was reinforced by the fact that, in different ways, they became isolated and were not in command of the Swedish language or the Swedish culture. The women have described how they always felt that they were in an inferior position and that the husbands had total control over them. This was compounded by their uncertainty about their possibilities of staying in Sweden. A return to their country of origin was not an alternative for any of the women; they hoped that their situation would improve. With reference to the violence, all four gave witness to having ended up in hell, and to having been broken down, both mentally and physically. All the women, however, were finally forced to leave their husbands in order to survive. For three of the women interviewed, this meant the risk of being expelled from Sweden. At the same time, breaking up was associated with major difficulties, since in three of the four cases, the husbands had deliberately isolated them. In two relationships, the definitive breakup was preceded by several temporary break-ups. Two of the women describe how they were persecuted and harassed after the break-up. All of the women state that they have received a great deal of assistance and support from women’s shelters but that assistance from the social services varied, depending on the caseworker. Three of the women expressed disappointment at the Swedish Migration Board’s treatment of them, and its processing of their cases.</p>
<h2>The two-year rule must be investigated further</h2>
<p>Close relative immigrants make up a growing proportion of those receiving residence permits in this country. In 2010, a total of 74 000 persons were granted residence permits in Sweden. Nineteen thousand of these received them on the grounds of ties with a person who is resident in Sweden.</p>
<p>The foreigner who first permanently cohabits abroad with the person with whom they have ties normally receives a permanent residence permit immediately. However, those foreigners who have not previously cohabited with the person with whom they have ties (what is termed newly established relationships) have to undergo what is termed a deferred examination of their immigrant status. This means that the foreigner first receives a temporary residence permit for two years. If the relationship continues after two years, the foreigner can apply for a permanent residence permit on the grounds of continued ties. Making a foreigner live in Sweden with a probationary period is an exception to what normally applies for migration to Sweden. The main rule in the Aliens Act is that a person who is approved for residence receives a permanent residence permit. Newly established relationships have increased significantly over the past decade. The most recent Government review of the legislation in 1999 showed that one third of cases based on ties with a person resident in Sweden involved newly established relationships. In the past two years, newly established relationships have represented 90 per cent of cases involving ties with a person resident in Sweden. This means that the exception with a probationary period affects not just a limited number, but actually the absolute majority of one of our largest immigrant groups.</p>
<p>The two-year rule is actually more of a three-year rule. After two years with a temporary residence permit in Sweden, it is possible to apply for a permanent residence permit on the grounds of ties, if the relationship is enduring. The relationship must, however, also endure when the Swedish Migration Board examines the case, which, because of waiting times, is very likely to take place one year later. Confusion over the concept of the two-year rule is considerable. Many foreign women try to stay in their relationships for two years in order to receive a permanent residence permit since it may be difficult for them to return. The fact that the decisive point in time is the Board ' s examination is not known by many people. This, of course, makes the rule even more difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Research has shown that women immigrants with temporary residence permits have less access to legal solutions to fight the violence exercised by men against them than other women who are exposed to violence. It has also been documented that the legal regulation of residence permits for women immigrants is of key importance for women ' s abilities to protect themselves against violence by leaving violent men. The Aliens Act has also been particularly criticised in research. This criticism is based on the lack of gender equality ambitions to combat men ' s violence against women in close relationships. The statements in the preparatory documents to the Act are especially criticised, where the focus is put on women’s motives for migrating to Sweden, while no mention is made of men’s views, motives or the fact that problems arise through men using violence.</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that the two-year rule must be investigated. In our opinion, it is unreasonable to have legislation that contributes to women staying in violent relationships at the same time as the task of society is to protect women against violence. The legislation means that it is the foreigner, and most often a woman, who alone bears the risk if the relationship ends during the first years, and moreover alone, or together with her child, must bear the consequences of violence. The person with whom an immigrant has ties, usually a man, is, on the other hand, able to make use of the legislation through his superior situation. Our investigations indicate that the number of men who systematically exploit the legislation is by no means small.</p>
<p>All in all, gender equality reasons strongly indicate against the two-year rule. The work-first principle also indicates against the rule. In October 2011, the Government appointed an Inquiry under the Ministry of Employment, tasked with increasing labour force participation and speeding up introduction into the labour market of newly arrived women and close relative immigrants.</p>
<p>One reason for the two-year rule is that it allows a generous examination of a permit application on the first occasion when the temporary residence permit is granted. At that point in time, the authorities’ examination does not need to be so detailed, since it only involves a temporary residence permit. The seriousness and sustainability of a relationship are revealed, so to speak, through the probationary period. We believe that it is better for the main weight of this examination to be given to the first occasion, since it reduces human suffering. How such legislation could be designed must, however, be more closely examined.</p>
<h2>Greater controls to prevent women and children from coming to Sweden and becoming the victims of crime</h2>
<p>So long as the two-year rule exists, the foreigner is placed in a subordinate position in relation to the person with whom they have ties. For women and their accompanying children, this means a greater risk of violence and violations. We believe that it is the task of the legislation to primarily try to identify non-serious persons with residence in Sweden citing ties with foreigners and to prevent them from being given the opportunity to bring women to Sweden through their ties with them. There are today a number of men who deliberately make use of the system. We consider that the focus should be more extensively given to the persons citing close ties, by using greater control measures. If the system manages to identify these, greater controls do not need to affect the serious couples who together seek a future in Sweden. We also consider that Swedish society must more extensively shoulder responsibility for woman and children, as victims of crime, if the public authorities are not able to prevent them from coming to Sweden and from being exploited here and exposed to abuse by men living in Sweden. Our next proposal is therefore an improved protective rule for these women and children, see below. Our point of departure, however, is that the focus should be on preventing children and women coming to Sweden and becoming the victims of crime here.</p>
<p>There is a loophole in the legislation, meaning that it is no longer possible for the authorities to reject an application for a residence permit if there is a risk that the foreigner or the foreigner’s children may be assumed to be exposed to violence or other serious violation if the foreigner and the person with whom they have ties are married . The general opinion is that this is an unfortunate, but necessary, consequence of the incorporation into legislation of the Family Reunification Directive in 2006. We have made a legal analysis of our own concerning the incorporation of the Family Reunification Directive. This analysis of the legislative process shows that it is fully possible, in national legislation, to retain the provision on rejecting an application for a residence permit, even for married persons who are covered by the Family Reunification Directive, if there is a risk of violence/violations.</p>
<p>Basically, the Family Reunification Directive is also related to the problem of women receiving residence permits on the grounds of ties with a person resident in Sweden only to a limited extent. The Family Reunification Directive requires that third country citizens be given the right to reunification in Sweden if one of the parties is resident here and can be expected to receive a permanent residence permit. There are also a number of exemptions in the Directive. This means that the Family Reunification Directive in fact only concerns a small proportion of all cases involving ties with a person resident in Sweden. Sweden, however, chose to voluntarily extend it to all citizens. This means that in its legislative process, Sweden distanced itself, to a high degree, from the purpose of the Directive, which was to provide third country families with protection. Instead, the door was opened for persons resident in Sweden who had ties with people abroad to have the unconditional right to be reunited with their spouses. Some of these have now proved to be women who suffer significant harm.</p>
<p>The result of the incorporation of the Family Reunification Directive into Swedish legislation was that one category of foreigners ended up in a special situation, that is, those who were married when the first application was submitted, but who had not lived together permanently abroad. Since such a relationship will, on the one hand, continue to be classified as a newly established relationship, the foreigner will continue to undergo a deferred examination of their immigrant status. On the other hand, however, the authorities are prevented from making a risk assessment and from examining the seriousness of a relationship. We believe that this is an illogical and unreasonable consequence. If a foreigner is to undergo a deferred examination of their immigrant status, we believe that a minimum requirement should be that the Board is able to make a full prior examination of the application. We believe that the legislator must make a decision here. If this group of married foreigners is to be exposed to a deferred examination of their immigrant status, they must also be protected by an examination of the risk of violence/seriousness of the relationship. The alternative is to also give this group of married foreigners a permanent residence permit from the beginning.</p>
<p>We believe that the risk assessment of violence and violations and the examination of seriousness must also include married people in the future. We consider that this is consistent with the requirements of the Family Reunification Directive.</p>
<p>Another possible solution is thus that married foreigners will no longer be included in the group requiring a deferred examination of their immigrant status.</p>
<p>If, after a thorough analysis, the Government is of the opposite opinion, there is also a third possibility. Since the Directive only includes third country citizens, one solution would be to let the risk assessment and examination of seriousness include all newly established relationships apart from those cases that concern third country citizens. This would mean that the paragraph concerning the risk of violence and violations would apply to everyone who had not lived together abroad, even those who had married before the application was made. In view of the Family Reunification Directive, an exemption could be made from this for third country citizens who were married. This would be a watertight solution in relation to the Family Reunification Directive. In this way, the majority of newly established relationships in which there is a risk of violence/violations could be prevented. This would considerably improve the legislative problem, although it would not solve it completely.</p>
<p>The Swedish Migration Board must thus undertake a risk assessment and examination of seriousness in all cases of newly established relationships. We propose that this Swedish Migration Board examination always include extracts from criminal registers, police registers and the population register as a general rule. Only where there is reason to assume that there is no risk of violence or violations, will it be unnecessary to include this type of documentation. What applies now, according to the preparatory documents of the Aliens Act, is that extracts from criminal registers, police registers and population registers must be included if there is reason to do so, or special grounds for doing so.</p>
<h2>Protection for victims of crime</h2>
<p>Apart from the two-year rule, the protective rule for women in the Aliens Act has also been criticised, both by women ' s organisations and by the research community. Confusion about concepts is considerable. Neither women’s shelters, nor experienced embassies manage to advise women who are exposed to violence, since the protective rule is so unclear and therefore not predictable. The purpose of the protective rule is that women exposed to violence should not need to stay in a violent relationship. If a relationship ends before the temporary residence permit period expires, the foreigner can still receive a permanent residence permit under current legislation, if the relationship has ceased primarily because the foreigner or the foreigner’s children have been exposed to violence or other serious violation of their freedom or peace of mind in that relationship. This rule is, however, severely limited by the statement in the Government Bill. It involves a total of 6 different criteria. These are: 1. Cohabitation must have lasted a certain amount of time. How long is unclear, but four months is too short a time. Nine months may be sufficient, but this is not certain. 2. The violence/violations must be of a certain extent; single, less serious acts of violence are not sufficient. 3. If the woman returns to the man, the violence is less serious. 4. The relationship must have ended because of the violence. 5. Violence or violations must be reported before the temporary residence permit has expired. 6. The relationship must have been serious from the beginning.</p>
<p>We believe that all of these criteria, apart from point 6, are unnecessary. They are primarily based on the idea that, without these criteria, a woman could evade the Aliens Act. Our survey shows that the requirement for cohabitation to have lasted for a certain amount of time represents a major obstacle to women. The criteria also give the impression that an immigrant woman who has been exposed to violence must achieve a specific degree of violence in order to qualify herself. Today there is knowledge that shows that violence against women in close relationships follows a specific pattern. This also means that women may be broken down without more severe violence. For foreign women with possible language difficulties, the lack of a contact network and poorer knowledge of Swedish society, the situation may be even worse. In view of this, we find it offensive that foreign women are not included in the protective rule if the violence is less serious. Today there is also knowledge about how difficult a process of breaking up may be for a woman, precisely because the violence breaks her down and the abuse finally appears to her to be the norm. The criteria relating to a reduction in the severity of violence if the woman returns to her husband and to the relationship having ended because of the violence do not take account of this knowledge and therefore appear antiquated.</p>
<p>We thus now propose a new protective rule, without the limitations of the previous criteria. It must be sufficient for the woman to show with all probability that violence or serious violations of her or the child have occurred in the relationship.</p>
<p>Even with this simplified protective rule, major initiatives will continue to be required in the future by the vulnerable woman to protect herself and any children. The break-up process is particularly complicated and requires a good deal of support. In criminal cases, therefore, an injured party counsel for the victim is regularly appointed. For violence and violations committed by a person resident in Sweden against a person with whom they have ties, there is the additional legal difficulty with the deferred examination of immigrant status. Our inquiry shows that what is termed the twoyear rule is difficult to deal with. In order to be able to make use of one’s rights, legal skills are required. We propose that a woman who reports violence/serious violations in the relationship targeted at herself or the child be entitled to a public counsel.</p>
<h2>Information and coordination</h2>
<p>The deferred examination of immigrant status entails a risk for the foreigner, since she (usually a woman) may need to leave the country if the relationship ends. Today, this risk is borne by the foreigner alone, while the person with whom they have ties may begin a relationship with another foreigner after the break-up. As we have analysed, this uneven distribution of risks entails a gender equality problem, since it means a shift in power. The consequences for the foreigner may be very serious. So long as the deferred examination of immigrant status is maintained, the relationship will also be characterised by inequality. A minimum requirement is that the foreigner is aware, from the beginning, of her situation before she leaves her country of origin. We propose therefore that the Swedish Migration Board, through Swedish missions abroad, provide all applicants with information, in which the procedure of deferred examination of immigrant status and its consequences is described in a detailed manner. Our proposal was submitted by the Government as early as 1999, but has not been realised. This should now occur at once, via a Government commission.</p>
<p>We also concur with the proposal presented by the Inquiry on civic orientation for newly arrived immigrants for those who have temporary residence permits on the grounds of ties with persons resident in Sweden to be also included in the right to information about society and for municipalities to actively seek out those persons who are entitled to information about society.</p>
<p>A special inquiry has also been tasked with increasing labour market participation and speeding up the introduction into the labour market of newly arrived women born abroad and close relative immigrants. Its report is to be presented no later than October 2012 (ToR 2011:88). We expect that this inquiry too will present important proposals that will promote these women’s entry into Swedish society and thereby reduce their dependence on their husbands. A person who is covered by the introduction legislation is included in the reception of recently arrived persons, parents are</p>
<p>covered by the Introduction Act with the right to an establishment plan and children are given an organised introduction.</p>
<p>Finally, we propose that the county administrative boards coordinate initiatives to help and support women and children who come to Sweden on the grounds of ties with a person resident in Sweden, and who come to substantial harm. In our opinion, measures must be introduced that are targeted at these women and children, to identify and support them. The public authorities must collaborate to help these women and children. Important actors are the social services, women’s shelters, the Swedish Migration Board, county councils, Swedish for Immigrant principals, schools, the police authorities and prosecutors. The county administrative boards should coordinate these efforts.</p>
<p>One county administrative board should also be given the national task of disseminating information and method support. The county administrative board in Värmland has considerable experience and knowledge in this field. This county administrative board should therefore be given national coordination responsibility.</p>
