<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>A New Biobanks Act</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a new Biobanks Act concerning the collection and storage of human biological material (tissue samples). The new Act is a revision of the current Biobanks in Medical Care Act (2002:297). The purpose of the Act remains unchanged. The Act will regulate how tissue samples may be collected, stored and used for certain purposes, while respecting the privacy of the individual.</p>
<p>The primary differences between the new Biobanks Act and the current Act are as follows:</p>
<p>• The proposed version expands the  scope  of the Act. The current Act applies to tissue samples from the medical care system only, while the proposed Act also covers samples from other activities.</p>
<p>• Under the current Act, the  consent  of the donor to collect and store tissue samples must be obtained for all types of samples. Under the proposed Act, it will be possible to collect and store tissue samples for use in the care and treatment of the donor and for certain limited purposes, provided the donor does not object  to this. The donor must be informed and retains his or her right to self-determination. In other cases, express consent is required.</p>
<p>• The Inquiry proposes regulations on  traceability . Tissue samples from the medical care system must be registered in the Swedish Biobank Registry. Other samples must in any case be registered at the biobank. It will be possible for the registered individual to object to information about a tissue sample being registered in the Swedish Biobank Registry.</p>
<p>• Furthermore, the Inquiry proposes that  processing of personal data  by biobanks be subject to regulation, which is not the case in the current Act. Such regulation would clarify where responsibility for personal data lies, the purposes for which personal data may be processed and what personal data may be processed. In addition, it is proposed that the donor be given the right to object to the processing of his or her personal data. Finally, regulations covering IT security are proposed.</p>
<p>• The proposed Act provides less formal yet clearer requirements for the  release of tissue samples  from biobanks. The current restrictions concerning which samples may be released will be abolished. At the same time, new requirements are proposed that specify, among other things, that traceability and the donor’s right to self-determination are to be maintained even after a sample is released.</p>
<p>• The Inquiry proposes that in certain circumstances it should be possible to release tissue samples from a biobank for the  identification  of deceased persons and for investigation into paternity  or parenthood according to Chapter 1, Section 9 of the Children and Parents Code.</p>
<p>• Tissue samples from biobanks that are subject to the Biobanks Act will be prohibited from use in  criminal investigations .</p>
<h2>Background to the Inquiry’s work</h2>
<p>In Sweden, as many other countries, tissue samples are to a large extent stored in biobanks, primarily within the medical care system but also for research and clinical trials of pharmaceuticals, etc. In the 1990s, the issue of biobanks in Sweden and their regulation was the subject of discussion. These discussions concerned such matters as the kind of privacy protection that should be introduced regarding donors. Millions of tissue samples were stored without the donors being informed of this and without them having the opportunity to form an opinion as to the purpose of such storage. The debate resulted in the current Biobanks in Medical Care Act, which entered into force in 2003.</p>
<p>The Act was criticised for leading to increased administration and costs within the medical care system and within the research community. Representatives of the medical care system protested that the requirements of the Biobanks in Medical Care Act took time from medical care and that risks to patient security could arise. Some of the criticism dealt with the Act being considered complicated and unclear.</p>
<p>In 2003, a debate also arose as to whether the Biobanks in Medical Care Act provided adequate protection to personal privacy. The Police Service and public prosecutor had confiscated a tissue sample from the PKU biobank during the investigation into the murder of Minister for Foreign Affairs Anna Lindh, which led to a discussion on whether this could be justified, especially since criminal investigations were not one of the intended purposes of the biobank.</p>
<p>The current Inquiry was appointed in 2008 and has been tasked with reviewing the current Biobanks in Medical Care Act in a number of different respects. According to the Government’s terms of reference, the Inquiry’s starting point was that tissue samples are to be available for both the care and treatment of patients and for research, while protecting the privacy and right to self-determination of the individual donor.</p>
<p>The basic conflict concerns making tissue samples available for care, treatment and research on the one hand, while ensuring the privacy of the donor on the other. If samples are made easily available, protection of the individual suffers, while if the Act strengthens the protection of privacy, research requiring samples from biobanks is impeded.</p>
<p>At the same time, it should be kept in mind that there is broad support for the value of good care and treatment as well as for the value of being able to conduct successful research, two activities that go hand in hand and are interdependent. There is good reason to assume that donors in general  are positive to allowing samples being used for both care and treatment and for research, but there is no reason to presume that all  donors would have that attitude.</p>
<p>To strike a balance between the two, the Inquiry has conducted ethical analyses of the issues. The issues that have been analysed are whether the scope of the Act should be expanded, whether forms of consent should be differentiated, whether registering tissue samples in the national biobank registry should be allowed, whether forms for the release and transfer of tissue samples and biobanks should be changed, and whether the possibility of using tissue samples in criminal investigations should be abolished.</p>
<h2>Scope of the Biobanks Act, etc.</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  expanding of the scope of the new Biobanks Act. The Act will apply to biobanks in Sweden holding identifiable tissue samples: - in research and education, - in activities relating to the production of pharmaceutical and medical technology products, and - in other comparable activities.</p>
<p>The current Biobanks in Medical Care Act only covers tissue samples from the medical care system. The proposal concerning an expanded area of application for the Biobanks Act means that more donors will be protected by the provisions of the Act. The activities of the pharmaceuticals industry will be covered by the proposal.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that the Biobanks Act is to apply to identifiable tissue samples collected from donors or deceased persons stored by biobanks covered by the Act.</p>
<p>The provisions of the Biobanks Act regarding selfdetermination cannot be applied when tissue samples are taken abroad. Such samples are, however, subject to the provisions of the Act when they are collected for biobanks in Sweden.</p>
<p>According to the Biobanks Act, tissue samples taken within the framework of one principal’s activities but collected for another principal’s biobank are to be regarded as belonging to the latter principal. For example, tissue samples collected within the medical care system but intended for use in clinical trials at a pharmaceuticals company are regarded as having been collected for the company’s biobank and not for the medical care system’s biobank. This means that such samples are not to be regarded as having been released from the medical care system’s biobank.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that the Biobanks Act is not to apply to tissue samples that have only been stored while awaiting analysis. The Act is, however, to apply if samples are stored longer than six months of being taken or if they are stored or used for any purpose other than that for which they were taken.</p>
<p>The proposed amendments mean that the exception for routine samples is expanded to apply beyond the medical care system. The exception period begins when the sample is taken and not when the analysis is made, so it will not be possible to store samples for an extended period prior to analysis. At the same time, the time limit is extended from two to six months.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that the Biobanks Act is not to apply if a tissue sample has been processed so that its original properties have been changed to a considerable degree.</p>
<p>In vitro  fertilisation of a human ovum or similar measures is not to mean that the Biobanks Act no longer applies to the ovum.</p>
<p>Nor is normal processing of tissue samples at the biobank to result in the Act ceasing to be applicable. It is only when the tissue sample has been processed so that it constitutes a product or a research outcome that it may no longer be appropriate to view it as a tissue sample. For example, a tissue sample that is included in a pharmaceutical or medical technology product must be regarded as having been changed to such an extent that the Biobanks Act cannot be applicable.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the establishment of an identifiable cell line from a fertilised human ovum or from an ovum that has been the object of somatic cell nucleus transfer does not in itself mean that the original properties have been changed to a considerable degree. The Act is thus to apply to such cell lines.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that the Biobanks Act is to apply to tissue samples that are collected and stored for transfusion, transplantation, insemination, in vitro  fertilisation or for the production of pharmaceutical or medical technology products only if they are stored longer than six months of being taken or if they are stored or used for any other purpose than that for which they were taken.</p>
<p>The Biobanks Act will not apply to blood samples or other tissue samples from a donor when the samples are only stored for quality assurance when used in connection with transfusions or transplantation. This concerns samples that are stored to protect the safety of the recipient.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that the Genetic Integrity Act be amended to give donors of sperm for insemination the same privacy protection as donors of sperm for in vitro  fertilisation.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  only minor amendments to the provisions in the Biobanks Act concerning various purposes. The purpose concerning clinical trials is to be included in that concerning research. Transfusion and transplantation, as well as production of pharmaceuticals and medical technology products, are to be listed as individual purposes.</p>
<h2>Information and consent</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  differentiation of the regulations for consent in the Biobanks Act. Under the current Act, the consent of the donor to collect and store tissue samples must be obtained for all types of samples. Under the Inquiry’s proposal, it will be possible to collect and store tissue samples for use in the care and treatment of the donor for certain limited purposes, provided that the donor does not object to this. A sample may not be stored against the donor’s will.</p>
<p>Apart from care and treatment, tissue samples may be stored for quality assurance and development work within the framework of medical activities as well as for training that is conducted in conjunction with the medical care system. Furthermore, tissue samples may be stored for later use in research. The donor will be given the opportunity to specifically object to the storage of tissue samples for these purposes.</p>
<p>For other purposes, express consent is required, especially when tissue samples are collected for research, including clinical trials. In such cases, the provisions of the Act concerning the Ethical Review of Research involving Humans (2003:460, also known as the Ethical Review Act ) and the Medicinal Products Act (1992:859) will apply. When samples that have been stored for later use in research are considered for use in a research project, an ethical review board will decide which requirements are to apply regarding information and consent for use of the tissue samples (Section 15 of the Ethical Review Act).</p>
<p>Our proposal calls for the collector of tissue samples to be required to inform the donor of the right to self-determination, the reason for collecting and storing the tissue sample and the purpose of the biobank. Since the Inquiry now proposes that samples in many cases may be collected as long as the donor does not object, it is particularly important to ensure that adequate information is always provided. Adequate information will provide the donor with the necessary knowledge to decide whether he or she wants to agree or disagree to the sample being collected and stored in the biobank.</p>
<p>Regarding minors, the legal guardian will, as is the case today, have the right to decide whether a tissue sample is collected and stored in a biobank until the minor has reached an age and maturity where he or she can make a decision on their own.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes , however, that a tissue sample from a minor may be collected and stored in a biobank against the wishes of the legal guardian if a clear risk of damage to the health of the minor would otherwise arise. In such cases, the tissue sample may only be used for the care and treatment of the minor.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that a tissue sample may be collected and stored in a biobank even if the donor, due to illness, mental disturbance, weakened state of health or similar circumstances, cannot take a decision on the issue (lacks decision-making capacity). As a general rule, such samples may only be used for purposes that do not require the express consent of the donor.</p>
<p>Swedish law does not yet contain an arrangement regarding the representation of those who lack decision-making capacity that is appropriate for use in the Biobanks Act. Those who lack decisionmaking capacity must nevertheless have access to good quality care on the same terms as everyone else. Such tissue samples may, in the Inquiry’s view, also be stored for future research, since research into people with dementia-related illnesses, for example, would otherwise suffer considerably.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that the Biobanks Act makes clear that special provisions in other acts concerning the taking of tissue samples, with or without consent that differ from what is stated in the Biobanks Act are also to apply to the collection and storage of the samples. A tissue sample that was taken with the support of such a provision may be stored and used for the purpose for which it was taken under the conditions that apply to the taking of the sample.</p>
<p>This concerns such matters as communicable disease regulations and provisions on compulsory mental care. Under these regulations, samples may be taken regardless of the donor’s position. In addition, there are regulations with stricter or different requirements concerning consent than those of the Biobanks Act, such as Chapters 5–7 of the Genetic Integrity Act. Under these regulations on assisted fertilisation and other issues, consent is also required from the individual in the couple being treated who is not the donor. These regulations, too, are to be applied rather than the provisions of the Biobanks Act.</p>
<p>In principle, however, tissue samples may not be stored or used for any new purpose without adhering to the provisions of the Biobanks Act.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that a tissue sample may be used for another purpose than that for which it was previously stored only if the provisions of the Biobanks Act concerning collection and storage are followed for the new purpose. Concerning new purposes for tissue samples from deceased persons, close relatives of the deceased are to be given the opportunity to object to the purpose.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that the donor can, at any time, decide that a collected tissue sample is to be destroyed or only used for certain purposes. The proposal gives the donor the unconditional right to have the tissue sample destroyed. Consent can also be withdrawn under the current Act, but then the biobank has the option of deidentifying the sample rather than destroying it. The tissue sample is to be destroyed as soon as is possible after notification is given, rather than immediately, which is the requirement of the current text of the Act.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that a tissue sample that is stored in a biobank may be de-identified only if the provisions of the Biobanks Act concerning collection and storage are followed with regard to de-identification. However, this is not to apply when the tissue sample is from a deceased person. Compared with the current Act, the proposal increases the donor’s right to selfdetermination.</p>
<h2>Traceability and processing of personal data</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that the Swedish Biobank Registry be regulated by law. The registry is to contain enough information to allow every tissue sample that belongs to or has belonged to any of the participating biobanks to be retrieved. Information such as the donor’s active position is to be registered. All care providers – but not others – are to be obliged to provide this information to the Swedish Biobank Registry. If a donor objects to a tissue sample being stored, it will then not be registered in the Swedish Biobank Registry. It will also be possible for the registered person to specifically object to information about a tissue sample being registered in the Swedish Biobank Registry. In this case, information is only registered within the organisation where the sample was taken.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has been tasked with proposing traceability regulations for tissue samples The Inquiry considers that adequate documentation must always exist to enable the identification of every tissue sample that belongs to, or has belonged to, the biobanks, so that donors are able to utilise their right to selfdetermination.</p>
<p>Under its terms of reference, the Inquiry has also been tasked with considering the establishment of regional biobank registries. The National Biobanks Council has, however, already done considerable work on establishing the Swedish Biobank Registry. This work is now so advanced that the system will soon be launched. The Inquiry has weighed the pros and cons of registering all tissue samples in the Swedish Biobank Registry and found that the benefits prevail when samples are collected within the medical care system.</p>
<p>The main benefit is that it will become easier for donors who want to change their position on whether a sample may continue to be stored if it is registered in the Swedish Biobank Registry. This is particularly relevant when a donor has given samples in a number of different circumstances, such as at a private clinic, then at a clinic at a county hospital and then within the highly specialist medical care system of another county council. It can also be the case that the donor has moved and thus given samples in different parts of the country. It cannot be assumed that a donor remembers the circumstances under which the samples were taken for storage at the biobank.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that biobanks – outside the medical care system – that collect or store tissue samples without registering them in the Swedish Biobank Registry are to be required to keep a registry (biobank register) with data that are equivalent to that stored in the Swedish Biobank Registry.</p>
<p>When tissue samples that are not registered in the Swedish Biobank Registry are collected for a biobank that has another principal than the one collecting the samples, they are also to be registered where they are collected.</p>
<p>The reason for registration of this kind is to ensure that the biobanks provide adequate traceability.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  special provisions on the processing of personal data in the Biobanks Act. The provisions are to provide privacy protection for the individual when personal data is processed at the biobank.</p>
<p>The provisions on personal data in the Biobanks Act are not to apply to the processing of personal data relating to care and treatment, research or other such activities that are conducted in connection with the biobank.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that a biobank may process personal data for the following reasons: - to guarantee the traceability of tissue samples in activities conducted in accordance with the Biobanks Act, - for the submission of information and the release of tissue samples that take place in accordance with acts or ordinances, and - for supervision, research and the generation of statistics.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that a biobank may only process personal data concerning: - the donor’s identity, - other people involved in a decision on the storage of the sample tissues, - the position taken regarding the storage of tissue samples, - the identity, character and use of tissue samples, - who processes information or tissue samples, and - to whom the tissue sample is released, transferred or provided.</p>
<p>Information concerning analysis results, diagnoses or similar matters may not be processed.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that personal data may not be processed if the individual objects in cases where the storage of the associated tissue sample is dependent on the individual's position on storage. If, in such a case, the individual opposes the processing of personal data after it has begun, the data is to be destroyed as soon as possible. Other forms of processing personal data that are permissible under the Biobanks Act are to be permitted even if the individual is opposed to such action.</p>
<p>The proposal introduces a right to self-determination which prevents the Swedish Biobank Registry and other biobank registries from processing personal data against the wishes of the donor except in cases when tissue samples may be stored regardless of the donor’s position (for example, in communicable disease control and compulsory mental care).</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  regulations requiring the party responsible for personal data to provide a high level of IT security.</p>
<h2>Release and transfer</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  less formal yet clearer requirements concerning the release of tissue samples from biobanks. The current Biobanks in Medical Care Act contains restrictions on the types of samples that may be released and a ban on the release of tissue samples that have already been released. The Inquiry proposes that these regulations be revoked. Instead, the Inquiry proposes the introduction of a series of new and adjusted requirements.</p>
<p>The Biobanks Act is to stipulate that tissue samples belonging to a biobank may not be released for purposes that are contrary to the purposes for which the biobank is registered or contrary to the purposes for which the tissue samples are stored.</p>
<p>In addition, tissue samples are not to be released if there is reason to assume that the recipient lacks the ability to handle the tissue samples in accordance with the requirements of the Biobanks Act.</p>
<p>Before tissue samples are released, the releasing biobank is to be required to make it conditional that the receiver may only store and use the released tissue samples for the purposes for which they have been released to them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, prior to the release of the tissue samples, the releasing biobank is to be required to set the following conditions for a recipient that is not a biobank according to the Biobanks Act: - The recipient is to maintain adequate documentation so that every released tissue sample can be retrieved on request from the releasing biobank. - The recipient is to guarantee that the donor of the released tissue samples is, at minimum, given a corresponding right as that stated in the Biobanks Act to object to the storage of a tissue sample at any time.</p>
<p>The reason for this amendment is that the Inquiry believes that the emphasis in the regulation should not lie on forms for making tissue samples available. Rather, the emphasis should lie on meeting the requirements to protect the individual before a tissue sample may be made available to a third party. It is also important to facilitate access to tissue samples from biobanks for use in research.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that the current obstacles to sending tissue samples to recipients in other countries be removed. They are to be replaced by a provision that tissue samples belonging to a biobank may not be made available to a third party recipient if this involves personal data being processed in breach of the regulations contained in the Personal Data Act (1998:204) concerning the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EU and EEA. In addition, the Inquiry’s proposal concerning requirements on contractual terms regarding traceability and self-determination applies with regard to all recipients abroad.</p>
<p>As is the case today, the Inquiry considers that permission from the National Board of Health and Welfare is to be required before a biobank or tissue samples may be transferred to another principal. Special grounds will still be required before granting permission for a transfer.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that when assessing whether or not there are special grounds for a transfer, the extent to which the donor’s interests can be upheld following the transfer are to be considered. Permission from the National Board of Health and Welfare is also to be required for a biobank to be made available to others, for example rented out. It is thus to be treated in the same way as a transfer.</p>
<h2>Identifying deceased persons, paternity investigation and criminal investigation</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes  that tissue samples from a biobank may be released for the identification of deceased persons, both when a need has arisen following a major disaster and for individual deaths.</p>
<p>Release may only be allowed if the identity of the deceased has been preliminary confirmed. A tissue sample and the associated personal data may only be released following a request from the National Board of Forensic Medicine or a police authority, including the National Police Board and the Disaster Victim Identification unit. Biobanks are to be obliged to release samples and information to these authorities upon request.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that tissue samples from a biobank may be released for investigations into paternity or parenthood under Chapter 1, Section 9 of the Children and Parents Code, but only if the tissue sample to be released comes from someone who is deceased or whose whereabouts are unknown. A tissue sample and the associated personal data may only be released to the National Board of Forensic Medicine, and only after a court hearing.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes  that the Swedish Code of Judicial Procedure stipulate that tissue samples covered by the Biobanks Act may not be confiscated for the investigation of crime. This provision means that tissue samples from biobanks covered by the Biobanks Act may not be used for the investigation of crime.</p>
