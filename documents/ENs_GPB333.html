<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>In accordance with a Government resolution in March 1999, a Commission was appointed in order to review the present Swedish system of litigation taking place before the Court of Patent Appeals and the District Court of Stockholm relating to patent and certain other industrial property rights. Mr. Eskil Persson, former Chairman of the Court of Patent Appeals, was appointed special Commissioner, assisted by a number of advisers and experts.</p>
<p>The main task of the Commission was to consider whether the activities of the Court of Patent Appeals (which is an administrative court) could be integrated, fully or in part, into the District Court of Stockholm. As an additional task, the Commission was later instructed to consider a proposal by the Swedish Patent Office to introduce a system giving patentees the possibility of limiting the scope of protection of their patents by means of a limitation procedure before the Patent Office.</p>
<p>The Commission was also instructed to take into consideration current activities at European level concerning, inter alia, the creation of a Community patent and the setting up of a European Patent Court.</p>
<p>There are various reasons for reviewing the present system. One reason is that the activities of the Court of Patent Appeals – trying cases appealed from the Patent Office (patents, trademarks, designs and certain other things) – and those of the District Court of Stockholm – trying cases relating in particular to infringement and validity of patents and other industrial property rights – are to a certain extent overlapping. The same subject-matter, i.e. whether an invention is new and involves an inventive step, may be considered by both courts at different stages of the proceedings. Since decisions taken by the Court of Patent Appeals can be brought before the Supreme Administrative Court, while those of the District Court can finally be brought before the (general) Supreme Court, there is a risk of lack of uniformity in the case law.</p>
<p>Another drawback of the present system is that it involves a split of the rather limited number of judges available with sufficient experience in intellectual property law. A special problem – mainly due to the impact of the EPC – constitutes a constant decrease over the last decade in patent appeals received by the Court of Patent Appeals. The</p>
<p>number last year was only 68 cases. This has made it necessary to reduce the technical staff considerably. At the same time, the District Court of Stockholm has expressed the opinion that it needs more technical support in order to render the preparation of patent cases more effective. Technically qualified members of the Court of Patent Appeals are already participating, on an ad hoc-basis, as members of the District Court (as well as of the Svea Court of Appeal) in patent cases. The experience from this co-operation is encouraging.</p>
<p>The Commission has been aware of the intense activities at European level presently being carried out in particular with regard to patents and the efforts being made in order to create a Community patent system (including a special court at Community level) as well as to the setting up of a European Patent Court within the framework of the European Patent Organization (EPLP). In particular the latter project could have a considerable impact on the activities of national courts in Europe and reduce their future rôle in patent litigation substantially. However, it is hard to predict when this project, as well as the Community patent system, will be completed and may enter into force.</p>
<p>In view of the above activities at European level, the Commission has considered whether a structural reform of the court system in Sweden as foreseen in its terms of reference should not be postponed pending more clarity about the prospects of the different European projects. However, for a number of reasons the Commission has rejected this idea. Firstly, the problems connected with the present situation remain unresolved and may even grow worse, if the taking of appropriate steps are further delayed. Secondly, the staff of the courts involved should not be kept waiting for a solution longer than necessary. Finally, having in mind that some kind of organization will be needed also in the future in Sweden for dealing with national patents and other national industrial property rights, the complexity of the European projects concerned is considered to be so great, that a realistic assessment justifies the conclusion that none of them will have any noticeable impact on the court system in Sweden for a period of at least five years. In these circumstances, it is thought that one should not refrain from taking action. Any reform of the present system, however, must obviously be directed to a solution which can be adapted to possible international developments.</p>
<p>For these and other reasons the Commission proposes that the activities of the Court of Patent Appeals be transferred to the District Court of Stockholm and integrated into its (seventh) division responsible for intellectual property law. By this a more rational use of the total resources available in both courts can be achieved.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the present drawback of having the jurisdiction divided between courts of different characters will be removed. It is proposed that the combined activities should be kept together and form the basis for a specialized court within the said division of the District Court. This court should be named the Patent Court. It is further proposed that the organization of the court and its rules of procedure be laid down in a new law named the Law on Patent Litigation. This law should cover also the procedure in the Svea Court of Appeal, which in this context should be named the Patent Appeal Court, and the Supreme Court. It follows that the Supreme Administrative Court will no longer deal with matters relating to industrial property law which will be concentrated to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the new Patent Court will meet the need for a necessary specialization in the field of industrial property law and be able to provide an efficient administration of justice. The incorporation of the court into the large District Court of Stockholm has also many administrative advantages and will provide a great flexibility in many respects (recruitment, training of staff, adjustment of resources in case of variation of input of cases etc.). This is of a particular importance in view of the uncertainty about the impact of the international development. In a longer European perspective it seems quite conceivable that the Patent Court may form the basis for a regional chamber within the concept of the EPLP as being discussed in the WPL.</p>
<p>In addition to the above proposals, the Commission has also, among some other things, proposed the introduction of a system for limiting the scope of protection of patents by means of a limitation procedure before the Patent Office and suggested a solution to the problem of limitation also in nullity proceedings. These proposals are in line with corresponding provisions added to the EPC at a diplomatic conference in Munich in November last year.</p>
