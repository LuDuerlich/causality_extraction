<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>SWENTEC AB is to take the form of a wholly state-owned company with the role of coordinator in a concentrated national effort to promote Swedish environmental technologies. This is the main proposal of the committee set up to recommend an appropriate organisational form for a national environmental technologies centre and to define its objectives and tasks.</p>
<p>The aim of SWENTEC’s activities is to help Sweden become a world leader in the fields of environment-driven business development, environment technologies exports and sustainable development. This is to be achieved by strengthening the competitiveness of Swedish enterprises in environment-driven markets, both on the export side and domestically. The term ‘environmental technologies’ is taken to mean all technologies whose use is less environmentally harmful than relevant alternatives.</p>
<p>Sweden has developed world-class niches of expertise in the environmental technologies field, particularly with regard to system solutions. One Swedish speciality is systems for dealing with or preventing environmental pollution in whole towns or cities. A factor that has given Sweden an edge in several markets is the cooperation that exists in this country between the public sphere, the business community and academia. The active involvement of Sweden’s local and regional authorities in the development of environmentally friendly technological solutions in the public sector has been a unique feature of Swedish efforts in this field. Environmental technologies have become a Swedish trademark and given the country a sound international reputation.</p>
<p>In many parts of the world, major investments are needed to deal with the environmental problems that have developed over the years and which are still enormous. For this and other reasons, there is considerable market and growth potential in the promotion</p>
<p>of Swedish environmental technologies exports and environmentdriven business development.</p>
<p>Environment problems know no boundaries and must therefore be solved through international cooperation. Sweden has been proactive in the various international political processes aimed at making sustainable development – which is one of our overall national policy objectives – an integral part of economic and other policies. The EU has now officially adopted the position that environment is an engine of economic growth. It has also formulated a European Environmental Technologies Action Plan, or ETAP, with the specific aim of enhancing opportunities in this field. Sweden can play an active part in implementing this action plan.</p>
<p>In its role as coordinator, the Swedish national environmental technologies centre, SWENTEC, will act as the hub of a broad, appropriately oriented network bringing together the various stakeholders in this field: the business community, academics and researchers, financiers, NGOs, central government authorities and regional actors, and international organisations. One beneficial outcome of the centre’s activities is likely to be a stronger ‘value chain’ – from research to market – as a result of greater opportunities for exchanging experience and information.</p>
<p>To finance the establishment of a national environmental technologies centre, as well as a number of other promotional activities relating to environmental technologies exports and environment-driven business development, a total of SEK 10 million has been allocated in the Budget Bill for 2004. The Government’s resolve to make a concentrated effort in this field is also expressed financially in a number of other budgetary areas where the yields are likely to be greater if government input is better coordinated overall.</p>
<p>The centre will not be taking over any tasks from existing government agencies or actors in this field.</p>
<p>The committee has summarised the tasks of the centre in the following ten points:</p>
<p>1. To develop new networks and strengthen existing ones. To develop contacts and promote cooperation between national, regional and local activities in the field of environmental technologies.</p>
<p>2. To strive for closer coordination in the activities of the various stakeholders, create synergies and promote a national concentration of resources. To strive for the launching of joint projects throughout the value chain and for the linkingin of system solutions in new technological fields.</p>
<p>3. To create interfaces and promote cooperation between the various market actors (businesses, researchers, financiers, international development agencies, public authorities and organisations, diplomatic representations, etc).</p>
<p>4. To identify and communicate Sweden’s competitive advantages in the environmental technologies field by pinpointing and formulating ‘areas of focus’ in collaboration with the stakeholders concerned. The analytical work should be undertaken in collaboration with relevant authorities (including the Swedish Business Development Agency, NUTEK, and the Swedish Agency for Innovations Systems, VINNOVA), organisations (the Swedish Trade Council, regional and other networks) and enterprises, and with the research community, including the environmental research institutes.</p>
<p>5. To collect, analyse and disseminate important information and knowledge throughout the value chain – from research to market and from market to other parts of the chain.</p>
<p>6. To strive for a greater exchange of knowledge and information at international level, and in this context identify needs and potential action areas, and report back to the Government.</p>
<p>7. To act as a contact point in the environmental technologies field for foreign policymakers seeking knowledge transfers or technological exchanges with Sweden or exports from Sweden.</p>
<p>8. To further develop potential funding solutions for environmental technologies advancement, including risk capital supply.</p>
<p>9. To maintain an overview of Sweden’s international commitments in the field of environmental technologies, and strive to ensure that Sweden continues to play a leading role and actively pursue efforts to promote environmental technologies in general by advising the Government and assisting it with background material prior to policy decisions.</p>
<p>10. Assist the Government with practical arrangements that may be necessary in connection primarily with official visits by incoming delegations concerned with environmental technologies, but also in connection with official outgoing visits by delegations from Sweden.</p>
