<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Talented and ambitious young people who are approaching the end of their higher education often have several interesting career opportunities to choose between. Higher education institutions must succeed in attracting gifted researchers to pursue an academic career. This is essential if Swedish research is to maintain its strong standing. To promote a continued supply of new talent and enable higher education institutions to recruit and retain outstanding young researchers in Sweden, good conditions are needed during thirdcycle education and clear post-doctoral career paths.</p>
<p>This report presents the Research Career Inquiry’s proposals and measures. In summary, the Inquiry focuses on the issue of how higher education institutions are to continue to be attractive employers for which students, teachers and researchers are the most important resource for the quality and development of their activities. The most important factor for achieving this is a research and teaching career that is distinguished by clear requirements and conditions that are common to all higher education institutions, a transparent recruitment process, and favourable and fair terms. In addition, the Inquiry recommends that the higher education institutions jointly consider cooperating on a clearer and less fragmented career system.</p>
<h2>Starting points for a research career for the future</h2>
<p>The overarching purpose of the Inquiry is to propose measures to ensure a continued supply of outstanding young researchers in Sweden. The Inquiry has based its work on the principles that the academic career path must be clear, the conditions for career progression transparent and the terms of employment favourable if the career is to be attractive. However, secure and favourable conditions are sometimes thought to be incompatible with efficiency and excellence. To put it rather pointedly, the thinking behind an assumption of this kind appears to be that young researchers’ uncertainty about future reviews gives them incentives to make more of an effort, and less favourable conditions encourage them to make extra efforts to reach the next stage of their career, where conditions are better. This is sometimes summed up in the phrase “hungry dogs hunt best”. The Inquiry does not concur with this view. In our opinion, doctoral students, post-doctorate positions and assistant professors should be appointed on a competitive basis, with positions being offered to the best qualified candidates. The foundations of an interest in an academic career are laid during firstand secondcycle studies. Well-defined career stages that make the requirements for a continuing academic career predictable will create an essential condition for encouraging students to start a research programme and subsequently continue their career after a doctorate. In addition, salary and other terms of employment should be favourable and equal for all. This path is not free of work; on the contrary, it demands work performed with good results, an ability to plan, organise and present research results. Laying such a foundation can create an attractive career path. In contrast, there are no reasonable grounds for dragging out the time until reaching a permanent position as long as possible, accepting a succession of different types of fixedterm contracts covering long periods of time, or allowing unfavourable and unequal terms of employment. The labour market in general does not enjoy greater predictability about the future than academia, yet it still manages to use permanent employment contracts as its basic form. Why is it that a teacher in academia has to wait around ten years, including the doctorate, for a permanent contract or, to turn it around, that 50 per cent are still on fixedterm contracts after that amount of time? Is this situation likely to attract the most promising and well-qualified people? We do not believe so and propose some measures in our report for achieving a more competitive academic sector.</p>
<h2>Better conditions for doctoral students</h2>
<p>One essential requirement for a favourable environment for study and good study results is that doctoral students are offered secure conditions and good financing during their studies. This enhances the likelihood of recruiting the most suitable students to research programmes and retaining doctoral students who have already been accepted. At present, doctoral students have varying conditions depending on the form of financing they have during their programme. The Inquiry would like to emphasise that most doctoral students have favourable working conditions and terms of employment. However, the situation is more difficult for a smaller group of doctoral students receiving doctoral grants and particularly for doctoral students financed by scholarships. In view of the Inquiry’s remit to improve student welfare conditions for doctoral students receiving doctoral grants or scholarships and to make third-cycle education an attractive option compared with other careers, the Inquiry considers that one aim should be that all doctoral students admitted to a Swedish higher education institution should be offered employment from day one. The main argument is that security and quality lead to attractiveness. Favourable conditions increase the prospects of doctoral students completing their education in the time allotted. The concept of quality includes admissions to doctoral studies being competitive, i.e. it should be the higher education institution itself that has the final say and chooses who should be admitted to a doctoral programme, not the scholarship granter. This is best achieved by means of a transparent recruitment process in which external advertisement, in national and international channels, is the general rule. The concept of quality also means taking responsibility for ensuring that individuals enjoy equal conditions, that both parties (the individual and the university) can be called to account and that the doctoral programme qualifies the student for the future teaching career.</p>
<h2>Abolish the doctoral grant</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes the abolition of the doctoral grant from 1 July 2017.</p>
<p>Whether or not the doctoral grant should exist has been discussed since it was reintroduced in 1995. The discussion has been prompted by the fact that a doctoral grant offers a poorer social safety net than a doctoral studentship. The long-term political ambition has been to abolish the doctoral grant. In practice, this has now become a reality in that all state higher education institutions have taken the decision to eliminate the doctoral grant in favour of doctoral studentships. With reference to this development, the Inquiry considers that it is natural to completely dispense with the doctoral grant as a form of financing for third-cycle studies. This means that the doctoral students who currently finance their third-cycle education with doctoral grants will in future receive studentship appointments, which will mean that they are covered by the same social security schemes as other employees at state higher education institutions.</p>
<h2>Better conditions for doctoral students with scholarships</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that doctoral students financed by scholarships should be employed on studentships when a period of studies equivalent to three years of full-time education remains until their doctoral degree or artistic doctoral degree, according to their individual study plan.</p>
<p>Exceptions from this general rule should be possible in certain cases. This applies to doctoral students with scholarships who: – are financed within the framework of a national or intergovernmental development assistance and  capacity-building programme in which scholarships are an established form of financing and the hosting higher education institution has insight into the terms of the scholarship and its disbursement; and – are financed by scholarships within the framework of a programme/equivalent financed by the European Union, in which scholarships are an established form of financing and where a requirement for  employment-based financing would be an impediment to participation by the hosting higher education institution.</p>
<p>There are several strong arguments for limiting the use of scholarships to finance doctoral students in favour of employment as a doctoral student. One reason is that, as a rule, foreign doctoral students financed by scholarships are not covered by residence-based benefits such as housing allowance, child allowance and dental care subsidy. Another reason is that scholarships are not pensionable, which means that doctoral students financed by scholarships who can be expected to retire in Sweden will receive a considerably lower pension than doctoral students who have been employed on studentships. Another reason is that doctoral students who finance their doctoral level education by scholarships do not have the same opportunity to teach as employed doctoral students, a fact that has great significance in terms of their qualification for future positions.</p>
<p>In addition, there are clear quality reasons against admitting doctoral students financed by scholarships. In contrast to the situation when higher education institutions themselves advertise doctoral studentships as widely as possible, in the case of scholarships it is difficult to ensure that the most suitable people will be admitted, since it is the scholarship granters that determine who receives the scholarships.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has learned that the higher education institutions that have doctoral students with scholarships generally have poor insight into the terms and conditions involved. The Inquiry therefore proposes measures to increase insight into the terms and conditions of holders of scholarships. The Inquiry considers, furthermore, that a long-term ambition should be to abolish scholarships as a form of financing.</p>
<p>However, the Inquiry proposes certain exceptions for doctoral students with scholarships within the framework of certain capacitybuilding programmes, for example. The Inquiry sees the importance of these types of cooperation that enable support for research students from countries that lack sufficient ability to pay or a research education capacity of their own.</p>
<p>The Inquiry further proposes that a regulation should be introduced on a minimum financial level when financing is based on a scholarship. This level should be equivalent, at the minimum, to the entry level  post-tax  salary for a doctoral studentship at the higher education institution concerned, and should keep pace with the salary increases or equivalent salary development for doctoral students employed at the institution. If doctoral students are to study alternately in Sweden and abroad, the requirement concerning a minimum level will only apply to the time spent in Sweden.</p>
<p>Given the objective of equal and favourable terms and conditions for doctoral students, the Inquiry considers that a regulation should be introduced on a minimum financial level that is the same at all higher education institutions. This financial level should be in line with the net salary of an employed doctoral student. The level of financing provided by a scholarship varies depending on what the scholarship granter offers and consequently, the financial conditions enjoyed by holders of scholarships can vary from one institution to another, and between faculties and departments at the same institution. For example, there are doctoral students on scholarships who receive barely SEK 9 000 per month, working side by side and with the same tasks as an employed doctoral student with an average pre-tax salary of SEK 26 645 per month. Such large differences are not reasonable. Several of the higher education institutions that have doctoral students with scholarships apply various minimum levels to which low scholarship levels are topped up.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Kammarkollegiet insurance scheme should entitle doctoral students to compensation equivalent to the period of absence for a period of study that is extended because of sickness or parental leave, provided that a scholarship is not given for the extension.</p>
<p>This proposal will improve the insurance coverage of doctoral students on scholarships in cases where it is impossible to stop the disbursement of a scholarship for reasons of sickness or parental leave.</p>
<h2>Position of assistant professor will be introduced as a step in a nationally recognised tenure track</h2>
<p>The Inquiry shows that Sweden essentially has never had a coherent career structure. The period after completing a doctorate is particularly problematic, being characterised to some extent by a lack of secure conditions and a lack of clarity about what is required to qualify for a permanent position. The Inquiry’s survey of career development positions in the Higher Education Ordinance has shown that there are currently several different ways to use career development positions in Sweden. Only 13 higher education institutions offer career development positions that give the holder the right to promotion to a higher teaching position. Moreover, the majority of these have a parallel career development position that does not entitle the holder to be considered for promotion. Although there are positive examples at various higher education institutions, the picture that emerges at national level is divided. The Inquiry finds that the lack of clarity that is typical of the current career system has negative effects for mobility, gender equality and, not least, the continued supply of outstanding young researchers.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore proposes the introduction of a fixed-term position as assistant professor for a maximum of four to six years. Upon application, an assistant professor will be promoted to a permanent position as associate professor if the assistant professor is qualified for such a position and in addition is deemed suitable in light of the criteria established by the higher education institution for that position.</p>
<p>One reason for introducing a career development position as assistant professor that entitles the holder, upon application, to promotion to a permanent position as associate professor is to attract promising young research talents to higher education institutions by offering a position associated with favourable conditions for engaging in research and other related resources, such as resources for recruiting doctoral students, resources for research infrastructure and mentoring support. Attaching talented researchers early in their career is strategically important and relatively advantageous in economic terms compared with recruiting nationally and internationally outstanding established researchers. The Inquiry considers that it should be possible to use the position of assistant professor for broader purposes than as a purely elite track. Establishing a career path that is well-defined, with a clear destination, and open to more researchers, will probably make more people inclined to choose an academic career. This will promote both gender equality and mobility. In the course of the Inquiry’s work, several people have emphasised that the uncertain and poorly defined career paths lead many talents to choose another career outside higher education instead. In itself, this is not necessarily wrong, but the reasons for such choices – being a less attractive option – must be seen as a concern.</p>
<p>The purpose of the position is to give the assistant professor an opportunity to develop an independent identity as a researcher and to add to their record as scholar and teacher so as to satisfy the eligibility criteria for employment as associate professor.</p>
<p>For a continued academic career, weight will be given to the teaching record so as to meet the requirements set for employment as an associate professor. However, the emphasis should be on the scholarly record so that an assistant professor is able to develop into a more independent, established researcher.</p>
<p>In order to emphasise the importance of the position for individuals at the beginning of a teaching career, the Inquiry proposes that the time between a doctorate and a career development position be shortened to five years.</p>
<p>To qualify for a position as assistant professor, the applicant is often required to have held a post-doctoral position. Post-doctoral employment that is regulated by collective agreements is, however, fixed at two years, which means there is a gap between post-doctoral positions and career development positions that has to be filled with various fixed-term contracts. We therefore propose a measure aimed at reducing long periods of fixed-term contracts before a person is entitled to promotion to a permanent position.</p>
<p>Positions as assistant professor should be advertised nationally and, unless there are special grounds not to do so, internationally. External assessors should be involved in the recruitment process. The aim is to attract the best-qualified candidates and promote mobility and gender equality.</p>
<h2>National targets for an increased number of career development positions</h2>
<p>In light of our intention that employment as an assistant professor should be used more broadly than as a purely elite track, we propose that the Government set a national target for the number of assistant professors to increase by 50 per cent over the next five years (2017–2022).</p>
<p>Over the last fifteen years, the number of career development positions has remained at a constant, relatively low, level of around 1 000 positions, despite the increase in research appropriations in previous research bills. The number of ‘researchers’ has increased substantially over the same period. If anything, what we can see is that it seems that higher education institutions have chosen to prioritise positions as researcher rather than, for example, career development positions. Perhaps it can be assumed – quite speculatively – that as research resources have rapidly grown, higher education institutions have chosen to recruit to researcher and postdoctoral positions for which the recruitment process is simpler and quicker, and which do not require the institutions commit themselves far into the future.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the proposal to increase the number of assistant professors, rather than short-term researcher positions with a high degree of insecurity, will increase the attractiveness of research as a career. The increase should be made on the basis of higher education institutions’ future recruitment needs and taking into account, for example, upcoming retirements and other normal attrition. The Inquiry takes the view that higher education institutions’ resources could, to some extent, be redistributed from researcher positions to assistant professor positions. It should be emphasised here that it is essential to work on planned, strategic skills provision.</p>
<h2>Fixed-term employment in higher education – how do things stand?</h2>
<p>The report includes the employment history of teaching and research staff at higher education institutions. In summary, the situation is as follows.</p>
<p>The total proportion of staff on fixed-term contracts is 31 per cent among teaching and research staff. However, the proportion varies widely between different categories of employees. The special regulations for higher education fixed term contracts contained in the Higher Education Ordinance and collective agreements cover a total of just over 40 per cent of the fixed-term contracts. Fixed term contracts contained in the Employment Protection Act cover 60 percent. The lowest proportion of fixed-term contracts is found – unsurprisingly – among professors.</p>
<p>The proportion of staff with doctorates who are on fixed-term contracts decreases year by year after obtaining a doctorate. Four years after obtaining their doctorate, 50 per cent of staff are on permanent contracts, with the proportion rising to 92 per cent twelve years after the doctorate. Longer periods of fixed-term employment do not appear to be common, but when their do occur, positions pursuant to the special higher education regulations account for the majority of them.</p>
<p>Researcher positions are not teaching positions, and researcher positions can therefore be terminated more easily due to shortage of work, for example when external grants for research projects are discontinued. The proportion of staff who are researchers and on fixed-term contracts also decreases year by year after obtaining a doctorate, but not as rapidly. Fifteen years after obtaining a doctorate, the proportion of fixed-term positions is still around 20 per cent.</p>
<p>The career paths for those with doctorates are highly diversified. The majority of new professors come from a position as associate professor. More than half of those in career development positions go on to a position as associate professor, but this is not the main route. The majority of newly appointed associate professors come from a fixed-term position as associate professor, and only a few come from career development positions.</p>
<p>If researcher positions are disregarded, the statistics show that the major problem is the lack of a clear career structure, not consecutive fixed-term contracts.</p>
<h2>Measures to reduce fixed-term contracts</h2>
<p>The Inquiry considers that there are grounds for the special regulation of fixed-term contracts contained in the Higher Education Ordinance. These contracts offer opportunities for higher education institutions to recruit and engage specialist expertise, but also opportunities to use attractive, career development positions that ensure the long-term skills needs at the institution. However, the flexibility allowed by the special regulations in the Higher Education Ordinance must not, in combination with fixed-term contracts under collective agreements and the Employment Protection Act, be overused and replace the work on establishing a clear career path.</p>
<p>One measure that the Inquiry proposes is changing the balance between research positions and teaching positions. The Inquiry believes there should be fewer researchers. Higher education institutions and research funders should, in cooperation, be able to reallocate some research resources to increase the proportion of teachers – associate professors, professors and, not least, assistant professors – to meet future needs and be an attractive employer. There is also a need for a deeper discussion on whether there is a need for a research career involving better and more secure employment.  With a view to improving the situation of employed researchers, there is a need for alternative career paths alongside teaching positions. A large proportion of researchers have either themselves received external research funding or have been employed due to another research group leader receiving research funding. These researchers are primarily employed pursuant to the Employment Protection Act’s provisions on general fixed-term employment. Research positions may be fulltime or part-time and employment terms and conditions vary. Positions are seldom advertised – at least widely – which means that the researcher’s competence is reviewed more summarily by the higher education institution. If research funding is granted for a period longer than two years, the researcher’s fixed-term contract is transformed into a permanent contract. If the researcher or research group leader receives additional research funding, the position continues. However, in this context the security of a permanent contract is a chimera, as the researcher’s position is often terminated in good time before the research funding runs out pursuant to the Employment Protection Act’s provisions on shortage of work. The effect of this practice is thus that insecure positions can succeed each other, even in the case of permanent contracts.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that teaching and research staff’s positions and employment history be followed up. In cooperation with the Swedish Higher Education Authority, the Inquiry has produced a draft model for following up positions and the employment histories of teaching and research staff, including the incidence of termination of permanent contracts. The Inquiry considers that it is important in the  follow-up  to be able to monitor – at higher education institution level – the different forms of employment that allow fixedterm contracts under provisions in the Higher Education Ordinance, the Employment Protection Act and collective agreements.</p>
<h2>Mobility – what is the current situation?</h2>
<p>In the report, we discuss mobility based on reported statistics from the Swedish Higher Education Authority/Statistics Sweden and the Swedish Research Council, and based on the Inquiry’s own statistical analysis. Mobility is grouped into two main categories. The first category is the mobility of doctoral students and researchers/teachers (on both fixed-term and permanent contracts) within the scope of their employment. The second category of mobility concerns a change of employer, both between different higher education institutions and in terms of individuals leaving or returning to the sector.</p>
<p>With respect to mobility within the scope of employment, a total of 37 per cent of all categories of staff investigated have been abroad in the last year. In several staff categories, the figure is over 50 per cent, while associate professors and particularly adjunct professors enjoy relatively low mobility (31 per cent and 17 per cent respectively). We can see that women are somewhat less mobile overall (41 per cent of men and 31 per cent of women), although this is not the case for all staff categories, and that women stay abroad for shorter periods.</p>
<p>With respect to mobility in the sense of changing employer, it emerges that a majority are employed at the same higher education institution from which they obtained their doctorate, even including Career development employees. Only Postdoc are employed to a lesser degree (45 per cent) at the same higher education institution from which they obtained their doctorate There are differences between the different types of higher education institution. At large higher education institutions, more than 60 per cent of professors and 70 per cent of associate professors are recruited internally. At smaller higher education institutions, the proportion of internally recruited staff is significantly smaller, primarily because a number of smaller higher education institutions have only obtained the right to issue doctorates in recent years.</p>
<p>The most substantial mobility occurs primarily between obtaining a doctorate and continued employment, or in the first few years after obtaining a doctorate. The majority of moves between higher education institutions occur around two to five years after obtaining a doctorate.</p>
<h2>Measures to increase mobility</h2>
<p>In the view of the Inquiry, the degree of mobility is substantially linked to how the research and teaching career system is designed and works. The lack of a clear career path makes it rational for individual researchers to believe that it is safer to remain at the same higher education institution from which they obtained their doctorate via a series of fixed-term contracts, in the hope that it offers the best opportunity of a permanent contract, this naturally hinders mobility. A more planned-out career structure, this will improve the conditions for mobility. Clear terms and conditions and career paths encourage mobility. The Inquiry proposes the introduction of a position as assistant professor with a right to be reviewed for a permanent position as associate professor. More uniform regulation of em- ployment as an assistant professor is not only an important piece of a Swedish career system puzzle, it will also stimulate mobility. The introduction of an attractive form of employment for young researchers will make Swedish researchers more inclined to be willing to move between higher education institutions, and make young</p>
<p>foreign researchers more inclined to move here. The Inquiry proposal of national targets for an increased number of Career development positions will also enhance mobility.</p>
<p>A yearly statistical monitoring of mobility creates incitaments for higher education institutions. The Inquiry proposes such statistical monitoring, where different types of mobility are monitored in different ways.</p>
