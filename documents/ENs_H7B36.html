<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Commission of Inquiry on Governance and Resources has had a broad remit: to conduct a comprehensive review of the steering of and resource allocation to Swedish state Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). According to our terms of reference, state steering should be conducive to “strong and responsible HEIs” that can help fulfil national goals and meet societal challenges in Sweden and globally. Our goal is thus a framework of governance and funding that enables HEIs to take an independent responsibility for the development and dissemination of knowledge for society’s longterm development. The details in the framework should be evaluated, developed and adapted over time to respond to shifting societal needs and priorities. However, we believe it is imperative that it always be based on a recognition of HEIs’ distinctive role and mission in society and the preconditions for its effective fulfilment.</p>
<h2>Principles for appropriate steering</h2>
<p>State steering needs to take its departure in the purpose  of HEIs and the conditions  for the fulfilment of this purpose. The overarching purpose of HEIs can be summarized as the creation, preservation and transmission of knowledge for a better world. The HEIs’ mission includes being responsive to societal needs, but also an indispensable freedom and critical distance. The free pursuit of knowledge is the hallmark of HEIs, and a condition also for their development of research and education to meet specific needs.</p>
<p>A first precondition for the fulfilment of HEIs’ complex mission is therefore academic freedom , as a basis for the development of knowledge and the necessary trust that this development is not controlled or limited by political, economic or other interests.</p>
<p>Academic freedom needs to be reflected in corresponding responsibilities  in the form of integrity and high quality. Academic norms of quality and integrity are upheld through collegial processes  which, consequently, are also central preconditions for HEIs’ mission. An active societal responsibility  in the form of public engagement and dissemination of knowledge is also central. Lastly, a long-term  view , coupled with room for flexibility and renewal , are important conditions.</p>
<p>On these grounds we believe that appropriate steering for strong and responsible HEIs must:</p>
<p>• Promote academic freedom, quality and responsibility  – guarantee the free pursuit of knowledge and promote a strong quality culture through maintaining focus on results and quality while avoiding detailed steering or misaligned incentives.</p>
<p>• Promote societal responsibility  – on a basis of strong academic integrity, HEIs should be expected to do what they can to ensure that the knowledge and competence they build contributes to society in various ways.</p>
<p>• Promote the ability for strategic action  – provide  long-term  conditions that allow HEIs to take responsibility according to their different profiles.</p>
<p>This is in line with the reforms initiated by the Swedish Government towards trust-based  public management , which places emphasis on intrinsic motivation and professional norms and knowledge, and combines a clear responsibility for meeting overarching goals with flexibility on how to meet them. An increased focus on dialogue  is an important part of this. So is coordination  between different political expectations of HEIs, including joint consideration of education and research. Steering should be knowledge-based   with follow-up and evaluation of reforms, take a  long-term  view  and be less detailed. In general, government should set overarching goals while HEIs have a great degree of freedom in how to achieve them. The government’s role includes a national overview of and strategy for higher education and research, weighing higher education and research against other societal needs, and coordination of steering to include factors that impact HEIs but are outside their sphere of influence. The role of HEIs is to develop education and research through their local and professional knowledge, in the regional, national and international contexts in which they operate.</p>
<p>Steering should be more  tailored towards different HEIs’ profiles in order to leverage the diversity of the Swedish higher education landscape and promote cooperation where HEIs can use each other’s strengths for joint development of high quality research and education. This requires a dialogue where HEIs can explain the role that they see for themselves in a national context and where the government’s knowledge of HEIs’ different profiles is thereby continuously maintained.</p>
<p>Follow-up  and evaluation  fill important functions to drive quality, provide a basis for priorities, and provide transparency to interested parties concerning quality and results. At the same time, it must be used in moderation and designed so as to avoid negative side effects such as homogenisation, goal displacement or crowding out of intrinsic motivation. Evaluation and follow-up should as far as possible be relevant and useful both to the government and to HEIs. A strong quality culture and continuous quality assurance within HEIs provide the foundation for maintaining and improving quality. External reviews which reveal quality and relevance are important drivers for maintaining a quality culture and the trust of society.</p>
<h2>The link between teaching and research</h2>
<p>A close linkage of teaching and research is an important condition for the quality and renewal of both. We see structural hurdles to this linkage and propose changes to strengthen it. These are: stating in the Higher Education Act that the work of academic staff should normally include both teaching and research; a recurring joint Government Bill for higher education and research; a common budget allocation for education and research that enables HEIs to use funds flexibly to fulfil their dual mission; strengthening the connection between how funds are calculated for education and research; and diminishing the dependence on external research funding. HEIs should also actively promote an academic culture where teaching and research are valued equally.</p>
<h2>Strengthening important norms in the Higher Education Act</h2>
<p>Clarity on basic academic values and norms provides a foundation for the division of responsibility and a trust-building dialogue between the government and HEIs, as well as between HEIs and their partners in the surrounding community. We note that several important principles are already set out in the Higher Education Act, but also find that there are some that we believe should be stated more clearly. These include the responsibility to protect and promote academic freedom ; the freedom of teaching ; collegial responsibility and influence ; and stating that the work of academic staff should normally include both teaching and research . We propose that the government initiate changes to the Higher Education Act in these respects.</p>
<h2>A coordinated,  dialogue-based and forward-looking process</h2>
<p>Higher education and research are subject to a wide range of policy goals, some of them in potential conflict with each other. In our view, this calls for established, recurrent occasions for coordinating policy. A particularly important aspect of such coordination is treating higher education and  research in one context. Goals should be formulated with a long-term perspective – e.g. ten years – with more concrete goals for a four-year period. A longer planning horizon than today is especially required for first and second cycle education. We therefore propose that the government present a Bill for higher education and research once during each term of office , as has been the tradition for research policy over the last decades.</p>
<p>We also propose a more dialogue-based, coordinated and longterm framework for the direct steering of HEIs that is done today through annual dialogues and appropriation directives. On the basis of the aforementioned Bill, those aspects that are relevant to direct steering should become the subject of a dialogue process which results in a  four-year  planning horizon  with regards to goals, education targets, commitments, and resources. The dialogues should also address cooperation and division of labour between HEIs.</p>
<p>In addition to making steering through the existing appropriation directives more long-term and dialogue-based, we also propose a new instrument in the form of four-year   Government-HEI  Agreements . In the Agreements, targets and follow-up indicators are formulated for each HEI within a limited number of priority areas. While subject to dialogue, targets and indicators should remain the responsibility of each HEI. We therefore propose that the Agreement be referenced, but not included, in the appropriation directives decided by government. The Agreements should not, at least not initially, be tied to funding. At a general level, the Agreements aim to promote a substantive dialogue to increase mutual understanding between the government and HEIs. Concretely, the Agreements can be used to address complex and qualitative goals in a way that is focused and grounded in each HEI’s profile and strategies, thereby enabling better goal attainment. Examples of such goals that are mentioned in our terms of reference and which we suggest be addressed through the Agreements are public engagement, gender equality and widening participation. Agreements could also be used to follow up funding increases aimed at quality improvement.</p>
<p>As a basis for policy formulation, and for the systematic reevaluation of policy choices, there is a need for analyses of the HEI sector’s development, the effects of current policy and earlier reforms, as well as international developments. We believe that these kinds of analyses should be produced more systematically than today, and with a greater degree of independence in relation to both government and actors with a stake in policy. We therefore propose that an analytical function be created with the mission to collect or commission independent analyses  to inform policy and support the work of HEIs and other actors. It should consist of a group of experts with broad societal representation and be hosted by the Swedish Higher Education Authority. One of the tasks of such a function should be to provide a report to inform the Bill for higher education and research.</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>An important point of departure is that HEIs remain responsible for their academic offerings. We propose that this responsibility be stated in the Higher Education Ordinance, along with the factors that should inform HEIs’ design of their academic offerings, namely: the development of knowledge , student demand , the needs of the labour market , and other needs of society . Both national and regional needs should be included in HEIs’ planning.</p>
<p>We also propose a  statement of HEIs’ responsibility for life-long learning in the Higher Education Act .  Life-long  learning is facilitated by the present  course-based  system in Sweden, as well as by the possibility to provide contract education and recently also Moocs. However, in the current resource allocation system, courses and programmes that are flexible for the student are often less economically viable for the HEI. We therefore propose that  funding becomes less dependent on the number of students and their credits .</p>
<p>Employment numbers for HEI graduates are important to follow, but  should not be linked to automatic steering e.g. through the resource allocation system; the rapidly changing nature of the labour market is an important reason to avoid such  backward-looking  steering.</p>
<p>HEIs’ responsibility for their academic offerings means that the government’s steering should be limited to cases where it is warranted by particular reasons and not be too detailed. We propose that the government steer through four-year  education targets including the total number of  full-time  equivalent (FTE) students and the number of completed degrees in professional programmes within health care and teacher training . Steering in the latter case is motivated by the high demand for graduates from these programmes in combination with the fact that this demand is partly the result of political decisions. An HEI’s education target could also include special commitments, e.g. regarding fields with few students but a clear national or regional need. Changes in education targets should be grounded in the overall priorities made in the Bill for higher education and research and in the dialogue with each HEI.</p>
<p>Cooperation between HEIs to achieve division of labour should continue, as should the work that has been initiated in creating local and regional arenas for cooperation, e.g. regarding health care programmes. We also propose a review of how cooperation between HEIs through joint degrees and programmes can be facilitated.</p>
<p>Widening access to higher education remains a challenge; not least is there clear underrepresentation of students from  non-academic  backgrounds in all three cycles. Although much of this underrepresentation is caused at earlier levels of education, HEIs can also do more. The  Government-HEI-Agreements  that we propose are a good form for the government to follow up the HEIs’ work. We believe the HEIs’ mission concerning widening access should also include the doctoral level, which we deem not to be the case as the mission is currently worded in the Higher Education Act.</p>
<p>There are at present no state targets regarding doctoral education , nor do we propose any. We do, however, stress that both the government and HEIs have a responsibility to make judgements regarding the need of doctorates inside and outside academia and whether those needs are being met. A common budget allocation for education and research, which we propose, would provide more flexibility in the design of any steering deemed necessary in the future.</p>
<h2>Research</h2>
<p>Both institutional funding and competitive project funding fill important roles, but we believe that the high levels of competitive funding compared to institutional funding in Sweden bring a number of negative consequences . Most importantly, they hamper HEIs’ capacity for independent strategic action regarding the long-term direction of the institution, for developing strong knowledge environments with close linkage between teaching and research, and for taking a strategic employer responsibility regarding career structure and development including gender equality. While project funding fills an important function, it is also valuable that teachers can be provided time and opportunity for research in other ways than through project funding.</p>
<p>We therefore propose that the government and parliament state as a goal that institutional funding should form half of total HEI research income  (up from 44 per cent today), and lay out a plan to achieve such a balance within an  eight-year  period . Such a change can be achieved through new funding to the HEI sector or through redistributing funds from state research councils and other public authorities that provide research funding. In the latter case, we propose that redistributed funds be allocated to the various HEIs according to their historical levels of funding from the public authorities in question. The changes that increased institutional funding for HEIs should enable can be monitored through the Government-HEI Agreements.</p>
<p>We propose a separate  review of state external funding , regarding both organisational structure and funding procedures. The review should include the research councils as well as other public agencies that fund research.</p>
<p>We stress the importance of clear drivers for high quality and a strong quality culture that is institutionalized at HEIs and internalized by academics. We do not believe that such a quality culture is best promoted by a high degree of dependence on project funding or performance based funding based on publications and citations; these means of funding risk shifting the focus to certain indicators and outsourcing quality judgements to journals and review panels. However, we do see an important role for research evaluations, as long as they can be adapted flexibly to different HEIs or fields. We therefore recommend that HEIs – together with other actors such as the Swedish Higher Education Authority and the Swedish Research Council – develop a national framework for research evaluations which drives quality and provides transparency .</p>
<h2>Public engagement and societal impact</h2>
<p>HEIs’ work with public engagement and societal impact encompasses a wide range of activities. In our view, the current statement of HEIs’ public engagement mission in the Higher Education Act is too narrow, not least regarding the societal impact of education. We therefore propose a new wording according to which HEIs should work to ensure that societal benefit is derived from their knowledge and competence .</p>
<p>Evaluation and  follow-up   of HEIs’ public engagement work should in our view be an integral part of the national quality assurance system, and could also be included in the GovernmentHEI Agreements we propose. We do not believe that public engagement or social impact should be made part of a general allocation formula, but propose that the government instead, from time to time, can allocate certain funds through a transparent process where all HEIs can apply.</p>
<p>We propose that  the role of HEIs in the innovation system become the subject of a separate inquiry.</p>
<h2>Gender equality</h2>
<p>Although much has been done to increase gender equality within HEIs, problems remain in the form of gendered choices of fields of study and unequal opportunities in academic careers or access to research funding. We believe that gender mainstreaming should remain the overall strategy for increased gender equality in HEIs , and that gender equality should be an integral part of the national quality assurance system. We suggest that the government consider giving the Swedish Higher Education Authority a clear responsibility for evaluation and  follow-up  of HEIs’ work for gender equality,  and that indicators and thematic evaluations are developed further for national follow-up and comparisons.</p>
<p>Goals and targets specific to each HEI can be included in the Government-HEI Agreements . This allows them to be designed in the way that is the most relevant for each HEI during the coming  four-year  period. This is in our view a more appropriate and effective form of steering than the current targets for the proportion of women among newly recruited professors, which have the same design for all HEIs, are limited to only professors, are set at the aggregate level (which may hide imbalances in different fields) and are preceded by limited dialogue. These targets should be abandoned in favour of a more  HEI-specific  steering through the Agreements.</p>
<h2>Resource allocation</h2>
<p>In our view, resource allocation for strong and responsible HEIs should combine freedom in resource use, including between different parts of their mission, with responsibility for resource efficiency and quality. It should enable differences between HEIs so that they can work in different ways towards partly different goals and missions. It should also build on professional responsibility through a sensitivity to how incentives or other steering signals affect the intrinsic motivation and the culture of quality and responsibility which must form the foundation of the HEI’s mission.</p>
<p>When HEI issues are being discussed, financial incentives  are often proposed to solve a particular problem. We see risks with a development toward more and more incentives for different issues, e.g. concerning their effect on other parts of HEIs’ mission, the risk of homogenisation of the HEI landscape and the risk of crowding out of intrinsic motivation and quality culture. We therefore believe that forms of steering other than performance-based funding are often more appropriate. Such forms of steering include a wellfunctioning quality assurance system and a stronger base in dialogue.</p>
<p>One commonly used form of financial steering is directing funds for some specific purpose . We believe this can be an appropriate form of steering, provided that the process is sound. It should be based on a thorough and transparent analysis of the needs, problems or challenges to be addressed, in which relevant parties participate. Based on the analysis, priorities should be made, with a view to complement or compensate for what HEIs or other actors are already doing. Areas selected must be sufficiently broad so as not to infringe on academic freedom. HEIs should thereafter be given the opportunity to apply, and funds be allocated after a transparent and professional review process. In cases where funds are allocated as part of the general institutional funding, a review should be planned and a time limit should be set for when the specific purpose of the new funding will no longer be followed up separately. If several HEIs formulate joint applications, funds should be divided between their different budgets at the outset.</p>
<h2>A common budget allocation for education and research</h2>
<p>Today, the parliament decides on two separate budget allocations to HEIs: one for first and second cycle education, and one for research and doctoral education. In their current form, these allocations must be kept separate according to budgetary rules, i.e. funds for research must not be used for education or vice versa. In order for HEIs to ensure a close linkage between teaching and research, we believe that</p>
<p>HEIs need to be able to use their resources in an integrated way. To achieve this, we propose that these two budget allocations instead form one, common budget allocation for education and research . Within this common budget allocation, we believe that there should still be one portion calculated for education and one for research, but that HEIs should have the freedom to use their total institutional funding to achieve their mission within education and research.</p>
<h2>The portion for first and second cycle education</h2>
<p>Today, the entire allocation for first and second cycle education is based on the number of FTE students enrolled and the number of credits they earn. The actual funding for a particular year is thus settled at the end of that year based on the number of students and credits. To increase stability, we propose that this system be replaced with a model where half of the funding cap for each HEI is given as a block grant, and half is settled yearly based on the number of students . The number of credits earned by students is thus proposed to no longer affect funding, in order to facilitate the development of new programmes and life-long learning and avoid incentives to lower requirements on students.</p>
<p>The subject-based funding rates in the present system have a number of drawbacks in our view. The subject categories are based on traditional and partly obsolete disciplinary fields, consistency in how each course is classified according to these categories is difficult to maintain, and the different funding rates for different subjects may hamper the development of new and transdisciplinary programmes. We propose a model without  subject-based  funding rates, where an HEI is instead given a certain funding level and a target for the number of FTE students . This model highlights each HEI’s responsibility for how resources are allocated within the HEI, while providing a more direct way for the government to influence the total number of students. In cases where funding levels are raised to expand a specific programme, the costs need to be calculated with the help of the Swedish Higher Education Authority.</p>
<h2>The portion for research and doctoral education</h2>
<p>There is currently a connection between education and research funding in the form of a floor in research funding related to the number of FTE students (SEK 12 000/FTE). To further strengthen this connection, we propose that raised targets for FTE students should be accompanied by increases also in the research portion of funding , with SEK 12 000 for each new FTE student. If targets are lowered, the same logic should apply.</p>
<p>The present indicator-based model for parts of the institutional research funding should be abandoned, and we do not consider performance-based  redistribution of institutional funding to be motivated until balance between institutional funding and external funding has been achieved . If a model for allocating additional funding is needed, a new one should be designed after careful analysis. Which criteria are used, and the relation between them, depends on which goals are desirable, which may shift over time depending on changing circumstances and political considerations.</p>
<p>If there is a need to direct funds to certain areas, we suggest using a model similar to the one used for Strategic Research Areas presented in the 2008 Research Bill, i.e. that HEIs can compete for funds which are allocated after peer review. The government can also attach terms to the funding, e.g. the connection of research to education.</p>
<h2>General administrative provisions</h2>
<p>HEIs have a number of exceptions from the general administrative provisions for government agencies, most of which we believe serve their purpose and should be maintained. In addition, we believe the government should consider further exceptions in line with its earlier announcements (Govt. Bill 2009/10:149).</p>
<p>We propose that the general regulation that is currently included in the common appropriation directive for all HEIs instead be regulated through ordinance, as has been the general rule for government agencies since 2010.</p>
