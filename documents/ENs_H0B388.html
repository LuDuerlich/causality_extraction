<p>Rental housing</p>
<p>– from a dwindling right to an option for many</p>
<p>The rental market is not working</p>
<p>The rental market is characterised by the lack of supply of rental housing in areas with high demand. In those parts of such areas where there is still some supply, this is, in practice, only available in the higher price brackets.</p>
<p>The market conditions that lead to uncertain profitability calculations have inhibited willingness to invest in rental housing even in areas with high demand and have made other investment options more attractive. It has only been possible to realise the land value through conversions from rental accommodation to tenant-owned housing. It has also limited the amount of new rental housing being built. The number of rental dwellings is decreasing rather than meeting demand – a change which has been dramatic in the case of Stockholm.</p>
<p>One consequence of the lack of supply has been long queues and, in all probability, a sizeable black market in rental contracts. The mobile labour force, students and others seeking accommodation have a difficult – if not impossible – time finding rental housing. These difficulties show a tendency to increase over time. One result of this is that labour market mobility and economic growth are impeded.</p>
<p>The lack of supply on the rental market contributes to pressure of demand and price escalation, primarily with regard to tenantowned housing. It also leads to undesired debt and exposure to risk for individuals who end up owning property against their wishes.</p>
<p>In parallel to the situation in urban areas, there is excess supply with relatively high rent levels in other areas of the Swedish rental market.</p>
<p>Differences compared to other forms of occupancy and other countries</p>
<p>The terms for letting differ on a number of key points from the terms for other forms of occupancy and the prevailing terms in countries such as Germany and the UK. The two most significant differences in the view of the Inquiry are:</p>
<p> Price formation on the rental market.</p>
<p> The limited access for private individuals to the supply side.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Inquiry maintains that housing is not an isolated part of the economy and that comparisons between different forms of housing and letting can easily be patchy and misleading.</p>
<p>Reform of the rental market is necessary</p>
<p>Rent-setting and conditions for investment that result from the utility value system and the collective negotiation system would appear to be a key issue for the rental market.</p>
<p>An image emerges of market conditions that are not designed to avoid supply deficits/housing shortages and, consequently, not to consolidate economic development in a dynamic world, either.</p>
<p>The utility value and collective negotiation systems have, in the view of the Inquiry, generally given rise to relatively small differences in rental relations that do not reflect demand and, therefore, do not reflect consumers’ valuations. The surplus demand does not correspond to markedly higher rent levels and excess supply is not manifested in markedly lower rent levels. The price mechanism is, to a considerable extent, eliminated. These systems have contributed to uncertainty and reduced willingness to invest in areas where there is surplus demand. One reason for this is the fact that contracts already entered into can be set aside by examinations in rent tribunals. In the view of the Inquiry, the systems have curbed supply.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the current lack of owner-occupied apartments is an inhibiting factor for the supply of rental housing. It is not</p>
<p>possible for private individuals to invest in individual apartments to let on reasonable financial terms. In general, far too little private investment capital finds its way to investments in rental housing in areas where there is excess demand.</p>
<p>Striking a balance between consumer and producer interests</p>
<p>Regulation of the rental market is about striking a balance between the interests of producers and consumers or, in other words, between conditions for landlords and tenants. Both tenants and landlords demand security and control.</p>
<p>A tenant demands security, which to a large extent is a matter of the right to occupancy in long-term rental accommodation, the quality of purchased housing services and controlled rent growth. In a functioning market, the tenant occupies a relatively strong position as there is supply and the possibility to move. Supply and choice are therefore valuable for existing tenants, not just for those seeking rental housing.</p>
<p>Landlords also demand security, and this also applies to rent growth, albeit from the income side.</p>
<p>Consumer interests must be protected – and therefore so must those of producers. Market conditions that obstruct a supply of rental housing do not benefit consumers. This is particularly true of the potential consumers who are affected and forced to choose other options. Good conditions for renting out accommodation create value for consumers.</p>
<p>Well-balanced consumer protection is important. The key points for consumers are the right to occupancy and the security of controlled rent growth – and, of course, a supply of rental housing in different price classes.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that a gradual transition to entirely new market conditions is necessary in order to create a functioning rental market in the long term. These conditions must lead to increased supply by ensuring that more people want to and can invest in, own and manage rental housing.</p>
<p>Proposed measures in an initial stage</p>
<p>The existing system of regulations was most recently adjusted on 1 January 2011. There are a number of measures within the framework of this system that, in the short term, could better reflect consumer valuations of location etc., and provide more secure planning conditions for housing companies for the production of new rental housing. The Inquiry proposes five such measures:</p>
<p>Take inspiration from the German rental market</p>
<p>Germany has a large, small-scale and – from the perspective of Swedish conditions – functioning rental market.</p>
<p>Most Germans rent their homes. Around 60 per cent of homes in Germany are rental housing, and 60 per cent of these are owned by landlords who are private individuals with between one and fifteen apartments.</p>
<p>Tenants benefit from strong tenancy rights and regulations that hold back rent changes in ongoing contracts. Rent-setting in new contracts is basically free.</p>
<p>There is a supply of rental apartments everywhere on the German market. This is even true of cities such as Munich, Frankfurt am Main and Hamburg where there is high demand for housing. Rents reflect differences in demand – between regions, cities, districts, blocks and individual apartments.</p>
