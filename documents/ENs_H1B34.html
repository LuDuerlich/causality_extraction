<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The remit deals with administrative matters under civil law within two fairly different legal areas: copyrights and company law. The common denominator is that these matters are currently determined by the Government. One starting point for the remit is that the matters are to be transferred from the Government to a court or an administrative authority, since they do not require a political position being taken. Put simply, the issues that the Inquiry has been instructed to analyse and take a position on can be summarised as follows. 1) Can certain requirements regarding permission from the Government in the area of copyrights be wholly or partially abolished? If, in one or a more cases, there is still a need for permission, the matters are to be transferred from the Government to one or more public authorities. In such a case, which court or courts, or administrative authorities, are to process the matters instead of the Government? 2) Under the terms of reference, certain decisions concerning mediation in the area of copyrights are to be transferred from the Government to a court or an administrative authority. Which court or administrative authority is to take over the matters from the Government? Are other amendments to legislation on mediation necessary to adapt it to existing needs? 3) In certain matters of company law that deal with exemptions, reviews of decisions taken by the Swedish Companies Registration Office are to be transferred from the Government to an administrative court. But what substantive criteria should there be for exemptions?</p>
<p>The remit also includes considering whether there is reason to specify the conditions for licences and mediation, and whether additional control arrangements are necessary in certain cases. The terms of reference also identify a number of consequential and specific issues.</p>
<h2>Proposals in brief</h2>
<p>The following is a summary of the Inquiry’s proposals.</p>
<h2>Exploitation for the benefit of persons with disabilities</h2>
<p>The requirement concerning permission is abolished and replaced by a notification obligation</p>
<p>At present, permission from the Government is required for libraries and organisations to be able to exploit protected works for the benefit of persons with disabilities in the manner stated in Section 17, second paragraph of the Act on Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works (1960:729).</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the requirement concerning permission be abolished and replaced by a notification obligation. This notification obligation will cover the same situations as the current requirement concerning permission. The Swedish Patent and Registration Office will maintain a register of the applications. The information in the register will be used to distribute the cultural policy support allocated by the state to authors and translators, based on their works being used pursuant to the provision (‘talking book compensation’).</p>
<p>Sanctions are associated with the requirements in Section 3 of the Copyright Regulation</p>
<p>A person who, pursuant to Section 17, second paragraph of the Act on Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works, exploits protected works for the benefit of persons with disabilities shall, in certain cases, inform the originator, label the copy with bibliographic information and maintain a register. The provisions concerning this are found in Section 3, first paragraph of the Copyright Regulation (1993:1212). There are currently no sanctions associated with the requirements.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that sanctions be associated with these requirements so that originators are provided with better information and control. This will be done by including the provisions in the Act on Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works and making them prerequisites for the limitation to be applicable. Anyone who does not comply with the requirements therefore risks infringing upon the originator’s exclusive rights.</p>
<p>The proposal calls for the introduction of an exception. The requirements will primarily apply to exploitation that has the greatest significance to originators, such as when someone records talking books or makes them accessible on the internet. In other cases, where there is less risk of encroachment, the Inquiry proposes easing the current regulations and relieving libraries and organisations from the obligation of following the requirements.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that sanctions be associated with the requirement concerning notification in Section 3, second paragraph of the Copyright Regulation. This requirement applies to certain kinds of exploitation – such as the purchase of talking books – that enable persons with disabilities to keep a copy of the work.</p>
<p>The obligation to inform is made clearer</p>
<p>Under Section 3 of the Copyright Regulation, the originator is to be informed if this can be done without inconvenience. This formulation is vague. The Inquiry proposes that situations in which originators are to be informed be made clearer.</p>
<p>An alternative: the requirement concerning permission is retained</p>
<p>If, in the continued legislative process, the assessment is made that requirements concerning permission pursuant to Section 17, second paragraph of the Act on Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works are to be retained, the Inquiry presents an alternative. According to this alternative, applications will be examined according to the same criteria as at present and the matters will be transferred from the Government to the Swedish Patent and Registration Office.</p>
<h2>Making and distributing copies within archives and libraries</h2>
<p>Limitation restricted for certain archives and libraries</p>
<p>The limitation found in Section 16 of the Act on Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works provides state and municipal archive authorities, research libraries and technical libraries that are operated by public authorities, as well as public libraries, with the right to make copies of works for certain purposes, namely (1) preservation, supplementation or research, (2) to meet borrowers’ requests to obtain individual articles, short excerpts or other material which, for security reasons, should not be made available in the original, or (3) for use in reading devices. Other archives and libraries may make copies for the same purpose if they have the Government’s permission.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the limitation for the benefit of archives and libraries other than those stated in Section 16, third paragraph of the Act on Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works – i.e. primarily archives and libraries that are not operated by public authorities – be restricted to apply to making copies for preservation purposes.</p>
<p>The requirement concerning permission is abolished</p>
<p>As mentioned above, under current regulations, permission from the Government is required for archives and libraries other than those stated in Section 16, third paragraph of the Act on Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works to make copies pursuant to the limitation covering matters that include preservation purposes. The Inquiry proposes that the requirement concerning permission be abolished. Permission will thus no longer be necessary for other archives and libraries – for example within local associations and popular movements – to make copies for preservation purposes.</p>
<p>It is made clear that exploitation may not occur for the purpose of making a profit</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that it be made clear that making and distributing copies pursuant to Section 16 of the Act on Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works may not occur for the purpose of making a profit. In this way, the requirements already in place based on EU law will be made clearer.</p>
<p>The collective licence provision in Section 42 d of the Act on</p>
<p>Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works is expanded</p>
<p>Which archives and libraries may enter into an agreement with extended collective licences pursuant to Section 42 d of the Act on Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works is currently determined in part by referring to those that have received permission under Section 16, fourth paragraph of the same Act. Since the Inquiry proposes abolishing the requirement concerning permission, consequential amendments must be made to the provision. The Inquiry proposes that all archives and libraries be given the opportunity to enter into an agreement on extended collective licences pursuant to Section 42 d of the Act on Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works.</p>
<h2>Mediation in copyright disputes</h2>
<p>The Mediation Act is revised linguistically and structurally</p>
<p>The Act on Mediation in Certain Copyright Disputes (1980:612) (the Mediation Act) has been amended on several occasions since its entry into force. However, a comprehensive review of the Act has never been carried out. The Inquiry proposes that the Act be revised linguistically and structurally so that it is adapted to the requirements concerning language and structure currently in force.</p>
<p>Matters are transferred from the Government to the Stockholm District Court</p>
<p>At present, the Government handles matters concerning mediation and the appointment of mediators. The Inquiry proposes that these matters be transferred to a general court, primarily the Stockholm District Court. When handling these matters, the Court Matters Act (1996:242) is to be applicable.</p>
<p>It is made clearer who is to be appointed mediator</p>
<p>There are currently no explicit regulations in place concerning the choice of mediator. Instead, the qualifications a mediator should have are determined by the Government in each individual case. The Inquiry proposes that it be made clearer who is to be appointed mediator. Only a person who is impartial, independent and otherwise suitable for the task may be appointed mediator.</p>
<p>Prolongation and the length of the mediation period</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the regulations concerning how long agreements continue to apply after the agreement period has expired (prolongation) are to be retained. The parties’ interest in ensuring that old agreements do not remain in force for too long a period of time is satisfied by including provisions concerning the length of the mediation procedure in the Act. The court is to set a time limit within which mediation is to be concluded. The time limit can be extended by the court if special grounds exist.</p>
<p>It is clarified when mediation is to be considered concluded</p>
<p>The regulations in the Mediation Act on when mediation is to be considered concluded are currently spread across several paragraphs with varying content. The Inquiry proposes clarifying the regulations. Mediation is to be considered concluded if (1) the parties reach an agreement, (2) the time limits set by the court for mediation have expired, or (3) the mediator decides to terminate mediation.</p>
<h2>Certain matters in the area of company law</h2>
<p>Reviews are transferred from the Government to a general administrative court</p>
<p>Provisions exist in the area of company law concerning exemptions from a number of different requirements in the legislation. Exemption issues are examined by the Swedish Companies Registration Office. Decisions taken by the Office are currently appealed to the Government. The Inquiry proposes that reviews of exemption matters be transferred from the Government to a general administrative court.</p>
<p>What should constitute the conditions for exemption from the residency requirement?</p>
<p>Several of the relevant requirements entail that certain functionaries of limited liability companies and economic associations must be resident in the EEA. However, the substantive criteria for exemptions are not made clear by the legislation.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that exemption from the requirement of residency in the EEA may be granted if there are special grounds for doing so. According to the proposal, special grounds for exemption may be that the applicant has adequately demonstrated that the relevant function will be satisfactorily managed even though the residency requirement is not met. Special grounds for exemption may also be that private law judgments and decisions against the official may be enforced.</p>
<h2>Entry into force, etc.</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the new provisions enter into force on 1 July 2014. The transitional provisions have been formulated in different ways, since the proposals apply to different legal areas.</p>
<p>Proposed amendments to the Act on Copyright in Literary and Artistic Works</p>
<p>The new provisions are also to apply to works and performances that originated before the entry into force of the new provisions. Older provisions will continue to apply with regard to measures taken or rights acquired before entry into force. This means that libraries, organisations or others that already have permission may continue to exploit protected works and performances pursuant to that permission and the provisions that applied when permission was given. Applications for permission received by the Government prior to entry into force are to be processed according to the older regulations.</p>
<p>Proposed amendments to the Mediation Act</p>
<p>Older provisions are to apply if the Government has received a writ calling for mediation before entry into force. This means that matters already being processed by the Government will not be transferred to the Stockholm District Court.</p>
<p>Proposed amendments to company law legislation</p>
<p>Under the proposal, decisions by the Swedish Companies Registration Office in exemption matters that have been issued before entry into force are to be appealed to the Government in accordance with older provisions.</p>
