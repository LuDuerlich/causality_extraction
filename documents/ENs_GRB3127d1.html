<p>Chapter 1 The Commission’s terms of reference and procedures</p>
<p>In the report ‘The Office of the Children’s Ombudsman – an advocate for children and young people’ (SOU 1999:65), it was proposed that official responsibility for the coordination of child and youth safety issues should be clarified and transferred to some other agency.</p>
<p>In Government Bill 2001/02:96, ‘Strengthening the Office of the Children’s Ombudsman’, which was presented to Parliament in February 2002, it was proposed that, as part of the process of refining the role of the Children’s Ombudsman, the area of child safety should be reassigned to another authority. It was also observed in the Bill that responsibility for the play and outdoor environments of children had not been transferred to the Children’s Ombudsman or any other agency from the former National Child Environment Council.</p>
<p>In addition, the Government had taken note of research results pointing to social differences in the injury risks of children and young people.</p>
<p>Against this background, in October 2001 the Government appointed a Child Safety Commission to work with issues relating to the environments of children and young people, with a focus on safety, injury prevention, and the right to play and recreation (S 2001:05).</p>
<p>The Commission has also had the official coordinating responsibility for efforts to promote child and youth safety.</p>
<p>The members and Secretariat of the Commission were appointed in the autumn of 2001, and began their work in January 2002. The assignment entrusted to the Commission was to be completed in its entirety by 31 December 2003, and prior to that an interim report was to be submitted on the question of which agency should</p>
<p>in future have overall responsibility for child safety issues. In February 2003 the Commission published this interim report, entitled ‘The right of children to safe environments conducive to their development. The future lead agency’ (SOU 2003:19).</p>
<p>We hereby present, in accordance with our terms of reference, our final report: ‘From child accidents to the right of the child to safety and development’ (SOU 2003:127).</p>
<p>Under its terms of reference, the Commission has had the task of reviewing and working with issues of safety and prevention of injuries in the environment of children and young people. The terms of reference have also required the Commission, in its work, to pay particular attention to and take into account the differing basic conditions and needs of children and young people, reflecting their gender, disability, ethnicity, and socio-economic and regional circumstances.</p>
<p>The Secretariat has reviewed studies, reports and research in this field and invited researchers and representatives of different bodies and programmes to Commission meetings and round tables, both to broaden its general understanding of the area and to provide information on specific activities. Four reference groups have been attached to the Commission, to gather information and reflect on its proposals. In addition, in the course of our inquiry we have paid fact-finding visits to various institutions and projects and held consultations with public authorities and organizations. We have also conducted numerous individual interviews with representatives of different bodies.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 The right of the child to safety and development</p>
<p>By ratifying the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (the Children’s Convention), Sweden has undertaken to ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child. In its work, the Commission has primarily taken into account the four main principles of the Convention: that the best interests of the child are to be a primary consideration (Art. 3); that all children have the same rights and are of equal worth (Art. 2); the right to life and development (Art. 6); and the right of the child to express his or her views (Art. 12). We would argue that, if due regard is paid to these principles – in the light of which the other</p>
<p>articles of the Convention are to be interpreted – they provide a value base for the task of creating environments for children and young people which are safe and conducive to their development, and of involving youngsters themselves in this process.</p>
<p>Views of children have gradually changed in recent years, in research, politics and other arenas. The Children’s Convention and new knowledge relating to children and childhood have together helped bring about a shift from a view of children as the object of upbringing and other actions by adults to a view of them as competent actors with expert knowledge of their own. In efforts to promote children’s safety and development, it is important to remember that children have a right to protection and care, while also having a right to participation and a say in decision-making.</p>
<p>Young people are growing up in an increasingly changing society, which means that it is no longer possible for them to take over the cultures, life patterns and identities of their parents’ generation. The traditional norm and value systems that once shaped people’s lives are becoming less influential. It might be imagined that all the choices available and the growing emphasis on the individual would mean that everyone had the same life chances, but major differences in basic terms of existence still exist between young people from different social backgrounds. While these are the tendencies that emerge from sociological research, parents of course still have a significant impact on how the individual young person shapes his or her life. In seeking to promote safe environments conducive to the development of the younger generation, it is important to proceed from an awareness that young people are a heterogeneous group, with varying interests and preferences.</p>
<p>The Child Safety Commission has primarily focused on unintentional injuries (accidents), but it has also looked at selfinflicted injuries and those resulting from violence. Our inquiry has concentrated on serious and fatal injuries, and on injuries that can cause long-term suffering or functional impairment. An endeavour to prevent every minor injury could impose excessive restrictions on children’s everyday lives.</p>
<p>In the case of injuries due to violence and those that are selfinflicted, a different kind of discussion is of course called for: here, it is not only the injuries as such that we are anxious to prevent,</p>
<p>but also the phenomena behind them, such as violence and mental ill health.</p>
<p>Safety and development are mutually dependent. Efforts to promote safety can make children more secure and give them greater scope to play and move about freely. But they are no guarantee that the children’s environment will be stimulating and beneficial to their development. To create such environments, a partly different approach is required. An environment conducive to development offers opportunities for play and independent mobility, allowing children and young people to safely visit their friends, go to school, and travel to recreational activities and service outlets. It is also important that they themselves feel secure in their environment.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 Future efforts to promote safety and development</p>
<p>The Child Safety Commission’s vision for future work in this area is that all children and young people should be able to safely play and spend time in all environments without being killed or seriously injured. The responsibilities of the future lead agency should include monitoring how different bodies and organizations in society, both public and private, are helping to realize this vision. Today, the situation of children in Sweden, including their safety and development, is affected not only by national regulations and strategies, but also by decisions taken for example within the European Union.</p>
<p>We wish to highlight four important aims and principles that should guide future efforts to achieve safe environments conducive to the development of children and young people:</p>
<p>• Give children and young people a greater say in decisions affecting their everyday lives</p>
<p>In our view, the participation of children and young people is essential to carrying the process forward, particularly in terms of new methods and approaches and new phenomena that require attention.</p>
<p>• A more  in-depth understanding of the social background factors behind injuries is needed</p>
<p>A modern approach to child safety promotion needs to take into account psychosocial, socio-economic and physical aspects of children’s and young people’s environments. Research reveals clear social differences in the risk of being injured; now a deeper understanding of the causes of these differences is needed. Attention should also be paid to injuries resulting from violence and self-destructive acts.</p>
<p>• Safety and development are mutually dependent</p>
<p>It is important to see the development of children and young people in context. Youngsters have a right to grow up in an environment in which they can play and move about freely, accept challenges, and gradually extend their radius of action and their independence, without risking being killed or seriously injured.</p>
<p>• Adolescents are a forgotten group</p>
<p>To a large extent, Swedish injury prevention efforts have focused on younger children. It is important to maintain these efforts, but also to step up preventive action for the benefit of adolescents.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the future lead agency should primarily focus on the following areas of work: coordination, knowledge development, methods development, surveillance and the task of serving as a unifying force for education, information and campaign activities. We propose that the future lead agency should be commissioned to study the feasibility of establishing regional knowledge centres. In the area of coordination we propose that the agency, in consultation with the National Agency for School Improvement and the National Agency for Education, should examine the need and scope to address safety and development issues in pre-schools, after-school centres, pre-school classes and schools, and make recommendations as to how such work could be naturally integrated into the educational activities of these facilities.</p>
<p>There are a number of areas and groups to which we feel attention needs to be devoted in the future. We have noted the</p>
<p>existence of social differences in injury risks among children and young people, and therefore consider it important to achieve a better understanding of ways of reducing such differences. We therefore propose that the future lead agency, working with the sectoral authorities concerned and with researchers, should develop methods to diminish social differences in the occurrence of injuries. We believe that it is also important, from the viewpoint of future efforts in this area, to monitor the social distribution of injuries among children and young people and to make the results known to decision-makers. Accordingly, we propose that the future lead agency should monitor the social distribution of injuries among children and young people and make the resultant data known to politicians and decision-makers at all levels.</p>
<p>Up to now, much of the work done in Sweden to promote child safety has had a focus on younger children. In future, special responsibility should be assumed for developing new knowledge relevant to promoting the safety of adolescents. Environments conducive to the development of this age group are another important area of work.</p>
<p>We have noted a lack of knowledge concerning the pattern of injuries across different categories of housing. We therefore propose that the National Board of Health and Welfare and the Swedish Rescue Services Agency, in collaboration with the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning, should initiate and monitor the implementation of analyses of injury patterns in neighbourhoods of different types.</p>
<p>Our discussions with our Young People’s Reference Group have demonstrated the importance of involving young people in the process. It is vital to continue to develop arrangements that will enable children and young people to participate at different levels in society. Involving the young generation and listening to their views and expertise will allow safety promotion activities to be developed and highlight areas in particular need of attention.</p>
<p>Every year around 100 children under the age of 18 in Sweden die as a result of injuries, violence or suicide. Roughly half of these children are killed on the roads, this category being followed by those dying as a result of deliberate self-inflicted injuries, drowning or fires. The Commission considers it important to investigate cases with a fatal outcome, since such inquiries can provide valuable</p>
<p>knowledge for preventive efforts. We therefore propose that the Rescue Services Agency’s National Centre for Lessons Learned from Accidents (NCO) should be commissioned, first, to investigate – where this would not otherwise be done – cases in which children and young people under the age of 18 have died as the result of an accident, suicide or violence; and second, to summarize and publish on an annual basis the results of other agencies’ inquiries into deaths, in collaboration with the agencies concerned.</p>
<p>The Child Safety Commission has identified a number of areas in which more needs to be done at the national level, and in which responsibilities need to be clarified. These areas are injuries resulting from violence and self-destructive acts; sports injuries; drowning; and safe outdoor environments conducive to children’s development. A review of the framework documents and activities of relevant authorities shows that several of these areas already fall within the remit of different authorities.</p>
<p>As regards sports injuries, no national coordination or methodological development of preventive efforts is currently under way. According to its standing instructions, the National Institute of Public Health is to serve as a national knowledge centre for methods and strategies in the field of public health, as well as promoting health and preventing diseases and injuries. We therefore propose that this Institute should be entrusted with developing methods and strategies to prevent sports injuries, in both organized and recreational sport, with a particular emphasis on children and young people.</p>
<p>There is no agency at present with overall national responsibility for ensuring the right of children to safe and developmentenhancing outdoor environments in the vicinity of pre-schools and schools and in residential areas. These questions have received little attention since 1993, when the National Child Environment Council was replaced with the Office of the Children’s Ombudsman. In our view, therefore, the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning should give a national lead in this area, and we propose that it be entrusted with overall responsibility for developing and disseminating knowledge about safe outdoor environments conducive to development, with a particular focus on children and young people.</p>
<p>For issues relating to drowning, too, there is no national lead authority at the present time. The principal body currently working with these issues at a national level is the Swedish Life Saving Federation, a non-governmental organization. In our view, the Swedish Rescue Services Agency is the authority best suited to act as the lead agency in this area, since its mandate includes seeking to reduce the number of accidents and to create a safer society. The new Rescue Services Act that has now been proposed will impose an obligation on municipal authorities to draw up local action programmes to prevent accidents which require the deployment of emergency services. The problem of drowning should be a natural focus of action in this context, and we propose that a national sectoral responsibility for measures to prevent drowning should be established in the appropriation directions of the Rescue Services Agency.</p>
<p>In the search for greater security and safety for children and young people, attention needs to be paid to injuries resulting from violence. Such injuries among children and young people are a matter of great concern from a public health point of view, and fall primarily within the remit of the National Institute of Public Health and the National Council for Crime Prevention. Neither of these authorities is currently able to address this issue in an active manner, and we therefore propose that the future lead agency should have a national coordinating responsibility for efforts to prevent injuries caused by violence.</p>
<p>Injuries resulting from self-destructive actions, such as suicide attempts, suicide and self-inflicted injuries, have attracted growing attention as knowledge about such phenomena has expanded. The work of the National Board of Health and Welfare covers the policy areas of health care, social services and public health, all of which are relevant in various ways to this complex set of issues. Such questions therefore fall within the Board’s sphere of responsibility.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 How and in what environments are children and young people injured?</p>
<p>In Sweden as in other parts of the world, injuries are a major public health problem. Even if the number of deaths in Sweden resulting from injuries is low compared with other countries, injuries still represent the commonest cause of death among children and young people. The number of injuries increases as their severity decreases, and the situation can be described as a pyramid, with fatal injuries at the top and minor ones at the bottom. Road traffic accidents account for the largest share of fatal injuries, but when it comes to injuries requiring hospital treatment various types of falls are the commonest cause.</p>
<p>Injuries are not randomly distributed over different areas and different social groups in Sweden. There are clear regional differences in the risk of being injured and in patterns of injury. These are described in more detail in the ‘Child Injury Atlas’ (SOU 2002:99) prepared at the request of the Commission. National studies show that there are also socio-economic differences in the risk of being injured, a state of affairs described more fully in one of the Child Safety Commission’s reports, dealing with social differences in injury risks (SOU 2002:68).</p>
<p>Although generally speaking more deaths due to injuries occur among boys than among girls, a similar pattern of causes of death emerges for both sexes. Road traffic accounts for the largest share of deaths throughout childhood and adolescence, the proportion showing a marked rise with increasing age. Drowning, suffocation and violence primarily figure as causes of death in the younger age groups. Between the ages of 13 and 17, injuries resulting from deliberate self-destructive actions cause a large proportion of deaths among both boys and girls. Such injuries are responsible for a larger share of deaths among girls than among boys, but the number of deaths resulting from them is higher for boys than for girls.</p>
<p>As regards fatalities resulting from road traffic injuries, injuries associated with car use predominate among both boys and girls and in all age groups. It should be noted, though, that in Sweden few children in the youngest age groups are killed on the roads. Among boys aged 13–17, moped and motorcycle injuries account for a</p>
<p>large share of deaths. Specific to girls are fatalities arising from horse and pony riding on roads.</p>
<p>Injuries caused by falls of various kinds make up more than half the injuries requiring hospital treatment up to the age of 12, and just under half in the case of the 13–17 age group. A clear agedrelated pattern emerges for different types of falls. Falls on the same level, from furniture and on stairs are commonest among the youngest children. Between the ages of 4 and 6, falls from furniture become less frequent, while falls from playground equipment become more common. In this age group the number of falls on skis, skates, in-line skates etc. also increases. This type shows a further rise among 7- to 12-year-olds, while falls from play equipment decrease. Same-level falls increase in this age group, largely owing to sports injuries (falls occurring while playing football, floorball etc.). Falls of this kind then increase further in the oldest age group.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 Injuries and injury prevention from a national economic point of view</p>
<p>The public policy aim of safeguarding people’s lives and health is manifested in both legislation and goal and policy documents. The case for injury prevention measures is rarely based on purely economic arguments, but rather on a valuation of the benefits of reducing injury rates. It is therefore important to establish what measures to prevent injuries will achieve policy objectives at the lowest cost. To this end, cost-effectiveness studies of such measures need to be developed. With regard to children and young people, we need to achieve a better understanding of how safety is valued – both by adults and by children themselves. It is also necessary to develop the effectiveness of different measures for children and young people. We note that society invests considerable resources in injury prevention. It is therefore important to improve our understanding of how the priorities defined by society promote the safety of children and young people.</p>
<p>While saving money is not the primary aim of injury prevention efforts, it is important to recognize that personal injuries often entail costs of various kinds over an extended period of time, spread over different cost-bearing entities, such as health services,</p>
<p>the social insurance system, local authorities and insurance companies. Existing knowledge about what injuries to children and young people cost society and how they are distributed over different cost bearers is inadequate.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 Statistics and other sources of information on safe environments conducive to children’s and young people’s development</p>
<p>It is important to be able to monitor changes in areas which we know can affect the safety and development of children and young people. One way of acquiring knowledge about changes over time is to track different types of occurrences that can be linked to safety or development, for example the number of injuries occurring. Data on different characteristics of environments, such as distance to schools and play and recreation areas, traffic volume on roads, the design of school and pre-school environments, the condition of playgrounds and play equipment etc., also enhance our understanding of the risks and development opportunities associated with these environments.</p>
<p>Continuous surveillance of injuries can help to identify different types of risks and the causes of injuries, and offer a picture of how injuries are distributed in the population, providing a basis for health promotion and injury prevention activities. This chapter gives a brief account of recurring national data collection programmes which provide a knowledge base for the task of ensuring the right of children and young people to safe environments which promote their development.</p>
<p>The Commission considers it important to strengthen the detailed, sample-based component of the existing national hospital discharge register. We propose that the current arrangement, whereby in-depth data on injuries are collected from a sample of hospitals representing just under 6 per cent of Sweden’s population, should be expanded to cover some 15 per cent of the population. The sample-based part of the system includes information on where, how and when injuries have occurred and on their causes. More detailed information about the background factors behind events leading to deaths and personal injuries provides a better basis for effective injury prevention efforts. Such a system also</p>
<p>gives us an improved understanding of the causes of childhood and youth injuries. The Child Safety Commission underlines the importance of a long-term financial solution to safeguard the system that has been developed and to permit further development of what is a powerful tool for effective injury prevention. The information contained in this part of the hospital discharge register sheds light on the external causes of injuries and provides a clearer link with injury prevention measures and the agencies and organizations responsible for them.</p>
<p>We propose that a national reference group be set up to support the development of the national information system. It should include members with a special brief to ensure that the quality of data on children’s and young people’s injuries is improved. The Commission regards it as essential to make full use of, collate and regularly publish the information provided by certificates of cause of death, and we propose that arrangements to do this should be established. This will provide a fuller picture of the sequences of events leading to deaths among children and young people, and could among other things identify where responsibility for preventive action lies.</p>
<p>Not enough is known at present about the nature and extent of children’s movements and the environments in which they take place – for example, where children play and how they move from place to place. Information on these subjects is something children themselves can supply us with. Equally, only youngsters themselves can tell us whether or not they feel secure. This sense of security is important for both the safety and the development of a child, and can be linked to the different environments involved: the road traffic environment, the school environment etc.</p>
<p>As provided in legislation and national goal and framework documents, the various sectoral authorities are responsible for producing knowledge in their respective fields, inter alia by means of monitoring. Since documents of these kinds make little reference to the right of children and young people to environments conducive to their development, national responsibility for this area is not clearly assigned to any specific body. This means that there is no national driving force for monitoring and systematic development relating to these issues. Several of the proposals advanced in this report will therefore require questions concerning the right of</p>
<p>children and young people to development-friendly environments to be incorporated in legislation and national goal and framework documents, in order to create incentives to develop monitoring.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 In the home</p>
<p>To a large extent, child safety efforts in Sweden have focused on young children and on measures in the home, an approach that has in fact reduced the number of injuries occurring in the domestic environment. There are many successful examples of modifications to this environment or to products found there, aimed at reducing incidents in which children are injured at home; these include window stops, childproof medicine containers and childproof electric sockets.</p>
<p>Among younger children, the majority of injuries occur in the home and in residential areas. Different types of falls are the commonest cause of domestic injuries. Injuries resulting from scalding and poisoning are common among young children, as are crushing and cutting injuries up to the age of 6. Damage to teeth has also been observed to be a frequently occurring type of injury, especially in the younger age groups.</p>
<p>The home environment poses different types of injury risk for a child, and these risks change as the child grows and develops. For the parent, it can be difficult to discover the dangers in time. Credible and accessible information for parents is therefore an important injury prevention measure. Since there will always be newcomers to parenthood, such information has to be provided on a continuous basis.</p>
<p>The building regulations of the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning include safety standards that apply to new buildings and to alterations to existing ones. To what extent these regulations are adhered to, however, is unclear. If a building is altered, it is the owner’s responsibility to ensure that the work complies with the child safety standards in force when the alterations are carried out. Despite this, new windows without stops or other safety devices are still fitted in homes, and new cookers are installed without their anti-tipping devices being secured. We therefore propose that the National Board of Housing,</p>
<p>Building and Planning should conduct a review of compliance with safety standards.</p>
<p>Most of the existing child safety standards for new buildings were incorporated into the building legislation in 1973, and those for alterations in 1976. Buildings constructed before 1973 or altered before 1976 usually lack the protection against injuries that is now included in new and altered buildings. This means, for one thing, that much of the housing built as part of the ‘million homes programme’ (1964–75) is not covered by the child safety standards laid down in the Board of Housing, Building and Planning’s building regulations. The Board has expertise regarding the different child safety devices and other measures that can be installed and introduced to improve safety in the home. We therefore propose that the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning should be given the task of producing and disseminating information on ways of enhancing child safety in older buildings.</p>
<p>The principal role of the Swedish Poisons Information Centre (GIC) is to provide information about risks and symptoms and to give advice on treatment in the event of acute poisoning incidents, both to the general public and to practitioners. More than half the enquiries the Centre receives relate to children under the age of 10. Often, the children concerned have drunk chemical products or ingested medicines by mistake, and such incidents mainly occur in the home. At present, information on the composition of chemical products is supplied to the Centre on a voluntary basis. We propose that all companies manufacturing and/or selling chemical products which could entail a risk of poisoning should be required to supply the Poisons Information Centre with data on the chemical composition of those products.</p>
<p>Chapter 8 Products</p>
<p>Children and young people constantly come into contact with products which in one way or another can pose a risk of injury. Globally, the range of products available is enormous, and increasingly free movement of goods and services within the EU, where producers themselves are responsible for product safety, means that the question of the safety of products to consumers needs to be carefully monitored.</p>
<p>The aim of making products safe is being pursued through work on various product directives at the European level and through standardization on both a national and an international basis. Existing rules in this field need to be continuously reviewed and improved, since new products are constantly appearing on the market.</p>
<p>Chapter 9 Pre-schools, after-school centres, pre-school classes and schools</p>
<p>Children today spend the largest part of their everyday lives at preschool, at an after-school centre, in a pre-school class or at school. The outdoor environments in the immediate vicinity of pre-schools and schools are therefore very important for their development and health. To raise standards in terms of secure, safe and stimulating outdoor environments, we propose that the Education Act should be supplemented to include a requirement that both indoor and outdoor school environments are suited to their purpose.</p>
<p>For pre-school children, outdoor spaces are an important developmental environment. It has been drawn to our attention that staffing cuts at pre-schools have reduced the scope for visits to parks and other green spaces, at the same time as the pre-schools’ own outdoor environments have not been developed so as to offer corresponding amenities. We therefore propose that, as part of its inspection of local authorities, the National Agency for Education should be asked to review the way in which authorities are discharging their responsibilities for the outdoor environments of pre-schools.</p>
<p>The National Agency for School Improvement, too, should be an important driving force and source of inspiration when it comes to developing the outdoor environments of pre-schools and schools. We therefore propose that this Agency should give priority to the outdoor environment of pre-schools in its development work. The Pre-School Curriculum (Lpfö 98), as currently worded, supports the view that the outdoor environment of pre-schools falls within the remit of both national education agencies, and it is our opinion that a more proactive approach to this question is called for.</p>
<p>In 1990 the application of parts of the Work Environment Act was extended to include individuals undergoing education, and since 1998 these rules have also applied to children in pre-school classes (aged 6–7). The Act applies on school premises during school hours, and covers some 1.5 million children and young people. The Commission’s view is that the Work Environment Act and the systematic working environment programmes which it requires could be a valuable means of improving the overall environment of child day care and school education. Several surveys suggest that compliance with the Act in schools is very poor as far as pupils are concerned. Studies show that many pupils sustain injuries in the school environment. According to the data emerging from these studies, the number of children and young people injured at school (between 19 and 30 pupils per 1,000) is higher than the number of adults who, according to the Swedish Work Environment Authority, are injured at work (roughly 6 to 8 workplace accidents per 1,000). Younger pupils are mostly injured during breaks and older ones during physical education lessons. More boys than girls are injured. Most of the injuries occur outdoors. Body contact (unintentional or intentional), e.g. collisions, hitting, pushing or kicking, accounts for some 30 per cent of all injuries to pupils.</p>
<p>The Commission is of the opinion that a review of the entire Work Environment Act from the standpoint of the pupil should be commenced immediately, also taking into account children at preschools and after-school centres. Pending the outcome of such a review, the Commission is presenting several proposals aimed at improving the working environment of pre-schools, after-school centres, pre-school classes and schools.</p>
<p>We consider it very important to give pupils the opportunity to influence and assume responsibility for their own working environment at school by involving them in work environment issues. Schools should make use of the resource which their knowledge and participation represent. In addition, working environment activities in schools provide a preparation for the world of employment. School students do not have the same opportunities as employees’ representatives to influence the environment in which they work, and need extra support in this context. We therefore propose that supervision by the Work</p>
<p>Environment Authority of the working environment of pupils in schools should be developed and improved. It is our view that more effective supervision will improve compliance with the relevant legislation and thereby reduce the number of pupil injuries resulting from accidents.</p>
<p>From our contacts with their organizations, it emerges that pupils are often unaware of their right to appoint their own safety representatives. In a report entitled ‘Pupil involvement in schools’ work environment activities through pupil safety representatives’, the National Agency for Education proposes, among other things, that head teachers should be required to inform pupils of their right to elect such representatives, and that the Work Environment Authority and the Agency for Education should together draw up guidelines on what training for pupil safety representatives should include and who should be responsible for it. The Commission welcomes and supports these measures to improve pupil participation in working environment activities. We assume that the proposals of the National Agency for Education will be implemented.</p>
<p>The Child Safety Commission feels that the position of pupil safety representatives on schools’ safety committees needs to be strengthened. To give these representatives a greater say and more scope to influence the working environment of their schools, we propose that they should also have the right to present proposals and to vote at safety committee meetings.</p>
<p>We propose that working environment training should be included in the new state education programme for school heads, so as to improve the school working environment of both pupils and staff. We also propose that the provisions of the Work Environment Act should apply to children at pre-schools and afterschool centres. From the vantage point of the child, pre-school, after-school centre, pre-school class and school form a coherent whole and constitute the environment in which they spend the greater part of their everyday lives. Children at pre-schools and after-school centres have the same need of a good working environment as older children and adults. We propose that children from pre-school classes up to year 6 should be given the right to appoint pupil safety representatives.</p>
<p>We propose that the Work Environment Authority, in consultation with the National Agency for Education, should be asked to deliberate on appropriate arrangements for reporting of schools’ work environment activities, and that the general provisions chapter of the new Education Act should include a clause making it clear that the Work Environment Act and its provisions apply to the school system as a whole.</p>
<p>The Commission takes the view that, to achieve an effective injury prevention programme, injuries occurring in schools need to be continuously reported and recorded at a national level. We propose that the Work Environment Authority should collect, analyse and publish data on injuries occurring in pre-school classes and schools in the same manner as it does for occupational injuries in general.</p>
<p>Chapter 10 The working environment of minors</p>
<p>Although the working conditions of minors are carefully regulated, serious injuries and deaths nevertheless occur every year in conjunction with the employment of young people. The Child Safety Commission considers the existing legislation on the working environment of minors to be adequate. We propose that the information given to those responsible for the working conditions of young people should be broadened and improved, so as to reduce occupational injury rates among this group. It is also important to ensure that workplace injuries affecting minors are reported, so as to improve the basic data for injury prevention efforts. The social partners, responsible authorities and schools must work together to disseminate information about the working conditions of minors to employers, children and young people and their parents.</p>
<p>Chapter 11 The road traffic environment</p>
<p>Injuries on the roads are the principal cause of death among children and young people. Road traffic affects young people’s lives in many ways. It opens up greater opportunities in terms of mobility, but may also be an obstacle to children wishing to</p>
<p>discover and explore their immediate surroundings. The Government has emphasized that the needs of children, especially in terms of access, traffic safety and a good environment, should guide the way the transport system is designed and operates.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposals are above all intended to enhance the safety and independent mobility of all children and young people. They should not, though, be seen as a substitute for other measures designed to promote alternative modes of transport. It is important for example, in line with government objectives in the areas of transport and environment policy, to develop public transport at the local and regional levels. Particular attention should be paid to transport for young people in the evenings and at weekends, a factor that could also help to reduce the occurrence of drink-driving.</p>
<p>In several countries, injuries to child pedestrians have decreased, despite an increase in traffic. To establish whether this is because conditions for children have become safer or because they are spending less and less time in traffic, we need to know the nature and extent of children’s and young people’s movements in the road traffic environment. We therefore propose that the National Road Administration should be given the task of further developing studies of children’s/young people’s exposure to road traffic.</p>
<p>These days, vulnerable road users and vehicular traffic are increasingly having to share the space available on roads and streets. In our opinion, this trend could have consequences for the safety and mobility of children and young people. To avoid any adverse impacts for the young generation, we propose that the National Road Administration and the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning, in consultation with the Swedish Association of Local Authorities, should develop criteria to ensure the safety and development of children and young people in road and street environments with mixed traffic.</p>
<p>Many local authorities have achieved a great deal in terms of promoting safe environments for pedestrians and cyclists in builtup areas. On the state road network, on the other hand, pedestrian and cycle traffic has not been given the same priority. We therefore propose that the National Road Administration should be charged with developing the pedestrian and cycling infrastructure along state roads, to make it safer for children to travel to school.</p>
<p>School transport services are provided by local authorities to ensure that children who live a long way from school are also able to attend. In many cases, therefore, they offer a safer means of transport than if the children were to walk or cycle on their own. However, certain problems with these services have emerged in recent years. The Commission consequently wishes to draw attention to three areas in which improvements need to be made. Reporting of incidents and injuries in conjunction with the use of school transport services must be improved, and we therefore propose that the National Road Administration should examine ways of including data on such occurrences in its system for recording road traffic injuries. When local authorities award school transport contracts, they have an opportunity to improve both safety and security by laying down requirements concerning contractors, vehicles and drivers (e.g. a requirement that alcohol ignition interlock devices be fitted). We propose that the National Road Administration, in consultation with the Swedish Association of Local Authorities, should prepare national advice and guidelines concerning the road safety requirements to be imposed when purchasing school transport services. The transport situation for children with disabilities is not satisfactory at present, and the guidelines should take particular account of this. Several groups are affected by school transport services, and closer dialogue among them would make for a better understanding of their respective situations, as well as making it easier to deal with problems that arise. We propose that the National Road Administration, in consultation with the Association of Local Authorities and the National Agency for Education, should develop methods for consultation between children, drivers, schools, local authorities and parents, with a view to improving the safety of school transport services.</p>
<p>Bicycles are an important mode of transport for children and young people, and they have a right to the independent mobility which being able to cycle to school and to recreational activities entails. This is touched on in several national and international documents. The extent to which children will actually be allowed to cycle on their own and young people will be able to make use of the mobility afforded by the bicycle depends above all on their having access to a safe network of cycle tracks, linking places that</p>
<p>are important to them, such as schools, sports facilities, central shopping streets and market places. A good cycling infrastructure is therefore crucial, and we propose that the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning and the National Road Administration, in close consultation with the Association of Local Authorities, should develop models that will enable a good infrastructure of safe cycleways to be created.</p>
<p>Head injuries account for a significant proportion of serious cycling-related injuries. This is also true of children and young people. In the framework of the National Coalition for Road Safety, launched by the National Road Administration, a rule requiring children to wear cycle helmets has been discussed. However, we propose that the Government should include a provision in the Road Traffic Ordinance requiring all cyclists to wear helmets. The arguments in favour of this proposal are that use of helmets seems to increase among children and young people, too, when there is a law that applies to everyone; that adults’ attitudes and behaviour are a major influence on children; that cycle helmets should be linked to cycling, not to age; and that the obligation to wear a helmet can easily be perceived as a ‘right’ to stop wearing one when a young person is no longer covered by the requirement. The Commission’s Young People’s Reference Group emphasized that, whatever age limit were to be chosen, those still required to wear a helmet would find it more difficult to do so when their older friends no longer had to. Last but not least, the Reference Group stressed that children and young people need their parents and that they, too, are affected if adults close to them are injured or killed.</p>
<p>Increased use of cycle helmets could be a step in the direction of narrowing social differences in injury rates among children. International experience shows that increased helmet use has a bigger impact in terms of reducing injury rates in low-income areas than in high-income neighbourhoods. This is why it is important to make helmets as widely available as possible. In this regard, price is a significant factor. We propose that the National Road Administration should develop a system to subsidize cycle helmets for a limited period, as a complement to the information and education campaign which it intends to launch to coincide with cycle helmets becoming compulsory.</p>
<p>The moped has seen a new rise in popularity in Sweden and, as well as increasing young people’s mobility and independence, this means that youngsters are beginning their careers as motorized road users on a vehicle which, apart from the helmet they are required to wear, leaves them completely unprotected. This creates a significant risk of serious injury. The minimum age for moped riders in Sweden is currently 15. Riders of Class I mopeds must hold a licence, which they can obtain after passing a theory and a practical test. Similar training for Class II (low-performance) mopeds would prepare young people better for their motor vehicle debut in the complex system which road traffic represents. We therefore propose additional terms of reference for the committee that is currently studying the question of licences for riders of Class I mopeds and light all-terrain vehicles, requiring it also to examine the possibility of compulsory training and licences for Class II mopeds. In addition, we propose that the National Road Administration should be asked to review the regulations concerning the carrying of passengers on mopeds. Riders should have some experience of handling a moped themselves before they are permitted to start carrying passengers.</p>
<p>In relation to older adolescents, we wish to increase the availability of broader-based road user training at upper secondary schools, to promote greater risk awareness on the roads and to lay a foundation of knowledge and skills prior to actual driver training. The Commission has noted that access to broader training of this kind (as opposed to training for a driving licence) in upper secondary schools varies widely across the country. To ensure that all young people, wherever they live, have a similar chance of receiving general road safety training before learning to drive, we propose that the National Agency for Education, in collaboration with the National Road Administration, should develop a national syllabus for such a programme.</p>
<p>More extensive driving experience has been found to be a very important factor in reducing the number of incidents giving rise to injuries in which car drivers are involved during their first year with a licence. Studies show that private driving practice is an important part of the training of learner drivers, since it results in greater safety after they have passed their tests, but also that there are certain problems with the way in which such practice is</p>
<p>undertaken, and that injuries occur in conjunction with it. To enhance the effectiveness of private driving practice, we propose improved support for supervisors and learner drivers in the form of compulsory supervisor training. This training should be seen as an initial step in the collaboration that is to take place between supervisor and learner, and they should therefore undergo it at the same time.</p>
<p>To be a safe driver, it is not sufficient to have a technical understanding of how a car works and to know the rules of the road; it is also necessary to be able to judge risk factors and to decide under what conditions it is dangerous to drive. We propose that the National Road Administration should make it compulsory for driver training to include a component designed to create a greater awareness of risks in road traffic and of behaviour that can give rise to dangerous situations. The skid control training provided at skid training centres already includes, in addition to training in practical skills, certain risk awareness elements. Our proposal envisages an expanded programme of skid control and risk training.</p>
<p>An important question for new parents and their relatives is how children should be placed in cars in order to be carried as safely as possible. Regarding this issue, the Commission stresses the need for car manufacturers to assume an overall responsibility for the child safety aspects of their vehicles. Integrating child safety into the design and development of new car models is an important injury prevention measure, facilitating both access to and correct use of child restraints. To give a clearer signal of the importance society attaches to road safety, we propose a tightening up of the Road Traffic Ordinance: on the one hand, it should be clarified to the effect that vehicles may not be used to carry more passengers than the number of seatbelts permits; on the other, we propose that the National Road Administration should study the feasibility and consequences of including in the Ordinance stricter provisions on special safety equipment for children. We also propose that the National Road Administration should be asked to study the feasibility of the national vehicle inspection company Bilprovningen carrying out inspections of how child restraints are fitted.</p>
<p>Chapter 12 The recreational environment and recreational activities</p>
<p>Drowning is the third commonest cause of death among children and young people, after road traffic injuries and injuries resulting from deliberate self-destructive acts. Swimming ability, improved water safety and supervision of young children are by far the most important factors in preventing drowning accidents. Over the period 1997–2001, 8–9 children aged 1–17 died as a result of drowning every year. In 2002, 14 children over the same age range drowned. The majority of drowning accidents occur in summer, in conjunction with outdoor bathing.</p>
<p>Pre-schools, pre-school classes and schools all have a part to play in promoting water safety and experience of water. We therefore propose that teaching of water safety should be included in the Pre- School Curriculum (Lpfö 98). We also propose that the expression ‘be able to swim’ in the physical education and health syllabus for compulsory schools should be clarified on the basis of the ‘official’ definition of swimming ability: a person is able to swim if they can fall into deep water, have their head submerged and, after surfacing again, swim 200 m without stopping, including 50 m on their back.</p>
<p>In addition, we propose that the Swedish Rescue Services Agency should be entrusted with the task of issuing general guidance on quality assurance of local authority indoor and outdoor bathing facilities from a safety point of view. From our contacts with the Swedish Association of Local Authorities it emerges that there is no clear-cut answer as to what responsibilities local authorities have in relation to outdoor bathing facilities. We propose that the Rescue Services Agency, in consultation with the Association of Local Authorities, should revise and update the publication Strandbad (‘Shore bathing’) and supplement it with information on the legal position regarding local authorities’ responsibilities for public bathing places.</p>
<p>Children spend a large proportion of the time they are outdoors in environments created for them by adults. This demands a great deal in terms of those adults’ understanding of play and what it requires in the form of physical environments. Since the National Child Environment Council was replaced with the Office of the Children’s Ombudsman, there has been no national driving force and channel for communication with local bodies on issues relating</p>
<p>to the play environment of children. We therefore see a development effort aimed at creating a better understanding of environments suitable for play as an important part of the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning’s overall task of developing and disseminating knowledge about safe outdoor environments conducive to children’s development. This question must receive more active attention at the national level, in order to support and develop local efforts. It is a matter both of creating awareness and understanding among the decision-makers concerned that play is important from many points of view, and of demonstrating how good environments for play can be created and managed.</p>
<p>In 1998 a new European standard for fixed playground equipment and impact-absorbing playground surfacing was presented, with the aim of eliminating serious injuries resulting from equipment in play areas. The following year the standard previously in force in Sweden was superseded by this European standard (SS-EN 1176- 1/7 and SS-EN 1177). In many municipalities there is uncertainty about what the new standard actually entails, and playgrounds and play equipment have been removed on the basis that they do not comply with it. To prevent uncertainty about rules and responsibilities inhibiting the development of good play environments for children, we propose that the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning and the Swedish Consumer Agency, in consultation with the Swedish Association of Local Authorities, should together inform and educate local authorities, housing corporations and others concerned about existing regulations on play areas and fixed play equipment.</p>
<p>Sport and exercise make a positive contribution to public health and should be encouraged, not least in view of the fact that inactivity is probably the biggest future threat to the health of the nation. Collated data relating numbers of injuries to the time devoted to sport and exercise are not available at present. More detailed data are needed on how much children and young people are exposed to specific sports, to get a better perspective on the scale of sports injuries. The number of children and young people actually injured when taking part in sport or exercise is more than 50,000 per year, and preventive action is necessary to reduce both the individual suffering involved and the cost to society.</p>
<p>The Commission’s view is that more effective efforts need to be made to prevent serious and fatal sports injuries. We propose that methods of preventing sports injuries should be included in the training of physical education teachers. We believe that this issue should be given high priority within the sports movement, and that the Swedish Sports Confederation, together with the specialized sports federations, should, by means of education and information, create wider awareness of the incidence of sports injuries and how they can be prevented. We propose that some of the state appropriation for ‘Support to sport’ should be used for efforts to prevent acute sports injuries among children and young people.</p>
<p>In the light of several serious accidents in recent years at discos and music festivals, resulting in young people being injured and killed, the Child Safety Commission’s terms of reference included the task of proposing ways of improving safety at musical events. This question has been examined in two recent studies by the Youth Advisory Committee and the Swedish Rescue Services Agency. The Commission notes that the problem of sudden-onset hearing damage, caused by high sound levels, is not addressed in these studies. While our own inquiry has been in progress, the National Board of Health and Welfare has studied the risk of damage to hearing due to high sound levels. In our report we describe the main findings of the studies mentioned, and stress our view of the importance of preventive action to ensure that children and young people do not develop tinnitus as a result of events involving high levels of sound. The Child Safety Commission endorses the measures recommended by the Rescue Services Agency in its report. We propose that, when decisions are taken to implement those recommendations, they should be supplemented with measures to reduce the injuries which children and young people can suffer as a result of high sound levels.</p>
<p>Chapter 13 Safety and development in physical planning</p>
<p>The position of children and young people in the context of physical planning is weak, and yet the design of residential, school and pre-school environments is of great importance to them. To ensure a stronger focus on children in planning, we propose that the word ‘children’ should be included in the purpose section of the</p>
<p>Planning and Building Act. The intention is to make it clear that the Act as a whole is to be interpreted from a children’s point of view.</p>
<p>Under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, children have the right to express their views in all matters affecting them, and due weight is to be given to those views. They also have the right to receive and impart information, and to do so using the medium of their choice. Similarly, the Planning and Building Act gives children and young people the right to participate in the consultation processes for which it provides. However, experience shows that their voices are rarely heard in this context. We therefore propose an amendment to the Planning and Building Act, requiring local authorities to take active steps to ensure that children have the opportunity to participate, and that due weight is given to their views. This amendment is intended to promote a conscious effort by local authorities to come into contact and communicate with children.</p>
<p>In our view, county administrative boards have an important part to play in securing the involvement of children and young people in municipal planning. In their supervisory role under the Planning and Building Act, these boards should look in particular at how the knowledge and views of children and young people have been taken into account in local authorities’ planning documents. To strengthen the expertise of county administrative boards on children’s issues in the longer term, we propose an addition to their standing instructions, requiring them to take into account in their supervisory activities the needs, views and rights of children, in the light of the provisions and aims of the Children’s Convention.</p>
<p>Child impact assessments are an important means of systematically elucidating how children and young people may be affected by different decisions. Such assessments should be based on research and empirical experience, as well as on the knowledge children themselves have contributed. In our opinion, a number of key factors determining the safety and development of children and young people are inadequately understood. We therefore propose that the future lead agency should be given the task of developing the knowledge base needed for child impact assessments in this field.</p>
<p>Architects, planners and local government officers often have to make difficult judgements in the context of physical planning. The standards and rules that used to provide guidance on the design of outdoor environments have been removed from the Planning and Building Act. To support work at the local level, we propose that the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning, in collaboration with researchers and relevant authorities, should be entrusted with the task of summarizing and communicating knowledge about how outdoor environments need to be designed in order to secure the right of children and young people to safe environments beneficial to their development. The elimination of detailed statutory regulation makes it necessary for the people who design such environments to possess knowledge in this area. Here, the relevant educational institutions have an important role to play in ensuring that their curricula and syllabuses correspond to the demands which students will face in their professional careers.</p>
<p>The concept of urban densification, or urban compaction, has gained a strong following among the architects and planners of today. The causes and effects of higher urban densities are complex, and opinions differ as to what they entail for children and young people. What is clear, though, is that green spaces in local neighbourhoods are disappearing, and that smaller and smaller areas are being set aside for children’s and young people’s play and recreation. It is important to monitor this trend, and we therefore propose that the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning, in collaboration with researchers and relevant authorities, should be given the task of collating up-to-date knowledge about what urban densification entails for children’s and young people’s access to safe environments which promote their development.</p>
<p>The national environmental quality objectives and the interim targets elaborated under each of them are important guidelines for community planning today. Consequently, we consider it important to formulate interim targets which result in a process of development that provides for the needs and rights of children and young people. We therefore propose that the Government should develop interim targets under the objective ‘A Good Built Environment’ which take account of the right of children and young people to safe environments conducive to their development.</p>
<p>Chapter 14 Suicide, suicide attempts and other self-inflicted injuries</p>
<p>Over the period 1980–2000, around 20 people under the age of 18 died each year as a result of suicide. Suicide is the second commonest cause of death in Sweden for girls aged 13–17, and the third commonest among boys in the same age group. Among children under 15, suicide is uncommon.</p>
<p>Between 1998 and 2000, 4 per cent of boys and 9 per cent of girls aged from 0 to 17 years received in-patient hospital care as a result of deliberate self-destructive behaviour.</p>
<p>Regarding acts of self-harm (cutting, scratching etc.) among children and young people, it is difficult to find reliable figures. A questionnaire survey showed that 9 per cent of respondents (under the age of 18) had at some time deliberately harmed themselves.</p>
<p>In our view, greater expertise on the part of school staff would improve the chances of the pupils concerned being seen and receiving help. We therefore propose that the National Board of Health and Welfare, in consultation with the National Agency for School Improvement, should be asked to draw up guidelines for schools on the elaboration of written plans to prevent suicide, suicide attempts and other self-inflicted injuries. We also consider that the mental and social ill health of children and young people should be given greater prominence in the work of the school health services. We therefore propose that, in the guidelines for school health service planning which it is elaborating, the Board of Health and Welfare should draw particular attention to mental and social ill health among children and young people.</p>
<p>We also propose that the National Board of Health and Welfare, in close collaboration with the National Institute of Public Health and the Swedish Federation of County Councils, should disseminate information on the commonest symptoms of mental ill health among children and young people to parents and other adults.</p>
<p>Preventing self-inflicted injuries in children and adolescents is a complex matter that requires the involvement of several different disciplines. We therefore propose that the assignment given by the Government to the National Board of Health and Welfare, in association with the National Police Board and the National Agency for School Improvement, to develop strategies for interagency collaboration for the benefit of vulnerable children, should</p>
<p>be broadened to include children and young people with suicidal or self-harming behaviour.</p>
<p>Chapter 15 Methods of achieving enhanced safety and development</p>
<p>To a significant extent, safety promotion efforts in Sweden have focused on building safety into the environments in which children and young people live their lives.</p>
<p>With regard to certain types of accidents, the scope to build in safety in this way is limited. Consequently, the emphasis of many injury prevention programmes has been on influencing behaviour, by means of either laws and regulations or information and education.</p>
<p>Experience makes it clear that consultation with children and young people should become a natural part of the work of many agencies and programmes. We often proceed from an adult view of the child, believing that we know what is best for children and young people. When we give them the opportunity to share their own experience and knowledge, a different picture of reality emerges, allowing efforts to be focused on the areas that genuinely make a difference to the everyday lives of the younger generation.</p>
<p>We can find good examples of local and other authorities involving children and young people in their work. Commonly, children are informed and consulted and their views form part of the input into the decisions taken. The Child Safety Commission emphasizes the need to maintain and further develop this approach. As the next step, the big challenge is to allow the views of children and young people to have a real impact on the decisions reached. Day care facilities and schools have an important part to play in promoting democracy in the local community, and several of the local projects which we present show how long-term collaboration with schools can be built up. It is also important to develop pupil democracy in schools. From experience we know that, when pupils are involved in a school’s work environment programme, the result can be a school playground that offers challenges that are something out of the ordinary – without increasing the number of injuries. There is no lower age limit for involving children; rather, it is a matter of how they are involved and in what issues. Finally, it may be noted that a crucial factor in any dialogue between children and adults is mutual respect, which also means having the courage to respond to and question one another’s views.</p>
