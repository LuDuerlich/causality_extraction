<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>Section II of the Minority Language Committee was assigned the task of investigating the question of whether Sweden should ratify the Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, and, if so, what measures Sweden must take in order to comply with the provisions of the Convention.</p>
<p>The Framework Convention is the first legally binding multilateral document concerning minority affairs in general. It lays down the principles which the Member States undertake to observe in protecting national minorities. Protection of national minorities is an important element of the protection of human rights and freedoms. The Council of Europe considers human rights an essential precondition for building a stable, democratic and safe Europe. The protection and rights expressed in the Framework Convention are to be implemented by national legislation and appropriate government policies. The Framework Convention not only imposes a prohibition on discrimination of persons who belong to a national minority but provides for active support for these persons' endeavours to preserve their minority culture and identity. The Framework Convention does not provide recognition of collective rights; the protection it affords relates essentially to private individuals.</p>
<p>As of December, 1997 the Framework Convention has been ratified by 13 states and will enter into force on January 1, 1998. Norway, Denmark and Finland are among the countries that have ratified the Convention. Sweden has signed it.</p>
<p>Sweden should ratify the Council of Europe Framework Convention</p>
<p>We propose that Sweden ratify the Council of Europe Framework Convention. This would demonstrate that Sweden, in line with its previous policy, supports the work of enhancing protection of human rights and freedoms. In the last few years issues connected with the protection of national minorities in Europe have once again been highlighted as a result of the upheavals in Eastern Europe. It is therefore important that Sweden, which has traditionally promoted the protection of human rights and freedoms, should ratify the Framework Convention, thus underscoring its decision to protect the rights of its national minorities.</p>
<p>Ratification would also imply recognition of Sweden's multicultural history, of which the national minorities have long been a part.</p>
<p>In Swedish legislation and political debate the term minority has often been used about immigrant groups. To make it clear that ratification relates to groups that have lived in this country for a long time as national minorities we propose that they be named in conjunction with ratification. The national minorities have also expressed a wish that the Convention be ratified.</p>
<p>What characterizes a national minority and what groups are national minorities?</p>
<p>The Framework Convention intentionally avoids defining the term "national minorities". Generally speaking, it is difficult to agree on such a definition. The OECD Member States assumed a pragmatic attitude in this respect and left it to the Contracting Parties to decide on a case-by-case basis to whom the individual articles should be applicable. Therefore, in accordance with its terms of reference, Section II of the Minority Language Committee is to present proposals for criteria for minorities as applied to Sweden's national minorities. Our proposals for criteria are based on the Framework Convention's position, i.e. that only minorities that have lived in the country for a long time should be eligible.</p>
<p>In our view, the following criteria should be fulfilled for a group to be regarded as a national minority: — it should be distinguished by a marked degree of cohesion and not have a dominant position in relation to the rest of the population; — it should have a distinctive character in terms of religion, language, traditions and/or culture; — it should have historical or longstanding ties with Sweden: — self-identification: both the individual members and the group as a whole must be prepared to preserve its identity.</p>
<p>We have concluded that Tornedalers, Swedish Finns, Roms and Jews fulfil these criteria and are thus national minorities.</p>
<p>Steps towards a minority policy</p>
<p>For Sweden to be able to ratify the Framework Convention, it should lay the foundation for a coherent and comprehensive minority policy. Such a policy must be explicitly designed to protect the national minority groups in Sweden and, in accordance with the Convention, to take measures which promote their opportunities for preserving and developing their culture and identity.</p>
<p>Parliament has recently adopted an integration policy which includes proposals to the effect that future overall policy should be based on recognition of the fact that, as a result of immigration, Sweden is now a multicultural country. In our view, it is important not to forget that Sweden has been a multicultural society throughout its history and that several of the cultures that have existed here for many hundreds of years are still with us and represent a vital feature of our society.</p>
<p>As a first step, a Swedish minority policy should include recognition of the minorities, measures to disseminate information among the majority population about the national minorities, their culture, language, religion and traditions, and their history in Sweden. Furthermore, steps should be taken to enable members of national minorities to participate in and influence the future formulation of minority policy.</p>
<p>Measures promoting the recognition of national minorities</p>
<p>We propose that the national minorities should be recognized by being named in conjunction with ratification of the Framework Convention. If, in accordance with our proposals, ratification is accompanied by the laying of a foundation for a minority policy directly focusing on the national minorities, this will make it clear, both in Sweden and abroad, what groups are national minorities in Sweden and what protection they enjoy.</p>
<p>We also propose that an amendment of the Constitution be considered, which would involve an addition to the existing provisions of the Instrument of Government (chapter 1, section 2 (4)), naming the national minorities and setting forth their status as national minorities. However, an amendment of the Constitution is a matter that must be considered from many different aspects.</p>
<p>Dissemination of information</p>
<p>Recognition of the national minorities must, to ensure that these groups enjoy the protection envisaged by the Framework Convention, be combined with measures to disseminate information about their culture and language and their history as part of our common heritage and of our modern society. We believe that it is necessary to increase our knowledge about the national minorities and their role in our cultural heritage if they are to enjoy respect, understanding and support for their endeavours to preserve their culture, their language, their religion etc. In our view, this is also essential for closer relations between Tornedalers, Swedish Finns, Roms and Jews and the majority population.</p>
<p>We therefore propose a number of measures in the fields of education and research, mass media and culture, including amendments of curricula so that knowledge of the national minorities' history, culture, languages and religion be embodied as a requirement in the curricula for compulsory and upper secondary schools. Education in these matters should be included specifically in the syllabuses for the following subjects: Swedish, History, Religious knowledge and Civics. We propose that measures be taken to ensure government assistance on a long-term basis for at least one folk high school for each national minority, which would function as a cultural centre. We propose that consideration should be given to the future rules governing broadcasting rights to allow the needs of the minorities to be taken into account, in particular, by the public service broadcasting companies. These needs may vary between the various minority groups and between sectors such as languages, culture, religion etc.</p>
<p>The cultural manifestations of the national minorities must, in our opinion, receive a sufficiently large share of the government grants to culture. We also stress the importance of ensuring sufficient assistance and opportunities under the regional cultural programmes for Sami and Tornedal culture in the areas where these cultures have existed for centuries and still exist today. According to the Framework Convention, culture is a key sector, and one that is conducive to a dialogue between the minorities and the majority. We also propose measures leading to the creation of an intercultural dialogue and exchanges between the minorities and the majority population.</p>
<p>Measures to enable the national minorities to exercise influence</p>
<p>It is of the utmost importance that the national minorities be in a position to influence the formulation of a future Swedish minority policy directly focusing on protection of these groups. This will necessitate establishing, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, arrangements allowing the national minorities a say prior to the taking, implementation and evaluation of decisions that concern them.</p>
<p>The details of these arrangements should be discussed with the national minorities themselves. There may be variations in the forms of consultation and influence that are most appropriate for the different groups. Consideration should also be given to the question of how everybody — and not only those who are represented in various organizations today — should have a chance to exercise influence. We therefore propose that an inquiry be set up for the purpose of investigating various arrangements in this respect, e.g. increased support for organizations, participation in advisory committees for consultations with the competent authorities etc. It may also be worthwhile evaluating the existing arrangements for exercise of influence and collaboration.</p>
<p>Like Section I of the Minority Language Committee, we propose that a regional consultative committee be set up in Norrbotten county for the task of proposing measures that would promote an intercultural dialogue between the various national minorities, and between these minorities and the majority population, especially in the field of education and culture.</p>
<p>Other proposals</p>
<p>Section I of the Minority Language Committee, which has presented proposals concerning the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, proposes a large number of measures designed to strengthen the regional or minority languages in Sweden. Since several of these proposals relate equally to the provisions of the Framework Convention, we have reviewed them. Our proposals coincide largely with those of Section I, although in several cases we propose additions and amendments.</p>
<p>In our view, Sweden should urge that closer Nordic cooperation should be extended to all national minorities where the same minorities exist in other Nordic countries as in Sweden. This cooperation should cover all matters of interest to the national minorities, for example culture, history, language, religion etc.</p>
<p>Section I has proposed regionally applicable rules laying down the right to use minority languages in courts of law and administrative authorities in several municipalities in Norrbotten county. This proposal goes beyond the requirements of the Framework Convention, but we consider it appropriate to support it since it would accommodate the minorities' desire to use their languages in connection with public administration. However, we have not comitted ourseves as regard the languages and areas to which the rules should apply. Nevertheless, we note that persons belonging to a national minority may have a legitimate desire to use their language in other geographical areas as well.</p>
<p>There is no mention in the Framework Convention of care of the elderly or child care. However, we consider the issue of the right to communication in one's own language in connection with both care services for the elderly and child care as so important that it must be addressed within the framework of the future minority policy.</p>
<p>The various minority groups have submitted comments and proposals to the Committee. The proposals that we have presented do not necessarily cover all the issues that are relevant to protection of the national minorities. We consider that our proposals may serve as a first step and a good foundation for a minority policy. The ongoing work of formulating this policy must be done in consultation and cooperation with the national minorities themselves.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we wish to declare that these proposals are presented in the spirit of the Framework Convention, which considers "...that a pluralist and genuinely democratic society should not only respect the ethnic, cultural, linguistic and religious identity of each person belonging to a national minority, but also create appropriate conditions enabling them to express, preserve and develop this identity". 1.2 Generella direktiv 3.1 Inledning 3.2 Inspirationskällor för ramkonventionen 3.2.1 Förenta nationerna 3.2.2 Europarådet</p>
<p>För att möta det starka behovet av juridisk hjä lp med demokratiserings- och författningsfrågor i Öst- och Centraleuropa bildades 1990 den s.k . Venedigkommissionen, som består av experter inom juridik och statsvetenskap. Kommissionen forskar även inom demokratifrågor och har bl.a. gjort ett utkast till en Europeisk konvention om nationella minoriteters rättigheter. I konventionsförslaget ges följande definition: ”For th e purposes of this Convention, the term minority shall mean a group which is smaller in number than the rest of the population of a State, whose members, who are nationals of that State, have ethnical, religious or linguistic features different from those of the rest of the population, and are guided by the will to safeguard their culture, traditions, religion or language”.
