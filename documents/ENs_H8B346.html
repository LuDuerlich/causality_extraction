<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>a whole, are now decreasing, above all owing to political shifts in large countries like China and India, but within  most countries – including those two – they are increasing. Global levelling is to be seen as progress, but the growing domestic inequalities pose significant risks.</p>
<p>For a long time, those in power in Sweden, in politics and business, seem to have underestimated the scale of the problems, particularly as regards integration. For the most part, they have relied on established political solutions. A policy to address the new challenges to society has to be based on an analysis of the mechanisms and causes behind the developments that have occurred.</p>
<p>Time is a key factor. Sweden has a window of perhaps ten to fifteen years to make the most of a favourable demographic situation – assuming that those who are of working age also find a place on the labour market.</p>
<p>In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic has tended to overshadow other issues, with urgent problems of livelihoods and revenues to be addressed. The questions dealt with in the Commission’s report, however, will still be there when the immediate crisis is over. In a best-case scenario, the crisis could help to find solutions, as ingrained routines and measures are called into question.</p>
<h2>The foundations of prosperity, and its distribution</h2>
<p>In earlier times, in answer to the question what formed the foundations of a country’s prosperity, it was common to compare a nation to a household and to regard physical and financial assets as the basis for its prosperity. As much as possible needed to be manufactured inside the country’s borders. With the Enlightenment, the development of international trade and the Industrial Revolution, a broader view evolved of the underpinnings of prosperity. Human capital – knowledge, networks and open relations with the rest of the world – assumed a more prominent role. Today we know that, in addition, people’s life satisfaction is very strongly influenced by levels of trust in society, or what is also called social capital.</p>
<p>All of these resources together – physical, financial, human and social capital – are what determine the legitimacy of the social order. So, although economic and welfare policy have traditionally, and with some justification, focused on income and material resources, they need to be designed with this broader approach.</p>
<h2>Why is inequality generally growing?</h2>
<p>Although inequality at a global level, between countries, has levelled off and even decreased somewhat, within most of the world’s countries it has, as we have seen, increased. Various technological and economic explanations for this have been put forward. Advances in information technology have resulted in a globalisation of both production chains and financial markets that has changed the balance of power between capital and labour, in that capital is more mobile than labour. Some new markets are dominated by global corporations with a near-monopoly position and high profit margins. Within Sweden, economic activity is currently being concentrated in the metropolitan regions, leading to regional inequalities.</p>
<p>Alongside technological and economic factors, the distribution of income is affected by political decisions. In the short and medium term, the equalising effect of the tax and transfer system is of great significance for the way income is distributed.</p>
<p>Beyond these technological, economic and political factors, there is a tendency for inequality to grow as a result of the way human interaction works. Both theoretical arguments and historical experience indicate that, under normal circumstances, inequality grows under its own momentum. In other words, a given level of equality in a society is not inherently stable, but needs to be defended and maintained. Historically, wars and outbreaks of epidemic diseases have sometimes had a levelling effect, quite simply because high mortality has led to shortages of labour. The history of the Nordic countries over the hundred years from the 1870s, however, shows that economic progress is perfectly compatible with greater equality, without the need for either violence or major epidemics. Social science research tells us that trade unions and universal suffrage help to create conditions for a favourable combination of equality and growth.</p>
<h2>Arguments for greater equality</h2>
<p>As noted in the introduction, the Nordic countries have shown in their practical policies that it is possible to combine high economic growth with a large measure of equality. Despite this, such policies began to questioned in the 1980s, based on a variety of arguments, both abroad and in Sweden. Today, three to four decades later, the climate of opinion is different, and there is reason to examine some of the arguments that have been advanced for and against equal living conditions.</p>
<p>Reasons put forward for differences in income</p>
<p>Before the principal arguments in favour of greater equality are presented, it may be useful to discuss those against  equality and for differences in income.</p>
<p>One traditional argument has been that individuals with higher incomes have a higher saving ratio and that a more uneven distribution of income thus frees up more capital for investment, resulting in higher growth. However, this argument is only valid in a closed economy; in a globalised financial market, there is no guarantee that the capital will remain in the country and contribute to higher growth here. Indeed, since the mid 1990s Sweden has experienced a significant export of capital, illustrating the weakness of the argument.</p>
<p>Another reason often put forward is that there need to be large differences in pay to attract people into education, which is said to indirectly promote economic growth. Estimates of the ‘earnings premium’ from education, that is, the personal economic return on a longer education, have been made by the OECD and confirm that Sweden is in the lower part of the international distribution. These estimates have a number of weaknesses, however. They end at age 65 and thus take no account of pension differences between income groups, or differences in life expectancy. What is more, it can be noted that a comparatively large proportion of Sweden’s population have attended higher education, so clearly people’s educational choices are not guided solely by the earnings premium calculated in this way.</p>
<p>Levels of parental education are an important factor, and highquality basic education and vocational guidance may therefore be at least as effective in increasing interest in higher education as larger differences in pay.</p>
<p>A third reason relates to the conditions for doing business and has found tangible expression in such things as favourable rules for closely held companies, low corporate taxation and generally light taxation of wealth. What such measures have in common is that they have been considered necessary to create more favourable business conditions in the country. However, international comparisons of conditions for doing business in different countries, carried out regularly by the World Bank and various financial institutions, show that conditions in Sweden are among the most favourable in the world. If this argument had any relevance in the past, in other words, it has now lost its force.</p>
<p>That does not mean that economic incentives are unimportant. The need for incentives should be, and is, taken into account, for example in setting salaries and in the design of social insurance systems. What is needed is a balance between incentives and equality.</p>
<p>Equality of opportunity and equality of outcome</p>
<p>A common distinction in the debate about redistribution is between equality of opportunity and equality of outcome. In general, there is broad political support for equality of opportunity, as it is difficult to argue against all children as far as possible being given the same opportunities in life. The beneficial impact of equality of opportunity on economic development has also been confirmed by research, for example by comparisons of countries that have gone from being poor agricultural economies to industrialised middle-income countries. In developed countries, human capital rather than farmland is the key factor of production, and the equality-promoting effect of a well-developed and equal system of basic education has also been confirmed.</p>
<p>The distinction between opportunity and outcome is difficult to uphold, however, since what is an outcome at one stage in life becomes an opportunity at the next. Whether or not a student leaving compulsory education meets the requirements for admission to upper secondary school is an outcome, but that outcome is an important prior condition for the student’s subsequent education and opportunities as an adult. What is more, a transfer of both human and financial capital occurs across generations, which is of great distributional significance in the longer term. Outcomes for the parental generation are therefore important in shaping the opportunities available to their children. Without corrective interventions such as subsidised education and inheritance tax, therefore, inequalities will grow over time, even if we were hypothetically to envisage a starting position with an entirely equal distribution.</p>
<p>A combination of levelling of opportunities and levelling of outcomes is therefore necessary to achieve a sustainable and reasonably even distribution of society’s resources, for the benefit of all.</p>
<p>Intergenerational mobility</p>
<p>Intergenerational mobility, sometimes referred to as social mobility, may relate to social class, education or income. Mobility is high if the chances of a person reaching different levels are not strongly dependent on the position of their parents.</p>
<p>Social mobility, like equal opportunities, is a political objective that enjoys broad support, and the two are closely connected. Both international and Swedish research show that greater inequality is associated with lower social mobility, an association made clear by comparisons both between countries and between regions within a country. Parents try in various ways to create the most favourable conditions possible for their children, and therefore there will be no equality of opportunity in the long term without a levelling of outcomes. Experience of how education systems have developed in countries with high inequality confirms this fear.</p>
<p>Growth</p>
<p>The links between equality and economic growth are disputed. This is because most of the studies carried out are based on a measure of inequality known as the Gini coefficient. This is a blunt instrument of measurement: two societies with the same Gini coefficient may have very different social and economic structures, and stable correlations therefore should not be expected when inequality is measured in this way.</p>
<p>Analyses that describe the relationship between distribution and growth in more detail find a stable positive correlation between a comparatively high share of income for lower income groups and the rate of economic growth. The causal link appears to operate through human capital, that is to say, in equal countries the differences in human capital between children of parents with a long education and children of those with a short education are small. The underlying explanation is that a school system which guarantees a high minimum level of human capital strengthens opportunities for children with a less favourable background to develop their potential and advance, helping to boost social mobility and hence economic development.</p>
<p>Trust</p>
<p>The link between equality and trust is strong and is borne out in both international and Swedish studies. Analyses of Swedish data from different regions indicate that it is the income share of those belonging to the lower half of the income distribution that is important for the general level of trust.</p>
<p>In international studies, the Nordic countries are found to have exceptionally high levels of trust. This is largely explained by their high equality. High standards of public administration have also been shown to have a positive impact on trust, and in that respect, too, the Nordic countries have a strong tradition.</p>
<p>Although the average level of trust is high, variations exist between individuals and between groups. People with a weak position on the labour market, or who are dependent on transfer payments for their incomes, tend to have below-average trust levels. High levels of education and good incomes affect trust in a positive direction.</p>
<p>Trust, in turn, has consequences both for how well the economic system works and for welfare in a broader sense. It is even possible to translate changes in trust levels into economic terms. The general level of trust also affects the legitimacy of the political system.</p>
<p>Health</p>
<p>The state of health of a population is dependent both on general living conditions and on the design of health care. Individuals with higher levels of education and higher incomes generally enjoy better health. At the same time, an even distribution of conditions and opportunities results in better health outcomes on average in society. A high minimum level is also associated with smaller regional variations in health.</p>
<p>A well-developed public health care system with charges to patients that are not too high ensures that good care is available to all sections of the population. International evaluations also demonstrate a good socio-economic return on public investments in health care, a return that benefits resource-poorer groups more in relative terms.</p>
<p>The central role of education</p>
<p>The great majority of welfare indicators covary positively with a raised level of education. Education has effects far beyond the labour market, both at the individual level in people’s private lives and at a collective level in society. Concomitant with higher standards of education in a society are a better-functioning democracy, greater trust, better health and lower levels of crime. In international analyses, investments in the education system, like those in health care, are found to yield a high socio-economic return. At the same time, a well-developed system of education is one of the most important instruments in equalising life chances and maintaining equality in a society.</p>
<p>All of this means that the educational sector, from preschool to adult education, has a key function in society, alongside its obvious role as the main instrument in the formation of human capital. The first four or five years of life are just as important as a child’s school years in shaping the opportunities that will be available to him or her later in life, so the discussion about individual development cannot be confined to the education system in a narrower sense, but must also include conditions during the early and preschool years of childhood. With increasingly rapid technological development, demands in terms of education in adulthood are also growing, so the time frame has to be extended in that direction as well.</p>
<p>Sustainability</p>
<p>A commitment to equal living conditions has found tangible expression in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by the UN General Assembly in September 2015. Many of the 17 goals of the Agenda refer to various aspects of equality, summed up in the ambition to ‘leave no one behind’. Goal 10 carries the heading ‘Reduced Inequalities’. The targets set as part of this goal include giving priority to the poorest 40 per cent of the populartion in the design of economic policy, and pursuing policies that promote the inclusion of all.</p>
<p>In an overall assessment, it would seem that, at present, the arguments in favour of greater equality carry more weight than those against it. Equality has long had to take second place to other policy goals, but the rapid changes that have occurred both in Sweden and in the wider world justify a reappraisal.</p>
<h2>Sweden: trends and the current situation</h2>
<p>Income and wealth</p>
<p>There are many dimensions to welfare, but the focus in discussions about redistribution policy is nonetheless on income and wealth. Both factor incomes (labour and capital incomes) and disposable income (income after taxes and transfers) are of interest. The 2019 Long-Term Survey of the Swedish economy studied trends in the income distribution from a number of different perspectives, both historically and internationally, and using various measures of differences. Some of the main trends emerging were as follows:</p>
<p>• The distribution of disposable income in Sweden was most even in the early 1980s. Measured by the standard metric of the Gini coefficient, inequality in disposable income has subsequently increased by around 60 per cent, from 0.2 to 0.32.</p>
<p>• Inequality in factor incomes (labour and capital incomes) has not changed as much. Since the mid 1990s, the Gini coefficient for factor incomes has remained fairly stable, around 0.5. Capital incomes have grown in significance and are also unevenly distributed, both between different income strata and between men and women. There are several reasons for this trend – increased asset prices, especially for housing; the dual system of taxation introduced in 1991, dealing separately with labour and capital incomes; and gradually more favourable rules for the taxation of closely held companies (the ‘3:12 rules’). This has been counteracted by increased wage income in earnings strata just below the median income. The increase in earned income may in turn have several causes. The  long-term rise in the dependency ratio – the number of children and elderly people relative to the working-age population – is increasing the demand for labour. Changes in the system of taxes and transfers have also made gainful employment relatively more attractive.</p>
<p>• The reason differences in disposable income are growing is that  low-income households are more dependent on transfer payments, which on the whole have not kept pace with general trends in earnings. Nor has the equalising effect of the tax system increased sufficiently to compensate for the more uneven distribution of capital incomes.</p>
<p>• Regional differences have been increasing for several decades. In a  long-term view, from the second half of the 19th century, industrialisation meant that economic activity in the country was spread more evenly, having previously been concentrated in the Stockholm and Gothenburg regions. It was most evenly distributed around 1980. Since then, economic development has once again been marked by a shift towards the metropolitan regions. One consequence of this is rising capital incomes and property prices in those regions, further contributing to a concentration of economic resources.</p>
<p>• International studies have shown that income inequality covaries with low social mobility. The Nordic countries accordingly exhibit a high level of social mobility. The growing inequality in Sweden has not yet fed through into reduced mobility, which may be due to the considerable inertia of institutions of the welfare state and of associated generation effects. Free education within an as yet comparatively equal system ensures a higher degree of mobility than is found in countries where large social differences have existed for a long time, both in general terms and specifically with regard to educational opportunities. Family background and childhood circumstances have long been major factors in educational success, but their significance has only increased since the turn of the century, and then only among students with a foreign background.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>A person’s level of education is of great significance both for their chances of finding employment and for their pay and working conditions.</p>
<p>• Sweden and the other Nordic countries have previously had a comparatively even level of education, and compulsory basic (primary and lower secondary) education of a high quality has contributed to a levelling of incomes.</p>
<p>• With immigration, the spread in education has increased. Among children with a foreign background, a higher proportion go on to higher education, given a certain social background, and on average they also receive stronger parental support in their studies than children from a Swedish background. At the same time, there are groups of immigrants with considerably shorter periods of education and the problems that entail in terms of gaining entry to the labour market and their children being able to benefit from schooling.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>The changes in society outlined above have left a clear imprint in the form of growing differences in incomes and assets. There is a danger of inequality in Swedish society growing as the result of a general process in which tendencies in a number of different areas are mutually reinforcing.</p>
<p>An education system with problems</p>
<p>The situation in the Swedish education system has to be described as a cause for concern. Outcomes have long been declining, although the latest international comparisons suggest that this trend has bottomed out, and a recovery has occurred for students with a Swedish background. For students with a foreign background born in Sweden, a slight deterioration may be noted. Those born abroad consistently exhibit poorer outcomes, attributable in part to their having arrived in Sweden at older ages.</p>
<p>An increased spread of educational outcomes can be observed between schools and municipalities. There is a problem of grade inflation, and both an acute and a long-term shortage of qualified teachers. Having once been a leading nation in terms of the quality and equality of its education system, Sweden dropped for a time to a middling position in the group of OECD countries we normally compare ourselves with. Some of the lost ground has since been made up, with the result that Sweden is now above the average.</p>
<p>With the many changes introduced over the last three decades or so, it is difficult to gain a clear picture of the causes of the problems. At least three major policy changes have contributed: decentralisation to municipalities, changes in educational approach, and school choice combined with free establishment of new schools.</p>
<p>Transferring the main responsibility for compulsory and upper secondary education to municipalities meant that the latter were entrusted with a task which, judging from all the evidence, small and medium-sized local authorities have had difficulty fully living up to.</p>
<p>A shift in educational approach, from traditional teacher-led learning to what has variously been referred to as student-centred or constructivist learning, has placed a heavy responsibility on students themselves, with negative consequences for learning outcomes in general and for students with a weak educational background at home in particular.</p>
<p>School choice, combined with a free right to establish new schools, has contributed to greater segregation, grade inflation and an element of unreliable providers. Housing segregation is still the dominant factor behind educational segregation, but school choice also contributes. In some cases, moreover, the free right of establishing new independent schools has thwarted municipal authorities’ attempts to reduce segregation.</p>
<p>The relative significance of these three policy shifts cannot be determined, as they have been implemented more or less in parallel. The large influx of foreign-born students has added further difficulty to an already problematic situation.</p>
<p>Inadequate integration policies</p>
<p>Like many other developed industrial nations, Sweden has undergone a demographic development in recent decades that creates problems for the national economy. The dependency ratio – the number of children and elderly people relative to the working population – has tended to rise owing to increasing life expectancy. From this point of view, immigration of younger people or people of working age is beneficial, and the demographic profile of Sweden’s population has indeed been substantially improved by the immigration of recent decades. At the same time, this immigration makes demands in terms of the education system, housing supply and other adjustment measures if the favourable demographic effects are to be turned to good account. Such investments do not come about automatically, but require public-sector initiatives on a significant scale. Without those investments, a potentially favourable demographic situation in terms of supporting the population will make way for its opposite.</p>
<p>Sweden has successfully received large groups of immigrants in the past – in the form of both labour immigration from Finland, southern Europe and Turkey and immigration of refugees from Chile following the military coup and in connection with the collapse of Yugoslavia. What has complicated the issue since the turn of the century is a large influx of both refugees and immigrant workers from geographically and culturally more distant countries. This makes greater demands in terms of adjustment measures, at the same time as central government agencies, regions and municipalities have all had to handle problems for which they have had neither the procedures nor the capacity required. A large proportion of newly arrived refugees and their family members lack sufficient education or other qualifications for the Swedish labour market. Many children have come to Sweden after the age at which they would normally have started school, and some have a weak educational background.</p>
<p>Integration of women from less equal societies is difficult but important, both for those directly concerned and for the next generation.</p>
<p>Sweden has not been less successful in integrating people of foreign origin than other comparable countries, but the scale and severity of the problems seem to have been underestimated. This in turn gives rise to concomitant problems – housing shortages, discrimination and other difficulties on the labour market, crime – which cannot be solved separately from the basic problem of integration.</p>
<p>The effects of greater ethnic heterogeneity on trust in a society are not clear-cut. International research points in different directions. Handled in the right way, ethnic diversity can be an asset, but it can also heighten conflicts in a society and make it harder to achieve the common sense of identity that is one of the cornerstones of trust. Politics, the media picture and public debate play a major part in reinforcing or mitigating such tendencies. The opportunities for cooperation that are created and the signals that are sent by leading politicians are therefore of great significance for the direction developments take. Surveys in Sweden point to a declining level of trust, especially among economically vulnerable groups such as the unemployed and those on sickness benefit.</p>
<p>A more uncertain labour market</p>
<p>In recent decades, traditional full-time employment with one employer has made way for other, more uncertain relationships between employer and employee. For the employer, this is a way of reducing the costs of unforeseen variations in demand for goods or services produced. Part-time work, temporary stand-in jobs and involuntary self-employment are a few examples. The overall scale of the phenomenon is difficult to estimate. Changes of this kind are recorded by the employer as increases in productivity, but in reality they amount to passing on the cost of uncertainty to the employee. Both equality in general and gender equality are adversely affected.</p>
<p>Social insurance, which is designed on the basis of more traditional forms of employment, works less well for these categories of labour. On top of this, there is the financial stress inherent in uncertain employment itself.</p>
<p>Gender equality – unfinished business</p>
<p>For much of the post-war period, Sweden and the other Nordic countries have pursued purposeful policies to bring about greater gender equality in society. These have been successful in more than one way: women have achieved a more equal position, at the same time as the increased supply of labour has helped strengthen the countries’ economic potential. Women are entering higher education to a greater extent and thus becoming the bearers of a growing share of human capital, with consequences in the long term for power relations both in and beyond the world of work.</p>
<p>In several areas, however, progress is lagging behind. Women still take greater responsibility for the home and for children and adults in need of care, which, in combination with paid employment, creates a risk of stress. For many, a solution is to work part-time, resulting in less economic independence, poorer insurance cover and, in the long run, lower pensions. Involuntary part-time employment, too, is commoner among women than among men.</p>
<p>Women’s and men’s wages in the same or closely related occupations have converged over a longer timescale, but widespread parttime work among women has meant that incomes have not converged in the same way. The growing significance of capital incomes, which show a skewed distribution in favour of men, has had the effect that convergence between the average incomes of men and women has come to a halt.</p>
<p>In addition, predominantly female occupations generally attract lower pay than those that are male-dominated, when occupations requiring similar periods of education and similar qualifications are compared. In the allocation of managerial positions, women are still under-represented in relation to their share of employees, in both the private and the public sector.</p>
<p>In social security systems, individualisation is now a dominant principle. In certain cases, however, it has only been partially implemented, or else benefits are calculated on a household basis. In such cases, there is a risk of traditional gender role patterns persisting or even being reinforced.</p>
<p>Ill health</p>
<p>The health of the Swedish population is generally good by international standards, but certain differences in health outcomes, too, have shown a tendency to increase. High levels of education and good incomes are correlated with better health. There are also geographical variations in health, which are more pronounced in lower income groups. Health problems linked to various forms of dependence – alcohol, tobacco etc. – have likewise tended to become increasingly concentrated among individuals on lower incomes.</p>
<p>Women have higher sickness rates than men, although only after giving birth to children. Part of the explanation is probably their greater combined responsibility for work and the home, but childbirth itself may also be a contributory factor, especially among women who, before giving birth, are less well placed to face the pressures involved.</p>
<p>Housing, neighbourhood and environment</p>
<p>Housing has traditionally played an important role in welfare policy. We spend a large part of our lives in and around our homes, and their location and standard are major factors in shaping the way our lives turn out. A large proportion of the subsidies that had formed part of policies in this area were phased out in the early 1990s, sharply reducing the role of the state. One consequence of this was uneven and generally low production of homes. With the rapid growth in population since the turn of the century, the shortage of rented accommodation, in particular, for low-income earners has become increasingly apparent. A housing shortage now exists in most of the country’s municipalities, in certain cases a serious one. The National Board of Housing, Building and Planning estimates that an average of 64 000 new apartments per year will be needed over the period 2018–2027, with particularly large numbers required in the metropolitan regions.</p>
<p>Assets in the form of owner-occupied homes have increased sharply in value in recent decades as a result of rising housing prices, but household debt has also grown. In addition, these assets are unevenly distributed across the population, more unevenly than incomes. Taxation favours owner-occupied housing, an imbalance that has become more pronounced in recent years. For low-income households, owning one’s home is not an option. The dominant problem on the housing market is therefore the shortage of rented accommodation at rents that are affordable for this category of tenants.</p>
<p>Beyond the immediate need for a home, there is a need for services, both public and private. From a children’s perspective, preschools and schools are primary needs, and for the population as a whole, health care facilities and public employment service, social insurance and tax offices. It is not just a matter of availability, but also of quality. Both schools and health care providers have had difficulty maintaining quality in areas with less favourable socioeconomic characteristics.</p>
<p>A weakened system of social insurance</p>
<p>One of the pillars of what has been called the Swedish model of economic policy is a compromise between capital and labour. In line with the ‘Rehn-Meidner model’, trade unions have accepted the rapid restructuring that comes with an open economy and heavy dependence on exports, in exchange for a well-developed system of social insurance. That system is intended, in the short term, to provide financial protection for those affected by the restructuring, and in the longer term, to help them make the transition to other occupations and sectors. In this way, broad acceptance has been secured for a free trade policy.</p>
<p>Internationalisation of the Swedish economy has if anything intensified in recent decades, owing to both EU membership and the general globalisation of production processes and financial markets. If the historic compromise had been respected, social insurance should have been strengthened to a corresponding degree, or at least not weakened. Since the beginning of the 1990s, however, it has been steadily eroded, with the result that the loss-of-income principle adopted on the basis of political agreement no longer applies in practice. Today, the system reflects a design principle midway between loss of income and basic security. This has resulted in the emergence of collective insurance schemes as a complement to the public ones, an approach that results in poorer spreading of risk, weaker redistribution and higher administrative costs.</p>
<p>The distribution of wealth</p>
<p>The distribution of wealth is always more uneven than that of income, in that individuals with higher incomes have more scope to save and because inherited wealth also tends to accumulate over generations. Since statistics on wealth were scrapped along with the wealth tax in 2007, the state of knowledge in this area in Sweden has been poor. The increased significance of capital incomes, however, suggests a more uneven distribution. In Sweden, the natural tendency towards a concentration of wealth has been amplified in recent years by the abolition of wealth tax, inheritance tax and property tax, and by changes in the taxation of closely held companies, and the importance of inheritance has grown.</p>
<p>In the lower part of the income distribution, trends have been unfavourable. People on low incomes generally take out smaller loans than those on high incomes, but at higher cost. Narrow margins may – in the event of unforeseen occurrences or issues such as problem gambling – result in an unmanageable burden of interest payments, fees and capital repayments.</p>
<p>As has been noted, the level of trust is of significance for economic life, and changes in this regard may be expected to have consequences in many areas. Several factors are currently operating in the direction of declining trust in Swedish society:</p>
<p>• Trust is strongly linked to equality. With something of a time lag, rising inequality may be expected to result in falling levels of trust.</p>
<p>• Growing internationalisation and more uncertain conditions on the labour market, combined with a gradually weaker system of public insurance, have resulted in greater insecurity for broad sections of the population, and with it declining trust.</p>
<p>• The majority of immigrants come from countries with lower trust levels than Sweden, owing to lower economic standards and often less  well-developed democracy. Even if the individuals who take the step of migrating to more or less distant countries are not representative of the population as a whole, this change in the composition of the Swedish population may be expected to result in a lower level of trust.</p>
<p>• Second-generation immigrants encounter obstacles in education and employment that create a risk of frustration and a low level of trust. Evidence of discrimination on ethnic grounds can be found both in schools and in working life.</p>
<p>Liberal democracy questioned</p>
<p>A new feature of the political landscape – with potentially significant consequences for economic life and development – is a questioning of both liberalism and democracy. Such tendencies have been discernible both in Sweden and in other countries that have been felt to be self-evidently stable democracies. There is convincing evidence that these tendencies have to do with the changes described – greater economic insecurity, increased inequality, and a sense of there being generally less scope to influence one’s own situation in life. Conversely, the changes in political opinion that have occurred may be expected to have consequences for economic development and hence also for households’ market incomes.</p>
<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
<p>Various explanations for the growing inequalities observed have been put forward in research and political debate. The developments that have taken place are complex and multidimensional. Some seek the explanation in economic and technological factors, such as globalisation of production processes and financial markets, or a high rate of innovation that rewards large, research-intensive companies with considerable market power. Others argue that the explanation lies, rather, in political decisions. The distinction between the two categories – economic/technological and political – is potentially misleading, as political decisions in recent decades have often been such as to increase the scope for market solutions and market players, thereby contributing to greater inequality.</p>
<p>Rising inequality in the Nordic countries is mainly attributed to political decisions and, to a certain extent, a lack of decisions, such as a failure to adjust transfer payments in line with trends in real wages. In the short term, reduced redistribution through the tax and transfer systems has been the most important factor. Over a longer time frame, greater segregation in housing and school education will be of major significance for differences in childhood circumstances and living conditions later in life, as will the effects of technological and economic changes that are not met with adequate countermeasures.</p>
<p>Which inequality is important?</p>
<p>When the correlation between inequality and various welfare outcomes – health, social mobility and others – is analysed using various measures of inequality, a clear pattern emerges, as already indicated: what is important is the income share and other dimensions of welfare of the bottom four or five decile groups. Put another way, high minimum levels of education, health, income and other resources are favourable to social mobility, to trust and to economic growth.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the upper part of the distribution is without interest. A strong concentration of income and wealth in the upper stratum may give a small group a disproportionate influence over the development of society and thus have far-reaching adverse consequences in the long term for economic development for the population as a whole. Such tendencies are evident in US society and have also been discernible in Sweden.</p>
<p>Market and the public sector</p>
<p>As already observed, in every society based on a market economy there is a natural tendency for different forms of capital to become concentrated. This is visible in purely geographical terms: a town with somewhat more favourable conditions than a rival one attracts people, skills and economic resources and thus becomes even more attractive. It is also visible in competition between companies: other things being equal, a larger company has an advantage over smaller ones, since it can more easily deal with disruptions, has greater market power, and can offer better prospects of promotion for qualified staff. Such differences exist between households as well: well-resourced ones with higher education and higher incomes can more easily exploit opportunities and cope with disruptions in income than those with more limited resources.</p>
<p>What can offset such tendencies towards concentration, imbalances of power and inequality are public interventions of various kinds. Geographical concentration can be counteracted by infrastructure investments, an expansion of higher education and other regional policy measures. Power imbalances between companies can be counteracted by measures to promote competition and innovation support for small and medium-sized enterprises. The position of resource-poor individuals and households can be strengthened in the short term by transfer payments and in the longer term by education.</p>
<p>• An important cause of the growing inequality at every level is that the nation state has been weakened by a series of political decisions over the last three or four decades. In Sweden’s case, significant legislative powers have shifted upwards to the EU level. The fundamental principle of EU cooperation is that of the four freedoms – the free movement of capital, labour, goods and services. This principle may seem neutral at first glance, but it in fact favours capital at the expense of labour, as capital is more mobile. Labour mobility has been greatest among workers from low-income countries within the Union, which may adversely affect corresponding groups on the Swedish job market.</p>
<p>• Various responsibilities have been delegated to municipalities, schools being the most notable example. This in itself increases the spread of outcomes, as, even with a system of economic equalisation, the capacities of different municipalities vary considerably. Differences in the political preferences of the local majority also have an impact.</p>
<p>• Market-like solutions and methods of governance mean that the inherent tendency of the market towards concentration and inequality also spills over into the public sector.</p>
<p>• Some of the key policy areas mentioned above – housing policy, social insurance – have also been affected by the retreat of the state from earlier undertakings, often in the form of gradual changes caused by an absence of decisions.</p>
<p>These factors combined are an important part of the explanation for the increased inequality both in Sweden and in other comparable nations, and the tendencies described have been more pronounced here than in most OECD countries.</p>
<h2>A policy for greater equality – starting points and principles</h2>
<p>A liberal view of society with a children’s perspective</p>
<p>The Commission has worked on the basis of a liberal view of society, meaning that the analysis undertaken needs to take individuals as its starting point, and not families, clans, nations or other groupings. The citizens of a liberal society are guaranteed certain fundamental rights, but in return have an obligation to take responsibility for their own lives. For these bundles of rights and obligations to be perceived as legitimate by the population as a whole, all citizens also have to be given a reasonable chance of realising their visions of a good life.</p>
<p>It is important to underline that the fundamental rights in question are universal, that is to say, independent of gender and social and ethnic background, and also independent of the cultural context.</p>
<p>A direct consequence of these starting points is that political problems relating to conditions in early life and through childhood and adolescence are to be seen from the child’s point of view. Parents normally represent their children, but where conflicts arise between the children’s interests and those of their parents, the best interests of the children must take precedence.</p>
<p>Greater equality and strengthened economic potential are compatible goals</p>
<p>The terms of reference for the work of the Commission rest on a conviction that it is possible to increase equality in society while also strengthening the country’s economic potential. The Commission’s analyses and the research and inquiry literature on which its report builds confirm the validity of this conviction.</p>
<p>The division of responsibilities between the public and private sectors must be based on an objective analysis</p>
<p>The boundaries between the public and private sectors have shifted in recent decades, without full account being taken of the complications arising from various forms of privatisation. A commonly held view has been that Sweden’s tax-to-GDP ratio has been too high and that there is intrinsic merit in reducing it. Analyses carried out by the OECD, however, show that different countries have very different ways of discharging public responsibilities, that these differences affect the amounts of tax levied, and that comparisons between countries’ tax ratios can consequently be directly misleading. It is not surprising, therefore, that it has been difficult to find any simple relationships between, for instance, tax ratios and rates of economic growth; what is done in the framework of public-sector responsibilities is more important for the economic outcome than the tax ratio.</p>
<p>Experience of trials of various market-like methods of governance in the public sphere in recent decades also shows that they by no means always increase efficiency or reduce expenditure. On the contrary, some of these changes have driven up costs.</p>
<p>Before responsibility for delivering public services is handed over to private providers, there thus need to be careful analyses of the basic conditions on which this is done. Since all contracts are incomplete, it is generally difficult, on a contractual basis, to bring the profit interest of the private enterprise concerned into harmony with the political goals laid down for a given service. Other requirements which public services have to meet – equal treatment, objectivity and transparency – are also difficult to reconcile with the rules that apply in the private sector, such as commercial confidentiality and loyalty to one’s employer. Supervision and sanctions must therefore form part of the rule structure within which private actors have to operate. In certain situations, the conclusion will be that public responsibility can only be assumed for a service if it is operated in-house.</p>
<p>The division of responsibilities within the public sector must be based on an objective analysis</p>
<p>Alongside various forms of privatisation, it has been common in recent decades to delegate measures decided on by central government to regions and municipalities. Decentralisation of schools to municipal authorities is one important example, but responsibility for the large flows of migrants has also largely been devolved to those authorities.</p>
<p>Delegation from central to regional or local government may have advantages, but requires a careful analysis of the public function in question. Here, too, there has sometimes been a failure to take into account what services are being delivered and what capacity municipalities or regions have to implement the policy decisions taken at a national level.</p>
<p>Another consideration is that certain changes in central government undertakings or in taxation have had negative consequences for municipal finances. A lower level of ambition in the social insurance system has resulted in a heavier burden on income support, which is administered by municipalities. Changes in taxation rules for closely held companies have adversely affected the municipal tax base, as wage income has been turned into capital income and thus been removed from that tax base. Where compensation is paid via state transfers to municipalities based on the ‘local government financing principle’, these payments are static, that is to say, they are not indexed, and therefore growth in an item of expenditure over time gradually increases the burden on the municipal sector, without any adjustment of the compensation paid.</p>
<p>Full use should be made of the national room for manoeuvre under EU legislation</p>
<p>EU membership has radically changed the basic conditions for political decision-making in Sweden. A substantial proportion of the new laws enacted by the Riksdag emanate from the EU level. According to an analysis carried out for this Commission, adaptation to EU law in several key areas has been pursued further than necessary, that is, further than the underlying directives have actually required. Housing policy is one example. This has sometimes been to the detriment of equality.</p>
<p>EU membership must also be properly administered in areas governed by the rules arising from it. Swedish authorities need to ensure that foreign commercial operators active in the country follow the regulations that apply. In the transport and construction sectors, for example, supervision has been inadequate, with negative consequences for domestic companies and employees.</p>
<p>Prevention is better than cure</p>
<p>There is an old rule that says that prevention is better than cure. Modern analyses of initiatives to compensate for a less favourable social background and increase the likelihood of children successfully completing their basic education, for example, confirm its truth. Early interventions, sometimes already at preschool age, have a better chance of bringing  socio-economic benefits. One difficulty that can sometimes arise is identifying the children who need special interventions and choosing effective ones. Selectivity is important; the fact that a problem has been identified at a group level does not mean that the entire group needs measures to tackle it.</p>
<p>School failure can have very negative long-term consequences. It often results in difficulty gaining entry to the labour market to earn one’s own living, which in some cases leads to long-term welfare dependency and in others to a criminal career. The socio-economic costs of such careers are far higher than the costs of preventive measures during a person’s school years.</p>
<p>In the area of economic crime, too, the benefits of prevention are confirmed. Effective legislation permitting information sharing between authorities, information to the general public, and appropriate proactive supervision can prevent crime and keep down the socioeconomic costs associated with it.</p>
<p>Health care is another area where preventive interventions can bring a number of socio-economic benefits. Creating good conditions for health early on, for example by establishing healthy lifestyle habits in school students and discouraging different forms of dependence – alcohol, tobacco, drugs and gambling – reduces both human suffering and the costs to society of ill health. The same is true of working conditions and environmental factors in employment and housing.</p>
<p>Administrative boundaries are needed for coordinated measures</p>
<p>Administrative boundaries are necessary, both vertically between different levels and horizontally between sectors. Without clear boundaries, it is more difficult to allocate responsibilities and enforce accountability. Sectors are needed to enable those working in different services to develop and maintain the necessary expertise.</p>
<p>There also need to be clear boundaries between the public sector on the one hand and civil society and the market on the other. Each of these spheres has its own logic, and a lack of clarity about boundaries entails a risk of inefficiencies, administrative errors, and difficulties calling people to account when mistakes are made.</p>
<p>At the same time as such boundaries are necessary, joint initiatives are often required for a service to be effective. The costs of early interventions in schools are borne by municipal education departments, while the benefits accrue to some extent to other departments or even other sectors. In such situations, special financial and organisational arrangements may be needed to ensure that the measures taken are on an appropriate scale.</p>
<h2>Measures to increase equality – cross-sectoral proposals</h2>
<p>Inequality is a complex phenomenon, and measures to limit or reduce it therefore have to be sought across a broad spectrum of policy areas. A selection of the Commission’s proposals are presented below, beginning with cross-sectoral measures and moving on to sector-specific ones.</p>
<p>Macroeconomic requirements</p>
<p>• An important part of the explanation for the successes of the Nordic welfare states in the 20 th  century is to be found in a historic compromise, whereby the trade unions accepted a free trade policy and rapid restructuring in exchange for an active labour market policy and a strong public system of social insurance. In the last few decades, internationalisation has continued and, if anything, intensified, at the same time as public insurance systems have gradually been eroded. This is part of the background to growing discontent and declining trust. To reduce the risks associated with such a trend, the thinking that was behind the historic compromise should be brought to the fore and allowed to guide current policy. How this should be done is discussed in more detail in the sections on the labour market and social insurance.</p>
<p>• Since the crisis in public finances in the 1990s, fiscal policy has been marked by great restraint. A surplus target of 1 per cent of GDP, adopted in 2000, has applied as an anchor with reference to the demographic trend predicted at that time, with a sharply rising dependency ratio. The high level of immigration since the turn of the century has changed this situation and improved the dependency ratio. To be able to make use of this more favourable position, it is essential that immigrants who are in need of education and training measures to gain access to the labour market in the next couple of decades are able to receive them.</p>
<p>Such an investment calls for a more active fiscal policy, and a renewed discussion about the surplus target and the tax ratio in the light of the greatly changed demographic situation should therefore be initiated. In the absence of the necessary investment, there is a significant risk of the dependency ratio increasing instead.</p>
<p>• Since the 1990s, the division of roles between fiscal and monetary policy has also changed, with a greater expectation that monetary policy will be able to handle the fluctuations in the economy previously addressed with fiscal policy interventions. This approach has become increasingly difficult to apply, and has among other things resulted in negative interest rates during what has been described as a period of high economic activity. A renewed discussion about the role and design of monetary policy and its relationship to fiscal policy in the light of the experience of recent decades is therefore called for.</p>
<p>• The strains on the national economy and public finances resulting from the  Covid-19 pandemic will not be able to be addressed in the framework of existing restrictions on the tax ratio and fiscalbalance targets. This has already been acknowledged by the European Commission. A combination of higher taxes and greater fiscal room for manoeuvre will be unavoidable. It is important that these policy changes are implemented with a high level of redistributive ambition. Well-resourced groups in society must shoulder a larger share of the burden, and that ambition must be continuously monitored in budgetary documents, in the same way as during the public financial crisis of the 1990s.</p>
<p>Institutional changes</p>
<p>• There has been a shift in recent decades in the boundary between the public and private spheres, resulting in a growing number of functions being transferred to the private sector through privatisation, outsourcing and other  market-based or market-like models. This has often been done without a careful analysis of what market failures the underlying public undertaking is intended to eliminate and to what extent it is possible to hand over responsibility to private actors. A reappraisal of some of these changes is called for.</p>
<p>• A similar review should be carried out of the division of responsibilities  within  the public sector, between central, regional and local government. The division of responsibilities within different sectors should be based on the character of the public services to be delivered, the relative advantages of the different levels, and the possibility of creating the right incentives for the institutions entrusted with providing the services.</p>
<p>• Central government has traditionally played a key role in the development and operation of infrastructure – the mainline railways in the 1850s, and later telecommunications and the supply of electricity – after private attempts had failed or been judged in advance to be impossible. The corporatisation and privatisation of recent decades have left us with no, or  under-resourced, central bodies with responsibility for developing the various infrastructure systems. This is detrimental to the expansion and management of the systems and also gives rise to regional imbalances. The problem is particularly noticeable in new areas of technology, such as broadband communication and charging networks for electric vehicles, but can also be seen in the traditional systems. An inquiry should therefore look into a strengthened role for central government in the infrastructure field, including a public enterprise for telecommunications, a shift in the boundary between public and private in the electricity supply system, and a state-managed charging network for electric vehicles. More functional pricing in certain infrastructure sectors may also be required, including in the form of higher charges for access to the rail network.</p>
<p>• Socio-economic evaluations of infrastructure projects are carried out in several areas, but have only a limited influence on political priorities. The methodology currently employed in the transport sector, which as well as transport efficiency includes safety and environmental aspects, should be supplemented to include a consistently applied distributional perspective on the projects considered. Once that element is included, greater respect for the outcome of the analyses should be shown in political decisions.</p>
<p>• In many areas of the public sector, especially at the municipal level, we find examples of preventive interventions that do not happen because the costs of the measures are borne by one department, while the benefits accrue to other departments or to regional or central government. To ensure that such ‘social investments’ come about, there need to be, on the one hand, an analytical function to develop methodologies for setting priorities and, on the other, funding. For some of these investments at least, funding can be secured through existing bodies (such as Kommuninvest), but the analytical function requires a new authority, with expertise similar to that found in existing agencies responsible for analysis in various fields, and involving a significant element of  socio-economic cost–benefit analysis. Its role should be to develop and to some extent standardise scientifically based methods for assessing costs and benefits in the area in question, drawing inspiration from existing international models.</p>
<p>• As noted earlier, in key areas  over-implementation of EU law has occurred, that is to say, for domestic policy reasons, Swedish governments have gone further than the EU rules require. In certain areas, this has had negative distributional consequences. A review should be carried out of more important policy areas, with a view to making more effective use of the available room for manoeuvre. Supervision of compliance with EU-related regulations must also be tightened up. Breaches of rules are unacceptably frequent in the operations of foreign companies in Sweden, for example in the transport and construction sectors.</p>
<p>• There is a need for supplementary databases for monitoring, supervision, evaluation and research in a number of fields, such as children’s health, problem gambling, the work environment, unemployment insurance and wealth. This should be made the subject of an inquiry. Particular attention should be paid to areas where data collection has been made more difficult in recent years by new regulatory regimes.</p>
<p>Gender equality</p>
<p>Although equality between the sexes in the Nordic countries has increased considerably over the past half-century, differences remain that sometimes have to do with historical gender roles, but which are sometimes the result of new policy decisions. Women bear a larger share of the responsibility for home and family, which in combination with paid employment can lead to stress and periods of sick leave. It also results in many women choosing to work part-time to cope with their greater responsibility for care and the home. Women’s and men’s wages have converged, but differences in average incomes have not decreased. This is partly because women more often work part-time, and partly because capital incomes, which show a skewed distribution in favour of men, have increased in significance. There are also a few remaining discriminatory elements in the legislation, for example in the rules on sick leave in connection with pregnancy.</p>
<p>The Commission recommends the following measures to achieve greater gender equality:</p>
<p>• Pregnancy should be put on a par with illness as a basis for establishing reduced capacity to work under the sickness insurance scheme.</p>
<p>• Pregnancy benefit should be adjusted so that it is paid at the same level as sickness benefit, and entitlement to it should be extended to the estimated due date.</p>
<p>• More days of parental benefit should be reserved for each parent, and the majority should be claimed before the child is 3 years old. Days of parental benefit paid at the minimum level should be individualised.</p>
<p>• Municipalities should be required to offer childcare in the evenings and at weekends to those who need it.</p>
<p>In addition, proposals with impacts on gender equality are presented in other areas, including vocational guidance to counteract genderbased career choices, reformed taxation of closely held companies, and greater provision of information about Swedish society for new arrivals.</p>
<p>Regional issues</p>
<p>Regional imbalances are growing, with a concentration of economic activity in the metropolitan regions. This is a strong tendency that is linked to changes in production systems, information technology, and the increased significance of human capital in the economy. The public sector cannot prevent this from happening, nor should it seek to do so, but the trend can be slowed and its consequences limited.</p>
<p>• There should be a greater central government presence up and down the country, with the opening of more service centres, police stations and so on. Relocation of entire government agencies out of Stockholm is of dubious value in this perspective.</p>
<p>The presence of service functions in people’s everyday lives – social insurance, tax and public employment service offices – is more important for the legitimacy of public services.</p>
<p>• The municipal equalisation system needs to be reviewed once again, with a view to preserving the levelling effect required. The most recent adjustment has helped to even out basic conditions, but all the indications are that it is not enough. Differences in growth potential and social factors make it difficult to maintain functioning public services in certain parts of the country.</p>
<p>• At the same time, there are limits to what can be achieved with an equalisation system. There needs to be an  open-ended discussion of additional measures, such as changes in the division of responsibilities between central and local government, asymmetrical solutions and mergers.</p>
<p>Proposals with favourable regional effects are also presented in other areas, including a coherent strategy for distance learning, and staterun learning centres to coordinate municipal adult education, Swedish for immigrants and distance-based higher education.</p>
<p>Political equality</p>
<p>The growing inequality of income and wealth in the OECD countries has affected the functioning of the democratic system. American political science research shows that decisions in Congress are increasingly being guided by the interests of the wealthier strata of society. Influence over the political process is being exerted both openly and behind the scenes. Similar tendencies have been seen in Sweden, but less research has been done on them. Sweden has been criticised by the international anti-corruption body Greco (the Group of States against Corruption) for not having done enough to regulate dealings between political parties and lobby groups of various kinds. Some tightening up of the rules has occurred, but problems remain. In its latest evaluation of Sweden, Greco is critical of a lack of adequate transparency in reporting contacts between political decision-makers and lobby groups.</p>
<p>Another threat is the development of very large databases containing sensitive individual data which, with the help of sophisticated information processing systems, have been used for commercial and political purposes. A third problem is that the nation state as a decision-maker is being challenged by transnational commercial actors with significant financial and legal resources. In these areas, too, there is a danger of the principle of political equality being put out of play.</p>
<p>The Commission makes the following proposals:</p>
<p>• Rules on party funding and political  decision-makers’ contacts with lobby groups should be tightened up, with a view to meeting all of Greco’s requirements. An inquiry should look into a register of lobbyists, of the same kind as is being discussed at the EU level.</p>
<p>• A new Study of Power and Democracy should be set up, with a focus on the threats to political equality emanating from, among other things, the tendencies indicated above – the growing concentration of wealth, the development of very large database systems, and the challenges to the nation state.</p>
<h2>Measures to increase equality – individual sectors</h2>
<p>Education and culture</p>
<p>Over a period of several decades, Sweden’s schools have undergone a variety of reforms that have put considerable pressure on the system as a whole, the people working in it and the students – decentralisation of responsibility to municipalities, with insufficient support from central government; new educational approaches; school choice and a free right of establishing new independent schools. Although the changes introduced have brought certain advantages – greater variation and possibly local improvements in performance – these have been outweighed by the disadvantages, in the shape of generally poorer outcomes, a greater spread of outcomes owing to increased sorting and the associated segregation of students, grade inflation, and an element of unreliable providers. In addition, there has been a large influx of students born abroad, who require more support on average to achieve the goals set. Overall, the experience gained calls for a reappraisal of the policies pursued in a number of respects:</p>
<p>• Clearer central government responsibility for preschool, compulsory and upper secondary education is necessary to reduce regional and socially based variation in the quality of the education system. Concrete measures to achieve this are a common admissions system for public and private schools, a common policy for differentiation of funding with reference to students’ needs and abilities, and clearer central government responsibility for the education budget. A sectoral grant of the same kind as was introduced in connection with decentralisation to municipalities should be the principal instrument in giving education providers the resources and incentives they need to work towards equivalent education. This grant should be made conditional on providers achieving the goals adopted at the national level in the education they deliver.</p>
<p>• An organisational structure with the emphasis on the county level should be developed to support small and  medium-sized municipalities, in particular, in their efforts to promote equivalent preschool, compulsory and upper secondary education. The most natural option would be to give the National Agency for Education a regionalised structure with a presence in every county, entrusted with safeguarding the supply of skills, quality and equivalence.</p>
<p>• Independent schools need to be better integrated into the national education system. The free right of establishment gives too much freedom to potential providers outside the public sector and therefore has to be limited. Given the selection which it makes possible, it can be argued that it conflicts with the requirement of the Convention on the Rights of the Child that children attending school should develop respect for civilisations different from their own. Freedom of establishment has also stood in the way of attempts by public agencies to integrate children from different environments.</p>
<p>• The provisions of the Education Ordinance and Upper Secondary School Ordinance allowing municipalities to subsidise independent schools’ premises costs, to enable such schools to establish themselves in their areas, are in contravention of the Local Government Act and probably also of EU rules, and should be repealed immediately. A thoroughgoing inquiry must be conducted into the legal framework for the operations of independent schools, with a view to establishing uniform provisions for public and independent schools regarding transparency, conflicts of interest and sanctions. An  open-ended inquiry should also be carried out into whether commercial entities can in fact be entrusted with the exercise of public authority.</p>
<p>• Resources for supervision should be strengthened, to enable the Swedish Schools Inspectorate to increase its regional presence.</p>
<p>• In view of the great importance of the early years of life, compulsory preschool education for children from the age of 3 years should be trialled and evaluated. Special initiatives should be put in place for younger children who do not have Swedish as their home language.</p>
<p>• The quality of preschool education is important in creating equal conditions for children to grow up in. The proportion of preschool staff with teacher education is declining, a tendency that must be reversed.</p>
<p>• Special support measures should be introduced to enable more students to meet the admission requirements for upper secondary school, both vocational programmes and those preparing students for higher education.</p>
<p>• The teaching profession should be strengthened. Responsibility for educational development should be concentrated in a smaller number of higher education institutions, at the same time as access to education and training for school and preschool teachers should be safeguarded throughout the country, includeing through greater opportunities for distance learning.</p>
<p>• In countries with successful school systems, educational research is strongly  knowledge-centred and focused on teaching methods. There should be lessons to be learnt from this for Swedish educational and pedagogical research. Basic pedagogical values should be written into the regulatory framework for school education, with a focus on knowledge and a stronger position for the teacher in teaching that is guided to a considerable degree by students’ prior knowledge (adaptive learning).</p>
<p>• Further measures should be introduced to make it more attracttive to work as a preschool or school teacher in less advantaged areas.</p>
<p>• A central body for scrutiny of textbooks and other teaching materials should be reintroduced, possibly combined with a public procurement function. The right of students to goodquality teaching materials and the right of teachers to insist on them should be written into the Education Act.</p>
<p>• The level of ambition for vocational guidance in schools should be raised significantly, to create conditions for  well-informed individual choices that are able to challenge established gender and class patterns. This could, on the one hand, interest children and young people with low levels of parental education in higher education and, on the other, increase interest in vocational choices that transcend traditional gender roles. Early interventions should be given priority.</p>
<p>• Adult education should be substantially expanded to meet the growing need both for basic knowledge – a municipal responsibility – and for vocational knowledge and skills in working life – a responsibility of the Public Employment Service. A transparent form of student finance should be created following an inquiry, with a particular focus on individuals who are a long way from the labour market. Central government should take on a greater responsibility for adult education.</p>
<p>• An inquiry should be undertaken to look once again at skills accounts of some kind, with the costs shared between employee, employer and the public sector.</p>
<p>• A coherent strategy for distance learning should be designed. It should include  needs-based educational programmes, funds for the development of digital teaching methods, and support systems and initiatives to broaden recruitment to higher education.</p>
<p>• A nationwide network of  state-run local learning centres should be developed to coordinate municipal adult education, Swedish for immigrants and distance-based higher education in regions where specialised education cannot be delivered cost-effectively in individual municipalities.</p>
<p>• Stricter requirements should be introduced concerning an active outreach approach in cultural policy. The policy delivered should be evaluated in relation to this goal, and grants should be made subject to conditions.</p>
<p>• Municipal arts schools should be seen as part of the public education system. Central government support conditional on outreach activities being provided should be introduced to ensure a presence in all the country’s municipalities.</p>
<p>Employment</p>
<p>The world of work is changing rapidly. Demands in terms of education and training, which were already unusually high on the Swedish labour market, are growing all the time, calling for a labour market policy with, on the one hand, greater flexibility and coordination between the central government, regional and local levels and, on the other, more accurately targeted central government initiatives. At the same time, conditions of employment in parts of the job market have become more insecure, adversely affecting social insurance cover and sometimes causing delay in starting a family. Part-time employment, in some cases at very low hours, and general fixed-term employment, with conditions that are difficult to monitor, are particularly common in certain low-paid occupations. The work environment, which in the last few decades has improved in some respects, has deteriorated in others – including increased stress due to a lack of control over one’s work and increased risks of accidents in sectors with a high proportion of foreign labour. To counteract these negative tendencies, the Commission proposes the following:</p>
<p>• The rules on general  fixed-term employment have been tightened up, but are judged to be so complex in their present form that they are difficult to apply. A review should be carried out, possibly with a view to limiting this form of employment.</p>
<p>• There should be special sanction rules in unemployment insurance where employees themselves give notice, in order to avoid abuse, but it is open to question whether the current rules strike the right balance. Excessively strict rules may result in employees staying for too long at dysfunctional places of work, giving rise to higher levels of sick leave and other consequences.</p>
<p>• Profiling – an assessment of a jobseeker’s knowledge and skills as a basis for matching with the labour market – should be developed and tested as a tool for determining the level and duration of wage subsidies for employees who do not achieve average productivity.</p>
<p>• Work capacity assessments should be made compulsory prior to decisions to refuse sickness benefit.</p>
<p>• The Public Employment Service should retain its role as a central coordinating agency and be given an expanded mandate without delay. Plans for privatisation have little support in research.</p>
<p>• The Swedish Work Environment Authority should be provided with increased resources. In addition, there should be greater scope for information sharing between authorities monitoring the work environment and those combating economic crime.</p>
<p>Migration, introduction and integration</p>
<p>Following an initial period for which central government is responsible, the main responsibility for the introduction and integration of immigrants currently rests with municipalities. In the Commission’s assessment, central government should take a longer-term responsibility, above all to assist local authorities with limited economic resources.</p>
<p>• A more stringent regulatory framework is needed for labour immigration. The need for such immigration should be assessed by an authority, as used to be the case. An offer of employment should be legally binding on the employer, and penalties when an employer deviates from the conditions forming the basis for a work permit should affect the employer and not the immigrant worker. Where the employer does not follow the agreed conditions, such behaviour should not be criminalised, but the financial penalty should be a significant one, and the employee should receive compensation without having to take his or her claims to court.</p>
<p>• Assessment of asylum applications should be concentrated in a number of reception centres where asylum seekers live and participate in early measures while awaiting their decisions.</p>
<p>• Municipalities should be responsible for initiatives providing an introduction to Swedish society, while the Public Employment Service should have responsibility for preparations for the labour market, including identification and validation of knowledge and skills. Asylum seekers should be required to participate.</p>
<p>• IT support for the Swedish Migration Agency’s decisions on recommended places of residence for those granted residence permits should be developed using effective algorithms to maximise the likelihood of their finding work.</p>
<p>• Daily expenses allowances for asylum seekers should be increased so as to reduce the administrative burden.</p>
<p>• The incentive effects of introduction benefit and supplementary introduction benefit should be reviewed, to make it equally worthwhile financially for both spouses in a household to take a job. Levels should be adjusted so that municipalities are not burdened with the cost of income support during the introduction period. Appropriate interventions should be available to meet all needs, not least for individuals with a short education and little work experience.</p>
<p>• The rules in the Reception of Asylum Seekers Act (1994:137) on accommodation arranged by asylum seekers themselves should be phased out.</p>
<p>• As mentioned earlier, days of parental benefit paid at the minimum level should be reserved in the same way as days paid at the sickness benefit level, an arrangement that may be particularly important in households with traditional gender role values. Individuals on parental leave with parental benefit should be permitted to attend introduction to Swedish society and Swedish for immigrants courses.</p>
<p>• The inquiry into student finance recommended above should analyse needs in particular from a migration point of view.</p>
<p>• The Public Employment Service needs to intensify its efforts to give equivalent introduction support to newly arrived women and men. Among other things, interventions for women who are a long way from the labour market must be expanded and put on a permanent basis.</p>
<p>• Efforts to combat  ‘honour-related’ violence and oppression should be stepped up, for example by means of further surveys and training for staff who may come into contact with those affected.</p>
<p>Housing, neighbourhood and environment</p>
<p>Significant housing shortages exist in a majority of the country’s municipalities. For a number of years, production of new housing has been low and uneven, and the existing stock is not being used entirely efficiently. The housing market has become polarised, in the sense that low-earning households have come to dominate the rental stock, while a large proportion of those on middle and high incomes own their homes. Taxation of housing has gradually been tilted increasingly in favour of owner-occupied homes, with adverse distributional consequences.</p>
<p>• Under current conditions, neither municipal housing companies nor private actors have sufficient incentive to build new homes. Central government must take a greater financial and possibly also operational responsibility. The level of investment support for the provision of rented homes and student accommodation should gradually be raised. The focus should be on a larger share of this support going to the metropolitan regions. The support scheme should be continuously evaluated.</p>
<p>• A state ‘top loan’ for construction in weaker housing markets should be introduced.</p>
<p>• The supply of housing must be planned on a regional basis, as labour markets normally extend over more than one municipality. Municipal authorities should meet at a regional level to determine the need for home building and to allocate responsibility among the municipalities of each region, in consultation with central government. The municipal right of  pre-emption (first refusal) should be reintroduced.</p>
<p>• A decision has been taken to conduct an inquiry into the design of social housing. This inquiry should be given additional terms of reference to look into a  state-owned property company that could assume responsibility for producing new homes in situations where neither municipal companies nor private property owners show sufficient interest.</p>
<p>• Taxation of  owner-occupied and rented housing should be harmonised. Taxes or charges on owner-occupied homes should be proportional above a certain minimum amount, with no ceiling. Increases in the value of housing should be taxed like other capital gains.</p>
<p>• Full use should be made of the room for manoeuvre under EU legislation with regard to municipal housing companies. Should the decision be taken not to develop a special category of social housing, it should be clarified that the ‘sound business principles’ requirement does not conflict with a  low-price approach limited only by the cost-price principle.</p>
<p>• The possibility of taking profits out of municipal housing companies should be limited to social preventive measures that demonstrably improve housing environments and reduce segregation.</p>
<p>• A state rent guarantee should be introduced to facilitate access to housing for younger people and households with lower but stable incomes.</p>
<p>• Tenants should be given more influence over renovation work, to prevent improvements in standards and increases in rent that make it necessary for some tenants to move.</p>
<p>• The National Board of Housing, Building and Planning and the National Board of Health and Welfare should be tasked with evaluating models for homeless families with children, together with interested municipalities.</p>
<p>• Having failed to keep pace with inflation, housing benefits have lost their significance as a housing policy instrument and need to be raised. The increase should be designed to be of particular benefit to families with children.</p>
<p>Consumer issues</p>
<p>The position of consumers has developed in different directions in different markets in recent decades. In some markets, competition is healthy and price trends are favourable. In others, for various reasons, consumers are less well placed to assert their rights: as a result of monopolies in the case of electricity distribution, a marked asymmetry between producers and consumers when it comes to health care services, or a general shortage, as in the housing market. The proposals put forward by the Commission in these areas will help in general terms to strengthen the position of the consumer. In one area – that of debt – a specific proposal to that end is presented.</p>
<p>Households with small financial margins are sensitive to a temporary loss of income or unforeseen expenditure. The financial stress caused by such disruptions undermines their decision-making capacity and increases the risk of overhasty decisions, for example to take out expensive, short-term loans or to turn to commercial gambling to try to resolve the situation. This can give rise to negative spirals and debt traps that are difficult or impossible to escape from.</p>
<p>One option is debt relief. Around 183 000 children are currently growing up in a home where at least one parent has debts that have been referred to, or has entered a debt relief scheme with, the</p>
<p>Swedish Enforcement Authority. However, debt relief is not sufficient to handle every situation that arises. With inspiration partly from legislation in Finland, the Commission therefore recommends an absolute limitation period for debts, subject to certain conditions.</p>
<p>• Absolute limitation of debts for individuals with  long-term overindebtedness should be introduced under the Limitation Act.</p>
<p>Health care</p>
<p>By international standards, the state of health in Sweden is generally good. However, significant differences exist between income groups and between regions. Relatively new developments, such as the health care choice reform and private health insurance, risk further increasing differences in access to health care.</p>
<p>• The health care choice system has meant that the formerly  joined-up system of child health care no longer works as it used to do. No one actor now has overall responsibility for monitoring public health and coordinating preventive interventions. The regions should be given a responsibility for preventive public health, with a particular responsibility for measures targeted at households at greater risk.</p>
<p>• An inquiry should be carried out into the feasibility of a concrete programme of effective measures to promote healthy lifestyle habits, particularly among young people in all  socio-economic groups. This should include, for example, wider-ranging teaching and efforts to establish good habits in schoolchildren (exercise, diet etc.), health counselling for adults (based on the ‘Västerbotten model’), and taxation of food additives such as sugar and salt.</p>
<p>• Current policy on alcohol should be maintained and also tightened up in certain respects.</p>
<p>• Problem gambling is now viewed on a par with other forms of addiction or misuse, but there is no coherent and effective policy in this area. Such a policy should be developed, modelled on those for other types of dependence. The Commission recommends restrictions on marketing as in the case of tobacco and alcohol.</p>
<p>• The Health and Medical Services Act needs to be made more precise so as to clarify what constitutes a violation of its intentions. Private health insurance is one example of a phenomenon that can give rise to conflicts with those intentions and that may need to be more clearly regulated.</p>
<p>• People with disabilities often have a capacity to work that can be made use of with appropriate assistive technology. Support arrangements need to be made more effective to reduce costs and enable more people to participate in employment. Commercial operators have for example driven up the cost of hearing assistive technology in an unacceptable way.</p>
<p>Transfer payments – children and families</p>
<p>The main changes to transfer systems for children and families proposed by the Commission were presented earlier under the heading Gender equality  – changes to the rules on sick leave during pregnancy and pregnancy benefit, parental benefit, and entitlement to childcare during unsocial working hours.</p>
<p>Economic vulnerability in childhood can have long-term consequences for children’s health and life chances. Housing and the local environment are particularly important in this regard. The Commission’s proposal to restore housing benefit as a housing policy instrument is therefore important, and changes to the benefit should be designed so as mainly to help families with children.</p>
<p>Insurance to cover unemployment and reduced working capacity</p>
<p>Sickness benefit is intended to provide financial security for individuals who, for a limited period, are unable to work owing to illness, and covers the period they are ill and their capacity to work is reduced. Unemployment insurance offers more specific cover for periods in transition between jobs, and requires the unemployed person to seek and take work that is considered suitable. The requirements and incentives to do so increase, moreover, the longer the person is unemployed.</p>
<p>Individuals with a weak position on the labour market are often excluded altogether from these systems by the requirements of the existing rules, even though they may have worked and paid taxes and contributions over a long period of time. In the case of sickness benefit, the requirement is a predictable income for a certain time into the future. With unemployment benefit, the condition is sufficient hours of work going far enough back in time, and also membership of an unemployment insurance fund, either one linked to a trade union or the independent Alfakassan.</p>
<p>Another problem concerns people who are denied sickness benefit with reference to what is termed ‘normally occurring employment’, but who on contacting the Public Employment Service are judged too ill to be able to find a job. In the Commission’s view, conflicting assessments of this kind by central government agencies are unacceptable.</p>
<p>For these systems of insurance, the Commission makes the following proposals:</p>
<p>• Levels of benefit paid under public insurance schemes have fallen over a long period for a large proportion of those covered. A  long-term target should be for 80 per cent of the individuals insured to have a benefit level of 80 per cent of their normal income.</p>
<p>• The sickness insurance scheme should be based on historical monthly income. This change can be made fiscally neutral if so desired, by adjusting either contributions to the system or benefit levels, or by a combination of the two.</p>
<p>• Unemployment insurance should be compulsory within the framework of existing administrative arrangements, that is to say, a combination of insurance funds linked to trade unions and an independent one, which employees would have to choose between. Benefit levels should be based on monthly income and should be raised.</p>
<p>• It should only be possible to deny individuals sickness benefit with reference to work of a specified character on the labour market. Such a decision must be preceded by a work capacity assessment that permits a more concrete appraisal of what available jobs could be appropriate. Definitions of what types of work are to be considered suitable for the person insured should be harmonised between the rules of the unemployment and sickness insurance schemes.</p>
<p>Crime policy</p>
<p>In the area of crime, the important point to be noted is that preventive measures are the most effective. A large proportion of criminal careers can be traced back to failure at school, which in turn is often associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, substance misuse in the family and similar problems. If children and young people at risk are identified early on and support measures put in place, in other words, it is possible to avoid much higher costs, both personal and socio-economic, later on in life. Exclusion early in life increases the risk of dysfunctional patterns of behaviour.</p>
<p>Even with a successful policy of prevention, crimes will be committed. At that stage in life, too, it is important that the measures taken by society are designed to integrate and not to exclude. Entry to the labour market and starting a family are important factors in achieving integration, and education while in prison should therefore be part of the process of readjustment.</p>
<p>The Commission has no specific proposals in the areas of crime prevention and treatment of offenders, but confines itself to making the following assessments:</p>
<p>• Early interventions in childhood and adolescence to prevent individuals embarking on criminal careers are  cost-effective, provided that at-risk groups can be identified with sufficient accuracy. This requires coordinated efforts by schools, social services and child and adolescent psychiatric services.</p>
<p>• As far as possible, crime policy should be guided by research, and not by what are judged to be politically attractive measures. Lengthening already long prison sentences has an uncertain effect and may, at worst, be counterproductive.</p>
<p>Increasingly, companies have become instruments of organised crime, with negative distributional consequences for both crime victims and exploited employees. To counteract this trend, the Commission proposes the following:</p>
<p>• The statutory audit requirement should be reintroduced for small limited companies.</p>
<p>• An inquiry should be conducted into the possibility of additional information sharing between authorities to facilitate targeting and control.</p>
<p>Taxes</p>
<p>A modern tax system should be based on progressive taxation of income. There is a strong correlation between capability (measured as earned income) on the one hand and capital assets and capital incomes on the other. This is an argument for taxing capital as a complement to labour, so as to be able to make overall taxation more progressive without too large an increase in the marginal rate of tax on labour.</p>
<p>The tax-to-GDP ratio is not a good measure of the extent of government involvement in household finances. In a direct comparison with other OECD countries, Sweden has a relatively high tax ratio, but when this is corrected for taxable transfer payments, welfare policy on the expenditure side of the budget and other policy elements, the country occupies more of an intermediate position. Since the turn of the century, the tax ratio has fallen by 5.7 per cent of GDP, currently corresponding to just over SEK 290 billion.</p>
<p>The growing inequality of income in Sweden is due largely to political decisions. Capital incomes, which are taxed less than incomes from labour, have increased in significance, and the tax and transfer system is, in general, less redistributive than before. Revenue from capital taxation has shown a downward trend from 7 to 5 per cent of GDP, despite an increase in both stocks and flows of capital.</p>
<p>Taxation of housing used to be guided by the principle that the state should be neutral between owner-occupied and rented accommodation. Now owner-occupied housing is strongly favoured, more so than in most EU countries.</p>
<p>Another factor of distributional significance is what are referred to as ‘tax expenditures’, i.e. subsidies on the revenue side of the budget that arise from deviations from the benchmark level of a given tax. Examples of this are lower value added tax on food, tax relief for interest on loans, and the ROT and RUT deduction schemes for home repairs and maintenance and household services.</p>
<p>In the area of taxation, the Commission has confined its attention to taxes with clear distributional implications:</p>
<p>• The tax on capital incomes should be raised, guided by the aim of a uniform rate of tax on all capital incomes. Inheritance and gift tax should be reintroduced, and an inquiry should be conducted into the feasibility of a wealth tax.</p>
<p>• Taxation arrangements for closely held companies, the ‘3:12 rules’, appear to have generated some increase in employment, but it is unclear at what cost. The rules have also been exploited to develop company structures that circumvent the progressivity of the tax system. Changes that would eliminate such abuse, while preserving the positive elements, were the subject of an earlier inquiry (SOU 2016:75). The proposals from that inquiry should be implemented. Steps should be taken to prevent structures of the type mentioned by introducing a more stringent activity requirement for these companies.</p>
<p>• The principle of equal treatment of rented and  owner-occupied housing should be reinstated. The rate of tax on tenant-owner apartments should be harmonised with that applying to houses.</p>
<p>• A charge or tax on real property should only be levied above an exempt amount, but on the other hand there should be no ceiling on the amount payable. Tax relief for interest payments should be reduced in stages. The property charge on rented apartment buildings should be abolished.</p>
<p>• The pandemic will lead to a sharp decline in the public budget balance, owing to both increased expenditure and reduced revenue. To restore the balance in public finances, significant tax increases will be necessary. These should be based on the principle of taxation according to ability, that is to say, be clearly progressive in character.</p>
<h2>Financing issues</h2>
<p>The remit of the Public Commission on Equality differs substantially from those of regular government inquiries, on account of the broad mandate set out in its terms of reference. As earlier parts of this report have made clear, its work covers a large number of policy areas, and it has not been possible to develop detailed proposals throughout as would normally be the case in an inquiry. A good many proposals and recommendations call for further inquiries, and estimates of costs in such areas will necessarily be approximate.</p>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has radically changed the basic conditions for fiscal policy. Both the tax ratio and ambitions in terms of the balance of public finances will need to be reassessed. In its outline analysis of financing, however, the Commission has disregarded the effects of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The problems faced by Sweden even before the pandemic, moreover, are on such a scale that it seems unrealistic to imagine that they could all be solved simply by reallocating existing budget funds. The extensive immigration of recent decades has crucially changed the conditions on which earlier decisions regarding the surplus target and tax ratio were based. The EU Stability and Growth Pact includes public budget deficit and debt requirements which Sweden has for a long time met by a good margin. The surplus target has recently been adjusted downwards, but the balance of public finances could be lowered by another roughly 1 per cent of GDP while still respecting the requirements of the Pact, corresponding to a fiscal space of just over SEK 50 billion. As mentioned, the tax ratio has been reduced by 5.7 per cent of GDP since the turn of the century, corresponding to around SEK 290 billion.</p>
<p>The surplus target was once set with reference to demographic projections that foresaw a sharp increase in the dependency ratio – the proportion of children and elderly people in the population was expected to grow relative to the proportion of people of working age. Immigration since the turn of the century has radically altered the demographic profile of the population: the dependency ratio improves by between 15 and 16 per cent when individuals born abroad are included. To be able to make the most of this favourable situation, however, those born abroad, as well as groups of people born in Sweden who for various reasons neither work nor study, will have to be integrated as far as possible into the labour force. This calls for very substantial investments in education and training, combined to varying degrees with wage subsidies. In the absence of such investments, there is a risk of costs of other kinds – a lack of economic growth, greater dependence on transfer systems, and social conflict.</p>
<p>With these figures in mind, the Commission has nevertheless sought to finance its proposals within the existing expenditure framework. If these funding routes are considered less appropriate, it will be necessary to find others, or else change the tax ratio or the surplus target.</p>
<p>In all, the costs of the Commission’s proposals are estimated to be in the range of SEK 30–40 billion. The main sources of funding are:</p>
<p>• raising VAT on food to the standard rate of 25 per cent, with compensation for families with children and  low-income households – a net effect of SEK 15 billion</p>
<p>• phasing out the ROT deduction – SEK 10 billion</p>
<p>• a temporary transfer of the equivalent of 0.3 per cent of GNI from the development assistance budget to purposes designed to improve the integration of individuals born abroad – SEK  15–16 billion.</p>
<p>The reasons for these proposals are as follows.</p>
<p>Standard-rate VAT on food</p>
<p>An analysis by the Swedish National Audit Office has shown that a reduced rate of VAT on food is an inefficient way of supporting families with children and low-income households, which was the reason originally given for it. VAT can be raised to the standard rate and the target groups compensated, a measure which the National Audit Office estimates would generate a net revenue in the range of SEK 15–20 billion. In the long term, VAT on restaurant and catering services should also be harmonised, to avoid problems of demarcation, but in the present circumstances this would not be appropriate, given that this sector has been particularly badly affected by the pandemic. Even without that additional adjustment, a net effect of SEK 15 billion is a cautious estimate.</p>
<p>Phase-out of the ROT deduction</p>
<p>The arguments for retaining the ROT deduction (tax relief on home repairs and maintenance) are currently weak. The subsidy was originally introduced as a countercyclical instrument, but was made permanent for unclear reasons. It is hard to see that there is any need for general support for the construction sector. The deduction is used for a range of purposes that do not help to increase the residential floor space available – renovation of fully functional living spaces, extensions that do not add to the residential floor area, and so on. A reallocation of resources to the construction of new rented apartments would make a better contribution to solving the housing crisis. At present, the deduction mainly benefits those on middle and high incomes. A substantial proportion of the projects for which deductions are currently granted would be carried out even without support. If these resources are transferred to other forms of support in the area of housing policy, moreover, the labour freed up could be provided with employment in other sectors of construction. The argument that the subsidy helps to reduce undeclared employment in the country rests on relatively weak foundations.</p>
<p>Temporary adjustment of the development assistance target</p>
<p>Sweden’s development assistance policy is currently geared to achieving a volume target of 1 per cent of gross national income (GNI). The total budgeted for 2020 is SEK 52.1 billion. This oneper-cent target is self-imposed. An undertaking which Sweden has made formally in an international context is that its international development assistance should amount to 0.7 per cent. This was decided in 2004 by the then 15 member states of the EU. The oneper-cent target originally referred to the total flow of resources from both public and private sources, but as donor country governments have no control over private flows, there was eventually a shift to a target of 0.7 per cent for public flows, i.e. for official development assistance (ODA). Of the OECD member states that cooperate on development policy – the DAC (Development Assistance Committee) countries – only the Scandinavian countries, the United</p>
<p>Kingdom and Luxembourg live up to this lower 0.7 per cent target. The average figure is 0.31 per cent.</p>
<p>Over the half-century or so that has passed since the discussion began, global resource flows have changed fundamentally. Both direct investments and private transfers by individual migrants to their home countries, known as remittances, have grown sharply and each is now substantially larger than the official development assistance budget. Globally, remittances in 2018 totalled more than twice the amount of ODA.</p>
<p>A broad approach needs to be taken in an assessment of international development cooperation. Immigration of refugees is not planned and sought after in the way that labour immigration is, but rests mainly on humanitarian considerations. In our report, a range of measures are proposed to facilitate the integration of refugees on the labour market, but even with optimistic assumptions concerning the integration problems involved, refugee immigration will entail appreciable costs to the public purse. In reality, this is to be regarded as part of our international development assistance.</p>
<p>Some migrants will return to their home countries after a year or two, perhaps when an armed conflict has ended, and will then have developed their knowledge and skills through education or vocational training. Some will stay for longer, and some will settle permanently in their new country or move to another EU country. This will result in remittances, which will indirectly be a result of these migrants being received and establishing themselves in a new country. Some will set up in business in their new country and use their networks in their country of origin to develop trade between the countries. What the net effect of all this will be is impossible to say with any reasonable certainty, but it should be taken into account qualitatively when the overarching goals of development assistance and migration policy are to be determined. Against this backdrop, a temporary adjustment of the development assistance target seems a reasonable measure. As the additional strain on the national economy that can be linked to migration is temporary, as far as can be judged at present, there will be a basis for returning to the one-per-cent target in the not too distant future.</p>
<h2>A re-established social contract</h2>
<p>The remit set out in the Commission’s terms of reference is broad and generally worded. It is summed up in the following three points:</p>
<p>• To propose measures that can help to level differences in childhood circumstances and in opportunities for good education and employment with good working conditions.</p>
<p>• To consider measures that will strengthen the rights of the individual in relation to powerful economic interests.</p>
<p>• To propose other types of measures to create equality.</p>
<p>In addition, it is stated that the proposals should promote equality in such a way as to strengthen the functioning and growth potential of the economy. The terms of reference also say that equality is to be promoted by as even a distribution of market incomes as possible. From the analysis carried out, it emerges that this last-mentioned strategy involves certain risks: the distribution of market incomes, measured by the Gini coefficient, has now been stable for a few decades, while that of disposable income has become increasingly uneven. As it is disposable income that ultimately determines how much room for manoeuvre households have, trends in that variable also have to be monitored.</p>
<p>Against this background, the Commission has presented a large number of proposals designed to simultaneously increase equality and strengthen the country’s economic potential. The great majority of them have previously been the subject of public debate, and some have been carefully studied in government inquiries. The Commission’s contribution is therefore primarily to be seen as an attempt to present a coherent analysis of Sweden’s current problems and a set of mutually supporting proposals to halt and in time reverse the trends towards greater inequality, polarisation and social conflict.</p>
<p>The pandemic has changed the basic conditions for policymaking, and will continue to affect them for a long time to come. Even before this external shock hit the global and Swedish economies, however, there were signs of a crisis. Polarisation in society has increased, as has the aggressive character of public discourse; the parliamentary situation is marked by instability; and in certain respects the political system is working less well. These changes have</p>
<p>occurred at the same time as economic development has been favourable, with a stable rise in gross domestic product, indicating that the questions of welfare and satisfaction with life are broader than overarching economic metrics are able to capture.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s assessment, the problems described are to a significant degree self-inflicted, in the sense that they are the result of domestic policy decisions. Continuing intense internationalisation of the economy, concentration of domestic economic activity in the metropolitan regions, and greater insecurity on the labour market for large groups of employees have not been met with adequate and appropriate compensatory measures. Instead, an insufficiently equalising tax system and a weakened system of social insurance have together resulted in greater inequality of disposable income, placing a strain on social cohesion. Against that backdrop, signs of declining trust in society should come as no surprise.</p>
<p>Three major problem areas directly related to the first point in the Commission’s terms of reference are education, housing and integration policy. The first two already presented significant problems a few decades ago, but these problems have been exacerbated by the rapid increase in population resulting from extensive immigration. The immigration policy pursued was shaped largely on the basis of political agreement, but the political parties seem to have underestimated what measures – investments in a broad sense – are needed to deal with the resulting rise in population. They have clung instead to preset political agendas, which have proved increasingly inadequate as a response to the country’s problems.</p>
<p>Greater heterogeneity of the population need not necessarily result in problems; handled in the right way, it can instead be an asset. Social science research indicates what conditions need to be met to ensure favourable developments in this respect. The majority population and different minorities must meet on reasonably equal terms. The prospects of achieving this are good: egalitarian values have been at the forefront of Swedish legislation and Swedish political tradition in modern times. In addition, there need to be common challenges to address. That condition is also met: there is certainly no shortage of problems when it comes to realising the traditionally ambitious goals of welfare policy.</p>
<p>The third condition is that political leaders unequivocally stand for a policy to promote integration that affirms diversity and invites everyone who accepts the basic values and conditions to participate on the same terms in building society. Tendencies towards conflict exist in all societies, but it is only when political leaders feed on such conflicts that they are legitimised and gather strength. To counteract such tendencies, what is needed is a renewed social contract.</p>
