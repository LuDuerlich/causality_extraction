<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Terms of reference</h2>
<p>The inquiry’s terms of reference have been to conduct a broad review of the deposit guarantee scheme and the investor compensation scheme. The deposit guarantee scheme covers deposits in banks, securities companies and credit market companies in the event of a bankruptcy. The investor compensation scheme gives protection in connection with the provision of investment services. Both schemes are currently administered by the Deposit Guarantee Board and are based on EC directives. The schemes entail a considerable commitment on the part of the state. At the end of 2003, the deposit guarantee scheme covered deposits amounting to SEK 475 billion, which represents about two thirds of the total outstanding volume of state guarantees.</p>
<p>In their present form these two compensation schemes are not governed by the principles that were introduced in 1999 and that apply to other state guarantees. In particular, they do not to have to use risk-related pricing. One of the main tasks of the inquiry has been to see whether the schemes can be brought into line with the state guarantee principles or whether they should instead be governed strictly by mutual insurance principles, with the insured firms guaranteeing one another’s assets.</p>
<p>Another factor behind the appointment of the inquiry is the way the Nordic banking market is developing. The commitments of the Swedish state under the deposit guarantee scheme may increase by around 50 per cent if Nordea Bank goes ahead with its plans to turn its subsidiaries in the other Nordic countries into branches. The EC directive states that the bank’s home Member State is also responsible for guaranteeing deposits in foreign branches. The Swedish state may therefore become responsible for extensive consumer protection in the other Nordic countries as well. In the</p>
<p>situation that has thus arisen, the Swedish state has an interest in obtaining compensation for the extra risk it is taking on. Moreover, reasonable competitive conditions in the Nordic banking market are in the interest of the Swedish banks. Events have made it necessary to reconsider the deposit guarantee system in general and the pricing of guarantees in particular.</p>
<p>Future role of the schemes</p>
<p>In the view of the inquiry, the main task of the Swedish deposit guarantee scheme should be to contribute to consumer protection primarily by protecting the liquid assets of individuals and nonfinancial enterprises. The scheme should also help protect the financial system by reducing incentives to withdraw funds when there are rumours of insolvency, thereby reducing the risk of runs on Swedish banks.</p>
<p>The role of the investor compensation scheme should be to contribute to consumer protection by protecting investors against losses due to administrative mistakes and crime in connection with securities firm bankruptcies. It should not be the task of the Swedish investor compensation scheme to help preserve stability.</p>
<p>Future coverage of the schemes</p>
<p>In the view of the inquiry, the deposit guarantee scheme should be limited to the area where protection is most valuable from the point of view of consumer protection. A restriction of this kind is motivated for competitive reasons but also because the deposit guarantee scheme entails a considerable commitment for the Swedish state and Swedish taxpayers and this commitment should be limited. The basic view of the inquiry is that the deposit guarantee scheme should not provide blanket protection of capital but should above all serve the purpose of protecting current accounts. The EC directive prevents the inquiry from putting forward radical proposals in this direction. However, the inquiry does propose that savings in accounts where a fee is charged for withdrawals should in future not be covered by the guarantee. It is also proposed to leave time deposits and savings within the</p>
<p>framework of individual pension schemes without coverage under the guarantee.</p>
<p>The categories of depositors entitled to compensation from the compensation schemes should also be restricted to a core for whom protection is most valuable – individuals and small enterprises. However, the possibility of leaving out larger companies is severely circumscribed by the EC directive and consequently no such proposal is presented. On the other hand, the inquiry does note that no protective interest whatsoever is served in the case of financial institutions, local governments, government agencies, pension funds and similar institutions. It is proposed that these depositors should not be covered by the deposit guarantee scheme in the future. The same exceptions are proposed for the investor compensation scheme.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the level of compensation that applies under the deposit guarantee and investor compensation schemes should remain unchanged at SEK 250 000. Further, the inquiry does not propose the introduction of any excess in connection with disbursements from the compensation schemes.</p>
<p>Future design of the schemes</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the deposit guarantee scheme should in future be organised strictly as a state guarantee and brought in line with the general rules that apply to other state guarantees. One implication of the proposal is that guarantees should be priced according to risk by an agency that is accountable for the economic result. A solution for the deposit guarantee scheme purely along mutual insurance lines is rejected. A solution of that kind has no prospect of working without being backed up by an implicit or explicit state guarantee. This follows from the scale of the commitment.</p>
<p>The investor compensation scheme is currently based on mutual principles but administered by the state. The inquiry proposes no change on this point. As far as is foreseen, the participating companies will always be able to meet claims under the scheme, without any commitment on the part of the state. The inquiry considers that it will be cost-effective to let a single agency administer both schemes.</p>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>The general level of fees in the deposit guarantee scheme is at present laid down by law. There is limited scope for risk differentiation. The inquiry proposes that the fees for the deposit guarantee should in future be set so that they can be presumed to meet the liabilities of the system during the guarantee period (costprice principle) .</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the fees should be payable before the beginning of the guarantee period (ex ante). The present possibility of levying fees ex post (with the fee being linked to the volume of funds deposited) should cease. Ex ante financing has the advantage that the fee can be levied at a time when the subject of the guarantee has a high capacity to pay and that fee payments can be spread over time. Moreover, this system would give participating firms an incentive to manage their risks. Another advantage is that the company that has failed will have contributed to the financing.</p>
<p>The inquiry does not only recommend that the general level of fees should be set relative to the risk; the fee for individual companies and/or groups of companies should be set so as to reflect the risk involved in these engagements (risk differentiation).</p>
<p>The inquiry takes the view that the precise arrangement for setting fees is not an appropriate area for legislation. Instead it is proposed that the Government should decide on the fee model to be applied, after proposals from the agency responsible. Within the framework provided by the fee model, the agency will then decide on fees in individual cases. Before the agency submits its proposal to the Government there should be consultation with the companies liable to pay fees, regarding the principles that should apply to the fee model.</p>
<p>The inquiry suggests that in future, all participants, with each company paying an equal amount in SEK, should share current administrative expenses.</p>
<p>For the investor compensation scheme, it is proposed that annual fees should continue to be levied to finance the running administration of the scheme. Claims should be financed by ex post fees, set relative to the size of the amounts covered in each company, without risk differentiation. The risk of having to meet claims in the investor compensation scheme is particularly difficult to assess. Charging ex post fees is a more effective way of ensuring</p>
<p>that the scheme breaks even than charging fees before the guarantee period begins.</p>
<p>Managing surpluses and deficits</p>
<p>In accordance with the terminology used within the framework of the state guarantees model, the present fund in the deposit guarantee scheme should be renamed the guarantee reserve . It should be possible to divide the guarantee reserve into two parts, one denominated in SEK and one denominated in foreign currency. As is the case for other guarantee activities, the funds should be put into a National Debt Office account. For the sake of clarity, it should be emphasised that the suggestion is for the funds to be earmarked to cover claims under the deposit guarantee scheme, just as is now the case.</p>
<p>Deficits in both Swedish kronor and in foreign currency will be financed by an overdraft facility at the National Debt Office, linked to the guarantee reserve.</p>
<p>Disbursement of compensation from the deposit guarantee scheme</p>
<p>At present, the compensation to which a depositor is entitled must be paid out promptly and no later than three months after the day of adjudication of bankruptcy, unless there are exceptional reasons for not doing so. The objectives of the system – to help protect consumers and to safeguard stability – could be achieved better if disbursements could be made more quickly. In order to emphasise more clearly the importance of compensation being paid out as quickly as possible, the inquiry proposes that the time allowed be shortened to one month.</p>
<p>Compensation from the deposit guarantee scheme should in future be paid out in the currency in which an account is denominated.</p>
<p>Levying of fees</p>
<p>At present fees are based on information referring to 31 December of the year before the guarantee period. This arrangement means that the fee cannot be charged until almost half the guarantee</p>
<p>period has passed. The inquiry therefore proposes that fees for the deposit guarantee scheme should be levied before the beginning of the guarantee period and be based on information for 30 September of the previous year.</p>
<p>Provision for losses</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that provision for future losses should be made within the framework of the deposit guarantee scheme, but not for the investor compensation scheme, as in the latter case it can be assumed that the companies themselves can meet all claims. The provision must correspond to expected losses plus administrative expenses.</p>
<p>Administration of the schemes</p>
<p>The inquiry considers that the Deposit Guarantee Board, like other small organisations, is too vulnerable. In the event of the inquiry’s proposals being implemented, a number of new tasks will be assigned to the Deposit Guarantee Board, which will entail a need for increased staff resources. However, the inquiry’s assessment is that the staff of the Board will not attain the sort of critical mass that makes it possible to avoid the problems associated with a small agency. The inquiry therefore proposes merging the Board’s activities with other state activities.</p>
<p>The inquiry suggests a broader approach is warranted to the administration of state guarantees. The guarantee portfolios that are currently divided up between the various state guarantee agencies (the National Housing Credit Guarantee Board, the Swedish Export Credits Guarantee Board, the Deposit Guarantee Board, the National Debt Office and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency) should be brought together into a single agency responsible for the entire portfolio of state guarantees. It does not fall within the inquiry’s terms of reference to put forward a more detailed proposal concerning the design of the new agency.</p>
<p>Financial consequences of the proposals</p>
<p>The inquiry’s proposals will necessitate considerable reinforcement of the resources of the responsible agency and will lead to increased costs for administering the deposit guarantee scheme. The inquiry finds that, in view of the scale of the commitment, it would be reasonable for the state to invest the resources required to manage and price the risk in an effective manner. The inquiry estimates that the proposals can be financed by rationalisation gains associated with the proposed merging of the state guarantee agencies. The administrative expenses should, as now, be financed by levying fees from the participating companies. The proposal is not expected to lead to any added burden on the central government budget.</p>
<p>The switch to ex ante financing will reduce the risk of systematic deficits in the system.</p>
<p>No added collective burden is foreseen for the companies covered. In its report, the inquiry describes various conceivable pricing models for the future financing of the deposit guarantee sheme. The calculations indicate that the present average level of fees is reasonable. A fee system based on the cost-price principle will therefore not lead to a general level of fees that differs significantly from the present situation. The proposed model is not expected to give rise to any significant competitive disadvantages or advantages for the Swedish banks. Under the present deposit guarantee scheme, high-risk companies are heavily subsidised by other companies. Correct risk differentiation will make it possible to resolve these distortions. Competitive conditions will become more neutral and firms will have increased incentives to manage their own risks.</p>
