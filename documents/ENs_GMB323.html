<p>My assignment</p>
<p>My assignment was to carry out a review, with the focus on the provision of export credits, of the officially supported export financing system and the rules and international guidelines that affect the Swedish exporters’ opportunities for offering competitive financing solutions. The areas I was instructed to examine in depth were officially supported export credits and the organizational structure, the role of the Government in other export credit arrangements and project financing. I was also instructed to consider the Government’s interest in an efficient system for export financing and officially supported export credit guarantees.</p>
<p>The inquiry</p>
<p>The main purpose of the inquiry was to assess the role of the Government and the future need of government participation in export financing and the most appropriate organization for this participation. Due to the short time available, I decided to dispense with the help of formally appointed experts. Instead, I established contacts directly with representatives of various parties. I also had meetings with representatives of the export industry, banks, etc.</p>
<p>I have compared the Swedish export financing system with those in Denmark, Norway, Finland, Germany and the United Kingdom and studied elements of the officially supported systems in the USA and Canada.</p>
<p>Changes in the composition of exports and the capital markets determine the Government’s role in export financing</p>
<p>The last ten years or so have witnessed great changes, and these have affected the Government’s role in export financing. These changes primarily affect the composition, organization and orientation of exports and developments in international credit and capital markets.</p>
<p>The share of exports as a percentage of GDP has risen from about 30% in 1987 to about 40% in 1997. However, exports are still dependent on the performance of the large international companies, which operate in a few sectors, in particular capital investment goods and infrastructure. Altogether, the largest companies account for two-thirds of Sweden’s exports. At the same time, as a result of increasing globalization, these companies depend less and less on Sweden as the country of production.</p>
<p>Previously, the smaller companies were normally suppliers to the large established export companies and were thus indirect exporters. The export industry is still the largest customer for small and mediumsized enterprises. But the proportion of direct exports has increased and is estimated now to exceed indirect exports from small and mediumsized enterprises with over 20 employees.</p>
<p>In the last ten years the capital and credit markets have undergone radical changes and also grown substantially in volume. New instruments and new players have emerged, and the existing instruments have been put to new uses. Consequently, it has been possible to tailor financing solutions to both borrowers’ and lenders’ risk profiles and capacities. The capital markets can now finance risks that they could not have financed previously.</p>
<p>As a result of these developments, there are now several ways of financing long-term export operations. Buyers increasingly have direct access to the international capital markets through bond loans, private placements and other instruments. Several alternatives have emerged for long-term export financing. However, the capacity for risk exposure is still a limiting factor.</p>
<p>Traditional export credits still predominate in the financing of projects and plant, as well as of heavy capital goods. In contrast with the previous situation, however, private buyers are now in a majority, and investments in both infrastructure and industry are now made to an</p>
<p>increasing extent under project financing arrangements, often through "project companies" set up by private companies for the purpose.</p>
<p>The shift towards private buyers and to project financing involves new kinds of risks, and this makes it necessary for borrowers and guarantors to make new kinds of risk assessments to meet the new needs.</p>
<p>The project financing model also requires a different kind of input from exporters and financiers. It not only involves arranging finance for purchases of goods and services, as in the case of traditional exports, but often also a supply of equity capital for the investment itself.</p>
<p>Proposals</p>
<p>The Government will continue to play a crucial role in export financing. The export industry is vital to Sweden’s economy and compared with other countries the large export companies are of greater importance for employment and export revenues. My general conclusion is that the Government should, within the framework of international agreements, do all it can to give the export industry the best possible support when it comes to financing the goods and services it produces.</p>
<p>Developments as regards exports and financing conditions will make it necessary for the Government to modify its role continuously. The Government’s reasons for assisting in the provision of credits differ from those relating to guarantees, and developments in the capital markets have accentuated these differences. I therefore propose that the present division of organizational responsibility into risk exposure and credit supply be retained.</p>
<p>The internationalization of export companies and the liberalization of the capital markets etc. have changed the climate in which the Swedish Export Credit Corporation operates. Furthermore, the provision of export credits is no longer a national, but an international activity. As a result, the Corporation encounters increasing competition from banks and other operators that offer long-term credits.</p>
<p>For reasons of industrial policy, the Government should, by owning a substantial share of the Corporation, continue to offer export credits on competitive terms. The export industry has strongly emphasized how important it is that the Corporation should continue to offer longterm financing on the best possible terms. The Government’s partownership of the Corporation helps it to provide export credits on competitive terms even when times are bad. This role should, as is the case today, be fulfilled in such a way as not to put the Corporation’s</p>
<p>high credit rating at risk. In my opinion, the Corporation’s present risk policy as regards export credits should in principle be maintained.</p>
<p>The Corporation’s Board of Directors should therefore decide on the Corporation’s risk exposure within the framework of the adopted credit policy, taking into account the available risk capital.</p>
<p>The ownership of the Corporation, which is divided equally between the Government and the Swedish commercial banks, is a result of the Corporation’s original role as a dominant provider of longterm exportcredits in the days of credit restrictions. In my opinion, as a result of the changes mentioned above and the increasing competition between banks and the Corporation, the present ownership structure cannot be retained. Consequently, the Government will have to resolve the ownership issue with the banks (holders of ’B’ shares).</p>
<p>Negotiations must take place with the shareholders as soon as possible with a view to reaching an agreement on a new ownership structure.</p>
<p>The proposals concerning changes as regards ownership and the administration of the officially supported loans will not affect the Corporation’s operations under its Articles of Association. By and large, its task would therefore continue to be to promote exports of Swedish goods and services and the development of Swedish industry, in particular the export industry.</p>
<p>With respect to officially supported loans, I propose that Sweden, like most other European countries, introduce a system under which the Government would only provide interest compensation and lending would be left to banks. The interest compensation payments should be administered by the Swedish Export Credits Guarantee Board.</p>
<p>Despite the developments of recent years, i.e. greater scope for private sector solutions through banks, credit insurers and capital markets etc., there is still a need of government risk guarantees in the more risky markets. The arrangements under which the Government furnishes guarantees through the Swedish Export Credits Guarantee Board (EKN) should remain basically unchanged. Government risk exposure with respect to export financing should continue to be channelled exclusively through EKN, with the exception of the areas for which the Swedish International Development Authority (Sida) is responsible in its capacity as a guarantor.</p>
<p>In some countries, for example Canada, governments have introduced the possibility, in conjunction with project financing abroad, of furnishing equity capital if this is necessary for the exporter to finalize a project, provided that the other risks are not an obstacle to the granting of an export credit guarantee. In my opinion, Sweden should also introduce this possibility. I therefore propose that EKN, together with</p>
<p>the Swedish Industrial Development Fund, should be instructed to investigate the need for the Government to provide infusions of equity capital for project financing, as well as studying related matters.</p>
<p>Small and medium-sized enterprises that export projects and heavy capital goods do not have the same expertise and contacts with lenders as the largest companies. I therefore propose that EKN be instructed to provide active assistance for medium-sized project exporters and exporters bound by long credit terms to identify and take advantage of suitable financing opportunities.</p>
<p>I propose that EKN, together with the Swedish Trade Council and the Regional Development Corporation (ALMI), be instructed to prepare an information campaign on government schemes that exist to help finance small enterprises’ exports.</p>
<p>ALMI can grant operating credits, or guarantees for bank-financed operating credits, to expanding enterprises. ALMI should be instructed to ensure that small export enterprises are informed and can take advantage of opportunities to obtain operating credits, or guarantees for such credits, in connection with export operations.</p>
<p>The growing presence of private buyers and the shift towards project financing increases the need to be able to assess the credit risks associated with such operations. EKN must have qualified personnel in this area in order to be able to make the necessary risk assessments and execute the new types of business transactions, as well as the resources to hire external specialists. I propose that EKN be authorized to increase its administrative budget for the purpose of hiring qualified personnel in the field of project financing and hiring the specialists needed to deal with individual applications and monitor the risk trends in individual projects.</p>
<p>I propose that EKN acquire in-house environmental assessment skills so that it can evaluate potential credit risks associated with the environmental impact of investments that are the subject of applications for export credit guarantees submitted by export companies.</p>
<p>Of the proposals mentioned above only one, i.e. the introduction of an exclusive interest compensation system, is likely to affect the budget. The main reason for introducing such a system is to give Swedish exporters the same opportunities as those already available to their competitors. The change is also desirable in view of the need for fair competition between lenders.</p>
<p>Given the current loan volume and interest rates and the current system for managing differences in interest rates, the additional cost for a complete interest compensation system would be in the region of SEK 10 – 12 million annually. The additional expense during the first year is estimated at SEK 2 – 3 million. The increase in the budget</p>
<p>appropriation might be reduced if the Government decides on a lower compensation rate than that used in several foreign CIRR-systems. I have considered the question of how the extra cost could be financed and have concluded that it should be possible to cover the increase in costs by a corresponding increase in revenue.</p>
