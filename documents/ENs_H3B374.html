<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has been tasked with considering Sweden’s accession to The Hague Convention of 13 January 2000 on the International Protection of Adults (the 2000 Hague Convention).</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit includes investigating how Swedish law relates to the provisions of the Convention and to shed light on the relationship to other international instruments in the area. The Inquiry is to consider how the Convention should be incorporated into Swedish law and whether Sweden should enter a reservation. The Inquiry is to propose statutory amendments.</p>
<p>The remit also includes proposing the authority to be appointed as the Central Authority in relation to the 2000 Hague Convention and whether certain tasks should be carried out by the Central Authority or by other authorities or bodies.</p>
<p>If, during the course of its work, the Inquiry should conclude that some related matter of private international law ought to be raised, the Inquiry is free to do so.</p>
<h2>Accession to the 2000 Hague Convention</h2>
<p>In today’s globalised society, Sweden needs to offer appropriate protection of adults in cross-border situations. The Inquiry therefore proposes that Sweden accedes to the 2000 Hague Convention, through ratification by the Government, following the Riksdag’s approval of the Convention. The Convention is to be integrated into Swedish law through incorporation, which means that the provisions of the Convention will have the force of law in Sweden. This proposal covers Articles 1–50 of the 2000 Hague Convention, whereas the Inquiry considers that Article 51 should be included in an ordinance with supplementary provisions to the Convention and that the final provisions should not be incorporated.</p>
<p>The provisions in the Convention to be incorporated are to be given priority in relation to other Contracting States. A provision to this effect has been added to the Act concerning Certain International Legal Relationships relating to Marriage and Guardianship (1904:26, p. 1) (the 1904 Act).</p>
<h2>The 2000 Hague Convention and proposed legislative amendments and supplementary provisions Scope</h2>
<p>One of the purposes of the 2000 Hague Convention is to improve protection for adults who, by reason of an impairment or insufficiency of their personal faculties, are not in a position to protect their interests in international situations. To achieve this purpose, the Convention contains provisions regulating which State’s authorities have jurisdiction  to take measures in different situations and provisions on which State’s law  is applicable. The issue of recognition  of measures that have been taken in the other Contracting States is also regulated, as are the conditions for the enforcement  of such measures. The Convention also contains provisions on cooperation  between authorities in different Contracting States.</p>
<p>The 2000 Hague Convention is applicable to measures for the protection of vulnerable persons from 18 years of age. The Convention covers both private law and public law measures of protection. The measures may deal with curatorship, guardianship and analogous institutions as set out in foreign law. The designation of a support or contact person, or a personal assistant also falls within the scope of the Convention. Also included are placements of adults in so-called family homes (foster homes) or in an institutionalised establishment, the placing of an adult under the protection of a judicial or administrative authority, and management of an adult’s property. However, the Convention does not regulate maintenance obligations, the conclusion, annulment and dissolution of marriage, marital property relations, social security, or decisions on the right of asylum and on immigration.</p>
<h2>Jurisdiction under the 2000 Hague Convention</h2>
<p>The 2000 Hague Convention regulates international jurisdiction of authorities in matters of measures of protection of adults. The provisions of the Convention, if the Convention is ratified by Sweden, grant Swedish authorities international jurisdiction when an adult is habitually resident in Sweden  and in relation to adults in Sweden whose habitual residence cannot be established  or who are internationally displaced . The State of habitual residence or, if it is not possible to determine habitual residence, the State of residence can abstain from exercising its jurisdiction in favour of authorities of the Contracting State of which the adult is a national . Further, authorities of the Contracting State in which the property  of an adult is located have jurisdiction to take measures of protection with regard to the property. In addition, the Convention gives Swedish authorities jurisdiction in relation to adults who reside or are present in Sweden (or in relation to the property of adults in Sweden) in urgent cases  or in respect of territorial measures  that only apply in Sweden.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes the introduction of a legal provision on a reserve forum concerning competent social welfare committee in situations where Swedish jurisdiction exists under the 2000 Hague Convention but no social welfare committee has competence under the current Swedish regulatory framework. The Inquiry also proposes that the jurisdictional provisions in Chapter 5, Section 2 and 4 of the 1904 Act be repealed in urgent situations and cases when a foreign national is habitually resident in Sweden. Following accession to the 2000 Hague Convention, situations currently regulated by the above provisions will, namely, be covered by the Convention. The Inquiry considers that no other legislative amendments or supplementary legal provisions are required to enable compliance with the Convention’s provisions on jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The 2000 Hague Convention has an in-built flexibility to enable international jurisdiction to be decided as far as possible with regard to the interests of the adult in each individual case. Under the Convention, it is possible for the authorities of two Contracting States to agree which State’s authorities shall exercise jurisdiction in a specific case on the basis of the interests of the adult. The possibility of ‘transferring’ jurisdiction requires that both states’ authorities agree that doing so is in the interests of the adult. The adult must also have some connection with the State to whose authorities jurisdiction will be transferred.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s assessment is that the right of a Swedish authority to submit a request for transfer of jurisdiction to an authority of another Contracting State and the obligation to receive a corresponding request from an authority in another Contracting State do not require legislative amendments or supplementary provisions. Nor should any special authorities be appointed to which a request of transfer of jurisdiction would be directed. Instead, an authority of another Contracting State should be permitted to direct a request either directly to a competent Swedish authority or to the Central Authority for transmission to the appropriate Swedish authority. The Inquiry also assesses that it is sufficient to prescribe in the form of an ordinance that the Central Authority should immediately transmit to the competent authority any request under the 2000 Hague Convention.</p>
<h2>Applicable law under the 2000 Hague Convention</h2>
<p>The 2000 Hague Convention contains provisions on which State’s law is to apply when a measure is taken for the protection of an adult. It follows of the main rule in the Convention, that Swedish authorities shall primarily apply Swedish law in exercising their jurisdiction  under the provisions of the Convention. However, the law of another State may be taken into account or applied in exceptional cases.</p>
<p>The Convention also contains provisions on the validity of a transaction between the adult’s representative and a third party . This provision gives some protection to a third party acting in good faith in cases where the adult’s representative is competent under the law of the State in which the transaction was concluded but lacks competence under the law designated as the governing law according to the provisions of the chapter on applicable law.</p>
<p>Provisions on applicable law do not constitute an obstacle to applying legal provisions of the State in which the adult is to be protected, when the application of such provisions is mandatory irrespective of the otherwise applicable law ( internationally mandatory provisions ).</p>
<p>If application of the law designated by the 2000 Hague Convention would be manifestly contrary to the Swedish legal order, i.e. would be contrary to public policy , the provisions of that law may be set aside to extent found necessary.</p>
<p>The Convention’s provisions on applicable law do not require any legislative amendments or supplementary provisions in Swedish law.</p>
<h2>Powers of representation granted in advance</h2>
<p>The 2000 Hague Convention covers the issue of applicable law with regard to powers of representation granted in advance by the adult, intended to be exercised when the adult is no longer in a position to protect his or her interests. This means that States which do not have the legal institute of durable powers of representation but have acceded to the Convention may need to give effect to such durable powers of representation under another State’s law. Swedish law does not presently include powers of representation in the meaning of the Convention.</p>
<p>The Convention regulates which State’s law is to apply to the existence, extent, modification and extinction of powers of representation granted by the adult. The adult has some discretion to designate the applicable law in the powers of representation. The competent authorities may also withdraw or modify the stipulated rights to represent the adult.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the district court in the location where the adult is habitually resident be designated as the competent court for matters concerning powers of representation. If the adult is not habitually resident in Sweden, Stockholm District Court is to be the reserve forum. The Court Matters Act (1996:242) is to be applied in the handling of these matters. If powers of representation are in the future introduced in Swedish substantive law, the Inquiry considers that provision should be made for a Swedish competent authority to deal with all situations in which Swedish authorities have international jurisdiction.</p>
<h2>Recognition and enforcement under the 2000 Hague Convention</h2>
<p>As a general rule, a measure taken in a Contracting State pursuant to the provisions of the 2000 Hague Convention is to be recognised  in the other Contracting States. However, in some circumstances a measure need not be recognised. Such a situation exists if, for example, contrary to basic Swedish procedural rules, the measure was taken in the context of a proceeding without the adult having been provided the opportunity of being heard (does not apply to cases of urgency). Another ground for refusing recognition is if the measure is incompatible with a later measure which is recognised in Sweden. The concerned parties can request a Swedish authority to determine in a separate proceeding whether or not the measure is recognised  in Sweden.</p>
<p>If a measure taken in a Contracting State is enforceable in that State, but enforcement is sought in Sweden, the measure shall on request be declared enforceable  in Sweden. The same grounds for refusal that apply for recognition apply, however, and can thus lead to rejection of the application. When a measure has been declared enforceable in Sweden, it shall be enforced as if it had been taken in Sweden according to Swedish law.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes certain supplementary provisions that are to apply in relation to both an application for a measure to be recognised or not recognised and to an application that a measure is to be declared enforceable in Sweden. One of these proposals is that the district court designated by the Government be a competent authority, irrespective of the measure’s classification as a public or private law measure under Swedish rules. However, jurisdiction is to be divided on the basis of whether the measure in full or in part concerns the person or the property of the adult. An application for recognition or declaration of enforceability that in full or in part refers to the adult’s person should be submitted to the district court in the location where the adult is habitually resident. If the adult is not habitually resident in Sweden, the application should be submitted to Stockholm District Court. An application for recognition or declaration of enforceability with regard to an adult’s property should instead be submitted to the district court that examines appeals in debt recovery matters. The district court designated as the competent court in the individual case should in most cases be determined on the basis of the habitual residence of the other party to the person applying for the recognition or declaration of enforcement in Sweden of a foreign measure. If the other party is not habitually resident in Sweden, the application should be submitted to Nacka District Court.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes certain provisions concerning the procedure itself, such as what documents are to be lodged with the district court, and that, as a general rule, the documents must be translated into Swedish. As a decision may contain both rulings that are covered by the scope of the Convention and rulings that are not, the Inquiry proposes that it should be possible for a district court to declare that a decision is only applicable or enforceable in part.</p>
<p>Further, the Inquiry proposes introducing a supplementary legislative provision on enforcement of a foreign measure. Under the proposal, the foreign measure is to be enforced in accordance with Swedish law and the applicable rules of enforcement of a Swedish decision in a corresponding issue.</p>
<h2>Cooperation, the Central Authority and provision of information under the 2000 Hague Convention</h2>
<p>A very important condition for the 2000 Hague Convention to function optimally is good cooperation between the authorities of the Contracting States and provision of information between them. The Convention therefore contains several provisions on this subject.</p>
<p>Under the Convention, Contracting States are to designate a Central Authority. The Central Authority has certain tasks that are to be carried out either by the Central Authority itself or through other authorities or bodies. The provision of information on Swedish legislation, encouragement of mediation, conciliation or similar means to achieve agreed solutions and assistance in discovering the whereabouts of an adult in Sweden are examples of such tasks. The Inquiry has considered which authority should be designated as the Swedish Central Authority and concludes that responsibility for discharging this task should reside with the National Board of Health and Welfare. The Inquiry considers that the tasks of the Central Authority do not require any legislative amendments or supplementary provisions.</p>
<p>The Convention also contains provisions on the communication of data and information between central authorities or other authorities in the Contracting States. These include the possibility for an authority in a Contracting State that is considering measures to request that an authority in another Contracting State communicate relevant information. The Inquiry considers that incoming requests for information should not be centralised at the Central Authority. The view of the Inquiry is that the Swedish authority considering measures should also make the request. When the request comes from a foreign authority, the Swedish authority with relevant information is to be considered competent to handle such a request. If an adult is exposed to serious danger, concerned Swedish authorities are to inform the authorities in another Contracting State where the adult is present about the danger and the measures taken or under consideration.</p>
<p>Information received by the Central Authority may refer to a person’s personal and financial circumstances. Currently, there is no secrecy provision in the Secrecy Act, OSL (1980:100) which would cover the Central Authority under the 2000 Hague Convention. The Inquiry proposes a secrecy provision to cover this information held by the National Board of Health and Welfare in its capacity as Central Authority under the 2000 Hague Convention, if it can be expected that the adult or a close relative to the adult will suffer harm if the information is disclosed.</p>
<p>Information subject to secrecy may not be communicated to a foreign authority unless it is communicated in accordance with a special provision in an act or ordinance, or if it would be permitted to communicate the information to a Swedish authority in a corresponding case, and the authority communicating the information deems that it is clearly compatible with Swedish interests for the information to be communicated to the foreign authority. In light of the Inquiry’s proposal that the Convention be integrated into Swedish law through incorporation, information may be communicated in accordance with the provisions of the Convention. The provisions on the communication of data and information do not require any legislative amendments or supplementary provisions.</p>
<p>Under the Personal Data Act (1998:204), transferring personal data to a State that is not a member of the European Union or part of the European Economic Area (EEA) is prohibited as a general rule if the State does not have an adequate level of personal data protection. However, the Government may issue general regulations prescribing exemptions from the prohibition on transmission of data if required having regard to a major public interest. This could lead to difficulties in applying the cooperation provisions of the 2000 Hague Convention. However, the Inquiry considers that cooperation under the Convention is to be considered of major public interest, and therefore an exemption from the prohibition on transmission of data is justified. Therefore, the Inquiry proposes introducing a legislative provision permitting communication of personal data to a third State, notwithstanding the provisions in the Personal Data Act, if required to enable the authority to consider a necessary measure under the 2000 Hague Convention.</p>
<h2>Placement of adults in another Contracting State</h2>
<p>The 2000 Hague Convention provides a system which enables and facilitates placements of an adult in need of protection  in an establishment or elsewhere in another Contracting State. If an internationally competent authority is contemplating the placement of an adult in another Contracting State, it shall first consult with the Central Authority or other competent authority of the latter State. A report on the adult shall be transmitted together with the reasons for the proposed placement. The decision on the placement may not be made by the requesting State if the competent authority of the requested State indicates its opposition to the measure within a reasonable time. This means that it is up to each individual State to determine the specific conditions for the granting of a consent.</p>
<p>A compulsory care order is in itself an intrusive measure. In light of statements by the Parliamentary Ombudsmen that care under the Care of Young Persons Act cannot be carried out abroad, since the coercive powers and supervision included in care under the Care of Young Persons Act cannot be exercised outside Sweden’s borders, the Inquiry considers that compulsory care in another Contracting State should not be permitted. This means that the only possible placements are those without coercive measures, such as a placement of the adult in Sweden equivalent to residence orders under the Social Services Act (2001:453) and the Act concerning Support and</p>
<p>Service for Persons with Certain Functional Impairments (1993:387), or an order of residence placing the adult in another Contracting State under these laws.</p>
<p>The municipality in Sweden where the adult is proposed to receive residence is to be deemed a competent authority for examining a request for acceptance of a placement of an adult in Sweden, with regard to placements equivalent to those under the Act concerning Support and Service for Persons with Certain Functional Impairments. A municipal committee in charge of social services (social welfare committee) within the municipality where the adult is proposed to receive residence is to be considered a competent authority with regard to examination of other requests such as placements equivalent to residence under the Social Services Act. The social welfare committee is also to be deemed competent to examine a foreign request for forced care in Sweden. Taking into account that Inquiry’s position that forced care in another Contracting State should not be permitted under Swedish law, such requests are only to be examined by way of the committee opposing placement.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that certain conditions should be fulfilled for a social welfare committee and a municipality to accept a placement in Sweden and to decide on a placement in another Contracting State. One such condition is that the placement is in the adult’s interest, in particular considering the adult’s connection to the State where he or she is proposed to be placed, and that the adult does not object to the placement. Another condition for placement in Sweden is that the conditions in other respects too are met under the Social Services Act and the Act concerning Support and Service for Persons with Certain Functional Impairments. It follows of these other conditions that the Contracting State where the adult is contemplated to be placed must have satisfactory arrangements with regard to supervision and that the committee and the municipality, where it is deemed necessary, through an agreement with the competent authority in the State where the adult is to be placed, have the right to monitor the placement.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has considered, but not found objective justification for introducing, a provision which would provide an adult with a residence permit in Sweden solely on the grounds of placement for care in Sweden under the 2000 Hague Convention. Moreover, such a provision would mean that adults covered by the Convention would be given greater possibility than other adults to be granted a residence permit in Sweden. For this reason, the Inquiry assesses that special provisions with regard to residence permits for adults who are proposed to be placed in Sweden should not be introduced.</p>
<h2>Relationship to other international instruments and to autonomous law</h2>
<p>Sweden’s current private international law concerning protection of adults is a combination of provisions resulting from international agreements and applicable only in relation to the other Contracting States, and autonomous law without a corresponding treaty obligation.</p>
<p>The general rule is that application of other international agreements is not affected by the 2000 Hague Convention. However, in the event of Swedish accession to the 2000 Hague Convention, inter-Nordic rules – rules that are based on inter-governmental cooperation between the Nordic states – will take precedence over the Convention. But its provisions should take precedence over autonomous Swedish law as expressed in the 1904 Act, containing the generally applicable provisions that apply where no conventionbased legislation is applicable. This relationship is reflected in the legislation proposed by the Inquiry.</p>
<h2>General provisions and final clauses of the 2000 Hague</h2>
<h2>Convention</h2>
<p>The 2000 Hague Convention also contains provisions of an administrative nature and provisions referring to States rather than to the individual person or entity applying the Convention.</p>
<p>Under the Convention, authorities in the Contracting State where a measure of protection has been taken or where powers of representation granted by an adult have been confirmed may issue a certificate . Such a certificate can indicate in which capacity a person entrusted with the protection relating to the adult’s person or property is entitled to act, and the powers conferred. The Inquiry considers that it should be prescribed by ordinance that the district court where powers of representation granted by the adult have been confirmed should be designated to issue certificates. A certificate for the Swedish protective measures corresponding most closely to curatorship ( godmanskap ) and guardianship ( förvaltarskap ) is issued by the chief guardian, and no supplementary provisions are required for this.</p>
<p>The Convention also contains provisions on the treatment of personal data and on confidentiality . Treatment of personal data conforms with the Personal Data Act and requires neither legislative amendments nor supplementary provisions. Under the provision on confidentiality, Swedish authorities are to ensure the confidentiality of information they receive in accordance with Swedish law. The Inquiry proposes the introduction of a provision in the Secrecy Act under which confidentiality is to apply for information held by a general court regarding an adult’s personal or financial circumstances in cases or matters under the 2000 Hague Convention, where it appears that the adult or a person close to the adult will suffer harm if the information is disclosed. With regard to information held by an administrative court, confidentiality is to apply to an adult’s personal circumstances in cases or matters under the 2000 Hague Convention unless it is clear that the information can be disclosed without the adult or a person close to the adult suffering harm.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Inquiry considers that it should be prescribed by ordinance that unless written in Swedish, requests and communication to the Swedish Central Authority or other authorities are to be accompanied by a translation  into Swedish or, where that is not feasible, a translation into English.</p>
<p>The Convention provides for the option of a reservation  with regard to language and allows Sweden to object to the use of either French or English, in communications with Swedish authorities. The Inquiry proposes that the possibility of entering a reservation against French be used.</p>
<h2>Autonomous law Basic premises</h2>
<p>The 2000 Hague Convention does not claim to exclusively regulate issues concerning cross-border protection of adults in the Contracting States. On the contrary, the Convention opens the way for entering into other conventions and leaves scope for States’ autonomous provisions, in other words in Sweden applicable provisions that are not convention-related or a result of intergovernmental cooperation. The autonomous provisions will be subsidiary in relation to legislation based on international cooperation.</p>
<p>Autonomous provisions may deviate in content from conventionrelated legislation. However, in case of conformity, the entire regulatory system is more transparent and comprehensible. Also, Swedish decisions are recognised and enforced in the other States that have acceded to the 2000 Hague Convention if the Swedish autonomous provisions are in line with those of the 2000 Hague Convention. The Inquiry has therefore chosen to conduct a review of Swedish autonomous provisions, with inspiration drawn from the Convention rules.</p>
<p>Autonomous private international law provisions with regard to curatorship and guardianship are found in Chapter 5 of the 1904 Act. However, under Swedish law there is no corresponding explicit regulation of public law measures of protection of adults in situations with a foreign connection. No need has emerged to introduce such provisions on the public law aspect of protection of adults and the Inquiry does not present any proposals in this respect.</p>
<h2>Revision of Chapter 5 of the 1904 Act</h2>
<p>Where inter-Nordic rules are not applicable, the 2000 Hague Convention, as a general rule, gives Swedish authorities international jurisdiction in cases where the adult is habitually resident in Sweden as well as in urgent cases with connection to Sweden. The revised autonomous provisions on jurisdiction proposed by the Inquiry in respect of the 1904 Act can be viewed as a supplement to the jurisdictional provisions in the 2000 Hague Convention and thus apply unless otherwise provided by an inter-Nordic regulation or the Convention.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes the introduction of a new jurisdiction provision  in Chapter 5 of the 1904 Act, guided by the principle of habitual residence  in the same way as the 2000 Hague Convention. The provision is to be applied when convention-based legislation is not applicable. Under the new provision, Swedish courts are to have jurisdiction with regard to matters of curatorship, guardianship or termination of a decision by another State to place under guardianship an adult who is a Swedish national with habitual residence or, if it is not possible to determine habitual residence, residence in another State. A fundamental prerequisite for Swedish jurisdiction is that taking a measure of protection is in the interest of the adult. Jurisdiction also requires that the authorities of the adult’s State of habitual residence (or State of residence, if the adult’s state of habitual residence cannot be established) do not consider that they have jurisdiction or in other cases where there are special reasons. Furthermore, a Swedish court should have jurisdiction to raise the issue of extinction of curatorship or guardianship arranged in Sweden on behalf of a foreign national if a corresponding protection measure has subsequently been taken in another State.</p>
<p>A new provision in Chapter 5 of the 1904 Act is also proposed concerning applicable law. When a Swedish court, under the same chapter, has international jurisdiction to examine a matter of curatorship or guardianship, the Inquiry proposes that Swedish law should apply . When a matter concerning the termination of a decision by another State to place an adult under guardianship is examined in a Swedish court under Chapter 5 of the 1904 Act, provisions on extinction of guardianship in Chapter 11 of the Children and Parents Code are to be applied. To the extent required for the protection of the adult’s person or property, the law of another State to which the adult’s situation has a substantial connection may be taken into account.</p>
<p>Currently, Chapter 5 of the 1904 Act contains no explicit provision on recognition. To avoid the trouble and costs which procuring a new measure in Sweden would entail for an adult, provisions need to be introduced on recognition of measures taken in another State. Another reason for introducing such provisions is that a measure corresponding to the Swedish equivalent of curatorship and guardianship implies restricting the adult’s legal capacity and thus the adult should be able to obtain a ruling on whether the foreign measures are recognised or not. Against this backdrop, the Inquiry considers that provisions should be introduced on what should apply with regard to recognition of foreign measures . Therefore, the Inquiry proposes that a measure corresponding to curatorship or guardianship taken in another State in the context of a judicial or administrative proceeding should be applicable in Sweden. However, recognition of the measure may be refused if: – the foreign authority that took the measure did not base its jurisdiction on the adult’s habitual residence, or on the adult’s place of residence when the adult’s state of habitual residence could not be established, or if there were no reasonable grounds to examine the application in that state; – the measure was taken in a  non-urgent case without the adult having been provided the opportunity to be heard, contrary to basic Swedish procedural rules; – the measure is incompatible with a corresponding measure taken later in Sweden, or – the measure is incompatible with a corresponding measure taken later in another State that meets the requirements of recognition in Sweden.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s view, the current provision on public policy in Chapter 7 in the 1904 Act can be applied to refuse recognition of a measure which is manifestly incompatible with the basic principles of the Swedish legal order.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that a concerned party may request that the district court designated by the Government decide on the recognition or non-recognition of a measure corresponding to curatorship or guardianship taken in another State. A provision in an ordinance should prescribe that application for recognition or non-recognition is to be submitted to the district court in the location where the adult is habitually resident. If the adult is not habitually resident in Sweden, Stockholm District Court is to be the reserve forum. The procedure proposed by the Inquiry for an application for recognition or non-recognition under the 2000</p>
<p>Hague Convention is to be applied when examining recognition or non-recognition under the 1904 Act.</p>
<p>Further, the Inquiry proposes that current provisions in Chapter 5, Sections 1, 3 and 8 cease to apply and that Sections 5–7 should be moved within Chapter 5 and be given a more modern drafting. However, it should be noted that parts of Chapter 5, Sections 1 and 3 have been included in the proposals for the new rules on jurisdiction and applicable law, but that the provisions have been changed to conform with the principle of habitual residence.</p>
<h2>Making placement orders of adults in another Contracting State generally applicable</h2>
<p>To date, cross-border initiatives for the protection of adults have been few. In the Inquiry’s view, there is little to indicate that, at least in the coming years, such initiatives will increase in number. Therefore, the Inquiry sees no need to propose rules corresponding to the Convention’s rules on placement orders of adults in another Contracting State, to apply generally in international relations. In this respect, no autonomous private international law provisions should be introduced.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions</h2>
<p>Since the date of entry into force of the Inquiry’s legislative proposals depends on the date of Sweden’s accession to the Convention, the Inquiry proposes that it be left to the Government to decide when the act incorporating the Convention and the supplementary provisions should enter into force. In the Inquiry’s view, the same date should apply to all the other legislative proposals due to their connection to the Convention.</p>
<p>The 2000 Hague Convention contains transitional provisions. It is proposed that these are also given the force of law, which means that the provisions of the Convention will apply to measures taken after the Convention has entered into force in Sweden. With respect to recognition and enforcement, the provisions of the Convention are to apply concerning measures taken after the entry into force of the Convention between the two States involved, i.e. the</p>
<p>State where the decision on the measure was taken and the State – in our case Sweden – where recognition and enforcement of the measure are involved. Under the Convention, powers of representation issued before the Convention enters into force are not to be considered invalid if the powers of representation were granted by the adult on grounds that are comparable to those set out in the Convention.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes the introduction of transitional provisions to the legislative amendments in the 1904 Act. The Act should be applicable to cases lodged after the Act enters into force. This means that a competent authority under the previously applicable provisions does not lose its competence to assess the case as a result of the new provisions. Also, cases lodged before the Act enters into force are to be examined under previous provisions. The provisions on recognition of measures decided on by another State are not to be applied to measures decided on before the Act comes into force.</p>
<p>No further transitional provisions are required.</p>
