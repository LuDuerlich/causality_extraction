<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Church of Sweden has a large amount of property at its disposal. This not only takes the form of churches and vicarages, for example, but also land and forests whose yield is to be used in some way to benefit the work of the Church. Sales of land and forests have given rise to funds that are administered to provide revenue for this work. These are merely a few examples of the different forms of property that the Church has at its disposal.</p>
<p>The National Judicial Board for Public Lands and Funds has made a general survey of Church property and this information is presented in various ways in the first section of this report.</p>
<p>Some of this property is owned in the normal way by the Church, i.e. the church has gained legal title to the property according to the usual regulations. Where much of the property is concerned, however, the situation is somewhat more complicated. For many forms of property there are provisions in laws and other statutes prescribing what it may be used for, how it is to be administered, etc. Often such property is not owned by the Church in the normal way, but the title has devolved to charitable foundations, the majority of them antiquated and with no firm basis in modern legal principles. This latter circumstance has not hitherto been of great importance, as the property has itself been subject to legal provisions.</p>
<p>Some of the property consists of what are known as royal benefactions, in other words property that during the course of history has been granted to the Church and ecclesiastical activities. It is not considered that the Church has been granted disposal of this form of property with the same kind of title as that conferred by ownership today.</p>
<p>In the second section of the report, the National Judicial Board for Public Lands and Funds has attempted to present a concise description, based on the findings of other scrutinies during the past century, of the origin of Church property subject to special regulations. One important outcome of the survey is that certain circumstances are now so unclear that there is no longer much point in attempting to clarify them within the scope of a normal investigation. This applies to questions such as the composition of the local ecclesiastical foundations and which items of property derive from royal benefactions.</p>
<p>The most important starting point for the remainder of our work has been that all of this property should remain at the disposal of the Church when the relationship between Church and state is to be changed in</p>
<p>accordance with the principle laid down by the decision of 1995. In our work we have concentrated on the task of analysing what will happen to this property on disestablishment and proposing suitable means of ensuring the Church’s continued disposal of this property.</p>
<p>The initial result of our work is the observation that all reasonable solutions require that the question of title to this property should be dealt with in conjunction with disestablishment.</p>
<p>With this as our starting point, we have proposed that the state should renounce all future claims to royal benefactions. In our opinion, today these have in reality no value for the state.</p>
<p>In addition, we have proposed that title to some of the property of the local foundations should be transferred from the foundations to their parishes. This applies to the older churches and cathedrals and to the real estate and real estate funds of the parish churches and cathedrals. One of the results of this transfer will be to remove any future need of different regulations for older and more modern churches. Similarly, we have proposed that vicarages should be transferred from the foundations that own them to the parish or group of parishes they serve. We have made a corresponding proposal that Bishop’s palaces that are not diocesan property or the property of the Ecclesiastical Fund should be transferred to their dioceses.</p>
<p>Finally, with regard to the ownership of real estate belonging to the Ecclesiastical Fund and that portion of the Ecclesiastical Fund that will remain when the state’s obligation to provide clerical pensions has been appropriately resolved, our proposal is that this should be transferred to the disestablished Swedish Church.</p>
<p>We have proposed an exceptional right to compensation for those who incur loss from the transfers that we have suggested, but it is our assumption that this will not have any significant implications in practice.</p>
<p>With the proposals listed here, we believe that we have attained the objective of removing any real obstacle that could prevent the Swedish Church from being able to take responsibility itself for its activities and organisation after disestablishment. We also consider that the legal situation will in this way be made simpler and clearer.</p>
<p>When it comes to the continued disposal by the Church of the real estate and funds now administered to provide clerical salaries – which constitute the real wealth of the Church in land, forests and funds – three alternatives are discussed. The first of these is the foundation alternative, which would involve using all this property to endow a foundation that would in future be subject to provisions of the Act on Foundations. Another alternative would be transfer of the entire financial holding to the direct ownership of the disestablished Swedish Church. The third alternative would be to allow the</p>
<p>Swedish Church to administer the property by virtue of continued legislation in the Act on the Swedish Church.</p>
<p>Our opinion is that each of these three alternatives is satisfactory. However, they have different features and different advantages. We have decided to recommend the legislation alternative.</p>
<p>Much of the property subject to special regulations today is dedicated to very specific purposes. We have analysed how these will be affected by disestablishment and submitted a proposal about which purposes should also be stipulated for the future and which should be described as applying on disestablishment but capable of modification either by transmutation or, to some extent, by the decision of the Church itself.</p>
<p>We have proposed certain transitional regulations to apply to parochial council property and the property of the free foundations and associations.</p>
<p>In addition to our brief concerning ecclesiastical property, we have also looked at two time-hallowed legal institutions, tenant right (åborätt) and onus (landgille), the latter as it relates to ecclesiastical property. We propose that both of these institutions should be terminated by judicial means.</p>
<p>Our proposal is commented on in summary in Section 18.</p>
