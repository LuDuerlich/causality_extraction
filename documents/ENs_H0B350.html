<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit of the Inquiry</h2>
<p>An Inquiry Chair is to consider the possible introduction of a system of tax relief for companies in urban areas where exclusion is widespread; these areas are referred to as ‘new start zones’. Under the terms of reference, this measure is intended to create jobs and increase employment in areas where the employment rate is considerably below the national average. More start-up companies and better conditions for enterprises to grow are additional aims.</p>
<p>The Inquiry is also tasked with identifying and analysing the advantages and disadvantages of a new start zones scheme. The proposal is to include rules for delimitation of new start zones, rules about the criteria companies should be required to meet in these zones and about the forms and amount of tax relief to be provided.</p>
<p>The terms of reference also emphasise that the compatibility of the new start zones scheme and the rules of free movement and state aid in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) is of special importance. In addition, the new start zone scheme should be sustainable and defensible from an EU perspective.</p>
<p>The socio-economic consequences, such as effects on employment and competition within and outside the new start zones, are to be analysed. The administrative impact on government agencies and companies are also to be reported, as is the impact on those affected by the proposal. Furthermore, any public finance implications are to be analysed and proposals for funding must be drawn up.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>There are various, but often similar, definitions of what constitutes exclusion. Whatever the definition, exclusion is often concentrated in certain areas or neighbourhoods. This does not mean that segregation and exclusion are only urban problems. Urban development efforts, which aim to “find forms of coordination and collaboration for the long-term reform work in neighbourhoods with widespread exclusion”, apply to areas in small, medium and large cities.</p>
<p>There are many reasons some areas are harder hit by exclusion than others. One reason could be that those who manage to enter the labour market choose to move away from these areas when they can afford to as a result of higher incomes. Thus those who remain in the area are those who have not yet overcome exclusion, while those moving into the area may primarily be people also suffering exclusion.</p>
<p>Although ethnicity or immigrant background are not part of the definition of exclusion, neighbourhoods with widespread exclusion are often associated with a high proportion of immigrants among the residents. One reason for this is the lack of integration in the labour market; foreign-born people have greater difficulty entering the labour market and also a weaker position in this market.</p>
<p>Labour market integration is one of the areas identified as particularly important to improve in order to achieve the objectives of the Swedish integration policy. To enable these objectives to be met, immigrants must be given the opportunity to establish themselves in the labour market. At present, there are clear signs that many foreign-born people have great difficulty doing so.</p>
<p>A low employment rate for foreign-born people is a major social problem for several reasons. Firstly, it represents a welfare loss for the individuals concerned, who are not given the opportunity to participate fully in society. Secondly, society misses out on the production that these people could contribute. This is especially serious given the challenges posed by an ageing population. Thirdly, high benefits dependency leads to substantial direct costs to society in the form of benefit payments and loss of tax revenues.</p>
<p>On the other hand, foreign-born people are one of the few groups where there is a potential for increased employment, which could meet the increasing dependency ratio predicted for the coming decades. Projections indicate that while the dependency ratio resulting from the part of the population that is too young to work is shrinking, the elderly dependency ratio is rising to such an extent that the total dependency ratio will rise relatively sharply over the next few years.</p>
<p>It is therefore important, both for the individuals concerned and for society as a whole, that integration of foreign-born people is improved to enable those who want to work to do so.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>In the view of the Inquiry, a new start zones scheme should be introduced.</p>
<p>The Inquiry assesses that the objectives stated in its terms of reference can best be achieved by implementing the key measure involving relief on social insurance contributions for companies in new start zones. Full tax relief will apply for five years, after which time fifty per cent relief will be given.</p>
<h2>Areas that may constitute new start zones</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the areas that may be considered as possible new start zones should be based on the existing division into ‘SAMS’ areas. These areas were defined more than twenty years ago to identify homogeneous areas and are therefore appropriate as a basis for identifying areas with widespread exclusion. In many cases, however, SAMS areas are too small to constitute appropriate new start zones and therefore need to be grouped together to form larger areas. The Inquiry proposes that areas with few inhabitants be grouped together to create areas of at least 4 000 people.</p>
<p>When areas of an appropriate size have been created, it will be decided which of these qualify as new start zones. The criteria for selecting new start zones must be objective and identify exclusion. The Inquiry therefore proposes that, for the part of the population aged 20–64 years, limit values be set for the employment rate, the proportion of the population receiving long-term income support, and the proportion of the population without an upper secondary school certificate. These values should be set so that only three per cent of all the areas have values that are poorer than each limit value. However, to be defined as a new start zone, an area must meet the criteria for all three limit values. The exact level for each limit value should be based on the latest available statistics. To illustrate the proposed system, the Inquiry has proposed levels of criteria using 2009 statistics.</p>
<p>Thus, under the Inquiry’s proposals, a new start zone will consist of one or more SAMS areas that together have 4 000 or more inhabitants and where the following (when using 2009 statistics) applies to the part of the population aged 20–64 years: - The employment rate is below 44.5 per cent. - The proportion receiving  long-term income support exceeds 6.8 per cent. - The proportion without an upper secondary school certificate or equivalent exceeds 31.3 per cent.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the Inquiry does not propose which areas should be defined as new start zones; instead, it illustrates the application of the proposal by indicating which areas would have been relevant as new start zones if the criteria were set using 2009 statistics. The example illustration comprises areas with a total of almost 138 000 inhabitants, which corresponds to roughly 1.5 per cent of Sweden’s population.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the criteria for selecting new start zones be defined by law and that decisions on the geographical limits of the new start zones, pursuant to law, be taken by the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth every five years.</p>
<h2>Companies covered by the scheme</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that all employers meeting its proposed criteria be covered by the new start zones scheme, regardless of legal form. This includes self-employed people and natural persons who are part-owners of partnerships and who are required to pay individual contributions on income from business activities liable to charges. Existing companies, businesses that move into new start zones and start-ups should be covered on equal terms.</p>
<p>A certain restriction is proposed, as only companies defined under EU law as micro or small businesses should be covered. Large companies are excluded from the system, as are activities relating to agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture. Other activities may need to be excluded after consultation with the European Commission (the Commission).</p>
<h2>Conditions for companies to obtain relief</h2>
<p>To obtain relief, a company must meet two conditions. - Operations condition: A company must operate at a fixed establishment in a new start zone or at a location in a new start zone corresponding to a fixed establishment. - Residence condition: At least a quarter of the time worked in the company must be by staff who are registered as residents at an address in a new start zone.</p>
<p>A company that does not meet the residence condition but did so less than six months earlier should be considered to meet the requirements. However, the right to relief when the residence condition is not met will apply at most for a period equal to the longest period during which the condition was fulfilled and which ended at most six months earlier.</p>
<h2>Details of relief for social insurance contributions</h2>
<p>Since the link between the old-age pension contribution and oldage pension benefits is to be preserved, companies must not be exempt from paying old-age pension contributions. The support provided by the new start zones scheme should therefore consist of full relief from general salary contributions and full relief from social insurance contributions except the old-age pension contribution.</p>
<p>Support that is intended to reduce the beneficiaries’ normal running costs and that is provided for an unlimited period is considered by the Commission as operating aid and may only be granted as ‘de minimis’ aid. The relief provided by the new start zones scheme will be too large to qualify as such aid. The Inquiry’s terms of reference also state that the purpose of the new start zones is to provide support that allows companies to establish themselves and grow. Whenever possible, the new start zones scheme should be prevented from directly subsidising unprofitable businesses and thereby obstructing necessary structural change.</p>
<p>In view of this, the Inquiry believes that support offered to the new start zones scheme must be clearly limited in time. At the same time, it is important that a new start zones scheme be sufficiently attractive to encourage businesses to establish themselves and hire new staff in new start zones and enable existing businesses to grow. An all-too-brief period of relief risks discouraging this. The inquiry assesses that full relief should be given for five years, after which time relief should be phased out over a two-year period at fifty per cent.</p>
<p>An unlimited exemption from social insurance contributions could amount to substantial sums and result in significant costs to the state. It may also be considered ineffective to give tax relief to companies paying high wages. Monthly relief should therefore be limited. For employers, the limitation refers to an amount that for each employee corresponds to no more than the employers’ social insurance contributions and the general salary contribution payable on a gross salary of a half income base amount per month. For selfemployed persons and physical persons who are part-owners of partnerships, it should be limited to an amount that corresponds to no more than self-employed social insurance contributions and the general salary contribution payable on a gross salary of six income base amounts per year.</p>
<p>Relief should be given to employers for employees who work at a fixed establishment in a new start zone and for self-employed persons and physical persons who are partners in partnerships for incomes that are attributable to a fixed establishment in a new start zone. The Inquiry assesses that of the alternatives it has considered, this one would have the greatest impact on employment in new start zones and at the same time keep costs at a reasonable level.</p>
<p>There are several ways to design entitlement to relief from social insurance contributions. The Inquiry has considered three methods: credits, reductions and deductions. Of these, a deduction on social insurance contributions for operations in new start zones is assessed as being the most appropriate.</p>
<h2>Conditions for a new start zones scheme</h2>
<p>Under the proposed scheme, companies in new start zones are granted tax advantages relative to companies in other areas. However, in the Inquiry’s assessment, such a scheme nevertheless meets the requirement that the Swedish Constitution sets out for generally applicable laws. Even if the regulation did not meet this requirement, it should be considered as covered by the exemption to the requirement of generality established in constitutional practice. Since the regulation is based on objective criteria and includes all the companies that meet these criteria, the proposed legislation is deemed not to violate the constitutional requirements of equal treatment and the principle of uniformity established in taxation law.</p>
<p>Provided that the right to relief under a new start zones scheme is not dependent on companies being domestic companies, the proposed scheme is not considered to be contrary to the rules on equal treatment and freedom of movement laid down in the TFEU.</p>
<p>As the proposed system means that some companies are given special exemption from the general tax treatment, this support is subject to the rules on state aid. Under these provisions, support of this kind, in principle, may not be considered compatible with the internal market. The Inquiry assesses that the support in question does not fall into any of the categories of aid that via Commission regulations have been considered possible to exempt from the state aid procedure. The Inquiry therefore considers that Sweden must notify the Commission regarding the support and may not implement the measure before the Commission has issued an opinion on the matter.</p>
<p>For the Commission to consider that the new start zones scheme can be exempted from state aid rules, the scheme would probably need to be developed on the basis of the requirements contained in the Commission’s decision regarding the previously exempt systems in France and Italy.</p>
<h2>Administration and coordination of the relief measure</h2>
<p>The deduction for operations in new start zones should be administered by the Swedish Tax Agency. Responsibility for monitoring that companies meet the requirements should be part of the</p>
<p>Swedish Tax Agency’s regular auditing operations. The rules in the</p>
<p>Tax Procedures Act (2011:1244) will apply to decisions regarding the proposed deduction.</p>
<p>Combined with existing forms of support, the deduction for operations in new start zones, in a few special cases, may lead to negative wage costs at individual level. This would be the case when combined with special employment support and wage subsidies, i.e. individual support to individuals deemed to be in particularly great need of an employment opportunity. Avoiding incurring negative wage costs, as far as possible, must certainly be considered important. However, the Inquiry considers it even more important that the effects of support to individuals with particularly weak attachment to the labour market are not limited. Therefore, the deduction proposed by the Inquiry should not be allowed to affect labour market support that is based on contributions under the Social Insurance Contributions Act (2000:980).</p>
<h2>Other aspects of the proposal</h2>
<p>Tax relief for companies alone is not sufficient to overcome problems in areas where exclusion is widespread, and additional measures should therefore be considered. In the first instance, measures to improve labour market matching should be considered. The Inquiry believes that if evaluations show that the new start offices and job coach schemes are effective, intensifying these efforts in new start zones should be considered.</p>
<p>As a complementary measure, the Inquiry proposes that people living in a new start zone should not need to be unemployed or at risk of unemployment to be entitled to receive support for starting a business. This exemption, which already applies to residents in certain support areas, is expected to help increase entrepreneurship among residents of the new start zones. Support that may be given under this proposal must be monitored in accordance with the provisions on state aid.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers it important that the new start zones scheme be evaluated and proposes that this evaluation be conducted by the Swedish Agency for Growth Policy Analysis, which should also be responsible for the annual progress reports on the new start zones. These reports will likely be a requirement imposed by the Commission.</p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>The proposed deduction for operations in new start zones gives companies meeting all the proposed criteria and located in a new start zone reduced labour costs. Companies are expected to face certain cost increases as a result of the increased administrative burden arising from the deduction. This increase is expected to be greatest in the initial stage and then decline.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the reduction in labour costs will lead to an increased demand for labour, which in turn may lead to increased employment in new start zones. The size of this increase will depend in part on how much of the cost savings goes to wage increases. If a large portion of the cost savings goes to wage increases, the demand for labour will increase to a lesser extent, as the actual cost savings will be smaller. However, the Inquiry considers that the impact on wage levels will be very limited.</p>
<p>In addition, the Inquiry believes that the proposal may also increase the likelihood of new businesses starting up in the new start zones and of businesses moving into the new start zones from surrounding areas. These consequences are also expected to contribute to increased employment in new start zones, but with negative effects in the surrounding areas if businesses choose to relocate their existing operations to a new start zone.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s assessment, the proposed new start zones scheme will lead to some distortion of competition. This is because the companies receiving the deduction will gain cost advantages over competitors who do not receive the deduction. These effects are expected to be greatest at local level, in the new start zones or in nearby areas.</p>
<p>The Inquiry estimates that the statically calculated public finance effect of the introduction of the proposal is a net tax loss of SEK 112 million in 2014. The Inquiry proposes that this be financed by raising the general salary contribution by 0.01 percentage point. This financing is also expected to cover increased costs as a result of the proposal on support for starting a business.</p>
<p>As stated above, the main purpose of the proposal on new start zones is to increase employment and business start-ups in the relevant areas. Reduced dependence on benefits and increased tax revenues from the new or expanded operations and their employees can be expected to have a positive impact on public finances in the longer term.</p>
