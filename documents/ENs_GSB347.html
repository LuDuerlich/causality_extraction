<p>The Mandate:</p>
<p>Confidence in Business – Dialogue, Analysis and Proposals</p>
<p>The Swedish Commission on Business Confidence (Förtroendekommissionen) was established by a government resolution of September 5, 2002 to conduct an inquiry into the impairment of confidence in the Swedish business sector. The Commission proposes measures to improve the conditions for business to build up public confidence.</p>
<p>Included in the Commission’s mandate was the establishment of a dialogue with business owners and representatives. The Commission’s work therefore began with a web council, and a Reference Group has submitted comments on the work on an ongoing basis. The Commission, together with business organisations, has set up the ”Code Group”, which has drawn up the proposed Swedish Code of Corporate Governance (SOU2004:46).</p>
<p>Material has also been gathered in interviews, conferences, and meetings in Sweden, Great Britain, and the United States and from information from Swedish embassies, books, papers and articles, together with a number of specially commissioned supporting reports. Most of the supporting reports have been published in a supplement to the main report. An overview of the standards and the standard setting bodies relevant to the Commission’s work can be found in an appendix to the report.</p>
<p>Business Confidence Has Great Economic Value</p>
<p>An introductory survey of the research reveals that the social sciences differentiate between real capital, human capital and social capital. Social capital is based on the confidence established among members of society. Confidence is defined as ”the expectation respecting other members of a community that comes into being when this community is characterised by consistent, honest and co-operative behaviour based on generally accepted norms”. Social capital ”is a capability that results from the existence of confidence in a society or some part of it”.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why confidence is the basis for social capital. The concept ”the social trap” describes a situation in which all those who want to honour the agreements that they have entered into, pay their taxes and so forth, gradually begin to suspect that many others - or indeed everyone else - in the system is not doing so and therefore they themselves begin to break the rules of the game. Another supporting factor is comprised of more culturally determined but slow changes and seems to vary with the degree of corruption in a society.</p>
<p>There are no exact estimates of the value of confidence or of social capital but it is estimated that increased transaction costs owing to a lack of confidence could amount to 10 per cent or more of gross domestic product. The Commission therefore notes that public confidence is an important condition for prosperity and growth. Confidence is thus a matter of concern to society at large, not just to individual groups or institutions that on various occasions encounter wavering confidence.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Lack of Confidence in the Business Sector</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been a large number of business scandals in the United States and Europe that have revealed accounting fraud, economic crimes and excessive remuneration. The United States has resorted to stiffer legislation (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and regulation (the Spitzer rules). In Europe, corporate governance codes have been developed in Great Britain, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Finland, Germany, Denmark, Norway and Spain and other countries. Developments in Sweden should be seen in the light of deregulated markets, internationalisation, increased indirect share ownership by households, the media’s increased reporting of business matters and the stock exchange bubble of 1997 to 2002.</p>
<p>Public confidence in large companies has fallen sharply in the past ten years, while confidence in banks has partially recovered after the banking crisis in the early 1990s. Swedish studies analysed by the Commission revealed the following:</p>
<p>• In a grading of confidence in institutions, large companies received a very low ranking, along with  trade-unions, political parties, the European Parliament and the EU Commission;</p>
<p>• With respect to the institutions in society on which those questioned relied, ”your bank” topped the list immediately above ”the party you voted for”. The business community was generally ranked in the middle. The Government placed in the middle of the lower half of the table and the mass media at the bottom;</p>
<p>• With respect to confidence in occupational groups, business people and merchants were highly ranked. They were followed by financial advisors in banks and bank managers and immediately under them were the heads of large businesses. Further down in the rankings were the heads of construction companies, stateand  municipally-owned enterprises, and insurance companies. At the bottom of the list were managers of investment funds and stockbrokers.</p>
<p>In an international comparison of public confidence in large companies, Sweden does well. In Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index, Sweden is considered to be one of the world’s least corrupt countries.</p>
<p>The events that have especially influenced the public’s confidence in business in Sweden are:</p>
<p>• Deficiencies in salary and benefits systems. From 1997 to 2002, the salaries of managing directors increased by 70 per cent at the same time that the wages of industrial workers rose 16 per cent and the Stockholm Stock Exchange fell 16 per cent;</p>
<p>• Poor control over companies and mismanagement of their business activities. During this period, some of the largest companies listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange have found themselves in serious economic difficulties.</p>
<p>In addition the following factors are considered to have affected confidence in the business sector:</p>
<p>• Too narrow a recruiting base for boards of directors. Informal recruiting systems are most important in deciding who is recruited; these systems reinforce the general tendency of homogeneous business leaders to choose directors who are leaders like themselves;</p>
<p>• Brokers and financial analysts’ lack of integrity. Conflicts of interest and risks of conflicts of interest are common at the same time that there is little outside knowledge about business activities and a ”culture of silence” is typical of the sector;</p>
<p>• Economic crimes. Accounting fraud and other economic crimes have an especially serious impact on public confidence.</p>
<p>According to the SOM Institute, it is the conduct of companies, not the media’s portrayal of events, that has led to the loss of confidence in large businesses. However, representatives of the business community interviewed maintain that the portrayal of a crisis of confidence in the business sector is superficial. They generally share the above view, with the addendum that inadequate oversight and fighting fraud play an important role. According to those interviewed, openness is the crucial factor in avoiding behaviour that damages confidence and in strengthening trust.</p>
<p>Strategies for Strengthening Confidence in the Business Sector</p>
<p>The Commission finds that there is no general crisis of confidence in the Swedish business sector. On the contrary, confidence that business is acting in the best interest of society seems to be higher in Sweden than in many other countries.</p>
<p>However, in recent years there have been a considerable number of events that have shaken confidence in parts of the business sector. These occurrences have attracted a great deal of attention in the mass media and led to a public debate, in many cases with wellfounded critical overtones. The problem of confidence applies primarily to senior officials of larger companies listed on the stock exchange and to parts of the financial sector. Even though most companies that belong to these groups are not affected by the criticised events, they are affected by the worsened confidence in the business sector. Large companies dominate the reporting of news and the public debate, and a lack of confidence in them risks spreading to other parts of the business sector.</p>
<p>Reasons for a Lack of Confidence</p>
<p>Phenomena that have figured prominently in shaking business confidence, intensified by the stock market bubble, can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p>• High remuneration levels and inappropriate salary and benefit systems for senior executives that are inadequately linked to performance and/or difficult to appraise;</p>
<p>• Erroneous or misleading economic information has been a feature of several  high-profile business scandals abroad, but similar incidents have also occurred in Sweden;</p>
<p>• Abuse of market position or of information advantage. Examples include the revelations of cartels, insurance savers’ weak position relative to life insurance companies and their managers, and inadequate consumer information about complicated financial arrangements;</p>
<p>• Unclear roles and responsibilities such as conflicts between various tasks when board members sit on more than one company board; external auditors as consultants; brokers and financial advisors with sales tasks; lumping together analysis, brokers’ functions and business financing; insurance brokers’ incentive systems; and in  state-owned enterprises, confusing the aims of business and public authorities;</p>
<p>• Poorly substantiated strategies and bad business decisions, primarily in the information technology sector, but also in businesses in more traditional sectors.</p>
<p>Several reasons with some degree of interaction underlie these phenomena, the Commission found:</p>
<p>• The lengthy rise in the stock market that began in the early1980s and culminated in the extreme stock market bubble from 1997 to 2002. During this rise, the extent of households’  share-related savings increased and, towards the end of the boom, share values climbed sharply. When the fall in the market came, it had a highly negative impact on confidence in companies listed on the stock exchange and on the stock market, all the more so as its fall coincided with the disclosure of highly questionable remuneration systems for business leaders. Professional analysts and investors contributed to the inflated market values, while financial advisors contributed to small savers’ exposure to high risks in their share investments;</p>
<p>• Want of personal ethics. Want of an ”inner compass” and lack of openness may explain inappropriate, improper, or unlawful decisions by individuals;</p>
<p>• Poor corporate governance. The issue is primarily related to governance by companies’ owners and secondarily to governance by the board of directors;</p>
<p>• An overheated investment banking culture in parts of the financial sector. The problems are not attributable to investment banking as such but to  transaction-driven mergers and floats, inflated company valuations, short-term profit maximisation, inappropriate bonus systems and overlapping roles.</p>
<p>The role of the mass media is basically positive since it is through the media that much of what happened became known. However, those who were held up for rigorous scrutiny by the media and many others in the business community have often criticised the way in which the media works and reports.</p>
<p>Confidence in a group can have a large impact on confidence in society as a whole and thus on social capital, which, as discussed previously, has considerable economic value. Thus the business confidence problems identified by the Commission must be taken seriously and carefully considered measures aimed at strengthening trust in business must be taken by the business community as well as by the central government.</p>
<p>Strategies for Increased Public Confidence</p>
<p>The Commission has worked on four main strategies for deciding programmes to promote confidence in the business sector.</p>
<p>Strategy 1. A good balance between different types of regulation. Statutory control is regulation by the Government; it includes laws, ordinances and public authorities’ regulations. Self-regulation refers to the regulations that individuals, associations or companies voluntarily adopt.</p>
<p>Statutory control and self-regulation complement each other and both forms of regulation need to be improved to promote confidence in the business sector. The goal of the Commission is to create, with as few additional regulations as possible, the conditions needed for Swedish business to regain public trust. Thus a big responsibility rests with institutions and firms in the business community to rebuild confidence using various forms of self-regulation and voluntary measures.</p>
<p>Ethics refers to the system of norms governing the conduct of companies and individuals. The exact formulation of ethical standards is not critical to public confidence in the business sector, but it is important that the laws and self-regulation and the conduct of companies and individuals show conformity with the public’s appraisal. A partial explanation of the problem of confidence in the business sector may be that norms in some management circles have moved in one direction while the general public’s values and their expectations have taken another direction.</p>
<p>Strategy 2. Balance in the confidence triangle. Well-designed regulatory regimes are not sufficient to support public confidence. Another prerequisite is that anyone who violates the rules is discovered and subject to serious sanctions. The ”Confidence Triangle” of Rules – Risk of Discovery – Sanctions has to be in balance at a sufficiently high level if it is to create and maintain a high degree of confidence. The system as a whole is not stronger than its weakest part.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s opinion, the regulatory regime is, in general, satisfactorily designed in many areas that are relevant from the point of view of confidence, even if there is a need to strengthen the regulations in some places. However, the risk of discovery is too low in many instances, for example, in cases of alleged economic crimes and unlawful manipulation of competition. The supervisory system therefore needs to be improved in several areas by such measures as strengthening those public authorities that have important supervisory duties towards the business sector.</p>
<p>On the issue of sanctions systems, there are also substantial deficiencies in a number of areas. In many instances, it takes an unreasonably long time before crimes that have been uncovered come to trial. These delays lead to a lack of respect for the regulatory regime and the norms. At the same time, the deterrent effect of sanctions can, in some cases, be called into question owing to the fact that they are too weak when compared with the substantial economic gains to be made from breaking the law. The implementation of changes in certain systems of sanctions is therefore warranted.</p>
<p>Strategy 3. Openness and transparency. Anyone wanting to enjoy public confidence must show a great deal of openness, and information needs to be clear, intelligible, correct and relevant to various target groups’ interest in the enterprise. In this respect, the requirements for information from companies need to be strengthened in certain cases. At the same time, the legitimate needs of business to keep information confidential respecting such matters as business secrets and individual integrity must be respected.</p>
<p>The mass media’s role is to inform, scrutinise and comment. Correct and open information from business makes this role easier and the public debate is more constructive.</p>
<p>Strategy 4. Clear division of roles and responsibilities. A partial explanation for the relatively large proportion of ambiguities in the division of roles and potential conflicts of interest in Swedish society is that Sweden is a small country with a consensus culture and with closely intertwined networks between persons in positions of leadership. Therefore an important confidence-creating measure is having systems in which the division of roles is clearly defined and both actual and potential conflicts of interest are avoided as much as possible, or – if this is not possible – are exposed and handled in an appropriate way.</p>
<p>In addition to these four main strategies, a strong, ethical leadership and the social control in the decision-making environment in the business community are very important. If the attitude to those that break the rules is conciliatory or if one is able to profit from certain rules, then events may occur that harm public confidence. Senior managers have a special role to serve as models in their organisations. In addition, it is important that leading representatives from the business sector actively participate in the public debate, not least with respect to questions about confidence related to the business sector.</p>
<p>Demands made of companies for ethical behaviour and social responsibility, often summarised in the concept ”Corporate Social Responsibility” (CSR), have increased. There are far-reaching voluntary activities under way in this area by businesses and business organisations in co-operation with non-profit organisations and the Government. In the opinion of the Commission, these make an important contribution to increasing confidence in the business sector.</p>
<p>Openness and transparency in these matters is of great importance for confidence in business.</p>
<p>Priority Areas for Action</p>
<p>The strategies described above sum up the principle approaches used by the Commission to analyse a number of prioritised areas where work to promote public confidence can and should be done.</p>
<p>Priority area 1. Improved corporate governance. Several of the events that have shaken confidence are linked to weaknesses in corporate governance caused by the institutionalisation of ownership, failure of boards of directors to execute their responsibilities properly and errors in financial reporting, among other things. The Commission will pay special attention to the following issues:</p>
<p>• Overall issues of corporate governance, which have led to the initiative to draw up a Swedish code of corporate governance in  co-operation with a number of organisations and bodies in the business sector;</p>
<p>• Owners’ role: the issues of too weak exercise of the owners’ role as well as risks of abuse of power by strong owners, together with certain special issues related to the exercise of the ownership function in  state-owned enterprises are analysed;</p>
<p>• The functions of the board of directors: the Commission sets out its principal views on a series of issues to be regulated under the corporate governance code referred to previously and makes certain proposals for legislation in addition to the code;</p>
<p>• Financial reporting and auditing: the Commission presents its view on a number of matters to be regulated under the code; it also proposes certain measures outside this framework.</p>
<p>Priority area 2. Increased confidence in the financial sector. Several confidence-damaging phenomena have financial sector links. At the same time, it is especially important for the public to have a high degree of confidence in the financial sector as it has a key role in the way in which the modern market economy functions. The Commission focuses on two areas:</p>
<p>• System stability: the financial system’s ability to withstand destabilising forces that may arise during economic crises and cause potentially large economic damages;</p>
<p>• The consumers’ perspective: the individual consumer or saver's position in relation to financial sector actors.</p>
<p>Priority area 3. A more effective competition policy. A well-functioning competition in various sectors is very much in the interest of consumers. At the same time, several of the events that have shaken public confidence are connected to shortcomings, especially in the oversight and sanctions systems in this area.</p>
<p>Priority area 4. Stronger provisions against economic crimes. The risk of discovery is low and the sanctions system is weak, but at the same time, this area is highly relevant from the standpoint of public confidence. This warrants measures that will make combating economic crimes more effective.</p>
<p>Improved Corporate Governance – a Swedish Code of</p>
<p>Corporate Governance</p>
<p>Well-run companies are a prerequisite for the market economy system to be able to create prosperity and growth. Good corporate governance is therefore important not only for a company’s owners and the capital markets, but also for society as a whole. It is accordingly of great general interest that corporate governance be improved in public companies, particularly in those listed on the stock exchange. In Supplement 8, there is an analysis of corporate governance in state-owned companies.</p>
<p>Swedish Code of Corporate Governance</p>
<p>The Commission has, together with a number of organisations and bodies in the business sector, established a working group, the Code Group, to draw up a proposal for a corporate governance code that summarises and develops best Swedish practice in the area. The proposed code specifies rules for the organisation and working methods of a company's governance bodies and the interaction between these two functions for the company’s reporting to owners and the capital market in general. However, there is no discussion of the auditing function per se, stock market rules and the manner in which the stock market works, or the company’s relations with customers, employees or the general public.</p>
<p>Compared with what is required by law, the rules in the code are more ambitious. A company that follows the code can deviate from individual rules but then this deviation must be warranted under the principle ”comply or explain”. Companies covered by the code are to attach a special corporate governance report to the annual report. For companies listed on the stock market, the market will decide if the reason reported for any deviations is acceptable or not. This model has been successfully used in a number of foreign corporate governance codes in recent years.</p>
<p>The code is written primarily for stock market companies, but it is probably also relevant for unlisted public companies and other companies with a broad ownerand/or public interest. Co-operatives, stateand municipally-owned companies, and many mediumsized and larger privately owned companies could probably use the code for the most part.</p>
<p>After interested parties have analysed and commented on the code and the final version has been decided, a body tentatively named the Council for Swedish Corporate Governance should ”own” and administer the code. The Council should come under civil law, with organisations and bodies in the business community forming a clear majority, but it should also have some state participation. Its activities should be financed by commitments that are binding in the long term from business leaders, possibly supplemented by fees from the companies covered by the code.</p>
<p>The Code Group’s proposals are reported in a separate volume entitled Swedish Code of Corporate Governance (Svensk kod för bolagsstyrning) (SOU 2004:46).</p>
<p>A Stronger Role for Owners in Companies with Broad Ownership or a Public Interest</p>
<p>An effective utilisation of the resources of the business community and companies assumes that capital is provided to the sectors and companies having the best prospects of meeting the needs of the market and that the capital in each firm is used in the best possible way. Here the share market and shareholders play a decisive role. Contemporary developments in corporate governance basically address how the role of the owner is to be exercised and how owners’ responsibility is to influence corporate governance.</p>
<p>Increased Owner Involvement in Corporate Governance</p>
<p>The ownership of stock market companies has been largely institutionalised and internationalised. Pension funds, insurance companies, investment funds and other portfolio management institutions dominate the owner representation in the large stock market companies. Similar changes have taken place in other developed countries, but this course has become accentuated in Sweden. After the abolition of foreign exchange regulations in Sweden and the repeal of the law on foreign acquisition of shares in Swedish companies in the late 1980s, the percentage of foreign-owned Swedish shares listed on the stock exchange rose from less than 10 per cent to over 30 per cent.</p>
<p>Fewer restrictions on ownership. Institutional owners, both Swedish and foreign, now represent the largest percentage of the stock exchange value. They are primarily portfolio managers with the main task of guaranteeing savers a good rate of return, not of exercising influence in the company. However, in the opinion of the Commission, it is desirable to make it easier for those institutions that have the will and the capacity to take a more active responsibility as owners to do so. One step in this direction is to reduce the remaining restrictions on certain institutional owners, principally the National Insurance Pension Fund’s ownership in individual companies. Since the equivalent restrictions for the life insurance companies were scrapped a few years ago, it is the opinion of the Commission that there is also cause for reviewing these restrictions on the Pension Fund. The Commission therefore proposes that the restrictions on the First - Fourth and Seventh Funds’ shareholding and the Seventh Fund’s voting rights for the shares held be re-examined with a view to abolishing these restrictions.</p>
<p>Furthermore institutional owners should, in line with the OECD's corporate governance principles, make public their ownership policy and the way in which voting rights for shareholders are exercised.</p>
<p>The wealth tax should be abolished as it plays a negative role for individual direct ownership of shares listed on the stock exchange. In addition, it affects a company’s choice of type of listing on the stock exchange. Abolishing this tax would not create new asymmetries or other undesirable economic side effects. However, the capital flight induced by the wealth tax would stop and perhaps even turn into some repatriation of financial assets.</p>
<p>Protection for Minority Shareholders</p>
<p>Shareholders' meetings should have an independent chair and be conducted in a manner that promotes active participation on the part of owners. The revision of the provisions on the organisation of public limited companies in the Swedish Companies Act (Aktiebolagslagen) on January 1, 1999 largely satisfies these needs. The corporate governance code takes additional steps for promoting shareholders’ means of exerting influence via the shareholders' meeting.</p>
<p>Owners’ abuse of power. There is no general criticism of the regulations in the Swedish Companies Act for the protection of minority shareholders but the Government authorities should, in the appropriate context, consider current limitations on minority rights.</p>
<p>Board of directors and management’s responsibility for damages.</p>
<p>Because there have been few legal procedures, the courts have not played the same role in the evolution of the law in this area that courts in other countries have. The responsibility of the board of directors would be made clearer and the position of minority shareholders would be strengthened if revised rules on the apportionment of the costs of judicial examination of these questions contributed to more cases being tested in the courts.</p>
<p>The issue of differentiated voting rights is highly relevant from the corporate governance perspective. There are reasons both for and against the current regulations. However, it is the opinion of the Commission that this subject is not primarily a matter of confidence in the business sector. The Commission has therefore refrained from presenting any proposals in this area.</p>
<p>Public take-over bids. An efficient market for controlling interests in listed companies reduces the risk that the management in a company in which the ownership and management are divided will act in a manner that is contrary to shareholders' interests. Carefully considered regulations on public take-over bids are therefore important elements in the protection of minority shareholders. At the end of 2003, a political agreement on an EU directive in the area was reached; therefore, the Commission has not analysed these issues in more detail.</p>
<p>Owner Involvement in the Governance of State-Owned</p>
<p>Companies</p>
<p>The central government is the largest business owner on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. In Supplement 8, it is argued that the mandate from the owner in the governance of state-owned companies is typically ill-defined and that there are generally insufficient resources to exercise the ownership role. The Commission supports this assessment. However, on the issue of nominating members of the board of directors, the central government has been in the forefront, with newly formulated rules for a structured evaluation of the board and a systematic set of procedures for the selection process that include requiring a nomination committee.</p>
<p>Ill-defined mandate from the owner. Effective corporate governance is not promoted by trying to maintain the fiction of a fully competitive and purely commercial activity with a clearly stated goal for return on capital if the company in actuality has a partial monopoly position and/or an additional mandate in the public interest. It is therefore proposed that for enterprises wholly owned by the state, a realistic and thorough description of each company’s mandate from the owner and efficient models for steering the activities of the companies towards these more multidimensional goals be drawn up.</p>
<p>Exercise of the ownership role. The Commission proposes reorganising and augmenting the state’s resources for corporate governance.</p>
<p>• The management of all of the companies wholly or partially owned by the state should be concentrated in the Ministry of Industry, Employment and Communications (Näringsdepartementet);</p>
<p>• There should be a minimum 50 per cent increase in the resources to administer the companies; the additional estimated cost comes to about SEK 15 million;</p>
<p>• The tasks of company administrators should be changed so that less time is devoted to participating in company boards and more time on drafting the role of the owners, following up compliance with targets and directing the nomination process;</p>
<p>• A pool of external specialists should be established to reinforce the competence of the ministry’s own staff.</p>
<p>Improving the Performance of Company Boards</p>
<p>The competence and professionalism of the Board of Directors in many instances have been inadequate in managing extreme rises and falls in share values. The prudence that boards and individual board members devote to their task has been deficient in certain cases. Individual board member’s civil courage and integrity sometimes appear to have wavered. Flaws in the way that many boards have functioned have seriously shaken public confidence.</p>
<p>It is the opinion of the Commission that most of the measures needed to improve the work of the company boards are included in the proposal for a Swedish Code of Corporate Governance. In addition, the Commission proposes amendments to the legislation in some instances.</p>
<p>Better Board Performance under the Code</p>
<p>The size of the board of directors should be decided by finding a balance between the need for knowledge, experience and perspective and the importance of simple, effective forms of work and personal responsibility. There are arguments for specifying an upper limit on the number of directors chosen at the company’s shareholders’ meeting.</p>
<p>Composition of the board of directors. Boards should be diversely composed of persons with different competences, experience and personal background, who together form a strong whole. An even gender distribution should be sought.</p>
<p>Independence of the board of directors. Of the members of the board of directors chosen at the company’s shareholders’ meeting, the majority should be independent of the company and at least two should also be independent of major owners. Other than employees’ representatives, only the managing director – if he or she is part of the board – should be employed in the company.</p>
<p>Recruiting board members. Methods and systems for recruiting board members should be developed substantially by way of a special nomination committee chosen by the owners.</p>
<p>Informed boards. Every new board member should receive an adequate introductory briefing on the company and all members of the board should develop their knowledge of the company and its activities on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>Definition of owners’ mandate. A board’s most fundamental duty is to acquaint itself with owners’ intentions and interests in the company and consolidate them into an integrated owners’ mandate as the basis for governing the company.</p>
<p>The role of the board’s chair. In recent years, the position of the chair of the board has become stronger, with explicit responsibility for leading the board’s work and seeing that the board discharges its duties according to the law. The chair of the board should therefore be chosen at the shareholders’ meeting.</p>
<p>The board’s decision-making culture. It is primarily the responsibility of the chair of the board to see that the effort to come to a consensus on decisions made by the board is not taken to the point where it is difficult for individual members to pursue dissenting opinions of high integrity on individual issues.</p>
<p>The board's basis for a decision. Under the Companies Act, a board is not allowed to come to a decision unless it has a satisfactory basis. This is one of the few provisions of the Act punishable by law.</p>
<p>Remuneration of board and management. The following requirements should be made of such systems:</p>
<p>• they are competitive for recruitment purposes;</p>
<p>• they reward behaviour that is in accordance with the company’s goals;</p>
<p>• there is a clear connection between remuneration and performance;</p>
<p>• there is a  well-defined ceiling on variable remuneration;</p>
<p>• pensions are premium based and the premiums paid are based on the fixed salary only.</p>
<p>The board of directors should follow a clear and structured process in dealing with remuneration matters. The code therefore includes a requirement for a special remuneration committee to prepare these matters.</p>
<p>The board’s responsibility for the company’s conduct towards the public. The board is responsible for the company’s behaviour towards its employees, customers and the general public, and in particular, for seeing that the company follows existing laws and regulations and other regulatory systems that the company is obliged to follow. To exercise its responsibility in such matters, the board must establish appropriate policies and guidelines governing the company’s conduct, ensure that their content is made clear to the company officials and staff members concerned and intervene forcefully at any sign that established rules and norms have been breached.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the board. The same requirements for systematic management by objectives and a structured evaluation process should be set for the board as are set for the company’s organisation in general. It is the responsibility of the chair to see that the board formulates clear objectives for its work and evaluates its performance in a systematic way.</p>
<p>Stronger Legislation</p>
<p>Decision on remuneration to senior executives. It is the opinion of the Commission that owners should take greater responsibility for remuneration to senior executives. It therefore proposes the introduction of regulations into the Companies Act that would require the following decisions to be taken at shareholders' meetings in public limited companies:</p>
<p>• the principles governing remuneration for managing directors and other company executives;</p>
<p>• the size of directors’ fees and their allocation to the chair, other board members and remuneration for committee work;</p>
<p>• all forms of share and share price incentive programmes for company executives or for the board.</p>
<p>Information on remuneration to senior officials. Openness is a restraint on excessive levels of remuneration or remuneration that is inappropriately designed, particularly when the reporting is done at the individual level. The Commission therefore proposes the introduction of regulations in the Annual Accounts Act (Årsredovisningslagen) and the Companies Act to the effect that public companies are to:</p>
<p>• present in the annual report information on the terms of employment for senior officials on a  person-by-person basis; this information is to be equivalent to that contained in the rules of the Swedish Industry and Commerce Stock Exchange Committee (Näringslivets Börskommitté) on the subject, with the addition that the circle covered by these decisions is to be widened to include all members of boards of directors;</p>
<p>• this matter is to be made the subject of a separate report at the shareholders’ meeting.</p>
<p>Election to the chair of the board at the shareholders’ meeting. A regulation requiring the chair of the board of directors in public companies to be elected at shareholders’ meetings should be added to the Companies Act. The board of directors should have the right to appoint a chair only if the chair resigns in the course of the mandate, in which case, the appointment should cover the time remaining until a new shareholders’ meeting, at which time the election of a new chair should be conducted.</p>
<p>A legislated role for the nomination committee. In connection with the coming revision of the Companies Act, consideration should be given to legislating the tasks and responsibilities of the nomination committee.</p>
<p>Limitation on substitutes for employee directors to be present at board meetings. The law on board representation for employees in private companies should be changed to limit the right of substitutes for employee directors to be present at board meetings to only those occasions when they are substituting for an absent director.</p>
<p>Reliable Financial Reporting and Auditing</p>
<p>Financial reporting is based on an extensive regulatory regime of laws and best practice in accounting and auditing, an area that is constantly being developed and that is characterised by extensive internationalisation.</p>
<p>The EU's regulation on the application of international accounting standards means that all listed companies are to prepare their consolidated financial accounts in accordance with the international accounting standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), which have been adopted by the EU Commission. These standards are currently called the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The regulation applies with certain transitional provisions for financial years beginning January 1, 2005 or later. The regulation adopted satisfies all the requirements that could be made today of standards in accounting.</p>
<p>The regulation of auditing is being reviewed in the EU, which recently published a proposal to update the 8th Company Law Directive. In short the directive provides that the International Standards on Auditing (ISA) will apply in the European Union beginning in 2005. The scope for specific Swedish regulations to deviate from what was agreed at the international level or in the EU is very limited. A new auditing standard comes into force in Sweden beginning in 2004. It replaces the earlier recommendation of FAR, the institute for the accountancy profession in Sweden.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors’ Role in Financial Reporting</p>
<p>Under the proposal for a Swedish code of corporate governance, the board and the managing director, immediately before signing the annual report, are to certify that the annual accounts, to the best of their knowledge, have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices for a stock market company, that the information presented is consistent with the actual conditions and that nothing of material value has been omitted. Responsibility for financial reporting must be made clear in the annual report. This proposed clarification should also become the subject of legislation.</p>
<p>The board of directors should also require that the director of finance certify in writing that the company’s financial reporting – both the annual report and the quarterly reports – meets the requirements of the existing rules and regulations in all essential respects.</p>
<p>The board of directors of all major Swedish companies listed on the stock exchange should have an audit committee with explicit instructions. The chair of the board should not chair the audit committee, but may be included on the committee. With the exception of the chair of the board of directors, members of the audit committee should be independent of the company. At least one member should be independent of major owners. Rules to this effect can be found in the proposal for the corporate governance code.</p>
<p>The board is responsible for seeing that the company has good internal control and must oversee and evaluate the company’s system of internal control on an ongoing basis. The corporate governance code stipulates that the board of directors is to make a separate annual report reviewing internal control, which is also to be examined by the auditors. In addition a stock market company should have internal auditing in the form of an independent unit reporting directly to executive management. Companies that do not have internal auditing should annually evaluate the need for it and in their annual report explain why there is no internal auditing.</p>
<p>The audit committee or the board of directors as a whole should examine all the critical accounting issues in the company. These issues should then be reported separately in the financial reports and should be highlighted at the shareholders’ meeting. The audit committee should review all financial reports before they are published. The board of directors and the auditors should confer on their views of the company’s risks and internal controls.</p>
<p>The specific requirements of the Swedish law on management and operational audits (a recommendation for or against discharge of liability in the auditor's report) should be reviewed as the auditing regulations should be harmonised at the international level. The issue should be discussed within the framework of a review of legislation on auditing.</p>
<p>Under the listing agreement with the Stockholm Stock Exchange, stock market companies at present are to issue quarterly financial statements but these reports do not need to be audited. However, audit of these interim financial statements would make possible an earlier discovery of potential problems. Therefore, at least one interim report – the half-yearly or nine-month report – should be reviewed by the auditors. At present it is sufficient that this requirement is included in the code.</p>
<p>The Auditor’s Independence</p>
<p>The selection of the auditor is a key issue in the owners’ governance of a company. The Code therefore stipulates that the nomination committee is to propose auditors at the shareholders’ meeting, together with proposals on auditing fees. The rules on rotation in the EU recommendation on independence are included in FAR’s rules on professional ethics; therefore, further regulation in the code or the laws is not required.</p>
<p>The services in addition to auditing that the auditors may provide are prescribed by the regulations in the laws on auditing and the supplementary regulations on the auditor’s independence. However, in listed companies, the board of directors should stipulate the services that the accounting firm is allowed to furnish to the company, as is stated in the corporate governance code.</p>
<p>Co-ordinated Standard Setting and Supervision</p>
<p>The new demands being put on standard setting and supervision against the background of developments in the past few years and expected forthcoming EU requirements bring the issue of the appropriate organisation and division of work among the various authorities and private bodies to the fore.</p>
<p>The bases for the future organisation of accounting and auditing matters should be the following:</p>
<p>• The role of the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (Finansinspektionen, FI) should remain focused on the financial sector;</p>
<p>• Closely connected fields, such as accounting and auditing, should be placed under the same authority;</p>
<p>• Self-regulation should be used where possible;</p>
<p>• Standard setting and supervision should be kept separate;</p>
<p>• Activities that are related to supervision should be financed by the objects of that supervision.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes putting accounting and auditing matters under a single new accounting supervisory authority (in Swedish, named Redovisningsinspektionen). Standard setting and supervisory tasks should be separated as far as possible, and this new authority should have the right to delegate some tasks to private bodies. The supervisory panel should remain a private body, which formally has its mandate from the proposed new authority but the panel should work independently. Under the proposal, a new authority with three main areas of responsibility would be created: accounting in unlisted companies; accounting in listed companies and their supervision; and auditing. There are administrative as well as competence-related advantages in having accounting issues handled in proximity to auditing issues.</p>
<p>The proposal includes an increase in the resources for standard setting and supervision in this area by 50 per cent compared with the current situation. The Commission is of the opinion that the entire cost of the new authority should be financed by the central government budget. This means a gross cost increase of about SEK 42 million. However, a considerable part of that amount should also continue to be collected in the form of fees paid by the companies and organisations that are to be supervised by the authority.</p>
<p>System Stability and Improved Consumer Protection in the</p>
<p>Financial Sector</p>
<p>The financial sector plays a key role in the economy and depends very much on good confidence. The requirements of system stability and consumer protection have necessitated more comprehensive state regulation and supervision in the financial sector than in other sectors.</p>
<p>System Stability</p>
<p>System risks in the financial sector mean that throughout society, core functions such as payments services and credit supply could be disrupted. Legislators, central banks and supervisory authorities have made extensive and partly internationally co-ordinated efforts in the 1990s aimed at improving the conditions for financial stability and the ability to handle stability problems. Regulatory regimes have been reformed and the new Swedish banking legislation is clearly aimed at system stability. Risk awareness and risk management capacity in financial companies is much higher today than it was when the financial crisis began fifteen years ago.</p>
<p>The Commission stresses the importance of pursuing work to develop the regulatory framework and to strengthen financial supervision in Sweden – largely through continued international co-operation - but does not see any grounds for presenting any proposal for measures in this area.</p>
<p>Improved Consumer Protection</p>
<p>The consumer’s disadvantage with respect to information when buying financial services is caused by the appearance of a wide spectrum of citizens who have come to use complex financial services that previously were the concern chiefly of professional actors or services that simply did not exist. Developments in the financial industry have meant many positive changes for the consumer but consumer protection needs to be strengthened. However, the aim can never be to relieve the consumer of every type of financial risk. Excessive protection easily becomes ”overregulation” with weak competition, a low rate of growth, low efficiency and high costs in consequence. The goal is not freedom from risk but risk taking that is conscious and controlled.</p>
<p>Self-regulation on the stock market. In a few years, several EU directives involving changed conditions for self-regulation on the securities market will have been incorporated into Swedish legislation. The regulations require a ”competent authority” with responsibility for supervision of the regulatory regime, which is presumed to be a central government authority. The Commission is of the opinion that self-regulation will still continue to fulfil important purposes and that it needs to be developed and be more widely supported. Actual and potential conflicts of interest need to be exposed and managed and a more proactive approach should be aimed at. The authorities responsible should also consider a better integrated and resourced organisational framework for the activities.</p>
<p>The role of the stock exchange. Stock exchanges and other financial market places play a key role in the financial market. Efficient market places, managed in a way that instils public confidence, contribute to good liquidity, low transaction costs and efficient price formation. The Commission proposes that the Government appoint a commission to look into the future role of stock exchanges and market places with respect to performing tasks similar to public authorities, such as the issuance of rules and supervision. The bases for the work should be the new EU directives in the area of securities and the requirements that these directives may involve, as well as the effort to eliminate conflict of interest risks in the Stockholm Stock Exchange as much as possible.</p>
<p>Changed supervisory responsibility. The Commission proposes that responsibility for consumer protection in the financial sector be given to the Financial Supervisory Authority, which has the knowledge of how the financial sector functions, the contact interface with the market and thus the means of identifying problems and pitfalls even before the consumer is affected. However, the Authority should not handle individual consumer matters or pursue legal processes, as doing so could mean a conflict of interest with its supervisory function. The Authority should therefore not assume the role of the Consumer Ombudsman in the financial area. Individual consumer matters and consumer information should be looked after by the consumer bureaus for bank and insurance matters. These bureaus should be restructured, given a broader mandate, allotted greater resources and financed by the Authority.</p>
<p>All in all, the Commission proposes additional resources of about SEK 30 million annually for the Authority, of which about SEK 20 million would be provided to the consumer bureaus. The funding should come from the central government budget, but, like the supervision in general, it will in the end come from fees from the financial companies. The Commission’s proposal will increase these net costs by about SEK 20 million annually.</p>
<p>In obvious cases of corporate infractions of the Marketing Practices Act (Marknadsföringslagen), sanction charges should be permitted. The charges are to be large enough to act as a deterrent. As the Financial Supervision Authority should not pursue individual consumer matters, responsibility for these matters most suitably lies with the Swedish Consumer Agency (Konsumentverket) and/or the Consumer Ombudsman. Decisions may be appealed to the courts.</p>
<p>Life insurance companies. The boards in non-profit-distributing insurance companies must take into account both policy holders’ and owners’ interests. To minimise conflict of interest risks in such life insurance companies, the structure of their board of directors and its guidelines should be changed. The Commission supports the proposals for corporate governance in the Ministry of Finance’s (Finansdepartementet) memorandum on improved protection for policy holders in life insurance companies.</p>
<p>The Commission recommends that the corporate structure of a mutual insurance company in a profit-driven concern be scrapped and welcomes the commission that has been appointed to review company law in the insurance area with the aim of improving transparency and minimising the risk of conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>Insurance brokers. When an insurance broker is commissioned, the broker’s fee is usually paid by the insurance company. Instead, the insurance broker should be paid directly by the person purchasing a policy. The customer should pay the insurance company only for the service that is being purchased from the company.</p>
<p>Fund Management Companies. The Swedish Mutual Funds Association (Fondbolagens Förening) should publish clearer and fuller guidelines to its member companies. The duty to inform should include key ratios that clearly show if the fund management company acted in the mutual fund owners’ interests. The companies should display greater openness respecting individual fund manager’s holdings and trading in the fund that he or she manages, together with the design of the fund manager’s remuneration system. In addition the same measures in the area of corporate governance that were proposed for life insurance companies should be adopted for the fund management companies in order to strengthen their independence and reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>Securities companies. To improve public confidence, the Financial Supervisory Authority should introduce stricter regulations to thwart conflicts of interest in the activities of securities companies. This should be accomplished with the guidance of the new American rules known as the Spitzer rules, which mean, among other things, that analysts’ compensation/bonus is not to be linked to corporate finance and an internal committee is to approve recommendations made by the firm’s analysts. In addition the company is to draw up procedures for internal supervision to guarantee that the rules are observed.</p>
<p>The Financial Inspection Authority should study what additional changes are required to check conflict of interests and improve consumer/investor protection and thereby improve confidence in the securities firms.</p>
<p>More Effective Competition Policies</p>
<p>The main problems in the area of competition are abuse of a dominant position and companies’ unlawful anti-competitive co-operation (formation of cartels). Other circumstances such as inappropriate public procurement and public subsidies that distort competition may also affect the functioning of the economy and public confidence.</p>
<p>Co-ordinated Authority Mandates</p>
<p>The Swedish Competition Authority (Konkurrensverket) should take over the functions now performed by the National Board for Public Procurement (Nämnden för Offentlig Upphandling, NOU). The total effect of competition policy will be strengthened if the responsibility for and the supervision of issues of procurement and competition are co-ordinated to the greatest extent possible. In the area of public procurement, the Competition Authority at present is focused on the producers of goods and services and on the competition in the market. The National Board for Public Procurement monitors how the procurer or the buyer follows the rules in force. In the opinion of the Commission, the National Board for Public Procurement should be abolished and its functions should be transferred to the Competition Authority.</p>
<p>The Competition Authority should be given the responsibility for supervision and co-ordination of government support. The responsibility for supervising government support now rests with the Government. An integrated responsibility for supervising government support by the Competition Authority, including adherence to the proposed ”Transparency Act” (transparenslagen), would increase the effectiveness and the credibility of this part of competition policy.</p>
<p>The role of the Competition Authority in the markets for electronic communication should be strengthened. Special regulations aimed at achieving a functioning competition in certain markets where the rules have been reformed carry the risk of leading to high transaction costs for the actors, owing to requirements in addition to the general laws on competition. The responsibility for market analyses and reviews of competition in the telecommunications market now resting with the National Post and Telecom Agency (Post- och telestyrelsen) should be transferred to the Competition Authority.</p>
<p>The appropriations for the Competition Authority should be increased. The credibility of competition policy requires effective rules, sanctions that are sufficiently forceful and a supervisory authority that has enough resources to discover and take measures against the most serious competition problems in the market. At present, the activities of the Competition Authority are largely limited to fighting cartels. The appropriation to the Authority for managing present and future tasks should therefore be increased by SEK 25 million annually.</p>
<p>Stronger Laws on Competition</p>
<p>The Public Procurement Act (Lagen om offentlig upphandling, LOU) should be given effective provisions for sanctions. The extensive practice of procurement in conflict with the Act carries the risk of leading to inefficient resource utilisation and losses to the economy. The authority responsible for procurement supervision should be given the right to sue for market damage fines in the event of serious breach of the rules, such as unlawful direct procurement. In order to concentrate as much as possible all cases concerning competition to the same court, the Market Court (Marknadsdomstolen,) should rule on all cases concerning fines for market damages.</p>
<p>Improved possibilities for sanctions, etc. for infringements of the Local Government Act (Kommunallagen). Municipal business activities are to be conducted without a profit motive and must have as their aim the provision of facilities or services for the public good. In practice, however, it has proved difficult for companies to appeal local government decisions – for example, on the municipality starting to operate business activities in a competitive market – or getting actions that may be in conflict with the Local Government Act tested in courts. Consequently, there is good reason to review the Act.</p>
<p>Competition considerations should be given more weight in the Planning and Building Act (PBL). Consumers have a legitimate interest in good competition, which leads to a larger and often more varied supply of goods and services and lower prices. One factor that affects the opportunities for the establishment of retail businesses is the local governments’ planning for retail trade by their application of the Planning and Building Act. A parliamentary committee is currently reviewing the planning and building laws. It is desirable that competition considerations be taken into account more clearly in the detailed planning.</p>
<p>Effective Sanctions</p>
<p>A changed order of courts of appeal in cases of Competition Act infringement. The present procedure of sanctions in cases involving breaking the Competition Act is often very lengthy. In many countries, the competition authority decides on sanctions and in the EU the Commission decides on sanctions. The latter’s decisions may be appealed to the Court of First Instance and in some cases further to the European Court. In Sweden there is a similar appeals procedure for the Competition Authority’s decisions on injunctions according to paragraph 23 of the Competition Act, which may be appealed directly to the Market Court. One way of making the time between an initiative to a final ruling shorter and more efficient would be to introduce this procedure in other areas as well. There should be a possibility to appeal the rulings of the Market Court in order to avoid the risk of impairing the legal rights of the individual. Such appeals should be made to the Supreme Court, which would then become the court of last instance for test cases in all matters of competition law.</p>
<p>Administrative fines for prevention and deterrence. At present, a company may be required to pay administrative fines for competition damages of up to 10 per cent of its annual turnover, which usually can be regarded as sufficiently high. Taking the levels of fines handed out in recent cases into account, however, the Commission finds reasons for clarifying the rules for deciding the size of fines in order to strengthen their preventive and deterring effects.</p>
<p>The resources, composition and competence of the Market Court.</p>
<p>There is reason to review the composition and staffing of the Market Court in view of the proposed focus on the role of the Court in hearing competition cases and matters. The Court’s resources should be increased by about SEK 3 million annually if the Commission’s proposals are acted on.</p>
<p>Intensified Efforts against Economic Crimes</p>
<p>Economic crime here refers to such crimes as bribery and corruption that have financial gain as their motive and that are committed within the framework of business activities that are not themselves criminalised. The Commission has limited its consideration to three areas of particular importance to improve public confidence in the business sector.</p>
<p>A Stronger Economic Crimes Authority</p>
<p>Integrated responsibility. The responsibility for combating economic crimes is today divided between the Economic Crimes Bureau (Ekobrottsmyndigheten, ECB) and public prosecutors in general. The Commission proposes that the fight against economic crimes be rendered more effective by having the Bureau handle all types of economic crimes, wherever possible, throughout the country. The long turnaround times at the Bureau need to be countered by a combination of increased resources and increased efficiency in management through such measures as the establishment in every department of a special chamber with the chief responsibility for handling large economic crime cases. The Bureau’s resources should be raised by about SEK 60 million on an annual basis.</p>
<p>More efficient management. Economic crime cases, by the time they reach the court of appeals, can be almost ten years old. In the United States the process often goes much faster because of the plea bargaining system. The prosecuting authority there can come to an agreement with a person suspected of various crimes. The suspect admits responsibility for certain crimes and helps the prosecutor with evidence and so forth in exchange for which the prosecuting authority writes off any remaining suspected crimes. In order for police and prosecutors to react more quickly in the event of business irregularities, a prosecutor should also have the duty in his or her area of responsibility actively to cover what ever is happening and if there is cause, decide to begin a preliminary investigation or hold a preliminary hearing. The Commission proposes that the matters of introducing a Swedish variant of the plea bargain and assigning prosecutors proactive surveillance duty be given further study.</p>
<p>Changed methods for preliminary investigations. The outcome of the Economic Crimes Bureau’s long turnaround times is that evidence becomes weaker, it becomes more difficult to present enough proof to get a conviction and the sentence may be lighter. In the worst case, the result may be uncertainty about what is or is not admissible, or an image of a legal system that does not fulfil its fundamental functions. The investigations need to be shortened, with the aim of giving priority to the graver cases of economic crime. When such a case comes up, the necessary resources should be made available so that it is possible to conduct a quick and efficient investigation. Major economic crime investigations must be viewed as projects to be carried out within a limited amount of time.</p>
<p>Improving the Authorities’ Competence</p>
<p>Broader recruitment base. The police officers who work at the Economic Crimes Bureau have a general police background. Differentiation in recruitment to the police profession should be tried, with a certain quota reserved for applicants considered to be suited to economic crime investigations. University graduates with an education in business administration should be recruited directly into the police profession and take a more compressed general police training. The system for recruiting economic crime police should be the subject of a commission of inquiry. The Economic Crimes Bureau should also establish a pool of experts with knowledge of such matters as options trading, banking issues, insurance matters and the securities market.</p>
<p>Specialised judges. The work of the courts must also demonstrate high competence. Even now expert knowledge can be provided by augmenting the court with an economic expert and/or an expert in tax law. Expert evidence may also be introduced during legal proceedings. The centralisation of the judiciary now in progress will result in the creation of larger courts, which means that some department in a court can specialise in economic crimes. Furthermore the training that judges receive on economic crimes should be strengthened.</p>
<p>Rule Changes to Combat Economic Crimes More Effectively</p>
<p>Clearer legislation on bribery. Corruption distorts competition in the business sector, increases costs and leads to higher prices. One problem with penalty clauses on bribery and corruption concerns ambiguities in what constitutes crimes of improper rewards. Penalty clauses on corruption and bribery should be clearer. The</p>
<p>Commission therefore proposes that a commission of inquiry be appointed to review the penalty clauses on bribery and corruption and to look into the possibilities of more clearly specifying where the boundary is between lawful and unlawful behaviour and examining whether it is possible to introduce a limitation on the amount that is exempt from penalty.</p>
<p>Anti-corruption programmes. An urgent task of trade associations is to keep informed about marketing methods in the industry and when necessary, inform themselves of current rules and regulations. The Commission recommends that large companies introduce special anti-corruption programmes and appoint a compliance officer with the task of verifying that various regulations, including those on bribery and corruption, are observed.</p>
<p>Administrative fees for insider trading. From the statistics, it is clear that insider trading is not effectively fought in Sweden. The Commission, however, refrains from presenting proposals in this area as another government commission of inquiry is expected to present proposals in June 2004.</p>
<p>A penalty regulation on management responsibility. The responsibilities of the managing director and the company board are of key importance to a public limited company. There thus should be a regulation that explicitly states that a disregard of such responsibility may result in the perpetrators being held accountable. The Commission proposes that the Government appoint a commission of inquiry with the task of considering the possibility of introducing a penalty clause on management responsibility.</p>
<p>Financing and Other Matters</p>
<p>Proposals for financing and consequences for local government autonomy, crime and crime prevention, small enterprises and gender equality are reported in accordance with the Ordinance on Committees of Inquiry.</p>
<p>The abolition of the wealth tax is estimated to result in a revenue shortfall of about SEK 4 800 million. It should be financed by one of the following alternatives: an increased corporate tax rate, changes in the rules for tax allocation reserves in the corporation tax, increased tax on returns from pension funds and amended rules for the reduction of the employers’ contributions or by a combination of these financing alternatives.</p>
<p>The Commission proposes financing expenditure increases amounting to a total of about SEK 185 million by reducing various appropriations in the expenditure areas of business and industry and the judicial system.</p>
<p>It is the Commissions’ view that the proposals put forward in the Report would make it easier for serious small enterprises to compete on equal terms, reinforce the fight against economic crime and lead to a more even gender distribution on boards of directors.</p>
