<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Government Commission on Marine Spatial Planning proposes a new system for national planning of the sea. Provisions for the planning system will be included in the new Marine Spatial Planning Act.</p>
<p>The marine environment is not in a sustainable state, and is still in part deteriorating, while claims on use of the sea are ever increasing. New uses and claims are arising, such as wind and wave power, mariculture and carbon capture storage. Increased knowledge of the sea as an ecosystem also shows that the marine environment needs a range of different kinds of protection. Often, the claims on the sea to provide the goods and services on which mankind depends are beyond its capacity. Marine spatial planning is the main tool available to settle how the marine resources and marine space should be allocated.</p>
<p>Increasing claims and the need for protection also lead to more conflicts between competing interests, and bring such conflicts more into the open. Spatial planning can prevent conflict and help solve conflicts that do arise. Planning should be forward-looking; it should anticipate and prevent risks of damage and conflict. It should also lead to an effective use, so that the pressure on resources and space is minimised.</p>
<p>In view of this, the interest in marine spatial planning has increased in recent years. Norway, the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium are forerunners in Europe. Australia, Canada and some states in the US also offer good examples.</p>
<p>Marine spatial planning is a clear national interest and responsibility. To a large extent, national and international interests and claims need to be balanced. Sweden has made international commitments and has obligations within the EU. It is also primarily the national level that has the means to manage</p>
<p>activities in the seas, by permits and licences, as well as through protection and conservation measures.</p>
<p>The seas are not planned today</p>
<p>In Sweden there is no comprehensive system for marine spatial planning, at local or national level. However, since the mid- twentieth century, some national planning initiatives have targeted coastal and sea areas, especially the national spatial planning that was set up during the 1970s. Its guidelines were the basis of the provisions on public and national interests in the Environmental Code of 1998, which includes some basic elements of national marine spatial planning. Apart from this, activities at national level have mostly involved sectoral decision support produced by the responsible national agencies, which will of course be valuable in future marine spatial planning.</p>
<p>Although the municipalities (local councils) cover the sea out to twelve nautical miles from the base line and are responsible for spatial planning in Sweden, their general spatial plans do not usually deal with the sea. Hence, the planning system is poorly prepared to tackle claims on use and need for protection of the sea. A mere four municipalities, out of a total of 80 along the coast, have a general plan covering the entire sea area in their territory. Municipal planning of the seas is generally prompted by immediate claims or issues, and motivated by a desire to influence future decisions or licensing at the national level. The main example is recent claims for sea-based wind power.</p>
<p>Inter-municipal, regional and international collaboration on coastal and marine areas is growing. The results so far are however mainly of methodological interest. No common procedures, structures or methods for collaboration on planning are yet in place.</p>
<p>What is marine spatial planning?</p>
<p>Marine spatial planning is the basis of marine management, which includes action plans or programmes. Marine spatial plans will resemble both the general plans and land use or urban plans drawn up at municipal level. The planning process for the sea will thus be</p>
<p>partially similar to the established process on land. However, the conditions are vastly different, and for instance there are no private property rights to consider.</p>
<p>Our purpose is to bring together development and conservation into one process, where respect for the limits set by the ecosystem comes first. The marine spatial planning system and legislation will link the Environmental Code, the Planning and Building Act, and various sectoral laws. The aim is to achieve a holistic and harmonised system of marine management.</p>
<p>The marine spatial plans mainly target national and municipal authorities, and should be applied when examining applications for licences and permits, or deciding on measures concerning the sea. The marine plans will also set the framework for municipal spatial planning.</p>
<p>Effective and efficient implementation of the EU Marine Framework Directive presupposes the introduction of marine spatial planning. Marine spatial planning is a basic tool for marine environmental management and marine activities. In practice, the implementation of the Directive and of marine spatial planning will mainly be one and the same process.</p>
<p>Effective and consistent implementation of international law, especially the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, will also be facilitated by marine spatial planning.</p>
<p>The objective of the Marine Spatial Planning Act</p>
<p>We propose a Marine Spatial Planning Act that will set the framework for a planning system for the whole sea area. The ecosystem approach is fundamental to the proposed system. This approach is a part of sustainable development, but also a framework condition for development. The objective of marine spatial planning should be to contribute to sustainable development. For this to be possible, the structure and functioning of ecosystems must be maintained, or restored where necessary. In this way, the ability of the ecosystems to provide mankind with the goods and services on which it depends will be maintained.</p>
<p>Within the framework of sustainable development and maintaining the structure and functioning of ecosystems, planning should lead to sea areas being allocated to the uses that are most suitable in view of their nature, location and requirements.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the precautionary principle should be applied. The relevant provisions of the Environmental Code are applicable to the marine planning process, not least the section on public and national interests.</p>
<p>The plans must also respect the fact that international law sets limits on what can be regulated concerning the sea, especially in the exclusive economic zone which is not part of the national territory.</p>
<p>Comprehensive and holistic plans</p>
<p>For planning to be ecosystem-based, it must take into consideration entire ecosystems and hence as far as possible cover entire sea areas. Therefore, international cooperation must be included in the planning system.</p>
<p>We propose that marine spatial plans should be elaborated for three areas, the Gulf of Bothnia, the Baltic Sea main basin and the ‘Western Seas’ (Skagerrak and the Kattegat). The geographic coverage consists of all Swedish waters seawards of a line one nautical mile outside the baseline (i.e. the coastline, or a line along the mouths of bays and the outer islands). The three areas correspond to established sea area boundaries and the water districts established out to one nautical mile beyond the baseline, according to the EU Water Framework Directive.</p>
<p>Initial planning will start simultaneously for all three areas, so as to cover the entire Swedish sea area as soon as possible. This will also facilitate coordination between the areas.</p>
<p>The tasks, contents and design of marine spatial plans</p>
<p>The marine spatial plans will give comprehensive support for decisions concerning activities or protection, and can therefore make the decision process and sea management more efficient. The plans will also be instruments for communication and information, and will contribute to international and EU cooperation on the sea.</p>
<p>The plans will identify the most appropriate use of sea areas, based on a balanced appraisal of public and national interests. They will consist of maps accompanied by guidelines on the use, protection and management of sea areas, as well as directions on which interests should be given priority in each area.</p>
<p>Under our proposal, the marine spatial plans will give guidelines for licensing and management, but will also specify which areas are of public or national interest and for what purpose. They may also contain binding provisions that exclude certain or all activities that are subject to licensing or permits, in certain areas (or certain activities in all areas except where indicated). The provisions may also set conditions for certain activities in certain areas.</p>
<p>Detailed plans for certain areas, as well as thematic supplements, will be an integral part of each plan. Hence, there will be a single plan for each planning area, and all amendments will be made in this context. This will enable a holistic view and coordination to be the guiding principles of planning.</p>
<p>The plans will be accompanied by the supporting documents needed, including 1) the planning conditions, such as descriptions of environmental status, natural conditions and existing activities, 2) the objectives of the plan, and 3) the considerations on which the design of the plan is based. Considerations include striking a balance between conflicting interests, and environmental, economic and social assessments.</p>
<p>Planning in cooperation with all parties concerned</p>
<p>The Swedish Marine and Water Management Agency will be responsible for the planning process, with the assistance of the Government County Offices in all the counties along the coast. The ecosystem approach should be the basis for all planning stages and for subsequent sea management. Basic planning data should be provided by all agencies and municipalities concerned. The first step is to draw up a programme document, giving the bases and objectives of the plans. There should be continuous consultations with all interested parties while the programme is being drawn up, as well as when the draft plan is being elaborated (step 2). The plan will be drafted in collaboration with all concerned agencies and other interested parties.</p>
<p>When the consultation process has been concluded, a final proposal for a marine spatial plan will be prepared and made available for examination (step 3). The Marine and Water Management Agency , the Government County Offices and the local councils (municipalities) concerned will make the proposal and supporting documents available. After examination, the Marine and Water Management Agency will submit the proposal, together with the opinions given, to the Government (the Ministry of Environment) (step 4). The Agency will also give its own opinion, including proposals in response to the opinions from interested parties. The Government will consider the proposed plan, taking account of the opinions, supporting documents and impact assessments. When all Ministries have agreed on a final version of the plan, the Government will adopt it, and it will gain legal force.</p>
<p>Based on experiences in Norway and Germany, we estimate that this process will be completed within four years. The first time, the process might take longer, especially in the Baltic Sea main basin.</p>
<p>After being adopted, the plans will be applied by national and municipal authorities in subsequent decisions (step 5), in licensing and management measures concerning the sea, and in municipal spatial planning. Plans can be amended for certain areas, or</p>
<p>supplemented thematically, for instance when a new interest arises. The Marine and Water Management Agency can decide on necessary amendments; appeals against its decisions can be addressed to the Government. If an amendment or supplement implies a new position on public or national interests, or if it is of fundamental importance, the decision will be taken by the Government.</p>
<p>The Marine and Water Management Agency will be responsible for following up plans, keeping them updated and, at least every four years, deciding whether they need to be replaced (step 6). Even if the plans are always kept up to date, new claims or objectives, or new developments, may give rise to the need for a new plan. Based on experiences in Norway, the plans may need to be replaced after about 12 to 20 years.</p>
<p>Government Offices in the planning process</p>
<p>The 14 Government Offices in the counties along the coast will participate actively in the planning process. They will assist the Marine and Water Management Agency in leading and coordinating the planning process at regional level. The Government County Offices will cooperate within the area covered by the plan, with one of them coordinating the work. They will also provide support and coordination to municipalities in planning of marine and coastal areas, and ensure that municipal spatial plans are in line with the marine spatial plan.</p>
<p>Connections between national marine spatial planning and municipal planning</p>
<p>The Marine and Water Management Agency is to consult the municipalities in all stages of the planning process. The municipalities play an essential part in coordinating marine and coastal spatial planning, and will be able to participate actively throughout – from consultations on the programme and the draft plan, to the examination of the final proposal. The opinion of the municipalities concerned will be conveyed to the Government. When the plans are applied, the municipalities will also play a part</p>
<p>in putting ecosystem-based planning of the coasts and the sea into practice.</p>
<p>The municipality must make sure that its general spatial plan indicates how it has been coordinated with the marine spatial plan. The Government County Office will monitor that a proposed general plan is coordinated with the marine plan and state whether there is any contradiction between them. The same will apply to land use plans and other municipal planning provisions. If a land use plan or provision is in conflict with the marine spatial plan, the Government County Office will cancel the municipal decision.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a municipality will not be allowed to issue a building permit which fails to comply with binding provisions in the marine spatial plan. This does not apply in the case of a minor discrepancy, or if the objective of the provision is not compromised.</p>
<p>It is proposed that funds are made available to support municipal and regional spatial planning of coastal and sea areas. Information and training should also be made available to municipalities and to relevant agencies.</p>
<p>We believe that national marine spatial planning will considerably improve the conditions for municipal spatial planning in coastal and sea areas.</p>
<p>Specific issues concerning the Exclusive Economic Zone and the continental shelf</p>
<p>Sweden should make use of the possibility provided by the Law of the Sea to introduce a contiguous zone within the economic zone (out to 24 nautical miles from the base line). One purpose is to be able to protect the cultural heritage. In the area, especially in the Baltic Sea, there are a large number of archaeological and historical sites, mainly well-preserved ancient shipwrecks and remnants of prehistoric settlements.</p>
<p>Planning and decisions concerning the exclusive economic zone must comply with international law. They must not involve any restriction of rights under international law and the Law of the Sea, such as the right to innocent passage, or other rights that follow from generally acknowledged principles of international law.</p>
