<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (Rome Statute, Swedish Treaty Series 2002:59) established the International Criminal Court (ICC) as a permanent institution for prosecution of individuals for the most serious international crimes. Sweden signed the Statute on 7 October 1988 and deposited its instrument of ratification with the UN Secretary General on 28 June 2001.</p>
<p>The Statute has undergone important changes in recent years. The Inquiry has been tasked with considering and taking a position on whether Sweden should accede to the amendments to the Statute adopted at a Review Conference in Kampala in June 2010 (the Kampala amendments), including amendments that enable the ICC to exercise its jurisdiction regarding the ‘crime of aggression’, but only after a separate decision had been taken to activate its jurisdiction. That decision was made in December 2017. The remit of the Inquiry also includes taking a position on whether Sweden should accede to the amendment adopted in 2015 regarding Article 124 of the Rome Statute. Moreover, certain amendments were adopted in December 2017 concerning the Rome Statute's regulation of war crimes (Article 8). The question of whether Sweden should also ratify these amendments has been considered as part of the Inquiry’s remit. In May 2018 the Inquiry presented its interim report The crime of aggression and amendments to the Rome Statute , SOU 2018:33. In that interim report the Inquiry proposed that Sweden should ratify the Kampala amendments, the 2015 amendment to Article 124 and the 2017 amendment to Article 8. Ratification of the Kampala amendments regarding the crime of aggression means that the Act on Cooperation with the International Criminal Court (2002:329) has to be amended so that the existing provisions of the Act regarding, for instance, the possibility of surrendering persons suspected of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes to the ICC will also apply to the crime of aggression. A legislative amendment to that effect was proposed in the Inquiry’s interim report.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit also includes considering and taking a position on whether possibilities should be introduced into Swedish law to prosecute in Sweden persons who have committed crimes of aggression and presenting proposals for the legislative amendments needed in Swedish law to make such prosecutions possible.</p>
<p>A further part of the Inquiry’s remit is to carry out a new review and produce updated and coherent preparatory material concerning the rules on Swedish criminal jurisdiction. Work on this part of the Inquiry’s remit has drawn on the report of the Inquiry on International Criminal Law International crimes and Swedish jurisdiction  (SOU 2002:98) and on the ministry memorandum Authorisation to prosecute under Chapter 2 of the Swedish Penal Code  (Ds 2014:13).</p>
<p>The latter two parts of the Inquiry’s remit – a possible criminalisation of the crime of aggression and the rules about Swedish criminal jurisdiction – are considered in this final report.</p>
<h2>The crime of aggression in Swedish law The main content of the crime of aggression</h2>
<p>Article 5 of the Rome Statute states that the ICC has jurisdiction with respect to the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression. The original wording of the Rome Statute contained a definition of the first three of these, while the crime of aggression was not defined in the Statute when it was adopted. When the Rome Statute came into being, the ICC was not given the power to exercise jurisdiction with respect to this crime either. The question of the detailed framing of the crime of aggression has long been considered to be controversial from several different perspectives. They have included the question of how wide the definition of the crime of aggression should be and what rules should apply to jurisdiction with respect to this crime. Since the States Parties were unable to agree on the detailed framing of the crime of aggression when the Rome Statute came into being, the solution was to point out in the Statute that the crime of aggression falls within the substantive jurisdiction of the ICC, but that an amendment to the Statute was required that defines the crime and sets out the specific conditions for the Court’s exercise of jurisdiction with respect to this crime.</p>
<p>The Kampala Conference adopted the amendments that were necessary to enable the ICC to exercise jurisdiction with respect to the crime of aggression. The definition of the crime introduced through the Kampala amendments consists of two elements. One concerns the act of aggression committed by a state, and the other concerns what acts an individual bears criminal liability for. The definition is set out in Article 8 bis of the Rome Statute. It states that ‘crime of aggression’ means the planning, preparation, initiation or execution of an act of aggression which, by its character, gravity and scale, constitutes a manifest violation of the Charter of the United Nations. The Article states that a crime of aggression can only be committed by a person in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military action of a State. This requirement means that it is a crime of leadership. An act of aggression means the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations. The provision also states that all acts specified in United Nations General Assembly resolution 3314 (XXIX) of 14 December 1974, qualify as acts of aggression. This can, for instance, involve an invasion or an attack by the armed forces of a State on the territory of another State.</p>
<p>The jurisdiction of the ICC with respect to the crime of aggression was activated through a separate decision in December 2017. In conjunction with this, the States Parties to the Rome Statute agreed that its jurisdiction will be limited in that only a State Party in respect of which the Kampala amendments regarding the crime of aggression have entered into force will be covered by the ICC’s jurisdiction with respect to the crime concerned.</p>
<h2>Sweden should criminalise the crime of aggression</h2>
<p>Preponderance of reasons for criminalising the crime of aggression in Swedish law</p>
<p>One starting point for this assessment has been that Sweden, as a State Party to the Rome Statute, has undertaken to work for the achievement of the aims underlying the Statute, including the fundamental norm of international law that states must not launch attacks on other states. Moreover, Sweden has long been strongly committed to promoting the development of international humanitarian law and human rights. A criminalisation of the crime of aggression in Swedish law can therefore be seen as a natural continuation of Swedish efforts to counter impunity for the most serious international crimes and of the consistent support shown by Sweden for the ICC since its foundation. One important starting point for the activities of the ICC is that national jurisdiction takes precedence over the jurisdiction of the ICC, as long as a national investigation is under way or has been carried out and the national prosecution proceedings are functioning in a satisfactory way. Even though there is no explicit requirement that States Parties introduce national legislation criminalising the crimes with respect to which the ICC has jurisdiction, the Rome Statute is based on the fundamental assumption that both the ICC and individual states have jurisdiction with respect to the crimes covered by the Statute. This has been considered to be a strong reason why, after ratifying the Kampala amendments with respect to the crime of aggression, Sweden should also introduce national criminal provisions that criminalise this crime. In making this assessment, the Inquiry has also considered what practical importance criminalisation by Sweden of the crime of aggression can be expected to have, certain security policy aspects and difficulties arising in application of the law with respect to a crime with as strong political overtones as the crime of aggression, as well as drafting aspects and questions of jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes placing provisions about the crime of aggression in the Act on Criminal Responsibility for Genocide, Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes (2014:406), whose name should be changed</p>
<p>The Act on Criminal Responsibility for Genocide, Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes (2014:406) was adopted so as to enable Sweden to prosecute persons for the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes to the same extent as is possible at the ICC. That Act criminalises these crimes in Swedish law. Certain inchoate forms of crimes such as attempt, preparation or conspiracy to commit a crime and failure to reveal or prevent a crime are punishable under the Act. In criminalising the crime of aggression in Swedish law, it is appropriate to place the penal provisions regarding this crime in this Act, whose name the Inquiry proposes changing to the Act on Certain International Crimes.</p>
<p>Main elements of the crime of aggression in Swedish law</p>
<p>The proposed provisions on the crime of aggression in Swedish law adhere closely to the regulation of the crime in the Rome Statute. Thus only a person who can exercise control of or direct the political or military action of a State can be convicted of a crime of aggression. The crucial factor in determining whether a person belongs to the group being referred to is the perpetrator’s actual possibility of exercising control of or directing the action of the attacking State, while a person’s formal position or professional rank is not decisive.</p>
<p>For consideration to be given to guilt of a crime of aggression, the Inquiry proposes that a person specified above has to plan, prepare, initiate or execute an act of aggression which, by its character, gravity and scale, constitutes a manifest violation of the Charter of the United Nations. An act of aggression is proposed to mean the use of armed force by a State against the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of another State, in a manner that is inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations. It is proposed that the list of acts of aggression in Article 8 bis of the Rome Statute should provide guidance in the examination of whether there is an act of aggression, but not be included in the Swedish criminal provisions on crimes of aggression.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes making attempt, preparation and conspiracy to commit a crime of aggression punishable, along with failure to reveal or prevent such a crime. The restriction that only a person who can exercise control of or direct the political or military action of a State can be convicted of a crime also applies to these inchoate forms of the crime of aggression.</p>
<p>The penalty for a crime of aggression is proposed to be imprisonment for a set period, at least four years and at most eighteen years, or for life. The crime of aggression should not be covered by the statute of limitation rules.</p>
<p>Jurisdiction and authorisation to prosecute with respect to the crime of aggression</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes Swedish courts should have largely the same jurisdiction as the ICC to hear cases of crimes of aggression. So there should be jurisdiction with respect to crimes where the act of aggression that forms the basis for the crime has been committed by a State with respect to which the Kampala amendments regarding the crime of aggression have entered into force. In certain cases, however, there should be unlimited Swedish jurisdiction, i.e. irrespective of whether or not the State that has committed the act of aggression has ratified the Kampala amendments. This is the case if the crime of aggression has a strong connection to Sweden, which is, for instance, so if the crime has been committed in Sweden or by a person who was, at the time of the crime, a Swedish citizen or habitually resident here, as well as if the crime was aimed at a Swedish interest. The Inquiry proposes placing the jurisdiction rules for the crime of aggression in the Act on Criminal Responsibility for Genocide, Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes (2014:406), (to be called the Act on Certain International Crimes after the proposed change of name), while jurisdiction with respect to the other crimes in the Rome Statute should continue to be regulated in Chapter 2 of the Penal Code.</p>
<p>Before a prosecution can be brought for a crime of aggression, the Government must have issued authorisation to prosecute.</p>
<h2>Swedish criminal jurisdiction Starting points for the Inquiry's deliberations</h2>
<p>The central provisions on Swedish criminal jurisdiction are set out in Chapter 2 of the Penal Code. These provisions have been amended and supplemented on a large number of occasions and the regulations have been considered to be badly arranged and complicated. There are also a number of provisions about jurisdiction in special criminal legislation. One explicit starting point for the Inquiry’s deliberations and its proposals for a coherent and easily applied regulation of criminal jurisdiction is the above-mentioned report of the Inquiry on International Criminal Law (SOU 2002:98) and ministry memorandum (Ds 2014:13). The Inquiry’s proposal brings together the general provisions on criminal jurisdiction in Chapter 2 of the Penal Code, which is given a new wording and the new heading On the jurisdiction of Swedish courts.  The provisions on jurisdiction are framed on the basis of the connection principles of international law.</p>
<p>To the extent that the provisions on jurisdiction in special criminal legislation are judged to be necessary, they should be retained; in other cases the general provisions in Chapter 2 of the Penal Code should be applied.</p>
<h2>New wording of Chapter 2 of the Penal Code</h2>
<p>Jurisdiction with respect to offences committed in Sweden</p>
<p>The territoriality principle, i.e. the principle that a State has jurisdiction with respect to offences committed on its own territory, has a special status in international law as a basis for national jurisdiction. Based on this principle, Swedish courts should have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed in Sweden, as is the case under the current law. Rules about localising offences, and about offences of omission, are also added to the provision about jurisdiction with respect to offences committed in Sweden. In addition, provisions are also introduced about the localisation of offences that constitute complicity in another person’s offences.</p>
<p>Jurisdiction with respect to offences committed outside Sweden</p>
<p>For offences committed outside Sweden the Inquiry proposes that Swedish courts should have jurisdiction if the offence was committed on board a Swedish ship or aircraft by the commander or a crew member of a Swedish ship or aircraft in the course of their duty. A new provision is proposed to the effect that Swedish courts have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed on an establishment in the Swedish economic zone or on the Swedish part of the continental shelf.</p>
<p>As is the case at present, Swedish courts should also have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed abroad by a person who, at the time of the offence, was a Swedish citizen or was habitually resident in Sweden or had, when a prosecution was brought for the offence, acquired Swedish citizenship or become habitually resident in Sweden. It is proposed that the previously applicable provisions about Swedish jurisdiction with respect to crimes committed by persons who are citizens of another Nordic country not be included in the new wording of Chapter 2 of the Penal Code. Nor is a provision proposed about jurisdiction with respect to offences that can result in imprisonment for more than six months committed by an alien who is in this country.</p>
<p>It is also proposed that Swedish courts should have jurisdiction with respect to offences aimed at a Swedish private interest. This means a Swedish citizen or someone else who is habitually resident in Sweden, as well as a Swedish legal person.</p>
<p>There should also be jurisdiction with respect to offences aimed at a Swedish public interest. This is the case for offences aimed at national security, public activities or any other Swedish interest given special protection by the legal system.</p>
<p>Swedish courts should also have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed in the exercise of a post or an assignment comprising a public position.</p>
<p>It is also proposed that Swedish courts should have jurisdiction with respect to offences committed by someone who is in Sweden if a foreign state has requested that prosecution of the offence be transferred to Sweden. The same should apply if a request for extradition or surrender for the offence has not been granted. The Inquiry also proposes that there should be jurisdiction if the offence is covered by an international agreement or other commitment that is binding on Sweden under which there is an obligation to examine, without making any exception, the question of prosecution if the suspect is not extradited or surrendered.</p>
<p>In the case of certain offences there is Swedish jurisdiction even without any particular connection to Sweden being required. This should be the case, as it is under the law at present, for the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. There should also be Swedish jurisdiction for the majority of the offences currently regulated in Chapter 2, Section 3, point 6 of the Penal Code. The Inquiry proposes a new provision laying down that Swedish courts have jurisdiction with respect to acts covered by the term torture  under Article 1 of the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and to attempts to commit these offences.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes abolishing the provision in Chapter 2, Section 3, point 7 of the Penal Code on jurisdiction with respect to offences for which the least severe penalty prescribed in Swedish law is imprisonment for four years or longer. The main reason for doing so is that enabling Swedish courts to have jurisdiction with respect to offences that have no connection whatsoever to Sweden is not judged to be a legitimate interest for Sweden in cases other than those concerning serious crimes against international law.</p>
<p>A requirement of ‘dual criminality’ applies as the main rule to jurisdiction with respect to offences committed outside Sweden. This means that, as a rule, there is only Swedish jurisdiction if the act is also punishable under the law of the place where it was committed. However some exceptions are proposed; they include offences for which the least severe penalty prescribed in Swedish law is imprisonment for four years or longer. The Inquiry proposes a new provision laying down that if an offence has been committed on the area of several states, the requirement of dual criminality is met if the act is punishable under the law of at least one of the other places where it was committed.</p>
<p>Authorisation to prosecute</p>
<p>For crimes committed outside Sweden, the main rule should be, as is the case at present, that authorisation to prosecute has to be issued. In certain exceptional cases authorisation to prosecute should also be required for offences committed in Sweden.</p>
<p>In the majority of cases the Prosecutor-General should be responsible for the examination of authorisation to prosecute. However, in certain exceptional cases, which may typically involve foreign or security policy considerations, the Government should have the exclusive competence to examine the question of authorisation to prosecute. In addition to crimes of aggression, this should also be the case for, for instance, offences committed in Sweden by an alien in the exercise of certain posts comprising a public position held with another state or international organisation.</p>
<p>In the case of offences committed abroad by a Swedish citizen or an alien who is habitually resident in Sweden the Prosecutor-General should be able to transfer the examination to another public prosecutor.</p>
<p>The proposal sets up a number of assessment criteria for the Prosecutor-General's examination. That examination should take particular account of whether a prosecution in Sweden is consistent with Sweden’s commitments under international law, the extent to which the criminal activity or the suspect has a connection to Sweden, whether measures for a prosecution have been initiated or will be initiated by another State or at an international court and what the actual possibilities are of investigating the offence and prosecuting the suspect in Sweden.</p>
<p>If there is reason to assume that the examination is of particular importance for Sweden’s foreign or security policy, the case should always be transferred to the Government for decision.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposals</h2>
<p>The criminalisation of the crime of aggression in Swedish law may result in costs for investigations of crimes of that kind, for subsequent legal proceedings and for imprisonment. However, the number of crimes of aggression that need to be handled by Swedish authorities will in all likelihood be extremely small. It should therefore be possible</p>
<p>to accommodate the costs that may arise on account of the criminalisation of the crime of aggression within existing appropriations.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposal of a new wording of Chapter 2 of the Penal Code will probably require the provision of some training for the people who have to apply the provisions. However, training costs are generally accommodated within government agencies’ general appropriations, so the training that may be required will also have to be accommodated within existing cost limits.</p>
<p>In other respects, the Inquiry’s proposals are not judged to have any consequences of the kind stated in the Committees Ordinance (1998:1474).</p>
