<p>The Commission’s remit has been to carry out a comprehensive review of the Extradition for Criminal Offences Act (1957:668) (the Extradition Act ). The remit also included monitoring the work to produce a third Additional Protocol to the European Convention on Extradition of 13 December 1957 and to consider the issue of ratification. Moreover, the Commission was required to take a position on whether Sweden should adopt the protocol of 15 May 2003, amending the 1977 European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism. Finally, the Commission had the task of carrying out a review of the provisions governing extradition to  Sweden under the Ordinance containing certain provisions on extradition for criminal offences (1982:306).</p>
<p>The Extradition Act, which has its roots in the first Swedish Extradition Act from 1913, has been in force since 1 January 1958 and is essentially based on the 1957 Convention on Extradition, which was drawn up within the framework of the Council of Europe. The Act contains rules on extradition from Sweden to another state for legal proceedings or the enforcement of a sentence in all cases in which extradition is requested by a state outside the Nordic region or the EU. It contains a number of grounds for rejecting an extradition request and rules of procedure. The review is thus not concerned with the European Arrest Warrant Act or the procedures that apply to Nordic states; in other words, the Commission’s remit only concerns extradition issues involving states outside the EU or the Nordic region.</p>
<p>Under the Extradition Act, a Swedish citizen may not be extradited. For an extradition to be possible, there are additional requirements concerning dual criminality, the gravity of the offence or the length of imprisonment, and proof of guilt. The possibilities of extraditing individuals for offences that are considered to be of a military or political nature are extremely limited. Moreover, extra-</p>
<p>dition is not permitted, if this would mean that the person whose extradition is requested risks being subjected to serious persecution, or if this otherwise would be in violation of human rights. If extradition is approved, the Extradition Act requires that certain conditions are also met. The person who is extradited may not be prosecuted or punished in the other state for any other offence committed prior to extradition (the ‘rule of speciality’ ) without the consent of the Government in the particular case. Nor may the person be re-extradited to another state without the consent of the Government. In addition, as a general rule, the conditions must be set that the person who is extradited may not be prosecuted for the offence in question in a temporary or extraordinary court, nor may the person be subject to capital punishment.</p>
<p>Decisions on extradition are taken by the Government. If the person, whose extradition is requested, does not consent to extradition, the Supreme Court must examine whether there are legal grounds for extradition. If the Supreme Court rules that there is an impediment to extradition, the Government is bound not to extradite. In other cases, the Government has full discretionary powers. This means that the Government is not obliged to extradite, even if all of the legal conditions for extradition are met. However, if there is a valid extradition agreement between Sweden and the requesting state, the agreement may mean that Sweden, on the basis of international law and other than in exceptional cases, does not have the right to refuse extradition. Bilateral agreements are currently in force with Australia, Canada and the United States. The reason for the current system with the Government as decision-maker is that extradition cases can have a bearing on foreign and security policy, which is the sole responsibility of the Government.</p>
<p>The number of cases of extradition from  Sweden is at the most 20 per year, whereas the number of cases of requests for extradition to  Sweden is about half that, i.e. a maximum of ten per year. In the past twenty years or so, requests for extradition from  Sweden have primarily come from the rest of Europe, Turkey and the Caucasus, and in many cases from Russia and other former parts of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Commission’s point of departure for the review was that extradition from Sweden for legal proceedings or the enforcement of a sentence must occur in a speedy, legally secure and efficient way, with due consideration paid to Sweden’s obligations under international law. In this connection, the Commission proposes a</p>
<p>completely new Extradition Act, whereby the general courts – with the district court as the first instance – alleviate the Government and the Supreme Court and fully takes on the role as decisionmaking body in all cases under the Act. In the interest of legal security, the circumstances and conditions of extradition should be clearly stated, as should the use of coercive measures in extradition cases.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, a transfer of the right of decision to the general courts has several advantages. It is more appropriate that extradition cases are dealt with in proceedings that are strictly of a judicial nature. In a court of law, the two-party procedure and the oral principle are a natural part, with a public authority – the Swedish Prosecution Authority in extradition cases – confronting the person in question. At the same time, the process offers greater opportunities for insight and transparency. It may also be assumed that proceedings that are strictly of a judicial nature could lead to a quicker processing, without compromising the legal rights of the individual. Court proceedings, whereby an examination begins in a general lower court and there is the possibility to appeal to the court of appeal and the Supreme Court (with the customary requirement that leave to appeal is granted), also provide better legal security for the individual compared with the current situation, where a court examination takes place in just one  court.</p>
<p>However, the Government should also henceforth have full control over extradition cases where Swedish foreign and security policy is concerned. This currently follows from the Government’s discretionary right of review and right of decision. Here, the Commission proposes that the Government should be able – through a procedural declaration  to the court – to guarantee that a request for extradition is not approved right up until an extradition order has been enforced. It is proposed that a procedural declaration from the Government with reference to foreign and security policy (an area under which military and political crimes should also fall) should represent an absolute impediment to extradition in a judicial examination.</p>
<p>Thanks to a more comprehensive regulation of the circumstances and conditions for extradition, it has been possible to better highlight protection of human rights in the new Extradition Act, e.g. by referring explicitly to the European Convention and the Rights of the Child. The impediments to extradition and the conditions for extradition are, in the Commission’s proposal, generally explained</p>
<p>in greater detail, but they are essentially based on the main features of the present law. This means that special attention is still given to the risk of capital punishment, torture, persecution or to due process concerns in the requesting state.</p>
<p>As already stated, the extradition of Swedish citizens  is not at all possible under the current regulations. The Commission proposes a relaxation of the absolute ban. In the present globalised world, an absolute ban seems out-dated and not very satisfactory. Swedish citizenship is not an impediment to extradition within the EU or the Nordic region either. Henceforth, Sweden should therefore be in a better position to contribute to legal proceedings being initiated for crimes of an international nature by ensuring that legal action is taken in the place where the procedural and practical conditions are best. A Swedish citizen who has committed a serious crime or lived for a long time in another country and committed a crime there should therefore not be able to avoid being subject to legal action simply by travelling to Sweden. It is therefore proposed that the extradition of Swedish citizens for the purpose of legal action  be possible under certain conditions (including considerations of the Swedish citizen’s links to the other state and the seriousness of the crime), as long as other general conditions are met and on the express condition, that the Swedish citizen is returned to Sweden, following legal proceedings in the other country, so that a penal sentence can be enforced here, provided that the convicted person does not consent to the enforcement of the sentence in the country in question. However, the Commission proposes that extradition of Swedish citizens for the enforcement of a sentence  should only be possible in situations where the Swedish citizen has explicitly consented to serve the sentence in the other state.</p>
<p>For the purpose of generally simplifying and speeding up the extradition procedure – mainly between countries in the Council of Europe and in cases where the person whose extradition is requested has consented  to extradition – the Commission proposes that Sweden ratify the third Additional Protocol to the 1957 Convention on Extradition. Special provisions for this kind of simplified extradition procedure are also proposed in the new Extradition Act.</p>
<p>In the Commission’s view, the amending protocol of 15 May 2003 to the 1977 European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism  can be expected to result in improved extradition cooperation concerning terrorism-related crime. The Commission, therefore, considers that it is a natural step for Sweden to also</p>
<p>ratify the protocol. The Commission does not consider that any special provisions are needed in the Extradition Act in this respect.</p>
<p>Where extradition to  Sweden is concerned, the Commission essentially proposes that the current regulation remains in place in substance, but it has also provided a completely new and revised Extradition Ordinance as a supplement to the new Extradition Act.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposal for a new extradition procedure thus entails that the general courts are given responsibility for a completely new type of cases, while the Supreme Court and the Government Offices are relieved of a large part of the present responsibility for extradition cases. In view of this, the Commission finds that its new proposals will be cost-neutral.</p>
<p>The Commission suggests that the new Extradition Act and the consequential amendments enter into force at the earliest on 1 January 2014.</p>
