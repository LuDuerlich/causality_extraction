<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>On 22 June 1998, the European Parliament and the Council of Europe adopted Directive 98/30/EC on common rules for the internal market for natural gas (Chapter 7). The Natural Gas Market Directive is aimed at increasing the competition on the gas market and creating an internal market for natural gas. To achieve this, the Directive includes provisions for ensuring that owners of transmission and distribution networks will allow other players access to these networks. The Directive is much more far-reaching and comprehensive than the present Swedish legislation in the field of natural gas (Chapter 6).</p>
<p>The main task of the committee is to submit a proposal for natural gas legislation that will meet the requirements of the new Directive. According to the committee directives, the work on the new legislation should aim at the regulations serving as a basis for a socio-economically efficient market. However, it should also be borne in mind that the Swedish natural gas market is less developed than the markets in most other European countries, and that a lack of equilibrium in the opening of the gas markets should be avoided. Current international deliberations concerning the natural gas network in the Nordic countries and the Baltic Sea region should also be taken into account. Chapter 1  gives more detailed particulars of the points of departure for the work of the committee and the implementation of the work.</p>
<p>The report is arranged in the form three main parts, i.e. a background part, a part describing the points of departure, and a proposals part.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Chapter 2  presents a review of some fundamental aspects of natural gas. This relates, for example, to characteristics, fields of application, and the supply of and demand for natural gas.</p>
<p>Natural gas consists of gaseous hydrocarbons, the main component of which is methane. The gas also contains small quantities of nitrogen and unmeasurable quantities of heavy metals, and its combustion produces less carbon dioxide than other fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Natural gas is predominantly transported in underground pipes. A pipeline system consists principally of transmission and distribution pipes. In many cases, the gas is transported by its inherent pressure. If higher transmission capacities are needed, compressor stations are built as necessary in order to increase the gas pressure and thus the transmission capacity of the pipes. The gas delivery is metered and the pressure is reduced in metering and control stations (MC stations). The laying of pipes demands a certain amount of land area. This area is greatest during the laying stage, which consists of operations such as clearing, felling, building of transport roads and excavation of pipe trenches. When the pipe-laying work has been completed, the land can be restored for agricultural use. However, some impact on the land may occur. As an example, loss of harvest may occur during the construction year. In forested terrain, a 7-metre wide cleared lane must be left when the work has been completed. The principal effect of a gas pipeline on forestry is the loss of production from the cleared lane.</p>
<p>The world's known reserves of natural gas are expected to last for more than 65 years at the present extraction rate (about 185 years if the possible or probable reserves are included). In Europe, the reserves are concentrated to Norway, the Netherlands and Great Britain. However, a large proportion of the world's gas reserves is in the vicinity of Europe, e.g. in Russia, Algeria and Iran. Europe accounts for around 13 percent of world production of natural gas, and around 20 percent of the consumption. This represents a significant import dependence. The imports originate principally from Russia and Algeria. By far the biggest gas producers in Europe are Great Britain, the Netherlands and Norway.</p>
<p>In Europe, the importance of natural gas as a source of energy is of a relatively recent date. However, the proportion of gas in primary energy consumption has risen from around 7 percent in 1970 to more than 20 percent in 1997. This has mainly taken place at the expense of oil and coal. In the EU, natural gas is now the second biggest source of energy after oil. The EU expects the consumption of natural gas to increase by 45â€“70 percent between now and the year 2020.</p>
<p>Due to its properties, natural gas has a number of applications. It is used to varying extents in sectors such as electricity and heat generation, industry, single-family houses and larger premises, and also for transport.</p>
<p>The natural gas network in Europe is extensive. Most of Europe (including Sweden) is interconnected in a natural gas network. A large proportion of the supply is from sources in the North Sea, North Africa and Russia, which are thus also linked to the European system.</p>
<p>Chapter 3  includes an analysis of the gas market structure. The natural gas market can be said to differ from conventional markets in a number of areas, and the purpose of the chapter is mainly to outline the features that characterize the gas market.</p>
<p>The extraction/production, transport and sale of natural gas can be regarded as a "network industry". A network industry is characterized by its high dependence on an infrastructure in the form of a network that interconnects the production of the basic product of the industry and the end consumers of these products.</p>
<p>The fact that the conditions for competition and market-governed pricing and capacity utilization of network industries differ from those of "ordinary" industries is due to two circumstances. The first of these is that there are generally significant benefits of scale in the construction and operation of the infrastructure ("transport network") of network industries. The benefits of scale result in the cost of maintaining a certain transport capacity being lower in a relatively large-scale transport network than it is in two or more parallel transport networks that together have the same capacity. If these benefits of scale are significant, the "production" of transport services is a natural monopoly.</p>
<p>The other circumstance of significance to the conditions for competition and market-governed pricing and capacity utilization is that network industries often offer vertical integration benefits, i.e. the costs of producing and delivering a certain quantity of the basic product will be lower if the utilization of the production plants and transport infrastructure are coordinated within the framework of integrated operations.</p>
<p>Another characteristic of the natural gas market is that the investments necessary for building a natural gas infrastructure which is significant from the energy supply viewpoint are not only large, but are also irreversible in all important respects, i.e. the pipework basically cannot be put to any alternative use. In addition, the pipelines and other parts of the infrastructure have a very long useful life. As a result of the combination of large scale, irreversibility and a long useful life, investments of this type generally involve a significant economic risk. The magnitude of this risk is dependent on the capacity utilization and the solvency of the network users during the life cycle of the plant. These circumstances depend, in turn, on how much natural gas the end customers demand and how much they are willing to pay for it. The prices that the network owners can command also depend on the import prices and the taxation of natural gas. The traditional method for reducing the economic risks of the network owners has been vertical integration of the transmission and supply, combined with long-term contracts with customers.</p>
<p>All western European natural gas supply has traditionally been based on long-term contracts. Large and long contracts have been regarded as representing an important condition for guaranteeing a return on the high capital investment in production. These have also secured the utilization of the transport network and improved the security of supply. The longterm agreements are generally drawn up as "take or pay" agreements. In such agreements, the customer undertakes to accept a minimum volume and the vendor to deliver a maximum volume. The customer must pay for the minimum volume even if the natural gas consumption has not attained the contracted minimum level.</p>
<p>The pricing principles applied on the natural gas market differs from those employed on customary markets. The natural gas price is generally based on the alternative cost the customer would have to pay, normally for oil. On gas markets that have been opened to competition, such as in Great Britain, the pricing is set instead in relation to the gas price offered by other suppliers, i.e. the gas has acquired its "own" price.</p>
<p>The gas market in Western Europe has been characterized by strong monopolistic elements. The combination of benefits of scale in the transport network and vertical integration benefits between production and transport are the most important reasons for most network industries in many countries having long had a dominating, vertically integrated, often state-owned company. The dominating company has usually also been responsible for the construction of the infrastructure. However, the growth in demand and the technical development have gradually created new conditions, so that the traditional structure is no longer the best for promoting efficiency and low prices. New technology in particular has reduced the benefits of vertical integration between production and transport. On the whole, this development has created the conditions for an industrial structure in which the infrastructure is operated as a natural monopoly, while production/imports and sales to the end users take place in competition and are based on free pricing. Important changes have taken place in recent years with the aim of increasing the competition. This applies principally to Great Britain, which now has a completely deregulated gas market, i.e. all customers have the right to choose their suppliers.</p>
<p>Chapter 4  describes the Swedish natural gas market in aspects such as extent, players, agreements, volumes and utilization.</p>
<p>Sweden is a small player on the natural gas market, and we have neither reserves nor any production of natural gas. Since 1985, we have been buying natural gas from Danish fields.</p>
<p>The gas network has been built gradually and now covers more than 25 municipalities in southernmost Sweden and on the West Coast. The transmission pipeline runs between MalmÃ¶ and Gothenburg, and branch pipelines and distribution pipes are connected to it. The transmission pipeline has an annual capacity of 2 billion m of gas, which corresponds to 22 TWh. By installing compressors, the capacity can be increased to around 30 TWh.</p>
<p>The national market in Sweden is characterized by a few players with strong monopolistic elements. All natural gas is imported by Vattenfall Naturgas AB. The company sells natural gas to local and regional distribution companies, to electricity and heat generation utilities, and to end users. Vattenfall Naturgas AB also owns and operates the Swedish transmission pipeline. On individual local markets, the distributors basically have a monopoly. Among the distributors, Sydgas AB is biggest and delivers around 75 percent of the gas consumed in Sweden. In some areas, Sydgas AB sells gas to local sub-distributors, who have built local distribution networks.</p>
<p>The agreements and pricing on the Swedish natural gas market basically follow the make-up described in Chapter 3. The contract between Vattenfall Naturgas AB and the Danish supplier, DONG Naturgas A/S, is of a take or pay nature and has a duration of about 20 years. It expires in 2003, 2006 and 2010. The agreements with the distributors are of a similar nature to the import agreements.</p>
<p>Natural gas accounts for less than 2 percent of the total energy supply in Sweden. However, in the areas in which natural gas has been introduced, it accounts for around 20 percent of the energy supply, i.e. around the same as in Europe. Natural gas has basically replaced oil in industry, in combined heat and power (CHP) generation and in district heating stations. Out of the total volume consumed in Sweden, more than 42 percent are used for electric power and heat generation, around 40 percent in industry, and about 17 percent in households, other buildings and smaller industrial plants. The natural gas used by households for heating accounts for only 3â€“4 percent of the total consumption.</p>
<p>An optimistic estimate is that the total potential for connection to the present pipe network is around 1.5 billion m of natural gas. Any volume increase is likely mainly for CHP generation, but the expansion of CHP is considered to be hampered by the make-up of the tax system and the low electricity prices. A very large proportion of the industrial plants in the existing area are now connected to the gas system. However, the household sector has a relatively low proportion of connection which is largely due to district heating being well established within the region.</p>
<p>Chapter 5  contains a review of the natural gas issue in Sweden, in neighbouring countries and in Europe.</p>
<p>Natural gas has acquired growing importance for energy supplies in the Baltic Sea region. The consensus of opinion is that the natural gas market will increase substantially in the immediate future. Finland and the Baltic States (and also many Eastern European countries) which are connected only to the Russian supply network are looking for alternative supply paths and suppliers. Interconnection of the natural gas networks in the Baltic Sea region and a connection to the Western European gas network would increase the supply opportunities, improve the security of supply and boost the competition in the entire region. It would also provide scope for substantially increased storage capacity.</p>
<p>New supply paths through the Baltic Sea region are also of great interest to the consumer countries in Western Europe. A larger number and more secure supply paths from Russia would also increase the security of supply and the competition on the European gas market. Since dependence on imports will increase, efforts are also made to increase imports and establish new supply paths from countries such as Norway and Algeria. For natural reasons, Norway is very interested in a larger number of supply paths to the European market.</p>
<p>In northern Europe, the growing interest in natural gas has been taken up in the inter-state energy cooperation. This is an important element in the extensive activities in the field of energy which is focused on expanded Baltic Sea cooperation.</p>
<p>In Sweden, parliament has adopted guidelines in 1988 for natural gas utilization. According to these guidelines, gas shall be purchased on strictly commercial principles. Gas must have the inherent potential to compete on the Swedish energy market. Commercial negotiations shall be pursued at corporate level. The social assessment of a natural gas project shall also be made in conjunction with the appraisal of applications for permission in accordance with the Pipeline Law. Finally, supply must take place in conformance with the energy policy guidelines. Social objectives must thus be met as regards reliability of supply, contingency storage and the environment.</p>
<p>Several studies concerning the establishment of natural gas in Sweden have been made in recent years. The Nordic Gas Grid study examines the opportunities available for a Nordic natural gas network which receives the gas from the reserves in Norway and Russia. A study carried out by North Transgas Oy examines the opportunities available for laying a natural gas pipeline from Russia to Western Europe. If established, natural gas would be transported from Russia, possibly via Finland and Sweden, to Western Europe. A study is also planned into an additional transport path for natural gas between Germany, Sweden and Denmark, known as The Baltic Gas Interconnector. The purpose of the study is to investigate the opportunities available for using new supply paths to link together the existing gas pipelines in southern Scandinavia with the continental system, with the aim of, among other things, increasing competition and reliability of supply.</p>
<h2>Points of departure</h2>
<p>Chapter 6  describes the laws that regulate the laying and operation of gas pipelines. In addition, a brief description is given of the opportunities available for gaining access to the land necessary for a gas pipeline.</p>
<p>The central legislation includes the Law (1978:160) on certain pipelines (the Pipeline Law), which principally deals with concession (permission) matters. According to the law, a concession is needed for laying or using a pipeline for the transport of natural gas (although no permit is needed for distribution pipelines, for example). The application for a concession is examined by the Government, although the application is submitted to the Swedish National Energy Administration. A concession may be granted only if it is appropriate from the public viewpoint for the pipeline to be run and used, and if the applicant is considered to be suitable for running the operations covered by the concession. The concession must not be in conflict with the detailed development plan or regional regulations. When assessing an application for a concession, the environmental code shall be applied. The assessment of an application for a concession involves the pipeline company being subjected to an overall assessment in all respects in which social interests apply.</p>
<p>The Pipeline Law (just like other legislation in the area) has no detailed provisions for the trading in and transport of natural gas. It only states that the concessionaire is responsible, against payment of a fee, for allowing others access for transport through the pipeline, if this can be done without significant detriment to the concessionaire.</p>
<p>A number of other laws shall be taken into account. This includes the Planning and Building Law, which includes provision for the plan preparation for land and water, and for construction. The Environmental Code, which came into force on 1 January 1999, governs the fundamental environmental conditions. The objective of the Environmental Code is to promote sustainable development and thus assure present and future generations of a healthy and good living environment. Other laws are the Road Law, the Law on Ancient Monuments, the Law on the Continental Shelf, and the Law on Flammable and Explosive Goods.</p>
<p>There are also detailed safety provisions. The National Inspectorate of Explosives and Flammables has issued, among others, the National</p>
<p>Inspectorate and Explosive and Flammables Natural Gas Regulations and General Advice on the Regulations. The regulations apply to the design, laying and operation of natural gas pipeline systems.</p>
<p>The right to use land for gas pipelines is regulated by the Pipeline Rights Law, and the Expropriation Law.</p>
<p>Chapter 7  contains an outline of the EC Natural Gas Market Directive. The main purpose of the directive is to create a competitive market for natural gas. The Directive contains common rules for access to the system, transmission, distribution, delivery and storage of natural gas, etc.</p>
<p>The central provisions of the Directive to increase competition are in Chapter VI which governs access to the system. The main objective is to give third parties access to the system, i.e. to give the customer an opportunity to choose his gas supplier. The Directive allows for different procedures for access to the pipeline network. The choice is available between negotiated and regulated access, or both of these procedures. Regulated access gives the legal right to use the network on payment of published tariffs and/or other conditions and obligations. On the other hand, negotiated access gives the right to negotiate the conditions for access to the networks.</p>
<p>The member states shall specify which customers in the respective country shall have access to the system, with the aim of concluding agreements or of purchasing natural gas. The definition of such "entitled customers" is designed to lead to the opening of the market which corresponds to 20 percent of the total annual gas consumption on the national market. This proportion should increase to 28 percent five years after the Directive has come into force and to 33 percent after 10 years.</p>
<p>The member states shall adopt the necessary measures for safeguarding that at least customers who have gas-fired electric power generation (with some exceptions) and other end users who have an annual consumption of more than 25 million m3 of gas per consumption point are designated as entitled customers. For the group of other end users, the threshold shall be lowered to 15 million m3 5 years after the Directive has come into force, and 5 million m3 after 10 years.</p>
<p>Another important item in the Directive is its provisions for separate accounting (Chapter V). A central element is to avoid discrimination, cross-subsidizing and distortion of competition. Integrated natural gas companies shall therefore have separate accounting in their internal book-keeping for the fields of transmission, distribution and storage of natural gas and, where appropriate, shall prepare collective accounts for the activities outside the gas sector, in a manner that would have been required of them if the relevant activities were pursued in separate companies.</p>
<p>Other main items in the Directive include Chapter II which deals with general rules for the organization of the sector. This includes the provision that member states can direct natural gas companies, in the public economic interest, to provide public services. These may concern safety, including security of supply, regular deliveries, quality and price of deliveries, and also environmental protection. Such services shall be clearly defined, open, non-discriminatory, and capable of being checked. With reference to public service obligations, it is possible to exclude the application of certain sections in the Directive. The chapter also deals with permission to build or operate natural gas plants.</p>
<p>Chapter III regulates certain matters related to transmission, storage and/or LNG companies. The companies shall operate, maintain and develop safe, reliable and efficient transmission, storage and/or LNG plants on commercial terms, with due consideration to the environment. Under no circumstances may companies discriminate between different system users or categories of system users, particularly if such discrimination would be to the benefit of its associated companies. The companies are also charged with some information responsibilities. If the information is commercially sensitive, it shall be treated confidentially. Chapter IV contains largely corresponding provisions for distribution companies. The only difference is that member states can charge distribution companies and/or supply companies with responsibility for supplying customers in a certain area and/or of a certain category.</p>
<p>The Natural Gas Market Directive can also allow various forms of exemptions from the rules on matters such as market opening and access to the system. In the case of Swedish companies, an application can be lodged with the Commission for a temporary exemption (maximum of 10 years) if the Directive were to cause serious problems within a geographically limited area, especially as regards the development of the transmission infrastructure, and if the objective is to encourage investments. Moreover, a natural gas company can apply for a temporary exemption from the rules concerning access to the system if the company faces or risks facing serious economic or financial difficulties due to "take or pay" undertakings.</p>
<p>The rules in the Natural Gas Market Directive specify the targets that should be achieved, while the member states themselves can choose the way in which they should be achieved. The make-up of the Directive thus gives every member state a certain amount of latitude in choosing the arrangement which is best suited to a certain situation. Chapter 8 analyses various ways of achieving the targets and the effects that may conceivably arise if one alternative or the other is chosen.</p>
<p>The choice of access form to the gas pipeline networks, which is the central part of the analysis in the chapter, can be assumed to affect the gas market and its players in different ways. Two important areas are how competition and readiness to invest are affected. The Natural Gas Market Directive is aimed at increasing competition on the gas market, but a well established infrastructure for natural gas is also one (of several) condition for achieving an effective market. In a sense, a conflict situation thus arises between the objective of achieving effective competition on the natural gas market and the economic incentives for setting up the infrastructure for natural gas. Significant economic risks are generally incurred in infrastructure investments. The traditional method of reducing the economic risks of network owners has been the vertical integration of transmission and supply, combined with long-term contracts with customers. This has substantially limited the access to the networks to third parties and has reduced the competition. Competition aspects and readiness to invest in the infrastructure must therefore be weighed against one another. A central question will therefore be how the two access forms affect the readiness to invest in the infrastructure. A concrete assessment that must be made in this context is how regulated access weakens the incentive to such an extent that negotiated access should be given preference to regulated access.</p>
<p>The analysis indicates that the requirement for examination and publication of tariffs in regulated access limits, to some extent, the freedom of action of network owners compared to the situation in negotiated access. Negotiated access gives the network owner certain opportunities for affecting the competitive situation in gas supply. It is thus probable that the incentive to invest in the natural gas infrastructure is stronger in negotiated access than it is in regulated access. However, the economic conditions for building up the infrastructure can also be influenced by traditional energy policy regulatory means such as taxes and other rules. These measures can be designed just to promote investments in the infrastructure and can therefore be more effective in this respect than regulations aimed at creating competition on the market. Moreover, the nature of the credit market has changed after most of the gas system had been built up, and the need for long-term commitments has therefore lessened.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is probable that a system of negotiated access is more demanding on resources and involves greater uncertainty for potential users of transmission and distribution networks than a system of regulated access. This means that negotiated access involves higher costs and more uncertainty in gaining establishment on the natural gas market than would be the case in negotiated access, which limits the competition.</p>
<p>The chapter also analyzes the degree of market opening in Sweden. The definition in the Natural Gas Market Directive of what is the least that should be regarded as an entitled customer leads to an opening of the Swedish market by about 45 percent when the Directive is implemented. After 5 years, the market opening will increase to 50 percent and after 10 years, to around 60 percent. Even if the market opening is relatively large, it is only 25 to 30 end customers who will be entitled customers. Distribution companies are not included in the provisions of the Directive on what is the least that should be regarded as entitled customers. However, studies indicate that the economic efficiency is low in many European distribution companies. One way of increasing the efficiency would be to regard these as entitled customers and give them access to the transmission networks.</p>
<p>However, it is open to discussion what proportion of customers can gain access to the systems in practice. Vattenfall Naturgas AB has the right to transport 2 billion m3 of gas annually in the Danish system, and there is therefore some uncertainty. Another uncertainty factor is in the choice of access form in Denmark and in the fact that the Danish production capacity is gradually declining. It will be important to gain access to the Danish and other transport systems to be able to put to use other import options.</p>
<p>The analysis also indicates that the provisions of the Directive concerning entitled customers may encourage cross-subsidizing and changed price behaviour. It is basically only bigger customers who can put the increased competition to use for assuring themselves of lower prices, while the domestic sector, for example, is excluded. In such a situation, the risk of cross-subsidizing is greater in the sale of gas to big customers than in sales to households, for example, since the competition in the former case is much stiffer than in the latter. This can also give rise to upward price pressure for the consumer groups that cannot, in practice, purchase gas in competition between different suppliers.</p>
<p>In order to avoid elements of discrimination, cross-subsidizing and distortion of competition, the Natural Gas Market Directive includes provisions for separate accounting. In their internal book-keeping, integrated natural gas companies must keep separate accounts of the operations of transmission, distribution and storage of natural gas. The objective is that financial surpluses from monopoly operations (such as transmission) must not be used for subsidizing operations that are open to competition, such as trading in gas. The requirements of the Directive are minimum requirements. Other alternatives could be that the network operations and other operations are pursued in separate companies. Such separate companies could also have separate owners.</p>
<p>The analyses presented in the chapter indicate that it may be relatively complicated to prevent or impede certain cross-subsidizing by separate accounting. Even if demands are made that monopoly operations and operations open to competition shall be pursued in separate companies, it would be complicated to draw up regulations that would prevent cross-subsidizing. As an example, studies have shown that cross-subsidizing could occur in the Swedish electricity market, for example. This is in spite of the fact that a corporate body that pursues network operation must not pursue the generation of or trading in electricity. It is impossible to specify in detail the conditions that must be met for separate accounting to be performed satisfactorily. For it to perform acceptably, it would probably be necessary to define clearly the functions that will belong to the transmission operations. Demands are also made on accounting principles, cost verification and an effective supervisory authority. If such conditions are met, and given that the network operations and operations that are open to competition can be kept apart, there is probably no significant difference from the competition viewpoint between the requirements of the Gas Market Directive for separate accounting and separate companies. Another alternative would be to demand separate companies which should also have separate owners. However, there is the risk that such a far-reaching separation could be an obstacle to the development of a natural gas market.</p>
<p>An important aspect is whether Sweden should utilize the opportunity to charge natural gas companies with public service obligations. The concept of public services is not clearly defined, but for certain customers, the market prices for certain services, for example, can be perceived as being insuperably high. Another example is that various requirements of the authorities could give rise to extra costs which cannot be passed on to certain customer categories. To make such services accessible to everyone, one or more gas companies must be charged with the task of providing the services. However, such requirements must be combined with a possibility for the companies to cover the extra costs that arise. This can take place, for example, by the companies being protected from competition within certain market segments. However, the main objective of the EC Natural Gas Market Directive is to increase competition and achieve efficiency gains in the longer term. It should therefore be possible to demonstrate that the gains from such action would exceed the costs, i.e. that the efficiency losses caused by providing public services are lower than the gains from increased access to the networks. It should also be analyzed whether conventional economic policy measures would not have a greater distribution policy security than legislation in the field of natural gas.</p>
<p>The Natural Gas Market Directive contains three different forms of exemptions from the rules concerning access to systems and/or opening of the market. For Sweden, an exemption could be claimed only if the implementation of the Directive would cause serious problems in a geographically limited area, especially as regards the development of the infrastructure for transmission and if the objective is to encourage investments. Such an exemption is decided by the Commission.</p>
<p>Heavy new investments in gas infrastructure pose the risk of being unprofitable in the type of competitive market that could conceivably emerge when the Gas Market Directive has been implemented. This is the background against which the exemption has been introduced in the Directive, i.e. to encourage new investment in areas that were not earlier supplied with natural gas. As stated in Chapter 5, a number of such investments in Sweden are analyzed.</p>
<p>The exemption leads to a temporary limitation of the competition on the natural gas market and is aimed at reducing the economic risk in the expansion of natural gas. The actual risk may also be related to uncertainty concerning the natural gas demand in the relevant area. However, the uncertainty concerning the future demand for natural gas can also be highly dependent on the uncertainty concerning future taxation of natural gas compared to the taxation of other energy types (cf. Chapter 3). The exemption rule can also favour vertically integrated natural gas companies, to the disadvantage of companies with a different structure in its operations. Network industries have traditionally been built up of vertically integrated state companies. However, this has taken place in times when the capital market was much less developed than it is today. In view of the currently well-developed capital market, totally different opportunities may be available for building up separate infrastructure companies. If the exemption rule were applied, there would be reason to analyze its effect. As an example, it may be justified to counteract contract forms that would make many customers bound, after the 10-year period, by very long-term commitments. The risk is otherwise incurred that, after a long time, the temporary exemption rule would lead to the formation of a number of regional monopoly markets in the event of an expansion of the network.</p>
<p>A form of exemption other than those discussed above is that in which a natural gas company, which has ended up or is expected to end up in serious economic and financial difficulties due to 'take or pay' commitments, applies for temporary exemption from the access rules. Gas companies on the Swedish gas market are tied by traditional and long-term 'take or pay' commitments. The import agreement entered into by Vattenfall Naturgas AB with DONG Naturgas A/S, for example, expires in 2003, 2006 and 2010. Such commitments could lead to heavy losses if the networks are opened to access. An analysis of contracts and how these affect the incentive structures indicates that the agreement date may be of importance. If exemptions were to be granted for agreements that were concluded after the EC Natural Gas Market Directive has become known, this may lead to the players on the market being given the opportunity, in practice, to override the regulations that govern the market. For agreements concluded before the EC Directive became known, the rule changes that retroactively alter the conditions for commercial agreements may make the players on the market unwilling to conclude agreements with long-term effect. However, it is important that any exemptions granted should be of limited duration, so that the players on the market are given clear indication of the rules of the game that will apply.</p>
<p>Chapter 9  contains a review of how the work of introducing the Natural Gas Market Directive is developing in our neighbouring countries and in countries that can be regarded as being of particular significance to the Swedish gas market. The countries analyzed are Denmark, Finland, Norway, Great Britain and Germany.</p>
<p>However, in many of these countries, the work has not been completed, and work is in progress on adapting the legislations in the field of natural gas to the Directive. In the light of this, it is currently impossible to report, in most cases, on the explicit standpoints that have been taken. However, more general views can be reported.</p>
<p>There are clear indications that negotiated access will be chosen in Denmark. There are also clear indications that the market opening will initially be limited to 30 percent and that distribution companies will not be entitled customers. In Finland, a working committee has suggested regulated access. Since the country is not connected to the interconnected European system, the access form is basically of no importance. However, the regulated access means that some limited trading will take place between major customers. Norway has a very limited domestic market and has not yet reported on the access form. Since May 1998, Great Britain has had a completely liberalized market with regulated access, so that all customers have free choice of their gas supplier. Work is in progress in Germany on drawing up the natural gas legislation. However, Germany is currently oriented towards negotiated access, and all customers will be entitled.</p>
<h2>Considerations and proposals</h2>
<p>The committee suggests that new legislation be introduced in the field of natural gas. The reason for this is that the EC Natural Gas Market Directive, which is to be implemented in Swedish legislation, is appreciably more far-reaching and comprehensive than the present Swedish legislation in the field of natural gas, which basically contains rules concerning concessions. The new Natural Gas Law mainly governs activities related to concession, obligations of the pipeline owner, separate accounting and supervision.</p>
<p>Concession</p>
<p>The construction of a major natural gas pipeline is a complicated process that may give rise to substantial impact on the environment. The present Pipeline Law gives society an opportunity to examine the construction and run of certain pipelines for conveying substances such as natural gas. In our opinion, the Pipeline Law has performed satisfactorily, and the main elements of the current concession system should therefore be retained. Our proposal is as follows:</p>
<p>â€¢ A concession should be required for running and using a natural gas pipeline and for constructing and using a natural gas storage facility. The Government should examine the concession issue. Natural gas pipes which are to be used mainly for meeting the needs of individual households and companies or are to be used exclusively in port and industrial areas should not be exempted from the obligation to obtain a concession.</p>
<p>â€¢ Concession may be granted only under certain conditions. The natural gas pipeline must be suitable from the general public viewpoint. The applicant should be suitable from the general public viewpoint to pursue the operations covered by the concession. The concession must not be in conflict with a detailed development plan or regional regulations. However, minor departures may be made if they do not run counter to the purpose of the development plan or the regional regulations. Certain provisions of the environmental codes shall be applied in the examination. An environmental consequence description must be included in an application for a concession. The purpose of suitability assessment is mainly to prevent the running of natural gas pipelines that are  socio-economically unnecessary, or pipelines being run in such a manner that they cause unnecessary intrusion, to the detriment of third parties.</p>
<p>â€¢ The concession shall relate to a natural gas pipeline with a basically predetermined run. A concession may be tied to conditions for matters such as protecting the environment.</p>
<p>â€¢ A concession shall be granted for 40 years. On application by the concessionaire, the duration of the concession may be extended by 40 years at a time.</p>
<p>â€¢ The transfer of a concession demands special permission. The suitability of the proposed new holder shall be examined in the same manner as in an application for a new concession.</p>
<p>â€¢ A concession may be revoked if the natural gas pipeline is no longer used and is not needed to safeguard the supply of energy, or if the concessionaire neglects his obligations.</p>
<p>â€¢ If a concession should expire, the most recent holder of the concession is responsible for removing the natural gas pipeline and adopting other restoration measures if this is necessary from the public or individual viewpoint.</p>
<p>Obligations of the pipeline owner</p>
<p>The chapter describes the fundamental principles for achieving increased competition on the gas market. In the opinion of the committee, it is important for the natural gas market in Sweden to be open to competition. To achieve increased competition in natural gas trading, buyers and sellers on the natural gas market must be given an opportunity to use the natural gas pipelines. In our opinion, the provisions of the Natural Gas Market Directive concerning access to the system are the central tools for achieving increased competition on the natural gas market. It is possible to choose either negotiated or regulated access, or both of these procedures.</p>
<h2>Access and connection</h2>
<p>The committee suggests that access to the natural gas pipelines should be based on a regulated procedure, with published tariffs. The principal reason for our suggestion is that regulated access gives rise to lower costs and less uncertainty than negotiated access, and therefore gives rise to less obstacles to access to the market. It thus has the most beneficial effects on competition and thereby on consumer interests.</p>
<p>Regulated access presupposes that sellers and buyers have access to the natural gas pipelines to an extent necessary for the deliveries. A pipeline owner shall thus be obliged to transport natural gas on reasonable terms for entitled customers.</p>
<p>Merely opening the pipelines to entitled customers is not sufficient for achieving a natural gas market on which competition prevails. The ability to supply and receive natural gas is also dependent on the customer being connected to a natural gas pipeline. We therefore suggest that the pipeline owner should be obliged to connect the natural gas pipes of entitled customers.</p>
<p>The obligation to connect natural gas pipes and to transport natural gas applies only in relation to those known as entitled customers. These are initially pipeline owners, customers who have gas-fired electric power generation, and certain bigger end users. From 1 January 2006, everyone will be regarded as entitled customers, i.e. the natural gas market will be opened entirely. However, the relatively quick and extensive market opening may lead to economic losses for the pipeline owners, due to 'take or pay' commitments. The authority that the Government appoints should therefore analyze during 2003 the effects of the proposed market opening and should submit proposals for any changes considered necessary to the pace of opening.</p>
<h2>Exemptions</h2>
<p>An uncertainty in our assessment is that we have a limited infrastructure in the field of natural gas and that development of this infrastructure would improve the performance of the market. The fact that our proposal for regulated access may have a negative effect on the readiness to invest cannot be disregarded. There is a risk that heavy new investments in natural gas infrastructure will not be profitable in the type of competitive market that may conceivably emerge when the Gas Market Directive is implemented. However, the Directive and our proposal for legislation include an exemption that has been introduced for encouraging investments in geographically limited areas that were not previously supplied with natural gas. The Government or the authority appointed by the Government can apply to the EU Commission for a temporary exemption from the rules for market opening.</p>
<p>Another uncertainty is how the profitability of natural gas companies may be affected by the companies being tied by long-term 'take or pay' commitments. Such commitments could lead to heavy losses if the pipelines are opened for access. At the same time, it has emerged that, under certain circumstances, the contracts can be re-negotiated. It is also probable that other contract forms may emerge in a market which is more open to competition. However, the committee is conscious of the fact that access to the pipelines may cause losses to the companies due to 'take or pay' undertakings. We therefore suggest that, in accordance with the Directive, the natural gas companies should then apply to the relevant authority for temporary exemption from the obligation to provide access to the pipelines.</p>
<h2>Transport tariffs</h2>
<p>Tariffs for transporting natural gas must be drawn up so that they meet the demands made on a competitive gas market with contractual freedom. It should be simple to buy and sell gas against different contract types, and different players must be given this opportunity. If should therefore be sufficient for an entitled customer to be connected to a point on the natural gas pipeline for the customer to have the right to use all other pipelines that are connected to the Swedish natural gas network.</p>
<p>It is not up to the Government to issue detailed regulations concerning the tariffs that should be charged by the gas companies. The detailed make-up of the tariffs is a matter for the pipeline companies. However, it should be specified in the Natural Gas Law that the transport tariffs should be reasonable and should be based on objective grounds. The supervisory authority should be entrusted with the task of assessing in its supervision whether the transport tariffs and other terms are reasonable and have been drawn up on objective grounds.</p>
<p>According to the Natural Gas Market Directive, pipeline owners should be obliged to publish their transport tariffs and other terms and obligations for utilizing the system.</p>
<p>Separate accounting (unbundling)</p>
<p>For effective regulation of a natural monopoly, the regulatory authority must be able to check the economic results of the operations. One of the reasons for this is that a monopoly company could attempt to impede access by setting prices that are too high. The company may, for example, also attempt to affect competition in other fields of activity. Assuming that a natural gas company pursues monopoly operations as well as operations that are open to competition, the obvious risk is involved of competitive problems by a financial surplus from the monopoly operations being used for subsidizing operations that are open to competition, which is known as cross-subsidizing. In such integrated operations, it is complicated to analyze the pricing of the various</p>
<p>utilities. It is generally also very difficult to determine whether any surplus from monopoly operations is used for subsidizing the operations that are open to competition.</p>
<p>Far-reaching separate accounting increases the scope available for achieving effective supervision and reducing the risks of crosssubsidizing, for example. We therefore suggest that (with certain exceptions) the operations pursued in integrated natural gas companies should have separate accounting for the natural gas transmission, distribution and storage operations. Separate accounting for these operations should be treated as separate lines of business. If the monopoly operations and the operations that are open to competition can be kept apart, we consider that there is no significant difference from the competition aspect between the requirements for separate accounting in the internal book-keeping and more far-reaching requirements such as separate corporate units. However, experience from the electricity legislation field in Sweden indicates that detailed regulations and checks may be necessary. In the opinion of the committee, distinct and clear guidelines are thus needed for accounting and that this accounting should be followed up by the supervisory authority in an active manner.</p>
<p>The separate accounts for the natural gas transmission, distribution and storage operations should be sent annually to the authority appointed by the Government.</p>
<p>The auditor of a company that pursues natural gas transmission, distribution or storage operations should examine the separate accounts for these operations. The auditor shall also state whether the accounting has been done in accordance with the relevant regulations.</p>
<p>When trading in gas is pursued in competition, the question arises whether the municipal law rules are appropriate for municipal companies that operate on the natural gas market. The municipal law rules that are mainly applicable are the siting principle, equal opportunities principle and at-cost principle.</p>
<p>Municipal companies that pursue the distribution of natural gas are currently exempt from the equal opportunities and at-cost principles, and the operations must thereby be pursued on business-like grounds. However, the companies are not exempt from the siting principle, and the operations must therefore be restricted to the area of the municipality or to its inhabitants.</p>
<p>No distinction is currently made in the legislation between transport or pipeline operations and trading operations related to natural gas.</p>
<p>However, when the Natural Gas Law comes into force, a distinction will be made between these two operations.</p>
<p>A matter of principle is whether the opportunities available to the municipalities for pursuing commercial operations should be facilitated further. As regards natural gas, we consider that there is a great deal to support the view that exemption from the siting principle may be justified for municipal companies that pursue trading in natural gas.</p>
<p>Municipal companies that pursue natural gas transport operation in their own municipality should also be given the right to pursue such operations outside the municipal boundaries. However, exemption from the siting principle of the Municipal Law should apply only if the aim is to achieve appropriate natural gas operations. The operations should therefore be allowed to be pursued only in the geographical vicinity of the company's natural gas operations in its municipality.</p>
<p>Municipal natural gas trading operations are operations that are open to competition, and municipal natural gas companies should therefore be allowed to operate on the same terms as other players. Such operations should therefore be pursued on commercial grounds.</p>
<p>Supervision</p>
<p>It is important that the rules of the Natural Gas Law and the regulations and terms issued on the basis of this Law should be followed. Supervision rules should therefore be issued. Supervision should also concern conformance not only to what is specified concerning the running and use of natural gas pipelines, including various natural gas plants that are associated with the pipelines, but also the restoration rules. Supervision should also cover a check on whether the terms for the right of access to the natural gas pipelines are reasonable. This supervision also includes determination of who should initially be regarded as an entitled customer.</p>
<p>To be able to exercise supervision, the supervisory authority should have the right to demand the information and documents necessary for supervision. The authority should have the right to issue instructions for correcting inappropriate behaviour.</p>
<p>Other tasks of the authority include the issuing of regulations and advice, and the preparation of concession matters. Moreover, the authority should provide information and advice, and should pursue general follow-up and monitoring activities.</p>
<p>The operations of the supervisory authority shall be financed by an annual levy payable by the natural gas companies that are obliged to submit separate accounts in accordance with the Natural Gas Law.</p>
<p>There are many similarities between supervision in accordance with the Electricity Law and with the Natural Gas Law. In the opinion of the committee, it is important that the supervisory activities in accordance with both the Natural Gas Law and the Electricity Law should have the strength and independence necessary for continuing the pursuance of deregulation of the natural gas and electricity markets in an effective manner. We suggest that the Government should set up a study into whether permission and supervision matters and standardization concerning both the Electricity Law and Natural Gas Law should handled by an independent authority.</p>
