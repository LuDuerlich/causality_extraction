<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Terms of reference</h2>
<p>The committee’s terms of reference concerning postal services were mainly:</p>
<p>• to describe the postal market and carry out an analysis of the effects of the liberalisation of the postal market on the national economy</p>
<p>• to analyse political objectives for the postal sector and evaluate regulation and the responsibility of authorities in the postal market as well as to assess whether legislation and the type of responsibility invested in authorities are aimed at ensuring that the political objectives for the postal sector are attained</p>
<p>• to propose amendments to legislation, the political objectives for the postal sector and the responsibilities of authorities, if necessary.</p>
<h2>Background and applicable law</h2>
<p>The overall goal for postal policy and what the government must guarantee is that postal services are available throughout the country, meaning that everyone must be able to send and receive items of mail. The items of mail to be covered by this postal service are defined as all addressed items of mail weighing a maximum of 20 kg, that is to say, in addition to letters, also parcels and addressed newspapers, catalogues and books. The overall goal for postal services is supplemented by a requirement on the level of service offered, that is to say a service goal. A general goal is specified in the Postal Services Act and further details of this goal are to be found in licence conditions.</p>
<p>Under the Postal Services Act, postal services must be available throughout the country, implying that everyone can receive letters and other addressed items of mail weighing a maximum of 20 kg. Postal services shall be of good quality and there must be opportunities for everyone to have such items of mail delivered at reasonable prices. Furthermore, some individual items of mail shall be delivered at uniform prices. There must also be opportunities to insure items of mail and to receive confirmation from the recipient that the item of mail has been received.</p>
<p>Several provisions of the Postal Services Act concern the obligations of entities carrying on postal operations. For example, postal operations shall be carried on under conditions that accommodate reasonable requirements of reliability and guarantee the protection of the sender’s and recipient’s personal integrity.</p>
<p>The Competition Act (1993:20) is a general statute covering all sectors of society, including the postal sector.</p>
<p>There is an EC Postal Directive, Directive 97/67/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 1997 on common rules for the development of the internal market of Community postal services and the improvement of quality of service (Postal Directive), amended by virtue of Directive 2002/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 June 2002 on amendment of Directive 97/67/EC in order to further increase competition in the postal sector in the Community. EU policy focuses on providing universal postal services of good quality as well as abolishing monopolies and establishing an internal market for postal services from 2009.</p>
<p>The National Post and Telecom Agency (PTS) is the central administrative authority with collected responsibility - sector responsibility - in the postal and electronic communication areas. Sector responsibility for the postal area means that PTS has extensive general responsibility for following developments, among other things from a consumer and regional policy point of view. At the same time, PTS does not play a role in general promotion of competition in the postal sector.</p>
<p>PTS monitors developments and ensures that postal service meets society’s needs.</p>
<h2>Developments in the Swedish postal market</h2>
<p>The committee has chosen to describe and analyse the postal market on the basis of the division letters, unaddressed direct advertising (UDA) and parcels. This is a broader definition of the postal market than that usually used.</p>
<p>Deliveries  constitute the largest area in the letter market, representing 73 per cent of the total volume. Office mail accounts for 20 per cent of the market and the proportion for letter-box mail is 7 per cent. The deliveries area includes the sub-areas economy letter deliveries (28 per cent of the volume of deliveries), first-class letter deliveries (21 per cent), addressed direct advertising (ADA) (33 per cent) and addressed magazines (18 per cent).</p>
<p>Letters function primarily as a channel for information from companies to households, and 95.8 per cent of all letters delivered in 2003 were sent from companies. The proportion for households was considerably lower – the proportion of letters sent from households was 4.2 per cent of all letters despatched.</p>
<p>Posten AB is the predominant actor on the letter market with a market share of 92.9 per cent in 2003, measured in number of deliveries. During the period 1996–2003, Posten AB’s volumes fell by 9.6 per cent, while the total decrease in this market was 4.4 per cent. Developments from the top year 1996 when Posten AB forwarded 3 361 million letters to the 3 037 million letters in 2003, is equivalent to an average rate of reduction of about 1.4 per cent per year, or over 30 million letters a year.</p>
<p>The second largest operator on the letter market is CityMail which delivered 216 million items of mail in 2003. With a steady growth in volume, CityMail has increased its market share of the letter market since 1996 from 1.5 per cent to 6.6 per cent. The volume of letters delivered in 2003 by the other 26 active postal operators amounted to about 17 million items of mail, equivalent to 0.5 per cent of the letter market, in which the eight largest in terms of volume accounted for almost 90 per cent of the volume.</p>
<p>The greatest competition to the letter as a form of communication comes from different types of electronic communication developed over the last decade. An analysis of both companies’ and private individuals’ patterns of communication shows that telephony, both fixed telephony and mobile telephony, is by far the most usual form of communication. However, for companies, the letter is still an important way of communicating; letters make up 25 per cent of total communication. Regarding households on the other hand, telephony is the most important form of communication followed by the Internet, while SMS accounts for 4 per cent and letters for 3 per cent of total communication.</p>
<p>In 2003, over 3 billion UDA items of mail were sent in Sweden. This means that almost half the number of items of mail on the Swedish postal market consist of unaddressed direct advertising. This may be compared with the number of ADA items of mail which, for the same period, amounted to about 700 million. There are two major companies engaged in the distribution of UDA in Sweden – Posten AB and Svensk Direktreklam (SDR). Posten AB is definitely the predominant actor with a market share of 64 per cent, followed by SDR whose market share is 30 per cent. Of the remaining 6 per cent of the market, the company S-Post accounts for about 5 per cent and a number of small local distribution companies and sports associations for the remainder.</p>
<p>The parcels market is usually defined on the basis of the weight of the items of mail. Parcels weighing up to 35 kg are usually designated light goods as opposed to heavy goods which is the term used for items of mail above 35 kg.</p>
<p>Regarding business parcels, that is to say parcels sent by companies either to other companies or to private individuals, business customers in Sweden may choose between several distributors of parcels. The largest distributors in Sweden apart from Posten AB include DHL Danzas which is owned by Deutsche Post, Schenker Privpak, which is ultimately owned by Deutsche Bahn, TNT which is owned by the Dutch post office and Pan Nordic Logistics (PNL) which is owned by the Danish and Norwegian post offices. In addition there are a number of small local transport companies.</p>
<p>Despite competition from several parcel distributors, Posten AB was the largest actor on the domestic market in Sweden for business parcels weighing up to 35 kg during the period 1993–2003. Posten AB estimates its share of this market to be between 60 and 70 per cent.</p>
<p>At present only Posten AB and Schenker Privpak offer distribution of parcels to private individuals through parcel agents in Sweden. Posten AB and Privpak estimate their market shares of all mail order parcels sent in Sweden to be 75–80 per cent and 20–25 per cent respectively.</p>
<p>Posten AB’s volume of inland parcels has amounted to between 40 and 43 million parcels a year over the last five-year period.</p>
<p>However, the number of inland parcels has decreased by five per cent over the last five years. On the other hand, Posten AB’s total volume of parcels delivered has increased, due to the fact that overseas parcels have increased considerably in recent years. This development is the result of companies’ increased internationalisation as well as the participation of Posten AB in the European parcel network DPD.</p>
<p>The total market for parcels (inland and overseas) will probably continue to grow in the near future. Regarding the market for inland parcels, it is expected to be relatively constant or growing, particularly in the areas business parcels and parcels sent by mail order companies. On the other hand, the number of parcels sent by households, primarily to other households, is expected to decrease further in the years ahead.</p>
<h2>The universal postal service</h2>
<p>Posten AB is considered today to generally fulfil the requirements of universal service as regards five-day service in all parts of the country, the scope of the service network, delivery times and complaints management.</p>
<p>Requirements regarding pricing for a universal postal service to the effect that prices are to be fair and individual items of mail delivered at uniform prices are also largely considered to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>The committee has tried to estimate the costs of providing a universal postal service. This estimate is based among other things on earlier Swedish studies of the issue. After comparing conditions in Norway, costs are judged to lie somewhere between SEK 115 to 460 million a year.</p>
<p>The committee has also analysed different models for financing and ensuring universal postal services as regards different types of charges from the market’s actors, a compensation fund and procurement of services.</p>
<h2>International survey</h2>
<p>The committee has studied conditions in the postal sector in some countries with similar conditions to Sweden. The countries in question are Norway, Finland, Denmark, the UK, Germany, the</p>
<p>Netherlands and New Zealand. The survey shows that Sweden is by no means alone in simultaneously maintaining universal postal services of good quality and exposing the postal market to competition. Our survey shows that several countries in the EU and EEA intend to keep ahead of the EU’s timetable which means the full opening of the postal market to competition from 1 January 2009.</p>
<p>The survey also shows that like Sweden, New Zealand and Finland have completely put an end to the monopoly in the postal area. There are also several countries which have done away with the monopoly altogether or which have only retained the monopoly for a minor part. At the same time, it has proved that, in spite of the market being wholly or partly open to competition for many years in several countries, without exception the previous monopolist holds a clearly predominant position on the letter market.</p>
<p>A corporatisation of the national post office has been carried out in most EU countries. Some countries are furthermore in the process of privatising the previous monopolist.</p>
<p>The countries to the fore as regards opening the market for postal services to competition, in addition to Sweden, include Finland, the UK, the Netherlands, Norway, Germany and New Zealand. As from 2007, the markets in the UK, Norway, Germany and the Netherlands will probably be fully open to competition.</p>
<p>Today, the UK and Germany apply a regulation that gives other postal operators right of access to the previous monopolist’s network for the distribution of post. The Netherlands are in the process of introducing such a regulation. New Zealand also applies a regulation on access. These regulations may lead to increased competition but it is not yet possible to see any proven effects.</p>
<h2>An economic analysis of the effects of liberalisation</h2>
<p>The committee has carried out an economic analysis of the liberalisation of the postal market. The aim of liberalisation was to enhance efficiency in the letter market. By opening the market to competition, gains were envisaged for the consumer in the form of lower prices and improved service.</p>
<p>Price development on the letter market varied depending on the sub-market analysed. A very rough estimate shows that the average nominal prices for sending a 50 gram letter in the early 2000s was at least 30 per cent lower than in the early 1990s. Taking into consideration inflation, this should mean a decrease of around 50 per cent in real terms. Regarding the sub-market individual letters  the price for the overnight delivery of a 20 gram letter has increased by 50 per cent excluding value added tax and 90 per cent including value added tax over the period 1993–2003.</p>
<p>The reform must be considered largely successful, although the number of companies added to the market is limited. The positive effects are chiefly an adaptation of products and services to demand as well as more cost-adapted prices. The favourable price development on the sub-market deliveries  is a more direct consequence of liberalisation.</p>
<p>Requirements of the universal postal service have been fulfilled during the period; thus, liberalisation has not meant poorer service or quality regarding nation-wide overnight delivery. However, Posten AB continues to have a strong and dominant position on the letter market, particularly regarding individual items of correspondence. Nor are there any signs that Posten AB’s strong position in this area will change noticeably in the near future given the current competitive conditions.</p>
<p>A circumstance which may be part of the explanation to the relatively weak development of competition after liberalisation is that there are high barriers to establishment on the sub-market individual deliveries , particularly that part referring to overnight nation-wide delivery. This means that it is very expensive to build up a parallel nation-wide network for delivery of letters. Another circumstance that partly explains the situation is that legislation in the postal sector was initially not adapted to support or create preconditions for competition. The Postal Services Act came into being primarily to guarantee quality and maintain universal postal service. On the other hand, subsequent amendments to the statutory framework were to a greater extent intended to create the preconditions for competition.</p>
<h2>Opportunities for co-distribution</h2>
<p>Possibilities for the co-distribution of unaddressed newspapers and magazines and addressed items of mail have been studied. Discussions have been carried on between the Swedish Newspaper Publisher’s Association, representing newspaper distribution companies, and Posten AB about possible co-distribution. There are two essential main alternatives for handling co-distribution and these can then be combined in different ways:</p>
<p>• The newspaper agent collects and delivers the addressed items of mail to be distributed with the morning paper, which will probably be before six a.m.</p>
<p>• The postman collects the daily newspaper and delivers it with the addressed items of post on his ordinary round, which will probably be during the morning or afternoon.</p>
<p>If the newspaper agent is also to deliver addressed items of post it will be difficult to meet the requirements of overnight delivery of letters in accordance with Posten AB’s licence conditions, counter service in the rural delivery service and management of parcel delivery and registered mail in the rural delivery service. Posten AB’s licence conditions specify that 85 per cent of all items of mail shall be delivered overnight and 97 per cent within three days. Since mail will be delivered very early in the morning in the first alternative, there will not be sufficient time to distribute items of mail despatched overnight. Hence the mail delivered will be a day late.</p>
<p>Today, Posten AB provides basic counter service in the rural delivery service. If items of mail are delivered by newspaper agents the consequence will be that customers wishing to carry out cash transactions must either do so at an unreasonably early hour or that the postman must do an extra round to handle counter service. Posten AB also currently provides delivery of parcels and registered mail in the rural delivery service. If these items of mail were to be delivered by newspaper agents there would be similar consequences, that is to say customers wishing to sign for parcels or registered mail must either do so at an unreasonably early hour or an extra round must be undertaken to manage this.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, the postman delivers newspapers on his ordinary rounds there will be problems with late delivery of newspapers. The subscriber will receive his morning newspaper at lunch time or in the afternoon – not at breakfast time. This will presumably result in a reduction in the number of subscribers.</p>
<p>Problems relating to co-distribution show that there are internal and external requirements imposed on Posten AB and distribution companies that must be changed if co-distribution is to be feasible.</p>
<h2>Price control</h2>
<p>Under the Postal Services Ordinance (1993:1709), universal postal service providers may not raise prices for inland delivery of individual items of mail delivered overnight, and weighing at most 500 g, by more than the change in the consumer price index (CPI) between July of the previous year and July the year before that.</p>
<p>When the first price ceiling was introduced in 1994, the reason given was to protect private individuals who it was considered did not have any alternative to Posten AB. As a result of changes following government bill Government responsibility in the postal sector  (Govt bill 1997/98:127) the aim of the price ceiling was extended to apply to all postal customers who have no alternative to Posten AB for delivery of individual items of mail. In practice this meant that the target group was extended from private individuals only to cover all unsorted post sent as individual items of mail at a normal postage rate. At the same time, the consumer price index (CPI) was chosen as an index rather than the net price index (NPI) on the grounds that value added tax is included in the price paid by private individuals which is not reflected in NPI, which is more adapted to a business perspective. CPI would therefore better reflect changes in the price level consumers meet.</p>
<p>The committee’s analysis shows that the current index which is based on CPI is correct if it is considered there are groups particularly worthy of protection. However, the committee considers this protection value is no longer relevant since postage costs represent a very small part of the total expenses of both private individuals and small companies.</p>
<p>If, instead, the starting-point is that the index should reflect Posten AB’s costs, finding a correct index becomes more complicated.</p>
<p>At the request of the committee, Statistics Sweden (SCB) studied which index could be used in connection with price regulation, and, in its report to the committee, SCB draws the conclusion that there is no existing index or balance of existing indices that reflects Posten AB’s costs. To be able to reflect Posten AB’s costs, a new special index must be created based on Posten AB’s cost structure for the service.</p>
<h2>Considerations and proposals</h2>
<p>The committee has made a comparison with another liberalised market, the telecommunications market, or to use more modern terminology, the market for electronic communication. Conclusions from this comparison have in some parts been used in continued considerations.</p>
<p>Postal policy goals</p>
<p>The committee proposes new political goals for the postal sector. The new goals shall read as follows:</p>
<p>Access shall be available to a broad supply of postal services at prices and quality corresponding to customers’ demands. From an international perspective, Sweden shall be at the forefront in these respects. Postal services shall be sustainable, customer adapted and accommodate future needs.</p>
<p>An important means of achieving this will be to create the preconditions for effective competition between several actors, without distortions and unwarranted restrictions. The Government shall guarantee that everyone has access to universal postal service of high quality and at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>The committee proposes the above goals be presented to the Swedish Riksdag for approval.</p>
<p>Aim of the law</p>
<p>The aim of the Postal Services Act must be broadened from focusing on the universal postal service to embracing all postal services. A new introductory section in the Postal Services Act is proposed accordingly. The provisions of the Act shall aim at providing the private and public sectors with access to safe and efficient postal services with the greatest possible selection of services at different prices and of varying quality. An essential means of achieving this must be to create the preconditions for effective competition between several actors without distortions and unwarranted restrictions. Everyone should have access to a universal postal service of good quality and at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>Monitoring responsibility will be broadened to include all postal services – not just the universal postal service. The Government or the authority appointed by the Government shall therefore continually follow developments in the postal sector and ensure that postal services meet society’s needs.</p>
<p>Definition of postal operations</p>
<p>The committee does not consider there is any need to change the definition of postal operations. Instead, it is proposed that entities carrying on operations that consist in leasing post box facilities to the general public for a charge (leasing of post box facilities) be obliged to report their operations to the licensing authority in accordance with the Postal Services Act. Those who hold a licence to carry on postal operations should not need to report such operations. As in the case of postal operations, leasing of post box facilities shall be carried on under conditions that accommodate reasonable requirements of reliability and uphold the protection of senders’ and recipients’ personal integrity.</p>
<p>Possibility to revoke licences</p>
<p>We propose that the licensing authority be given the possibility of revoking a licence if the holder has not carried on postal operations for at least six months.</p>
<p>Scope of the universal postal services</p>
<p>The universal postal service should have the same scope as today. The committee does not propose that it should be restricted to covering only individual items of mail.</p>
<p>Quality of the universal postal services</p>
<p>The requirement of overnight delivery shall continue to apply. No change is proposed to the quality requirement. The requirement is of importance, inter alia  for the matter of co-distribution of unaddressed newspapers and magazines with addressed items of mail. However, the committee considers that this matter should be solved in negotiations between the parties concerned within the framework of the applicable body of rules.</p>
<p>Delivery service</p>
<p>Today, Posten AB applies certain guidelines for its delivery service in population centres and sparsely populated areas respectively. These guidelines were already established when Posten AB was a public administration. In spite of what is specified in the guidelines about these being formulated in consultation between Posten AB and PTS, they are not official regulations nor even general advice. Instead, they are Posten AB’s own internal guidelines for management of its delivery service.</p>
<p>The committee considers that PTS should issue general advice concerning the delivery service of universal postal services.</p>
<p>Communal post boxes</p>
<p>The transition to delivery of mail in apartment blocks in communal post boxes should be speeded up. We consider that PTS can specify the details of this transition in the form of general advice concerning the delivery service of universal postal services.</p>
<p>Procurement of a universal postal service in certain cases</p>
<p>Under the present formulation of the Postal Services Act, entities wishing to carry on postal operations may be bound to provide a universal postal service. However, the Act specifies no limitation of the burden following from such an undertaking.</p>
<p>In order to create good market preconditions for all actors on the postal market, protection should be introduced against any actor being obliged to provide universal postal services to an extent that is unreasonably onerous for the company. When deciding whether or not such an obligation must be considered unreasonably onerous, attention must be given not just to the unprofitable aspects but also to the market advantages that may be associated with the provision of a universal postal service.</p>
<p>The committee therefore proposes that a universal postal service shall be procured if this is specially required bearing in mind the costs of providing the service. However, the committee judges that there is no need at present to procure a universal postal service.</p>
<p>Measures against unclear pricing and discrimination</p>
<p>Universal postal service providers shall apply clear and unequivocal as well as non-discriminatory pricing of the service. The requirement of non-discrimination also applies to individual agreements concerning a universal postal service.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the committee proposes a provision be introduced into the Postal Services Act under which the universal postal service provider must apply the principal of non-discrimination in connection with the use of special prices and other special conditions for certain customers. A special price of this nature shall take into consideration the costs saved compared with a standard service consisting of collection, sorting, transport and delivery of individual items of mail. Price and other conditions shall be applied equally, both in a comparison between customers or other licence holders as in the relationship between a customer or other licence holder and the provider of a universal postal service of a corresponding nature.</p>
<p>It must be considered clear that postage costs for households and small companies, both in absolute figures and in relation to other costs, are so small that they do not justify the imposition of a price ceiling. The real reason of those actors demanding price regulation is rather to prevent Posten AB from cross-subsidising between different services.</p>
<p>The conclusion that may be drawn from the study carried out by Statistics Sweden at the request of the committee is that it is not fair to Posten AB to continue to use CPI for calculating the price ceiling since, as a result, Posten AB will not be compensated for the annual increases in costs for the services covered by the price ceiling.</p>
<p>Statistics Sweden judged that there is no existing index that can be used to reflect Posten AB’s costs for the price-controlled service. Instead, according to Statistics Sweden, a new special postal index must be produced. But the alternative recommended by Statistics Sweden involves a considerable administrative burden. Above all, it means details of Posten AB’s underlying costs for providing the service that is to be regulated will have to be produced. This work is the same as that needed to be able to verify that Posten AB’s prices for the universal service are based on the costs.</p>
<p>The committee presents a proposal that aims to increase transparency and protection against discrimination in connection with the pricing of a universal postal service. We also present a proposal for protection against discrimination in connection with the application of special conditions in the form of discounts for major customers and the like.</p>
<p>For we consider that this is a better way of managing problems such as cross-subsidising than by asserting very small protection interests as a reason for a general price control – when the real reason is something else. In the light of this, the committee proposes that price control under the Postal Services Ordinance shall be abolished. However, the abolition can be effected at the earliest six months after the proposals for amendments to the Postal Services Act have entered into force. In addition, further time may be needed before PTS has implemented the new provisions on clear and unequivocal pricing and protection against discrimination to such an extent that they protect against cross-subsidising. It is then for the Government to decide the exact date for removal of the price ceiling regulation.</p>
<p>The postal code system</p>
<p>Today the Government may appoint a licence holder providing a universal postal service to also provide and administer the postal code system. The Government has appointed Posten AB for this task. It is proposed that the Government should now be given powers to authorise the licensing authority (PTS) to appoint a licence holder providing a universal postal service to also provide and administer the postal code system.</p>
<p>The entity providing the postal code system is under obligation to allocate on the request of other licence holders, postal codes for post box facilities within the postal code zones requested. It is proposed that the same obligation should apply if it is requested by an entity registered under the Postal Services Act for lease of post box facilities.</p>
<p>The approval of the licensing authority is required under the Postal Services Act for changes to the postal code system unless the changes only concern individual postal addressees. The licensing authority must consult other licence holders, the authorities responsible for national registration and the real estate directory as well as the municipalities concerned on the matter. It is proposed this obligation to consult should also apply to those registered for lease of post box facilities under the Postal Services Act.</p>
<p>Redirection</p>
<p>It is proposed that, on request, universal postal service providers be obliged to redirect letters weighing a maximum of 2 kg conveyed by other licence holders to an address located outside their delivery zone. Conditions for redirection must be fair and not affect competition and also be non-discriminatory in relation to what the universal postal service provider applies in its own operations.</p>
<p>Rational and safe handling of unpaid and underpaid letters</p>
<p>Under the Postal Services Act, for a letter that is unstamped or has insufficient stamps to be considered undeliverable, it is required that the recipient does not redeem the letter. The committee proposes instead that the delivery company’s obligation to offer the recipient an opportunity to redeem the letter be removed. Thus, letters that are unpaid or underpaid may be handled as undeliverable. However, there should be no impediment to delivering the letter to the recipient without a surcharge or to offering the recipient an opportunity to redeem the letter.</p>
<p>Organisation of public agencies in the postal sector</p>
<p>The committee proposes that, in addition to its present tasks in the postal sector, PTS shall also promote an efficient postal market from the point of view of competition in certain specially specified respects. We propose that PTS’s present task to complete the review or inspection specially decided by the Government in connection with agreements between the state and postal operators, should cease.</p>
<p>In connection with its inspection, the licensing authority should pay special attention to ensuring that agreements are entered into that mean 1. that the items of mail the licence holders convey reach other licence holders’ facilities for delivery to recipients, 2. that addressed items of mail weighing a maximum of 2 kg that have been conveyed by another licence holder can be redirected to an address that is located outside the licence holder’s delivery zone, 3. that the principles of transparency and  non-discrimination be applied between a universal postal service provider and other licence holder in connection with the application of special prices and other special conditions for certain customers.</p>
<p>Should disputes about such agreements arise, the licensing authority shall look into the circumstances without delay and, unless special reasons speak in favour of some other action, mediate between the parties. In a dispute of this nature the authority may give an opinion at the request of one of the parties.</p>
<p>PTS may issue regulations concerning requirements imposed on universal postal service providers, also regarding the use of clear and unequivocal as well as non-discriminatory pricing for the service, and taking care of redirection as well as application of nondiscriminatory conditions in certain cases, in the same way as applies to other requirements imposed on universal postal service providers. PTS shall also specify through licence conditions the way in which obligations are to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>We propose that PTS annually publish a report on the extent to which pricing for the universal postal services meets requirements under the Postal Services Act. This task may be included in the authority’s appropriation directions.</p>
<p>It is proposed that, in accordance with Article 14.8 of the EC Postal Directive, PTS be authorised to take decisions on waivering the obligation of the universal service provider to apply the Postal Directive’s accounting rules. PTS shall inform the European Commission of its decision.</p>
<p>Charges for financing PTS operations</p>
<p>It is proposed that the Government or, if the Government so decides, the licensing authority may provide an obligation for entities carrying on operations registered under the Postal Services Act that consist in leasing space in post box facilities to the general public for a charge (leasing of post box facilities), to pay a charge to the licensing authority’s activities under the Postal Services Act.</p>
<p>PTS may provide that entities carrying on operations registered under the Postal Services Act as leasing of post box facilities shall pay an annual charge of at most SEK 1 500.</p>
<p>PTS shall be authorised to issue more detailed regulations on the charges. Regarding charges for leasing of post box facilities, PTS shall also be authorised to wholly or partly grant freedom from the charge if there are special reasons for doing so.</p>
<p>Concluding remarks</p>
<p>The committee considers it essential that developments on the postal market are closely followed in the years ahead and also that a new follow-up be carried out within 4–5 years in which the effects of regulation of the postal sector are followed up and analysed.</p>
<p>Regarding the Government’s role as owner, the committee establishes that in the years ahead the Government as owner of Posten AB will face several complex issues of a strategic nature, concerning, among other things, Posten AB’s long-term economic sustainability. The ownership structure may in itself be a factor of importance for Posten AB’s development as a company and also for the long-term efficiency of the postal market.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposals</h2>
<p>As far as the conditions for small companies are concerned, the committee judges that an abolition of the price ceiling for the universal postal service in combination with the requirement of nondiscriminatory special conditions, will increase the scope for new competitors on the market, chiefly as regards local operators. The competitive pressure that will then arise will counteract any postage rate increases resulting from the abolition of the price ceiling. The advantages of increased competitive pressure on the postal</p>
<p>market outweigh the disadvantages of abolishing the price ceiling, for small companies also. Thus, in general, increased competition should in the long term lead to lower prices for postal services for small companies also.</p>
<p>PTS’s operations in the postal sector will be financed through charges from licence holders and from entities that apply for licences and advance notification. Entities registered for leasing of post box facilities under the Postal Services Act will also contribute to the financing of PTS’s operations, according to the committee’s proposals. No government appropriations to PTS are proposed in view of the committee’s proposals.</p>
