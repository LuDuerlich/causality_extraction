<p>The Inquiry’s proposal</p>
<p>This report contains a proposal for new legislation concerning the right to full-time employment. The proposed Act is to apply to the entire labour market. The Act will be mandatory in favour of the employee, but it will be possible for the social partners to agree on derogations from the provisions of the Act.</p>
<p>The central provisions of the Act are a general rule that the employment contract must refer to full time work and a rule on the right to full-time employment for a person who has been employed part time for a period. A general exemption from the rules is made for employers with a maximum of ten employees.</p>
<p>When an employment contract is entered into, under the general rule it shall refer to full time work. A general exemption will be made from the general rule corresponding to a seventh of the total number of employees with the employer. When the number of part-time employees with an employer is greater than the allowed limit, the employer may only enter into a further part-time employment contract when the parties to the agreement are agreed on this and it is permitted by law. In that situation exceptions may be made if the employee is to carry out work for another employer in parallel with the new job, if the part-time job is a substitute position or if a full-time job does not reflect any need for labour that the employee has sufficient qualifications for. Exceptions from the general rule may also be made if the employee expresses a desire that the employment should be for part-time work.</p>
<p>The provisions of Section 25 a of the Employment Protection Act concerning a preferential right to increased working hours will be transferred to the new Act. At the same time a right to full-time employment will be introduced for those who are already employed part time. The new rule assumes that the employee has</p>
<p>notified the employer of his wish for full-time employment and thereafter been employed for a total of more than three years within the past five years. The right also assumes that full-time employment with the employer will meet a labour need that the employee has sufficient qualifications for. An employee who at some time after the notification refuses an offer of full-time employment that should reasonably have been accepted, will lose his preferential right. If the employer has several operating establishments the right to full-time employment and the preferential right to increased working hours applies to the establishment where the employee works part time. The Act contains rules on order of selection and precedence between several entitled employees. The Act also contains rules on coordination between precedence under the Act on Full-time employment and the Employment Protection Act.</p>
<p>An employment contract for part time work which is in conflict with the general rule must be declared valid for full-time employment by a court of law if the employee so petitions. Such a declaration must also be made on petition by the employee when a person already employed part time has the right to full-time employment after a certain period. According to the proposal, the legal adjudication should be limited to a more general check of the supporting material for the employer’s decision as regards the choice between part-time and full-time employment. In exceptional cases, however, a more detailed review should be made of the validity of the employer’s reasons for not employing a worker full time.</p>
<p>An employer who contravenes the Act must pay damages for the violation this breach implies. An employer who contravenes the general rule that an employment contract shall refer to full-time employment or who sets aside the preferential right shall also pay damages for the loss sustained by the employee.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the employer’s obligation to negotiate and inform be extended in certain cases.</p>
<p>The considerations of the Inquiry</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit was to investigate how the right to full-time employment should be strengthened. The remit includes considering whether a regulation should be introduced to limit the</p>
<p>freedom of an employer to employ staff on a part-time basis, while allowing exceptions when warranted in view of the needs of the business or the employee’s wishes for part-time employment.</p>
<p>Part-time employment affects the size of earnings and thus the possibilities of an individual to support himself through his own work. A person who works part time is also affected in that a low income has an impact on the transfer systems. This applies to the size of pension benefit and health and unemployment insurance benefits.</p>
<p>Several studies show that people working part time have poorer chances of development and career opportunities than those working full time. For many part-time unemployed the sometimes variable work schedule is an obstacle to their arranging the necessary education and skills development.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has drawn the conclusion from available labour market statistics that the number of part time unemployed is at least 200 000 people. Of them, about three quarters are women. The Inquiry has defined a person who is part-time unemployed as a person employed part time (1 34 hours per week) and who works less than he or she wishes due to labour market reasons.</p>
<p>For the majority part time work is an entry into the labour market and in the long term can lead on to full-time employment. The statistical material also shows that about three quarters of those employed part time at a given time are satisified with the number of working hours. But studies and the National Labour Market Board (AMS) register data show that many part time unemployed remain in part-time employment against their will for a long period. At the same time as part-time employment affords the opportunity of establishment in the labour market, for many it also entails a risk of being locked into part-time employment for a long time.</p>
<p>In recent years many valuable efforts, aimed at solving the problem of part time unemployment, have been made at organisation and workplace level. For example county councils have achieved very good results in reducing part time unemployment in their own organisations. There are also several good examples among municipalities, even though the efforts there have not come as far. In recent years the National Labour Market Board (AMS) has worked actively to reduce part time unemployment, for example by introducing new working methods and routines aimed at informing employers about part time unemployment among</p>
<p>staff in their own operations. In 2002 2004 the ”HelaProjektet” (FullProject) implemented 63 local projects. Many voluntary efforts have been made and their value should not be underestimated, but the Inquiry has nevertheless concluded that up to now efforts have been insufficient, since part-time employment is still high.</p>
<p>In 1997 a rule was introduced that under certain circumstances gives part time employees the preferential right to increased working hours (Section 25 a of the Employment Protection Act). In the motives for the legislation the Government stated that the aim should be full-time employment, and part-time employment should only be considered when it was justified with regard to the needs of the operation or the wishes of the employee. Experience seems to show, however, that Section 25 a of the Employment Protection Act has been applied to a relatively limited extent. The intentions behind the Section have, thus, not been fully possible to realise.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has stressed the advantages of allowing the social partners the possibility of agreeing on the choice between full-time and part-time employment, thus solving the problem of part time unemployment themselves. At the same time, the investigation made by the Inquiry indicates that collective agreements giving employees a direct say in the choice between full-time and parttime work have not been signed.</p>
<p>The picture of part time unemployment gained by the Inquiry indicates that it is a considerable problem for the individual and for society. The unequal gender distribution, to the disadvantage of women, is in itself a problem. The Inquiry has come to the conclusion that there are strong reasons for solving the problem of part time unemployment through legislation and that these reasons are of greater weight than those that may be brought to bear against this. The Inquiry has therefore determined that there are weighty reasons for implementing reform through legislation based on the guidelines drawn up in the Inquiry’s terms of reference.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s work on the proposed legislation has been based on the premise that a regulation must not make it more difficult for the social partners to effect necessary changes. The work of the Inquiry has also focused on considering regulation that gives the parties an incentive to continue and intensify their efforts to find solutions that cater for both employers’ and employees’ interests. Another reference point for the work has been considering</p>
<p>regulation that effectively reduces the extent of the problem, particularly in industries where part time work is common.</p>
<p>The decisive issue has been, however, how regulation can be formulated so as to express a balance between the individual employee’s demands to make a living and be established in working life and the employers’ sometimes conflicting interest in being able to organise and run operations in the way the employer regards as most expedient. Consideration has been given here to the commitments that follow from the Part-time Work Directive and undertakings within the context of Sweden’s membership of the International Labour Organisation (ILO).</p>
<p>The Inquiry is proposing a new rule that employment contracts must refer to full-time work. Departures from the general rule assume that the employer and employee make a special agreement on this and that it is permitted by law or collective agreement. According to the proposal an employment contract for part-time work which is in conflict with the general rule must be declared valid for full-time employment by a court of law if the employee so petitions. The general rule that employment contracts refer to full time work also implies that a person maintaining that a contract refers to part time bears the legal responsibility for proving this. This will require of the employer that he or she carefully reviews the possibility of offering full-time employment when the employee so wishes and – ultimately in a dispute – specifies an acceptable reason for choosing part-time employment.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also considered it important that the present rule on the preferential right to increased working hours is tightened up and developed in order to afford part-time employees real possibilities of extending their working hours. In many cases it may appear to be a reasonable demand of an employer that he or she at least at some time during a long period of time should be able to incorporate a part-time employee in the organisation on a full-time basis, when the employee has expressed a wish to that effect. A strengthening of the preferential right should therefore also include a demand in principle that employers in time should offer part-time workers full-time positions in the organisation. This demand should be formulated with an ultimate time limit for when the employer at the latest must have satisfied the employee’s wishes for full-time employment.</p>
<p>In the light of this, the Inquiry proposes a rule implying that an employee who has notified the employer of interest in full-time</p>
<p>employment and thereafter is employed for a total of more than three years within the past five years, must be able to obtain a court order that the employment contract refers to full time work. By means of a rule of this type it will be possible for the employee to bring about a review of the situation and elicit a more definite answer with reference to his notification of interest. The fundamental idea is, however, that the employer is to satisfy the employee’s wishes as soon as there are duties available for which the employee has sufficient qualifications, and not wait until the three years have passed. But if the employee has not been given full-time employment, the new rule will provide the possibility of having the matter reviewed.</p>
<p>Apart from the possibility of obtaining a court order that the contract refers to full time work, an employee shall also be able to bring an action for damages for the violation implied by the employer’s breach of the law, and in certain cases also bring an action for financial compensation.</p>
<p>The right to full-time employment must, then, be possible to be determined in a court of law. In this connection, however, the Inquiry considered that it is not appropriate for the court to “take the place of” the employer and in some sense overrule business decisions or decisions concerning a company’s internal organisational structure. In the opinion of the Inquiry the court hearing can in normal cases be restricted to a more general examination of the reasons behind the employer’s decision to offer the employee full time or part-time employment and that these reasons appear acceptable. Only in exceptional cases should the procedure be more exhaustive. In those cases the courts will have reason to review more closely the validity of the employer’s reasons for his decision.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that the employer’s obligation to negotiate with and inform the trade union organisations be extended. An employer who is bound by collective agreement and who enters into a contract for part-time employment for work covered by the agreement, shall be obliged to inform the employee organisation concerned about the contract. The obligation to inform may contribute to the employer carefully considering and being prepared to justify the choice between part time and full-time employment already at the time of recruiting. It also provides the employee organisation with an opportunity to follow on a more continuous basis the incidence of part-time employment at a</p>
<p>workplace and, where necessary, to start negotiations with the employer. The obligation to negotiate provides the opportunity for trade union insight and monitoring of correct compliance with the rules.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that a new Act be introduced to strengthen the right to full-time employment. A special Act will make it possible to provide a total presentation of rules aimed at giving employees a stronger right to full-time employment or the desired number of working hours.</p>
