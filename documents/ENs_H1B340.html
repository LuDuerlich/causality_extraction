<p>Intruduction</p>
<p>Sweden has a public sector that in many ways is one of the most efficient in the world. This is thanks to a successful combination of well-educated staff, flexible organisation, a high degree of decentralisation, a high level of confidence, and a curiosity about and interest in testing new technologies, new methods and new services. In Sweden, you can file your tax return at the touch of a button, collect a parcel while doing your food shopping, check into a patient hotel after giving birth, and conduct simple medical tests at home and see the results on your computer.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Sweden is also facing significant challenges in terms of waning confidence in public institutions, long-term financing of health and social care, energy systems, an ageing population, integration, environmental damage, the education system, violence, youth unemployment, serious crime and other social issues that are difficult to solve. The Government’s</p>
<p>Commission on the Future of Sweden has recently carried out an invaluable in-depth study of these ever-topical issues.</p>
<p>Many of these issues are unlikely to be resolved once and for all, but it is our firm belief that public administration could do a great deal more than is the currently the case – at the same cost or lower.</p>
<p>It is our impression that the municipalities, county councils and government agencies are bubbling with ideas and a desire for change. There is also a great deal of engagement among people in general, businesses and civil society in how public administration should be further developed. This energy must be harnessed to a much greater degree than is currently the case.</p>
<p>The values created by public administration change over time, which is why an ongoing dialogue is needed between voters,</p>
<p>elected representatives, commissioning bodies, providers and</p>
<p>‘clients’ about which values we want to achieve and how.</p>
<p>Administration has a very important role here to listen to the views and needs expressed by people, businesses and others, not least because they are very much involved in creating and upholding these values (e.g. by complying with regulations, living healthily, helping relatives, etc.). We believe that openness, the inclusion of citizens, businesses and civil society in the shaping of public administration, and an improved holistic and long-term approach in political decision-making are important steps in its further development.</p>
<p>Given the many challenges that Sweden, too, is facing, it is no coincidence that the Riksdag has decided that public administration needs to become more innovative. Nor is it a coincidence that the Government has drawn up an innovation strategy that also includes the public sector. If Sweden is to continue growing as a welfare state and take the lead internationally, public administration needs to continue to think innovatively, break with patterns and challenge the givens.</p>
<p>Contribution by the National Council for Innovation and Quality in the Public Sector</p>
<p>This report aims to support and stimulate innovation and change efforts in public administration in two ways. Firstly, we have submitted proposals aimed at further clarifying the Government’s policy in this area. We want to improve the conditions in public administration for thinking innovatively to do good, for moving from idea to action, and for taking controlled risks.</p>
<p>The aim of our proposals  is to achieve:</p>
<p> increased focus on needs, value creation and systems;</p>
<p> greater scope for public administration to try new services and methods for achieving the aim of policy;</p>
<p> an infrastructure for managing ideas and knowledge;</p>
<p> improved capacity of public administration to carry out innovation and change processes; and</p>
<p> new instruments that promote  long-term investments in social issues that are difficult to solve.</p>
<p>Secondly, we want to encourage ongoing dialogue in municipalities, county councils and government agencies among the people who are involved in developing public administration in their everyday work. We would therefore like to encourage the Government to invite opinions not only on our proposals but also our reasoning and perceptions, in the consultation round or some other way. This applies, in particular, to the extent to which our reasoning can be of use in government agencies’ operational development.</p>
<p>Increased focus on needs, value creation and systems</p>
<p>We believe there is a need for some important shifts in perspective in the public sector. The first shift in perspective concerns how we view the needs that people and businesses have in their dealings with the public sector and how these needs can best be met within the framework of legislation. The public sector today is not primarily organised to meet the needs that people have in their everyday lives or that businesses have in their operations; instead, it is historically grounded, in line with regulatory frameworks tailored to the public sector’s needs. Efforts to gear public administration more towards meeting the needs of the people have been under way for several decades, but far too many people still feel that dealing with public bodies is complicated. This may be a factor contributing to waning confidence in various social institutions. For the individual, the value of public administration is not created by forms being easy to fill in, internet services working well or staff being competent, even though each of these is an important component. For individuals, value is created when their goals and objectives have been achieved, e.g. when they have recovered from an operation, when all the permits are in place and they have started their business, when they have found a job or when the production plant has been extended.</p>
<p>We therefore propose  that public services be developed based on a new model that builds on life events and knowledge of the various needs that people have at different stages of life and that businesses have at various stages of operations.</p>
<p>The second shift in perspective concerns how we view governance and how public administration creates value for people, businesses and society as a whole. Governance and the conditions for governance change over time. There are many indications that hierarchical and more authoritative governance mechanisms are being replaced by horizontal, network-like and more egalitarian mechanisms. There seems to be consensus that governance has become more complicated, which should mean that the conditions for, and demands on, the role of policy in governance have changed. The notion that policy sets objectives that public administration should achieve remains prevalent, despite all the evidence suggesting that it is difficult in practice to make such a distinction, and despite the fact that there are rarely any clear linear links between political decisions and what ultimately actually happens in society. In our view, the results in the form of actual impact on society from public administration generally emerge through intricate interaction between people in and outside government agencies in complex systems. It is therefore these systems – rather than individual agencies or bodies – that must be given greater attention, e.g. with regard to how the various parts interact. By gaining a better understanding of these systems and thinking about them in new ways, we believe that we can considerably improve the prospects for future prosperity.</p>
<p>A simple accountability model consisting of one single responsible party and one single party demanding accountability is therefore also an inadequate description of reality. Many public sector employees see themselves working in various forms of partnership, where different parties are responsible for different parts of a joint operation, i.e. a system with several responsible parties.</p>
<p>We therefore propose  that the capacity to understand and manage this complexity be strengthened, for example in the Government Offices. The system approach offers a procedure and methods for providing new perspectives to social issues that are difficult to solve; this can help to unleash the power of innovation.</p>
<p>We also propose  that public control systems be developed on the basis of a system approach so that they focus more on real impact on society and less on details and the performance of individual organisations on the basis of an outdated accountability model.</p>
<p>Scope for public sector services</p>
<p>The fact that the Riksdag and the Government have highlighted innovation as an important watchword for public administration helps to create significant scope that public administration should seize. However, there are contrasting movements that considerably limit the ability of public administration to develop. We believe that confidence is an important cornerstone of Swedish administration and its development. Change requires leaders who take risks, empowered employees and a high level of confidence – between politicians and officials, between managers and staff, between agencies at various levels, and between individuals and the public sector. It cannot be stressed enough how important it is to build on one of Sweden’s foremost assets – trust. We therefore consider that the trend of recent years towards diminishing trust and more control is counterproductive. It is misleading to believe that it is possible in one-year cycles to control, evaluate and report your way to desired results in an increasingly complex world and on issues that take a long time to change. The rear-view mirror is becoming so large that it is obscuring the view ahead. Control systems, administrative routines, the fear of making mistakes and a public sector organised in thousands of more or less separate divisions at various levels prevent competent staff from meeting society’s needs on the basis of policy.</p>
<p>We therefore propose  that the Riksdag and the Government review their positions on the establishment of special agencies whose main task is to inspect other agencies under the Government.</p>
<p>We also propose  that agencies under the Government be allowed greater financial scope.</p>
<p>In addition, we propose  that unnecessary burdens on agencies in the form of regulations be reviewed so that agencies can free up resources for operations that create value.</p>
<p>One important aspect of innovation and renewal efforts is the opportunity for agencies to launch concrete pilot projects so that they can test new ideas on a limited scale and learn from them. As</p>
<p>the real world is complex and subject to change, it is difficult to fully predict the consequences of various changes and how people will react to a certain measure or reform. Developing ideas in a real environment therefore provides important knowledge of the consequences a change will actually have in practice. Testing proposals in a real environment within the framework of pilot projects provides valuable information ahead of a decision on the permanent and perhaps national implementation of a certain proposal.</p>
<p>We therefore propose  that the pilot statutes instrument be used more systematically to test new solutions. Pilot statutes and associated evaluations are a good way of testing changes under controlled forms and creating a good basis for decisions. Where it is possible and ethically justifiable, these pilot projects should be carried out in the form of randomised controlled trials to be better able to obtain as reliable knowledge as possible about the development measures that work.</p>
<p>Infrastructure for managing ideas and knowledge</p>
<p>One success factor in innovative organisations is that every employee is seen as a potential innovator and implementer of change. This approach should also be integrated into the public sector to a greater extent. Public sector employees have a great deal of knowledge and a wealth of ideas that, if there were clearer support, could be used and better channelled than is currently the case. One method that has proven to be appropriate in large companies wanting to improve their innovative capacity is building new working methods in combination with IT support through ‘idea management systems’. These are used to try to match ideas that employees want to share with the needs or problems that others in the organisation are looking to solve. The National Council for Innovation and Quality in the Public Sector considers that new working methods for the development of ideas, combined with idea management systems, can help to unleash employees’ innovative capacity, steer ideas to where they are needed, clarify the process for improvement suggestions and feedback, and bring together people working on similar problem-solving issues in various parts of public administration. An inter-agency system for ideas management, knowledge-sharing and cooperation could contribute</p>
<p>to effective problem-solving across agency divides and help the public sector to make better use of the combined competence and ideas that exist within its ranks.</p>
<p>We therefore propose  that an infrastructure for ideas and knowledge management be built in public administration.</p>
<p>Capacity to carry out innovation and change processes</p>
<p>There must be capacity to carry out change processes based on the purpose of operations. This is about the motivation and skills of individuals and the capacity of organisations to move from idea to implementation, to change behaviour and create value – either on their own or in collaboration.</p>
<p>The impact of an innovative and collaborating administration is to a large extent affected by the attitude and skills of those managing it. Managing and developing learning organisations and promoting innovations and new thinking require a certain competency. The innovation and renewal dimension must be made more prominent in the recruitment procedure so as to get managers who have the right competency and attitude to lead a changing administration. This, combined with appropriate terms of employment and possibly also incentives, could lead to more managers who can, want to and dare to develop public administration.</p>
<p>We therefore propose  that capabilities and experience in terms of innovation and change work be taken into account when drawing up candidate profiles for the recruitment of agency heads.</p>
<p>We also propose  the creation of a programme for directors general that supports them in their work to develop and renew public administration.</p>
<p>Moreover, we propose  a more detailed analysis of various forms of incentives that could favour sustainable renewal efforts from a holistic perspective.</p>
<p>The knowledge of the public sector and its ability to think innovatively and develop operations need to be strengthened, and methods for understanding and changing various complex systems need to be developed further. A concerted effort is required on the part of the entire public sector to further develop public services based on the perspectives and needs of people and businesses. Design, behavioural science and ethnology are examples of disciplines that</p>
<p>could help to develop services for people and businesses, policy processes and other changes in various systems. The National Council for Innovation and Quality in the Public Sector considers that several agencies need tangible support in developing both internal operations and collaboration across agency and organisation divides.</p>
<p>We therefore propose  the creation of a development and competence centre for public services. This centre should be a permanent development environment where a critical mass of various skills is present, with the aim of building knowledge of people’s and businesses’ needs in terms of public services, based on a holistic perspective, i.e. based on various life events.</p>
<p>Responsibility for the continuing development of statecontrolled activities lies with each agency. Agencies should also cooperate to make things easier for individuals and to avoid duplication. There is currently no appreciable follow-up of the extent to which agencies are actually engaging in continuing development of operations or cooperation.</p>
<p>We therefore propose  that the Swedish National Audit Office find ways of examining how agencies under the Government live up to the demands for continuing operations development and cooperation, in line with the Government Agencies Ordinance.</p>
<p>New instruments that promote long-term investments in social issues that are difficult to solve</p>
<p>Short-term planning in public administration leads to poor management of society’s resources and makes it difficult to take sustainable action on the social issues that are difficult to solve. It is true of course that relatively low costs at an early stage are better than high costs at a later stage. We therefore believe that it is important to test additional mechanisms that secure long-term management, and to ensure that the public sector develops the capacity to identify, calculate and implement important social investments in human capital. We believe that there is a need for new forms of social investments.</p>
<p>We therefore propose  the establishment of a social investment fund under the responsibility of the state. The main aim of the fund is to reduce the scope of social problems that could be</p>
<p>prevented and thus promote the more efficient use of resources over time and between sectors and responsible authorities.</p>
<p>We also propose  that the state issue a new form of social impact bonds in a pilot project. The aim of these obligations is to attract additional long term capital for certain social issues that are difficult to solve and to provide opportunities for testing new methods without risking public funds.</p>
