<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>During the last few decades, the number of large predatory animals in Sweden has increased. One consequence of this growth is that predators, in particular wolves and lynx, are spreading across the country. Current predator policy has thus been fortunate from the predators' perspective. However, the policy and its management has been less successful in dealing with the conflicts that have arisen in connection with predatory growth. Rural industries such as reindeer herding, summer farms, sheep farming and hunting believe they have limited opportunities to influence their own situation. They consider the legislation to be too biased in favour of the predators and too limited in the extent to which it takes into account the rural industries and hunting. The Report finds that a long-term sustainable predator policy, to a greater extent than at present, needs to balance the needs of rural industries, including hunters, with measures for the conservation of biodiversity. The management must create forms for coexistence between humans and wolves while taking into account the best interests of both.</p>
<p>The recent opinion poll shows that the majority of the population is satisfied with or undecided to the current number of wolves and that most people do not wish the number to increase. The polarisation between city and countryside appears persistent or even increasing. City dwellers have a more positive view of wolves than rural residents. The survey reveals strong support for wolf hunting and relatively weak support for management measures where the government relocates wolves or places wolf pups in the wild. Public confidence in how the Riksdag (Parliament) and administrating authorities are handling the predator policy and its management appears to be waning.</p>
<p>Most of the Report's recommendations are therefore about how predator policy and its management should be developed in order to provide an administration that involves improved opportunities</p>
<p>for coexistence between predators – especially wolves – and humans and their livelihoods, not least rural industries. My conviction is that developed and partially renewed strategic objectives with a more efficient culling, a somewhat new compensation system, a new management plan for wolves as well as a slightly reappraised and rearranged legislation, can restore confidence in the Swedish wolf policy at the same time as Sweden fulfils the requirements of the EU Habitats Directive. This would also create good conditions for the discontinuance of the current infringement procedure against Sweden.</p>
<p>The Report's proposal for measures can be summarised as follows:</p>
<p>- clarification of the policy direction and purpose of the predator policy</p>
<p>- development of comprehensive wildlife management legislation</p>
<p>- creation of conditions for adaptive management</p>
<p>- simplification of the culling process</p>
<p>- increased compensation for damages caused by predators</p>
<p>- further development of  damage-preventing measures</p>
<p>- concrete definition of the management plan for wolves</p>
<p>- decision for an action plan for genetic reinforcement of the wolf population</p>
<p>- curb on illegal hunting</p>
<p>- introduction of opportunities for licensed hunting of wolves, when favorable conservation status is achieved</p>
<p>- allocation of sufficient resources to the responsible authorities</p>
<p>- conduct of  socio-economic analysis related to predator presence</p>
<p>- establishment of a permanent wolf committee</p>
<p>Clarification of the policy direction and purpose of the predator policy</p>
<p>The main elements of the Report's proposal suggest that the Riksdag (Parliament) should outline the overall goals of the predator policy and its management. The focus should also continue to be to maintain or achieve long-term viable populations of large predators. A natural dispersal across the country has been allowed but wolf</p>
<p>establishments will generally be limited to territories outside the reindeer owners' year-round lands. This means that the large predators should be found in such great numbers as required to achieve and maintain a favourable conservation status in accordance with the requirements of the Habitats Directive. Given that the wolf can potentially have a major impact on livelihoods, hunting and the rural population, and given the costs it can cause society, the number of wolves in Sweden should not be allowed to permanently exceed that which has been determined as a favourable conservation status. The Riksdag should accordingly decide that the Swedish wolf population will vary within a determined range of a favourable conservation status. The calculation of minimum viable population is based on the scientific data regarding population size requested by the Habitats Directive. It would not be feasible to determine on scientific grounds which level is significantly higher  than the minimum viable population. Guidelines for how this level will be established should therefore be determined by the Riksdag. It is entirely a national decision. As long as it is based on scientific data (for example, minimum viable population, MVP), it is also in accordance with the Habitats Directive.</p>
<p>As long as the level for a favourable conservation status is not determined, the policy direction will remain unclear. Decisions on favourable conservation status should therefore be made promptly. The current level of wolf population is close to four times higher than the minimum viable population, as calculated by the ”Scandinavian wolfscience project” on behalf of the Environmental Protection</p>
<p>Agency. For effective management, a favourable conservation status should not be set higher than absolutely necessary. The Riksdag should therefore request that the Government commission the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency to, in dialogue with the Swedish Board of Agriculture, promptly decide on the range for the favourable conservation status.</p>
<p>Gene flow and genetic variation is an important source of information for assessing the favourable conservation status. The genetics of wolves should therefore be periodically monitored using a random selection of wolves. Changes in the genetic status may lead to measures to strengthen the genetics, primarily through the relocation of wolf pairs or, if the genetics have been strengthened, to a reduced range for favourable conservation status.</p>
<p>Today the wolf population has increased to a number signifying the spread of the species to new areas where there is a high density</p>
<p>of domestic animals. There is a risk that keeping domestic animals in some areas will become significantly more difficult and locally untenable. Therefore the Riksdag should show an ambition to see that attacks on domestic animals by predators does not become so great that it becomes difficult or untenable to keep domestic animals in any part of Sweden. In cases where local attacks becomes too frequent, a geographic redistribution of the wolf population should be considered.</p>
<p>The Riksdag should also make clear that a long-term viable wolf population is dependent on a sufficient number of wolves being allowed to wander into the wolf counties through reindeer owners' year-round lands and winter grazing areas.</p>
<p>Development of comprehensive wildlife management legislation</p>
<p>A long-term sustainable predator policy must be based on legislation that is clear and predictable. It must be based on the interaction between predator and prey, and take into account the economic, social, cultural and regional needs. Current laws and regulations need to be adjusted and adapted to each other and a new more concrete management plan for wolves is needed. EU Directives also need to be more clearly incorporated in the legislation. The ongoing Game Law Report has been tasked with modernising the hunting legislation and, as part of the work, needs to take predator management into account in comprehensive wildlife management legislation. The Report proposes that the existing legislation be supplemented with a regulation on the management of wild mammals and birds where predators are given a central place. In the long run, a joint management plan should also be produced together with Norway and Finland where general and common guidelines for the management are established. It should, for example, indicate how countries can work together to assist each other with the goal of strengthening the genetics of the wolves. A similar agreement should also be established with Russia further down the line.</p>
<p>Creation of conditions for adaptive management</p>
<p>The key to full-scale adaptive management lies in establishing a favourable conservation status and in Sweden showing how our country intends to achieve and maintain this. This will allow the EU to drop the infringement case against Sweden. The management plans may in fact be adaptive and based on a cyclical and learning process.</p>
<p>In order for the management to be able to continuously change and still be perceived as clear and long-term, it needs to be directed toward goals that are understood and accepted by the people affected. The management must therefore be further established at the regional level so that the relevant people become involved in shaping the regional and local administration. This must of course be achieved within the context of national and international legislation such as the Habitats Directive.</p>
<p>Regional authorities must therefore be allowed greater responsibility to deal with predator issues. In their professional capacity, the county administrative boards are specialised in dealing with areas of activity characterised by conflict, and have comprehensive and broad competencies well-suited to addressing these issues.</p>
<p>In order for greater regionalisation not to jeopardise the national targets, it is proposed that the Environmental Protection Agency commission the county administrative boards to ensure that the regional predator targets in all counties collectively fall within the range of the favourable conservation status for the State.</p>
<p>The Report also suggests that the county administrative boards be given the mandate to decide on the licensed hunting of predators if the species at the national level fall within the range of the favourable conservation status, and if they exceed the agreed upon regional minimum levels. The Report also proposes that the county administrative boards be authorised to decide on the culling of predators as soon as they constitute a regular presence in the county. An expanded delegation of culling hunts as soon as predators appear in the county will by all accounts only marginally increase the level of shooting. It will not affect whether or not Sweden can manage to maintain favourable conservation status. However, it is of great importance for people's acceptance and a central part of an effective adaptive management that responsible agencies can provide prompt culling decisions.</p>
<p>Simplification of the culling process</p>
<p>Based on experience, it can be concluded that existing damage preventing measures do not provide satisfactory results when applied to reindeer herding, summer farms and livestock on archipelago islands. As these industries can also be classed as cultural with regional characteristics, which are taken into account under the Habitats Directive, there are particularly strong reasons to facilitate culling for these industries. The Report's conclusion is that for each individual case it is not justifiable to re-test damage prevention measures that have already been tried on numerous occasions with poor results on free-ranging animals. Reasonably, the industries mentioned must be able to refer to the fact that they have already tried the damage preventing measures that are available. The Report therefore recommends they grant culling after the first attack as long as a documented genetically important wolf specimen is not involved.</p>
<p>If attacks occur despite animal owners having a county administrative board approved predator repellent enclosure, culling should be permitted after the first attack.</p>
<p>Neither should it be necessary in every individual case where culling may be relevant in other contexts – such as flocks of sheep</p>
<p>– to try all other imaginable protective measures if there is empirical data and experience that speaks to the contrary. Sweden should therefore work to have this approach codified by the European Commission in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p>A more liberal culling would mean a lot to the individual animal owner and probably also for the broad acceptance of the predator policy. It would only have a limited impact on the predator populations.</p>
<p>Increased compensation for damages caused by predators</p>
<p>Something that animal keepers often state is that predator attacks do not only cause an initial loss of income, but also result in a worsened economy over a period of years. The Report therefore recommends that the Government commission Viltskadecenter (Wildlife Damage Centre) to analyse the indirect damages that may occur when predators attack and submit proposals on compensation levels for the damages. The Report further suggests that compensation levels and</p>
<p>the basis for these, as well as what should be reimbursed, be standardised across the country and made binding for the county administrative boards. The Report also recommends that the government funding be increased so that it meets the needs of predator county administrative board estimates of what is needed for full compensation to be awarded.</p>
<p>The State should also prevent future claims for damage to wildlife reserves by reviewing compensation options and compensation levels for damages to these.</p>
<p>Further development of damage-preventing measures</p>
<p>The Report considers that the damage preventing measures need to be further developed and refined, and that the affected industries must be given the opportunity to participate in the development process. Consideration should be given to grants for emergency teams that through herding prevent damage to summer farms and reindeer herds in the presence of wolves. Similarly, the possibility of using livestock guard dogs for herds with loose housing should be investigated in detail. The Rural Development Programme prioritises grant payments based on the value of land, i.e., land with particularly high biodiversity is prioritised. Cultivation of these lands is given high priority on payment of fencing grants. This does not necessarily equate with animal keepers who have the greatest need of fencing grants. For this reason, the form of financing should be evaluated.</p>
<p>As predators, mainly lynx and wolves, spread southwards, the risk of attacks in wildlife reserves increases. The Report therefore recommends that the new legislation includes a review of funding options and grant levels for damage preventing measures in wildlife reserves. The Report further suggests that grant levels and the basis for these, as well as what grants should be received for, be standardised across the country and made binding for the county administrative boards.</p>
<p>Concrete definition of the management plan for wolves</p>
<p>The Report proposes that the Riksdag and Government clarify the management plans' meaning. The purpose of the management must be shown as well as the long term goals for the species to which the management plan relates. In addition to this, the execution of the management needs to be described, as well as the monitoring and evaluation of implemented measures, and what consequences this has for the continued management.</p>
<p>The management plans need to be adaptive, concrete, predictable and clear and there needs to be a clear plan on how the management of wolves in the long run will interact with other large predators and their common prey. Therefore a clear link to the elk management plans is needed, and there may also be a need to develop management plans also for other ungulates.</p>
<p>Decision for an action plan for genetic reinforcement of the wolf population</p>
<p>The Report proposes that a plan of action for genetic reinforcement be developed and that it be part of the management plan. In order for the natural migration – which is a prerequisite for successful genetic reinforcement – to be effective and provide the desired results, a clear action plan developed together with the reindeer owners and other relevant actors is required. Within the framework of what the Riksdag has decided, the plan should clarify the conditions surrounding the migration. It should clearly state which wolves should be allowed to wander through the year-round lands and when culling will be permitted. The management must find a form where wolves that do not cause harm may wander down to the wolf counties and where breeds that cause damage are quickly removed, either by culling or relocation. Exceptional litters of particularly valuable wolf pairs should, in accordance with the basic principle of “primarily natural migration” be allowed within the year-round lands. However this requires the support and approval of the affected reindeer owners.</p>
<p>The Report proposes that the policy and its management clarify that the number of wolves in Sweden is directly linked to how the genetic reinforcement is achieved. The management plan should describe how it will be accomplished and also describe alternative solutions. The plan should clearly point out which release sites will</p>
<p>be used if and when the relocation of wolves arises. A plan for genetic reinforcement should also contain a clear purpose and goals for relocation. A plan also needs to provide a basis for the relocations, so that the wolves are relocated to an area where they have the greatest opportunity of success.</p>
<p>In order for the release of pups to be a justifiable alternative, the Report is of the opinion that the difficulties must be eliminated or at least substantially reduced. The management plan needs to include an account of how this is to be achieved. If it transpires that current problems cannot be dealt with, the Government should consider postponing any release of pups in the future.</p>
<p>Finally, the administration's overall strategic objectives should be supplemented with goals for impact. What impact in the form of, for example, predator attacks on domestic animals should be considered acceptable? If such a ambition is formulated then the management plan must also outline the actions to be taken if attacks exceed the tolerance level.</p>
<p>Curb on illegal hunting</p>
<p>Several studies claim that illegal hunting is a widespread phenomenon. The Report proposes that the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency be commissioned to conduct periodic assessments of the scope of illegal hunting.</p>
<p>Introduction of opportunities for licensed hunting of wolves, when favorable conservation status is achieved</p>
<p>Aside from through natural mortality and road accidents, the harvest of the wolf population primarily occurs through culling. If the total mortality, including culling, is less than rejuvenation – while at the same time favourable conservation status is achieved – it should be possible to harvest the population through the hunting of wolves with a low degree of genetic variation. If, despite continuous efforts to achieve reinforcement, the genetics are not improved, an increase in the wolf population will occur and new follow-ups will verify whether or not the genetics have improved. If instead the genetics are improved, the value of the favourable conservation status may be reassessed and the wolf population's numbers allowed to decline.</p>
<p>Allocation of sufficient resources to the responsible authorities</p>
<p>Increased predator populations result in increased costs for the regional administration. Following the Government's extra funding to regional predator management, there is still a shortfall of about SEK 30 million for the administration in the northern and central predator management areas. The increased costs of administration in the southern predator management area mean that there is no appreciable funding for well-functioning regional predator management in Sweden.</p>
<p>Financing could be achieved, for example, through the reappropriation of funding to the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>Conduct of socio-economic analysis related to predator presence</p>
<p>The Report proposes that an appropriate actor be commissioned to carry out a detailed socio-economic analysis of predator presence. The analysis should focus on gathering further knowledge about:</p>
<p>- today's costs, mainly the indirect costs</p>
<p>- how the number of predators affects the  cost-benefit picture</p>
<p>In the socio-economic analysis conducted under the direction of the Report, it is stated that it was not possible to express the total costs and benefits of predator presence in SEK. Partly due to the lack of supporting data but also because of the numerous and often complex conflicts of interest that result from the predator's presence. The study conducted shows that there is a significant positive welfare effect from keeping viable populations of the four predators in Sweden. It also found that the costs to society as a result of predator presence are greatly underestimated if only direct costs of attacks on humans, dogs and livestock are included. The indirect costs are often substantial. In order to reach a consensus on the predator issue, authorities and cost bearers need to share the same realistic perception of the costs incurred today. For this reason, there is a significant need for an in-depth socio-economic analysis.</p>
<p>Establishment of a permanent wolf committee</p>
<p>Confidence in policy and government action is crucial for the acceptance of the predator policy. Opinion polls show that people today have a lack of confidence in the Riksdag, Government and the administrating authorities. The justification for establishing a parallel forum to the Nationella rovdjursrådet (National Predator Council) is mainly that it allows a more direct dialogue between the Government and the managements of the relevant organisations. Such a committee should not include the participation of representatives from central or regional authorities, other than to report on current issues.</p>
