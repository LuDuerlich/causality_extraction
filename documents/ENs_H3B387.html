<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction: the Inquiry’s remit</h2>
<p>Under its terms of reference (ToR 2014:72), the Inquiry’s remit is to consider whether the current model for levying energy tax on electricity is fit for purpose and to make legislative proposals.</p>
<p>The general premise of the remit is that any change in the energy tax on electricity must be compatible with EU law, that the international competitiveness of the Swedish business sector must be preserved and that distorting consequences must be avoided as far as possible. According to the terms of reference, the Inquiry should mainly focus on reviewing the current levels of taxation, which involve different tax rates for different types of activities.</p>
<h2>Choice of model for taxation of electricity consumption</h2>
<p>Access to statistics from the Swedish Energy Markets Inspectorate and other sources has enabled the Inquiry to make a survey of electricity consumption in the Swedish business sector. On the basis of this survey, the Inquiry has analysed various models of electricity taxation. The alternative models have been compared with one another, using criteria related to the problem description drawn up by the Inquiry. The Inquiry concludes that models without elements of state aid have negative impacts and consequently none of these should be introduced. The Inquiry instead chooses to submit proposals that build further on the taxation model currently in use. The current model needs to include supplementary rules to ensure that Sweden meets EU state aid regulations, which is a prerequisite for continuing to apply lower tax rates to certain activities. Moreover, the Inquiry considers that one more industry, the data centre industry, should qualify for the lower tax rate, provided certain conditions are met.</p>
<h2>Management of state aid</h2>
<p>Since the Inquiry proposes retaining the current model for the taxation of electricity consumption, the existing elements of state aid need to be managed in compliance with EU law. To allow this to happen, the Inquiry proposes changes in the existing model, as described below. The existing elements of state aid that are affected by the Inquiry’s proposals relate to the lower energy tax on electricity used in manufacturing processes in industrial activities, electricity consumed by ships in harbour (shoreside electricity) and the special, lower tax rate in certain municipalities in northern Sweden (the Norrland tax rate).</p>
<h2>Unlawful aid recipient</h2>
<p>Under EU law, state aid may not be given to companies in difficulty or to companies required to repay unlawfully received state aid. The Inquiry proposes that these requirements be summarised in the new expression ‘unlawful aid recipient’ and that an unlawful aid recipient should not be entitled to reduced energy tax.</p>
<h2>Lower tax after deductions or refund</h2>
<p>In practice, electricity suppliers currently serve as a kind of intermediary for the state aid, as they charge customers a lower rate of energy tax on the basis of the activities they conduct. As a result, the electricity suppliers bear the risk of any errors discovered, for example, by Swedish Tax Agency audits. Moreover, this system is untenable if the requirements of EU law are to be met in future. On the Inquiry’s assessment, this means a direct contact needs to be established between the agency providing the aid, i.e. the Swedish Tax Agency, and the aid recipients.</p>
<p>In light of this, the Inquiry proposes that energy tax on electricity be levied at a single  rate irrespective of use. The lower tax rate for certain types of consumption will be achieved by means of pre-tax deductions or a post-tax refund following a demand or application from the taxpayer claiming state aid in the form of lower tax. Deductions can be used by those who are personally liable to pay taxes, while a refund may be used by others. Certain taxpayers will be required to submit the application for a refund electronically.</p>
<h2>Voluntary tax liability, limits on refunds, quarterly applications</h2>
<p>To facilitate processing and reduce liquidity strains, the Inquiry considers it may be warranted to give large electricity consumers, which are also state aid recipients, the option of voluntary tax liability, which would enable them to receive state aid through running deductions rather than refunds. A consumer expected to consume electric power on a very large scale may be approved as voluntarily liable for tax by the Swedish Tax Agency. The Inquiry is not submitting any legislative proposal but considers that a regulation should be introduced in the Energy Tax Ordinance (2010:178) to the effect that the requirement of very large-scale consumption will be deemed to be satisfied if the applicant has an estimated consumption of at least 20 GWh per calendar year.</p>
<p>Those who are not considered to be large-scale consumers will be obliged to receive the state aid through a refund of parts of the tax that the electricity supplier has charged them. The Inquiry considers that in this case as well, there is reason to set limits, so as to keep the administrative burden on companies and the Swedish Tax Agency down where minor amounts of aid are concerned. The Inquiry therefore proposes that a refund of tax on electricity, apart from shoreside electricity, should only be permitted for the share of the tax that exceeds SEK 12 000 per calendar year. The Inquiry makes no proposals on changes in the limits on refunds made to land and water based industries. As a result of the proposal to levy tax at a single rate, commercial greenhouse cultivation will also receive its tax reduction through a refund.</p>
<p>Finally, the Inquiry notes that existing refund rules provide the option of applying for a refund on a quarterly basis, not just per calendar year. This is conditional on the applicant being estimated to consume electricity ‘on a large scale’. The Inquiry proposes that a corresponding regulation be introduced in the primary legislation (the Act), applying to the new refund situations that will result from the Inquiry’s proposals. The Inquiry therefore proposes that the Swedish Tax Agency should be allowed to permit quarterly applications if the applicant is expected to consume electricity on a large scale. The regulation in the Act should be supplemented by a regulation in the secondary legislation (the Ordinance), similar to the existing regulation, concerning the consumption criterion (‘large scale’). The Inquiry considers that consumption in excess of 250 000 KWh per year should be deemed to be ‘large scale’.</p>
<h2>Information concerning state aid recipients</h2>
<p>To make the Swedish system of reduced energy tax rate on electricity for certain types of activities compatible with EU law, certain requirements regarding publication and information must be fulfilled. To this end, the Inquiry proposes the introduction of a requirement that parties claiming a tax rate reduction by means of deductions or refunds must submit information. The consequence of any failure to submit information will be that no tax reduction will be received. The information required will be referred to collectively by the new expression ‘information concerning aid recipient’, and will include the following: 1. the type of company (small or  medium-sized/large) the supplier of information belongs to; 2. the region where the company submitting information has its place of business; and 3. the sector in which the company submitting information operates.</p>
<p>This will comply with certain systems of categorisation used in the EU.</p>
<p>To make it easier to submit information, the Inquiry suggests that the Government or the Swedish Tax Agency should issue enforcement regulations clarifying the information to be submitted in the above respects.</p>
<h2>Tax rate reduction in certain municipalities in northern Sweden will be abolished</h2>
<p>As part of the review of current legislation in the light of EU law, the Inquiry proposes that the special, lower tax rate in certain municipalities in northern Sweden should be abolished. The lower tax rate constitutes state aid when applied to business operators. In the Inquiry’s assessment, it is impossible to retain the special tax rate while fulfilling the requirements of EU law that are to apply in full from 1 July 2016.</p>
<h2>Lower tax for certain large-scale data centres</h2>
<p>State aid in the form of lower tax rate is currently provided to certain types of activities. These include industrial manufacturing. The rationale is that such activities have been regarded as worthy of protection, as they are electricity-intensive while also exposed to international competition, which makes it difficult for them to pass on nationally imposed taxes to final customers.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has looked into electricity use in various industries and has assessed their exposure to competition in terms of trade intensity. The Inquiry considers that the current system supports parts of the business sector that have previously been deemed – and may still be deemed – worthy of protection.</p>
<p>The data centre industry is analysed in particular since it is specially mentioned in the Inquiry’s terms of reference. This industry is only a couple of decades old, but is growing fast both in Sweden and internationally, due to the increasing use of the internet and of online services. The result is an increased need for data centre capacity. The industry is assessed as still having great development potential.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has found that certain companies operating in the data centre industry are both electricity-intensive and exposed to international competition. These are two factors that, in the current model, have been deemed to justify a lower tax rate. In view of this, and considering the potential that lies in the development of an industry that has large investment needs and can generate new jobs, the Inquiry considers that there is sufficient reason to propose a lower tax rate for the data centre industry. The Inquiry therefore submits a proposal to this effect, incorporating it in the system that the Inquiry proposes to fulfil the requirements of EU law.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, the lower tax rate that currently applies to manufacturing in industrial activities will apply to data centres where a business operator mainly engaged in information services, information processing or rental of server space with associated services carries out such activities. Further, the combined installed power capacity of the data centre for equipment other than cooling and ventilating facilities must amount to at least 0.5 megawatts.</p>
<h2>Concept of ‘industrial activities’ should be reconsidered</h2>
<p>The concept of ‘industrial activities’ plays a key role in the energy tax on electricity. However, the Energy Tax Act contains no definition of this concept.</p>
<p>On a rough estimate, up to 70 000 companies may have activeties that can be deemed to be industrial for the purposes of the Act. For the traditional industries, it is mostly obvious that their activeties are industrial. In certain other areas, in contrast, it is difficult and burdensome for both the Swedish Tax Agency and the companies concerned to assess whether an activity is industrial or not. The concept leads to interpretation problems in the application of the law, even though it has existed for a long time. Moreover, as applied at present, it means that electricity is subject to different tax rates, depending on the activity in which it is consumed, even if it is consumed in exactly the same way. Organisational changes made in a company or group for business reasons can also result in a certain activity, all other things being equal, being categorised in an area outside the range of activities that are deemed industrial.</p>
<p>There is a need to reconsider what should be regarded as ‘industrial activity.’ The work that such a review would entail, in the way of obtaining facts, making assessments, presenting proposals and analysing consequences, is too far-reaching to be accommodated within the framework of the Inquiry. However, the Inquiry recommends that such a review be carried out.</p>
<h2>Implications of the Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>Overall, it is estimated that the Inquiry’s proposals will increase state tax revenues by around SEK 975 million.</p>
<p>The abolition of the Norrland tax rate and the introduction of the limit on refunds of electricity tax will lead to increased tax revenues, while a lower tax on certain data centres will give lower tax revenues.</p>
<p>Under the Inquiry’s proposals, certain data centres will have lower costs for energy tax on electricity, while electricity users in certain municipalities in northern Sweden will have higher costs. For example, a data centre with an electricity consumption of 4.4 GWh will receive a lower tax burden by SEK 12.6 million per year. Overall, the industry’s tax burden will be lowered by approximately SEK 245 million.</p>
<p>Households in certain municipalities in northern Sweden will see their tax costs increase by approximately SEK 252 million per year. For a customer living in a flat using 5 000 KWh of electricity per year, this will mean an increase in electricity costs of SEK 625 per year, including VAT. Businesses in these municipalities will have their tax costs increased by nearly SEK 300 million per year. For a company in the service sector using 50 000 KWh per year, the cost increase will be SEK 5 000 per year. The abolition of the Norrland tax rate will also increase the public sector’s tax costs by approximately SEK 97 million per year.</p>
<p>The proposed limit under which a refund of energy tax will be given on the share exceeding SEK 12 000, will entail increased tax revenues of SEK 566 million per year.</p>
<p>As a result of the proposals, the Swedish Tax Agency’s administrative costs are expected to increase by SEK 9.8 million per year, while administrative costs for affected companies are expected to increase by between SEK 42.5 million and SEK 62.8 million per year.</p>
<p>The proposal is expected to have positive competitive effects for the data centre industry. Companies in this industry are exposed to international competition and the Inquiry’s proposal will give them a competitive edge relative to competitors in other countries. As the proposal does not significantly change the conditions for Swedish industrial companies that currently pay the 0.5 öre/kWh tax rate,</p>
<p>the situation of these companies is not expected to change. Companies in certain municipalities in northern Sweden that end up with higher tax costs may find themselves in a marginally poorer competitive position, as the relative advantage they currently enjoy will be taken away, meaning that they are taxed in the same way as other companies. This means that the potentially distortive effect of the current tax rate differential will disappear.</p>
