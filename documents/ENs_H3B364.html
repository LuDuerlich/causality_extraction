<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The Remit</h2>
<p>The remit and focus of the inquiry has been to submit proposals for how state financial support to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) should be organized and conducted in order to be efficient. The focus has been on high-growth enterprises with a high technological content.</p>
<p>The inquiry has analysed and assessed when state financial support, eg. grants, loans or equity, may be motivated in order to correct or complement private financing in the market. In general, the Swedish financial markets are well developed by international comparison. However, the inquiry identifies a need for stronger support in very early stages of the development of new or innovative enterprises. There is also a lack of capital when financing the interval 5–50 million SEK. Furthermore, measures should be taken to enhance the availability of loans for small and mediumsized enterprises in general.</p>
<h2>Proposals</h2>
<p>A new public state-owned fund should be set up in order to coinvest with private capital in venture capital funds. The fund will also act as the holding company in a new investment structure.</p>
<p>The main objective of the new fund will be to co-finance early stage venture capital investments in innovative Swedish enterprises with high-growth potential. Another objective is to contribute to the strenghtening of the overall financial ecosystem in Sweden. The fund will be a limited company called Fondinvest AB, with a total capital of 3 billion SEK.</p>
<p>Fondinvest AB will be a holding fund in a structure comprising several funds. Up to six new funds will be set up with total capital of 500–1 000 million SEK. Furthermore, two EU-financed funds will be incorporated into the new structure. The inquiry also proposes a demonstrator fund, capitalized with 1.5 billion SEK, for investments in production-scale facilities. Fondinvest AB will also administer a loan guarantee system, aimed at securing access of small enterprises to financing.</p>
<p>Finally, the inquiry proposes measures to enhance the support for developing innovative enterprises. In total, 340 million SEK in increased funding is proposed for several measures to enhance loans and grants for innovation.</p>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>In accordance with the proposals, the implementation of the new investment structure should be conducted in 2016 so that the new fund, Fondinvest AB, can be in full operation at the beginning of 2017. The implementation is recommended to be prepared within a special committee as a coordinating party.</p>
