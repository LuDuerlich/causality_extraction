<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Paternity and Parenthood Inquiry has had the remit of reviewing parts of the rules of the Children and Parents Code on establishing paternity and parenthood. Our remit has had a clear focus on three areas. Our remit has included:</p>
<p>• considering whether the parenthood of a spouse or registered partner should be presumed in cases of assisted fertilisation in the same way as how paternity is currently assumed for a married man;</p>
<p>• presenting proposals for how the rules for acknowledgement of paternity and parenthood for unmarried persons can be modernised and simplified, taking account of the importance of an establishment of paternity being correct and the possibilities of simplifying the procedure offered by digitalisation;</p>
<p>• carrying out a review of the regulations on forensic genetic examinations in the investigation of paternity.</p>
<h2>Parenthood is presumed in the same way as paternity when the mother is married Presumption of parenthood</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that parenthood under Chapter 1, Section 9 of the Children and Parents Code should be presumed for the woman who is married to or the registered partner of the child’s mother in the same way as paternity is presumed for a married man.</p>
<p>A presumption of parenthood raises the question of equal treatment in the situation where the child has been conceived through assisted fertilisation with donated sperm. The starting point for the positions taken by the Inquiry is that the regulation of parenthood must be equal and must not distinguish between people on account of sexual orientation or sex unless there are particularly strong reasons to do so.</p>
<p>The presumption of paternity builds on the idea that in the vast majority of cases it specifies the genetic father as the child’s legal father. So the situation for the presumption of paternity differs to some extent from what would apply to a presumption of parenthood. Regarding the first presumption, it is in most cases the sexual intercourse – and genetic relationship – that determines who is considered to be a parent. When it comes to the second presumption, it is the assisted fertilisation – and the consent given by the mother’s spouse or registered partner to the treatment – that determines who is considered to be a parent. Assisted fertilisation for a married female couple always involves donated sperm. As regards a differentsex married couple who undergo assisted fertilisation, this happens in exceptional cases. However, the presumption of paternity also applies to that situation. The rules for satisfying a child’s right to find out about its origins are also the same for a child of a same sex couple as for a child of a different-sex couple. The Inquiry therefore considers that the fact donated sperm are always used when a samesex couple have a child is not a strong reason against a presumption of parenthood since that can also be the case regarding a married different-sex couple and then paternity is always presumed for the man in the marriage.</p>
<p>There is a risk that a parenthood presumed in the future may be set aside if the requirements for parenthood after assisted fertilisation have not been met. The rules recently adopted by the Riksdag (Swedish Parliament) on parenthood after assisted fertilisation abroad (Govt Bill 2017/18:155, Committee Report 2017/18:SoU20, Riksdag Comm. 2017/18:368) mean that this risk will also exist when paternity is presumed. One result of the new rules is that the grounds for setting aside paternity or parenthood will be the same for different-sex couples and same-sex couples. In view of this, the risk that a parenthood may be set aside in the future cannot be considered a strong reason against a presumption of parenthood.</p>
<p>To sum up, the Inquiry considers that there are no strong reasons for treating parenthood for married couples differently when a child has been conceived through assisted fertilisation. A presumption of parenthood should therefore be introduced. This means that it is the marriage that has legal effect for parenthood on the birth of the child.</p>
<p>The presumption of parenthood should be framed in the same way as the presumption of paternity. It should be possible to set aside a parenthood on the same grounds as apply to setting aside a paternity if the child has been conceived through assisted fertilisation with donated sperm. In such cases a court should declare in an action brought by the child or the woman in the marriage that the woman is not a parent of the child. In addition, a number of consequential amendments are proposed on account of the introduction of a presumption of parenthood.</p>
<h2>Presumption of paternity and maternity when a parent has changed their gender 1</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that a legal parenthood should also be assumed when a person who has given birth to a child is married and one or both of the spouses have changed their gender.</p>
<p>In the view of the Inquiry, the presumption of parenthood makes it clear that marriage is also of free-standing importance for legal parenthood in cases of assisted fertilisation. This means that it is not the genetic link between the child and the parent who did not give birth to the child that is the idea underlying this presumption rule. The fundamental requirement for legal parenthood in cases of assisted fertilisation is consent to the treatment through which the child has been conceived.</p>
<p>In the view of the Inquiry, a presumption should therefore also apply when the person who has given birth to a child is married and one or both of the spouses have changed gender. This arrangement means that a presumption applies in the same way for different-sex couples and, through the Inquiry’s proposal, for same-sex couples who are married. In some cases the child may have been conceived through sexual intercourse and in other cases the child may have been conceived through assisted fertilisation.</p>
<p>The presumption of paternity and maternity when one or both parents have changed gender should be framed in the same way as the presumption of paternity. It should be possible to set aside paternity or maternity on the same grounds as apply to the setting aside of paternity. In such cases a court should declare in an action brought by the child or the man or the woman in the marriage that the man or woman is not a father or mother of the child. In addition, a consequential amendment is proposed on account of the introduction of a presumption of maternity.</p>
<h2>New way of confirming paternity and parenthood Change of formal requirements for acknowledgement</h2>
<p>An acknowledgement of paternity is made in writing. The Inquiry proposes removing the witnessing requirement for acknowledgements that relate to children who have not attained 18 years. To ensure that an identity check can be performed, the acknowledgements in these cases should instead always be made at a personal visit to the municipal social welfare committee, as also happens in most cases today. The acknowledgement should, in the same way as today, be accepted in writing by the social welfare committee and the mother.</p>
<p>The witnessing requirement should be retained for acknowledgements of paternity regarding children who are legally competent. As is the case today, the acknowledgement should be accepted in writing by the child itself.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that it is appropriate to continue to regulate the formal requirements for the establishment of paternity by acknowledgement in Chapter 1, Section 4 of the Children and Parents Code. As is the case today, the same formal requirements will also apply, through references to that provision, to acknowledgement of parenthood under Chapter 1, Section 9 of the</p>
<p>Children and Parents Code and for acknowledgement of maternity and paternity when one or both parents have changed gender.</p>
<h2>Electronic acknowledgement should be possible</h2>
<p>The Inquiry presents a proposal that makes it possible to confirm paternity or parenthood electronically within 14 days of the birth of the child.</p>
<p>The same formal requirements as under the main rule in Chapter 1, Section 4 of the Children and Parents Code should apply, with the difference that an electronic acknowledgement will not have to be accepted by the social welfare committee. The possibility of acknowledging electronically should apply if the child, the mother and the person acknowledging paternity or parenthood are registered as being resident in Sweden. A further requirement should be that the mother and the person making the acknowledgement are legally competent. An electronic acknowledgement should be made in a system provided and administered by the Swedish Tax Agency.</p>
<p>The Inquiry makes the assessment that the formal requirements that are necessary to ensure the character of the acknowledgement as an act with legal consequences can be met through an electronic acknowledgement. The requirement of the mother’s approval means that an electronic acknowledgement can ensure that paternity and parenthood are established correctly. The approval means that the mother and the person acknowledging paternity or parenthood are able to provide concordant information when they are convinced that the child is their common child. As a result, the Inquiry make the assessment that an electronic acknowledgement in cases of this kind means that the person acknowledging paternity or parenthood can also be assumed to be the father or parent. Therefore an approval by the social welfare committee should not be required in cases of electronic acknowledgement.</p>
<p>Since paternity or parenthood can only be established if the child is born alive, the Inquiry considers that it is not appropriate to have a system in which an electronic acknowledgement can be made before the birth of the child.</p>
<p>Parents should be able to register joint custody of the child in conjunction with an electronic acknowledgement of paternity or parenthood.</p>
<h2>Responsibilities of the social welfare committee</h2>
<p>The social welfare committee should continue to have a responsibility for establishing a legal parent of the child. If paternity or parenthood has not been established within 14 days from the birth of the child, the social welfare committee’s obligation to investigate paternity comes into effect. The committee may take up the investigation at an earlier point. The Swedish Tax Agency should notify the social welfare committee in cases where a father or parent has not been established on the fifteenth day.</p>
<p>In the view of the Inquiry it is not appropriate for the social welfare committee’s obligation to conduct an inquiry to come into effect while parents are able to acknowledge paternity or parenthood electronically. The social welfare committee’s obligation to investigate paternity should therefore be deferred. The Inquiry’s proposal is that the social welfare committee’s obligation to investigate who is the parent and to ensure that paternity or parenthood is established should be altered to state that the obligation to conduct an investigation comes into effect at the later point in time. As before, the obligation to conduct an investigation should only apply if the child is in someone’s custody and has its habitual residence in Sweden. An amendment to this effect is proposed to Chapter 2, Section 1 of the Children and Parents Code.</p>
<p>So, the obligation to conduct an investigation is unchanged compared with the present position. The proposal for electronic acknowledgement means that many parents will not need the support of the social welfare committee and will use the new option for acknowledgement instead.</p>
<h2>New regulations on forensic genetic examinations in the investigation of paternity</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a new act on forensic genetic examinations to replace the Act concerning blood tests etc. in the investigation of paternity (1958:642). A forensic genetic examination means an examination that is conducted on a person’s genes on behalf of the public authorities in order to investigate the question of paternity. This examination is now conducted by DNA analysis.</p>
<p>The new act should apply to the investigation of paternity by courts and social welfare committees. The act is technology neutral and does not require the examination to be conducted using a certain method, for example DNA analysis of oral swabs or blood analysis.</p>
<p>The act contains provisions on forensic genetic examinations for the establishment of paternity and setting aside of paternity. An order for a forensic genetic examination can refer to the child, the mother and the man who is a possible father of the child.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has concluded that in cases concerning the establishment of paternity it should be possible, under certain circumstances, to order a forensic genetic examination of tissue from a deceased man for investigation of paternity. The Inquiry considers that there are strong reasons to enable such an examination to be conducted regarding the establishment of paternity. It should only be possible to make an order if it can be assumed that the man did have sexual intercourse with the mother during the period when the child could have been conceived. An additional requirement for an order should be that the court makes the assessment that the reasons for the order outweigh the intrusion or other detriment that it entails for the deceased man or some other opposing interest.</p>
<p>After paternity has been established through an acknowledgement or a judgment, a court should be able, in the same way as at present, to order a forensic genetic examination provided that some new fact has emerged that gives reason to assume that some man other than the man who has been established to be the father did have sexual intercourse with the mother during the period when the child may have been conceived. The Inquiry does not consider that the possibility of ordering a new forensic genetic examination should be expanded. A man who has been ruled out as the father of a particular child using older technology will also be ruled out as the father in a new examination using DNA analysis. This means that the result of a new examination will, in practice, mainly be a possibility of setting aside paternity established previously. The Inquiry considers, against this background, that the balance between opposing interests previously decided by the legislator, to the effect that scientific progress regarding examinations should not, in itself, be a sufficient reason for ordering a new examination still holds.</p>
<p>The new act also contains provisions about the competent court, how to appeal orders and court proceedings. It contains regulations that a court can impose a conditional financial penalty and order the assistance of the Swedish Police Authority as to ensure that there are effective means of investigating paternity.</p>
<p>The costs of testing and a forensic genetic examination under the new act and when the social welfare committee initiates such an examination under Chapter 2, Section 6 of the Children and Parents Code should be paid from public funds.</p>
<p>The National Board of Forensic Medicine should be the only actor to carry out forensic genetic examinations on behalf of the public institutions. The main reason is difficulties regarding the need for follow-up and supervision to satisfy the requirement of legal certainty if more actors than the National Board of Forensic Medicine can be engaged by social welfare committees and courts. This service should be financed by appropriations instead of by charges. One consequence is that the full cost of the forensic genetic examinations required to fulfil the state undertaking to investigate questions of paternity will be met by the State.</p>
<h2>Impacts</h2>
<h2>Introduction of presumption of parenthood</h2>
<p>The proposal is judged to have a positive impact for female married couples, women who are registered partners and married couples where one or both of the spouses have changed gender when a child is born. This is because parenthood will be presumed in all these cases instead of being established by an acknowledgement or judgment. Children of married parents will be treated more equally and the proposal can have positive impacts for children.</p>
<p>The proposal only affects a relatively small proportion of the total number of investigations carried out by social welfare committees each year. The Inquiry therefore makes the assessment that the proposal will have limited impacts for the municipalities.</p>
<h2>New way of confirming paternity and parenthood</h2>
<p>The proposal will have positive impacts for the majority of all children born in Sweden to an unmarried mother. This means that the proposal affects more than 45 000 children and their parents every year. It will be possible to acknowledge paternity and parenthood electronically in these cases instead of at a visit to the social welfare committee. The proposal also means greater accessibility and lower costs for parents. For children it can have practical impacts. If acknowledgements are made electronically, paternity or parenthood of more children than at present will be registered in the population register shortly after their birth. This is a clearly shorter time than at present for acknowledgements of parenthood, for example.</p>
<p>The simplifications proposed mean that the aggregate costs of social welfare committees for handling these cases are estimated to decrease by, at any rate, SEK 90 million. This estimate can be affected by several factors, for instance pay costs and how individual social welfare committees process investigations of paternity. Depending on how the estimate is made, the saving can be put at as much as SEK 190 million.</p>
<p>The Swedish Tax Agency should be responsible for producing a function for electronic acknowledgement. Ahead of the entry into force of the legislative amendments the Swedish Tax Agency should be commissioned to produce a secure e-service for electronic acknowledgement. The cost of developing a technical solution to handle electronic acknowledgements is estimated at SEK 20 million. The estimated annual administrative cost is around SEK 6 million. These funds can be taken from expenditure area 25 (General grants to local government), an appropriation that is financed by the resulting reduction in costs for the municipalities when the work currently done by the social welfare committees in corresponding cases comes to an end.</p>
<h2>New regulations for forensic genetic examinations</h2>
<p>A forensic genetic examination is carried out for around 2 per cent of all new-born children. This means that around 2 300 children and their parents are affected by this proposal each year. The proposal can have positive impacts for children</p>
<p>The proposal that the National Board of Forensic Medicine should be the actor to perform forensic genetic examinations on behalf of the public authorities and that this service should be financed by an appropriation means that the examinations initiated by social welfare committees will not be a charge on municipal budgets. This proposal is expected to reduce municipal costs nationally by around SEK 10 million. At the same time, the Inquiry proposes financing the forensic genetic service at the National Board of Forensic Medicine from appropriations and taking the funds from expenditure area 25 (General grants to local government). The assessment made is therefore that, in aggregate, this proposal for financed from an appropriation will not have any financial impact for the public authorities.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>The new regulations are proposed to enter into force on 1 January 2021.</p>
