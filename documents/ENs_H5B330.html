<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Regulating the gambling sector is extraordinarily complex. The sector covers and is influenced by a variety of market phenomena and operators engaged in varied activities with different motivations – but all with great commitment. These are the players, the non-profit organisations, state-owned/controlled companies and online gambling companies without a licence in Sweden.</p>
<p>The area encompasses issues such as consumer protection, matchfixing, problem gambling and gambling addiction. The gambling market turns over very large sums and offers the chance of good profits and, above all for the players, also entails the risk of considerable losses. The issues include the interests of non-profit organisations and central government, which in many respects differ from those of the other stakeholders. This involves the activities of many government agencies; in addition to the Spelmyndigheten  (the Swedish Gambling Authority) proposed by the Inquiry, these include the Public Health Agency of Sweden, the Swedish Consumer Agency, the Swedish Tax Agency, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, the Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Prosecution Authority.</p>
<p>The assignment to re-regulate a market of such a diverse character is not like the normal re-regulation of a national market. This has made the work of the Inquiry complicated, which is not least borne out by the scope of the report. At the same time, the Inquiry has had a very short time – just over a year – in which to produce a comprehensive, coherent and consistent proposal for re-regulation that will hopefully address the problems and provide a reasonable balance between all the interests encompassed by the area of gambling.</p>
<p>It is therefore reasonable to assume that some things will need to be amended, adjusted or supplemented – also after the Act has entered into force. This is suggested by experience from other reregulations.</p>
<p>After such a comprehensive reform as this, the Inquiry believes that it is important to follow up the effects in the area of gambling in various respects. The Government should therefore formulate an evaluation assignment to be given to an independent reviewer to continuously monitor developments and evaluate effectiveness and other strategic aspects. Essential issues to follow up include market development, channelling, consumer protection – with a focus on public health – and tax revenues.</p>
<h2>The assignment and the problems with current regulation The assignment</h2>
<p>The inquiry chair's assignment is to submit proposals for a new regulation of gambling based on a licensing system in which all operators on the Swedish gambling market are to have the appropriate permit – a licence. Those without such a licence are to be excluded.</p>
<p>This new gambling regulation is to promote gambling that is healthy and safe, that has a high level of consumer protection and that has a transparent regulatory framework. Furthermore, the regulation shall help to limit the negative consequences of gambling.</p>
<p>The assignment also includes the new regulation as far as possible securing the conditions for financing central government activities and public interests. Consideration is to be given to market and technological developments and to EU law.</p>
<p>The role of central government in a re-regulated gambling market shall be analysed and where applicable be included in the regulatory framework.</p>
<h2>The problems</h2>
<p>The report presents the circumstances necessitating a re-regulation, as well as the analyses and considerations that have led to the legislation proposed.</p>
<p>The current regulation is essentially protective or prohibitory legislation proceeding from a purely physical handling of gambling activities, such as lotteries. It is also legislation that aims to secure the surplus proceeds of gambling for central government, associations and the equestrian sector.</p>
<p>Today's situation is characterised by the fact that online and crossborder gambling companies, unregulated in Sweden and whose current market share stands at approximately 23 per cent, are taking an increasing portion of the Swedish market at the expense of regulated companies.</p>
<p>The central government control that is an essential part of today's gambling regulation is non-existent as regards this part of the gambling market. The online companies operate tax-free in Sweden, and consumer protection is limited. This impedes the opportunities for dealing with problem gambling and gambling addiction.</p>
<p>Permits are currently held by AB Svenska Spel  (Svenska Spel), AB Trav och Galopp  (ATG) and the non-profit associations. These therefore constitute the regulated part of today's gambling market.</p>
<p>The current legislation is therefore partial and obsolete and corresponds neither to the present or future gambling market. Sweden is not unique. Corresponding conditions are found in several other countries. These countries have chosen strategies that have both differences and similarities in order to address problems and challenges. The similarities include various forms of licensing procedure. Some of these are described in the report.</p>
<h2>The market</h2>
<p>Gambling for money is a decidedly consumer and mass market. This market accommodates operators with diverse origins, motivations and business logics; for-profit companies, state-owned/controlled companies and non-profit organisations. The market and its profitability entail extraordinarily powerful incentives for the online operators, without a licence in Sweden, which are rapidly expanding and showing good profitability. Even compared with several other dynamic markets, this part of the market is displaying rapid change that is primarily customer-driven and contingent on technology.</p>
<p>In 2016, gambling consumption in Sweden amounted to SEK 2,802 per year and person over 18 (refers both to the market regulated in Sweden and the market not regulated in Sweden). In total, 68 per cent gamble every year. This is SEK 4,121 per player and year (2016). Until now, the gambling volume trend has been a lower number of players but a slowly increasing gambling volume. There is thus an increase in gambling per person. Online gambling is increasing and landbased gambling is decreasing. After paid winnings, the industry’s turnover was approximately SEK 21 billion in 2016 (SEK 17 billion excluding the unregulated market in Sweden).</p>
<h2>Current trend</h2>
<p>In 2016, the total gambling volume has increased by 5 per cent. Gambling in the regulated market has increased by 2 per cent, and gambling with the online gambling companies unregulated in Sweden has increased by 16 per cent net. There is no information on player numbers, but there is reason to assume that the number of players has stopped decreasing or has even increased somewhat in 2016.</p>
<h2>The basis and purpose of a new regulation of gambling</h2>
<p>Primarily equipped with the new Gambling Act, a partly outdated national monopoly will turn into a partly oligopolistic section and a partly free market section by dividing Svenska Spel into a competitive section and a section having exclusive rights. Common and sustainable gambling rules will be created, a licensing system will be established that the online companies will hopefully join, tax revenues will be secured, and the associations’ rather fragile gambling domains – essentially lotteries – and revenues will be protected. Furthermore, marketing in the area will be regulated, problem gambling curbed, moderate gambling promoted and cheating at gambling counteracted. Gambling is to have a high level of consumer protection and good security. The Act is also intended to open up for competition and competitive neutrality and establish a system of sanctions both for controlling the activities of licensees and for prosecuting those outside the licensing system, but which are targeting the Swedish market.</p>
<p>It is also intended to create the right mix and balance between framework legislation and detailed regulation. One of the challenges is achieving this with operations that are increasingly online. A part of the global and cross-border internet is to be fenced with a national regulatory framework. Furthermore, there is to be regulation of who will receive a licence and specific requirements on licensees and their behaviour towards the market, government agencies and players.</p>
<p>The Act and its application are thus to balance and legalise gambling competition, impose tax of 18 per cent on the online companies currently unregulated in Sweden and at the same time be technology and competition neutral.</p>
<p>The online gambling companies unregulated in Sweden have operated on the Swedish market for about twenty years. It is on this part of the market that the competitive gambling is found. The Inquiry’s objective with the proposed regulation is for as good as all gambling offered on the market to be offered by companies that have a licence in Sweden. The Inquiry’s objective is a “channelling” of 90 per cent.</p>
<p>The Gambling Act will enable the Government and Spelmyndigheten  to determine the conditions for entering the competitive market through their power over the infrastructure constituted by regulation.</p>
<p>In addition to being comprehensive, the Act is to be operationally logical and consistent. Several of the parts are to work together as they presuppose each other in a partially intricate synergistic relationship. The Act and its effects may also not increase administration for companies to an extent that it creates or contributes to such an extensive cost base that the licensing alternative becomes uninteresting, at least to the major online gambling companies.</p>
<p>It is not possible to regulate everything in detail. The Act has therefore been designed as framework legislation – with clear and fixed frames. The Act opens up for the Government to issue ordinances and for Spelmyndigheten  to issue regulations. Framework legislation increases the opportunities of society to take control and means that swift measures can be taken to respond to external changes. It is an adaptive regulatory framework which, in the Inquiry's view, will be robust, appropriate and sustainable over time.</p>
<p>If required, the sanction component proposes heavy penalties for providing gambling that targets the Swedish market without being licensed. A ban on payment transfer is introduced against those outside the system but which are still targeting Swedish customers. It is proposed that such payment transfer be criminalised. However, IP blocking will not be included in the Act. That being said, the Inquiry does propose that internet service providers, at the request of Spelmyndigheten , be required to display a warning message when a visitor attempts to play on illegal sites.</p>
<p>The proposed re-regulation mobilises a large part of central government's combined arsenal of legal, economic and administrative measures in order to take control of the gambling market and of conditions in which the old Act has become increasingly unmodern.</p>
<h2>Division of the market</h2>
<p>According to the report, the division of the market will be as follows:</p>
<p>Online gambling companies, Svenska Spel’s competitive section and ATG</p>
<p>A licence will allow online gambling companies, Svenska Spel’s competitive section and ATG to operate on the competitive section of the market. The types of gambling that may be offered are online casino, online betting, online poker and online bingo. Landbased sports betting and landbased horse-race betting will also be included in the competitive section.</p>
<p>It is proposed that ATG no longer have a monopoly on horserace betting. This will open up for competition from other operators that offer horse-race betting. Like other gambling companies, ATG will have access to the competitive gambling sector on the same conditions and become a licensee like others.</p>
<p>Svenska Spel’s exclusive rights will cover token gaming machines and landbased casinos in designated premises – Casino Cosmopol AB  (Casino Cosmopol). The company will also have to continue to compete with the public interest associations with respect to online and landbased lotteries.</p>
<p>The public interest associations</p>
<p>No major changes are proposed here. The non-profit sector will continue to conduct lottery activities, both landbased and online, and landbased bingo.</p>
<p>The following image from Chapter 27 of the report illustrates the division of the market.</p>
<h2>Why this division and what does it mean for each sector? Online gambling companies</h2>
<p>A large part of the games proposed to be placed under competition are games already offered by the online gambling companies unregulated in Sweden operating on the Swedish market. In other words, this part of the market is already competitive today and will through the new Act be regulated in an effective and secure manner.</p>
<p>The fifteen online gambling companies publicly listed in Sweden represent a market value of SEK 69 billion (SEK 11 billion in 2011).</p>
<p>This reflects the large profits made by these companies and the market’s even greater expectations. Few online companies have as great profit margins as the online gambling companies.</p>
<p>In 2016, the net turnover of the online gambling companies unregulated in Sweden was SEK 5.1 billion.</p>
<p>The motive of central government to re-regulate the gambling market is to gain control over this part of the market through regulating and licensing. This involves issues regarding taxes, gambling responsibility and consumer protection.</p>
<p>For the online gambling companies, this means greater legitimacy, common gambling rules, more equal conditions of competition, predictability and becoming an accepted and visible industry. This is considered positive for shareholders and the stock exchange, which increases the likelihood of the publicly listed online gambling companies joining. What is negative, from a business perspective, is the additional administration imposed on the companies, not least deriving from the aspect of gambling responsibility, the ambition to curb problem gambling, and from relatively extensive information requirements.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the regulation is that it will limit today's extensive and largely illegal marketing, in part by enhancing the ban on promotion. Marketing by the online gambling companies unregulated in Sweden is assessed to amount to SEK 2.3 billion. The marketing of other companies amounts to approximately SEK 1 billion.</p>
<h2>Svenska Spel – competitive section and exclusive rights, etc.</h2>
<p>Svenska Spel’s net turnover in 2016 was approximately SEK 9 billion. In 2015, SEK 4.8 billion went to the public treasury. In 2016, SEK 1.9 billion came from online gambling. Svenska Spel’s online section is increasing in 2016 by 14 per cent. Landbased gambling in the same period decreased by 3 per cent. Overall, this yields a net turnover that is unchanged.</p>
<p>According to the Inquiry's proposal, the future competitive section (Svenska Spel K) with licences will cover online and landbased sports betting, online casino, online poker and online bingo. Several of these gambling forms already exist today on the competitive section of the market. The future Svenska Spel K includes sports gambling, which today constitutes 20 per cent of net turnover, SEK 1.8 billion, and online casino, which Svenska Spel does not currently offer but will do so in a licensing system.</p>
<p>It is thus one fifth of Svenska Spel’s current turnover that is proposed to be placed in Svenska Spel K. In addition to this is Svenska Spel's planned online casino.</p>
<p>The Inquiry's proposal means that Svenska Spel’s section with exclusive rights, etc. (Svenska Spel E) includes gambling on token gaming machines and licences for landbased casino games in designated premises (Casino Cosmopol) as well as lotteries, both landbased and online. This corresponds to approximately 79 per cent of Svenska Spel’s net turnover.</p>
<p>The Inquiry calculates that the two sections of Svenska Spel might together reach a net turnover of SEK 10 billion three years after the Act’s entry into force. With the same delivery share to central government as before, i.e. approximately 55 per cent, SEK 5.5 billion of this may go to central government.</p>
<h2>Particular information on Svenska Spel’s exclusive rights, etc.</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposed Svenska Spel E, which corresponds to approximately 79 per cent of the company's current turnover, will have a shared exclusive right on lotteries together with the public interest associations and on essentially the same licence conditions. However, it is proposed that Svenska Spel will pay tax, which the public interest associations will not need to do according to the proposal.</p>
<p>Lotteries are deemed to be of great value to the public interest and there is no direct competition from online gambling companies or the equivalent, which means that there is also no need for channelling.</p>
<p>For token gaming machines, a continued exclusive right for Svenska Spel is proposed. The primary motive of the Inquiry is promoting responsible gambling and inhibiting gambling on illegal gaming machines. The channelling that can take place here and that is deemed desirable is that which goes from illegal gaming machines to token gaming machines. There is otherwise no need for channelling.</p>
<p>The marketing of gambling on token gaming machines for consumers will not be permitted. The Government can take other factors into consideration than a purely commercial gambling company can, which is of significance in this case.</p>
<p>The issue of token gaming machines is complex, and the Inquiry’s assessment is that if more significant amendments are to be made, this should be investigated separately. The time for this Inquiry has not allowed this.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that it shall only be permitted to grant a licence for landbased casino games in designated premises (Casino Cosmopol) to a state-owned company. The motive is to ensure that this will maintain responsible gambling, counteract crime, decrease gambling-related crime and limit social harm.</p>
<h2>Horse-race betting and ATG</h2>
<p>The Inquiry's proposal will include horse-race betting in the licensing system and in the competitive section. This means that ATG will become an operator like other gambling companies. These gambling companies may enter into agreements with the harness and horse racing organisations that own the courses and other infrastructure. The agreements are negotiated between the parties and are not a question for the Inquiry. As a consequence of the Inquiry's proposal, it is proposed that the Government withdraw from its involvement in ATG and equestrian sport in the form it has hitherto had.</p>
<p>The tax rate on net gambling revenue for horse-race betting is proposed to decrease from 35 to 18 per cent. With the current net turnover of approximately SEK 3.5 billion, this corresponds to a decrease of just under SEK 600 million. A total of SEK 1.6 billion of the current surplus proceeds goes to equestrian sport, primarily for its facilities.</p>
<p>With more gambling companies in competition, agreements between the sport and new gambling companies can be financed with an amount corresponding to ATG's possible decrease. This means that the net or revenues for the sport are assessed to be about the same as before re-regulation but with contributions from more operators.</p>
<p>It is assessed that ATG will have a decrease in its cost base of SEK 100–150 million, given that no other gambling company enters the market. If this is the case, ATG's market dominance will decrease correspondingly.</p>
<p>Factors that speak in ATG's favour and that have a constraining influence on competitors are both that the ATG brand is strongly associated with the sport and safe gambling and that its established products are in themselves very strong brands, as well as the gambling pool itself.</p>
<p>At the same time, ATG anticipates entering the other parts of the gambling market’s competitive section, and this might offset some of the market loss in the equestrian area.</p>
<p>Re-regulation creates a new competitive situation for horse-race betting. ATG will lose a limited part of its market and can compensate for this by offering other games available on the competitive market, primarily online games. Horse-race betting is expected to have a minor net gain in the next few years, with online gambling increasing slightly more than the decrease in landbased gambling. Central government tax revenues will decrease by approximately SEK 100–150 million.</p>
<h2>The public interest associations</h2>
<p>The Inquiry's terms of reference state that it is of great importance that the non-profit, public interest organisations can continue to develop. Furthermore, the conditions for financing public interests shall continue to be good.</p>
<p>Several of the public interest associations, often connected to a popular movement, obtain a not insignificant part of their financing through games and lotteries. Approximately SEK 2 billion per year goes back to charity and non-commercial purposes.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes no major changes to the public interest associations. These associations will continue to be able to conduct lottery activities, both landbased and online, as well as landbased bingo on a partially protected market. These are proposed to remain exempt from tax. To the extent that the associations wish to operate gambling belonging to the competitive section of the market, the same conditions will apply to them as for other the gambling companies on that section of the market. Thus entry to the competitive section of the market with tax exemption will not be possible.</p>
<p>Within the non-profit sector, this does not involve major revenues per organisation in relation to the other operators on the gambling market. This is true with the exception of the Swedish Postcode Association. The payout percentage for lotteries is low.</p>
<p>However, these are strategic revenues for civil society, so without these revenues civil society would probably be smaller and partially lose its independence. Representatives of civil society argue that this is money with a high societal and social yield.</p>
<p>The net turnover of the public interest associations’ games and lotteries was SEK 3.9 billion in 2016, which is 17 per cent of the market. The Swedish Postcode Association accounted for SEK 2 billion or 53 per cent. The volume has increased in recent years, by 12 per cent in the period 2011–2016.</p>
<p>That this is a delimited sector with tax exemption and some oligopoly on lottery tickets and bingo does not mean that the sector would not be able to be exposed to external competition as regards the players. It is conceivable that other gambling companies will attract customers from these public interest lotteries and bingo. However, representatives of the sector believe that this risk is limited.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Inquiry’s assessment is that the public interest associations will hold their ground in the gambling market with a probable, but limited gain in the next few years.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Inquiry would like to flag up a measure of uncertainty regarding tax exemption as this might come into conflict with EU state aid regulations.</p>
<p>The EU essentially specifies four conditions for being able to deviate from the state aid regulations in cases like these. Firstly, a derogation is to be applied in a non-discriminatory manner. It shall also be in response to a pressing public interest, really function on the basis of its purpose and finally entail intervention no greater than that to which the public interest corresponds. The Inquiry leans towards tax exemption for the public interest associations in this case corresponding to the stated conditions, but recommends that the Government as soon as possible after the Inquiry’s presentation makes a “pre-notification” to the European Commission in order receive a statement on the issue.</p>
<h2>Landbased commercial gambling, etc.</h2>
<p>The Inquiry believes that the current flat-rate model for the taxation of “restaurant casinos” and casino games on vessels in international traffic should be retained.</p>
<p>Here, the tax conditions are different to those proposed by the Inquiry for other sections of the gambling market. It is proposed that the tax be levied per gaming table at an amount of SEK 5,000. Like the winnings, the stakes are relatively low. If a tax rate of 18 per cent were to be applied, SEK 34 million more would be paid. Besides this, corporate tax of 22 per cent is paid. The Inquiry assesses this to be an effective order that fulfils its purpose. Nevertheless, this also has a state aid problem, and the Inquiry proposes that a pre-notification procedure with the European Commission also be initiated as soon as possible in order to find out if this is possible.</p>
<h2>The division of Svenska Spel</h2>
<p>As previously stated, the Inquiry proposes a division of Svenska Spel into a competitive section and a section with exclusive rights, etc.</p>
<p>Svenska Spel has a dominant role on the market, and a division of the company is deemed to be delicate for several reasons.</p>
<p>The general opportunities for Svenska Spel to compete with an unregulated payout percentage are considered good. This is because Svenska Spel is a large company with financial muscle and is now – like ATG – a strong and established brand, as are its products. A total of 48 per cent of those who gamble online have Svenska Spel as their first choice, despite the fact that Svenska Spel only has 22 per cent of the entire online gambling market.</p>
<p>Svenska Spel can derive advantage from being a well-known state operator with exciting games, which in addition to betting on sports, will now also be able to offer online casino and other games in competition with other companies.</p>
<p>The Inquiry presents and discusses different options for handling the division of Svenska Spel in conjunction with a re-regulation so that it takes place as smoothly as possible and also contributes to market balance and competitive neutrality. A state-owned gambling company operating in direct competition with others is, after all, essentially like any other gambling company. The Inquiry’s conclusion is that the best option would be to sell the competitive section. The Inquiry notes, however, that the choice here involves the taking of a purely political position and will have major consequences for both Svenska Spel and public finances. For this reason, the Inquiry submits no more concrete proposals concerning this.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry's assessment, as soon as the Gambling Act has entered into force, it is fundamental that the two sections be kept just as separate as if they were two different companies so as to avoid cross-subsidisation and the disruption of competitive neutrality. Possibly, there could be some measure of joint administration and certain common functions.</p>
<p>Some of the critical factors for the owner to particularly observe in the event of a sale are, for example, whether Svenska Spel's market share is to be limited initially, how the new ownership directives are to be designed, valuation of the company upon a sale, the social responsibility that should be taken for Svenska Spel's activities on Gotland and how the market entry of small companies can be promoted.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not a sale occurs, it is the Inquiry's assessment that, provided sufficient measures are taken with regard to the separation of Svenska Spel's two sections, there are good conditions for a market situation to arise that has an acceptable and functioning operator composition from the aspect of competition.</p>
<h2>The design of the licensing system</h2>
<p>The Inquiry's proposal means that those wishing to provide or arrange gambling in Sweden are to have a licence. However, for “registration lotteries”, registration with the municipality is sufficient.</p>
<p>The principle means that customers, when cooperating with a licensed operator, are to be sure that they are dealing with a person or a company that meets a number of basic requirements that aim to protect customers and give them a fair and honest experience.</p>
<p>Those possessing or manufacturing certain gambling equipment are also to have a licence, as are those manufacturing, providing, installing or modifying software for games in connection with online gambling.</p>
<p>Which persons should then be the subject of approval? The Inquiry proposes that these should be the company's board, management and shareholders “with a qualifying holding”, i.e. ownership corresponding to at least ten per cent.</p>
<p>The requirements that the Inquiry proposes be placed on applicants are</p>
<p>• that they have the insight, experience and organisation needed to operate the planned activities,</p>
<p>• that there is reason to assume that the planned activities will be operated in accordance with the law and other statutes regulating the activities, and</p>
<p>• that applicants are also otherwise deemed suitable for operating the planned activities. This assessment is to take into account the reputation and capital strength of applicants.</p>
<p>If a person in the company’s management or board no longer meets the legal conditions, the Inquiry proposes that the person should immediately leave the management or the board.</p>
<p>There is an exception from the licensing obligation for games of skill, such as billiards, competitive bridge and chess or when stakes and winnings are insignificant or where the games take place in private forms with low stakes and are not of an organised or professional nature.</p>
<h2>Spelmyndigheten</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the name of Lotteriinspektionen be changed to Spelmyndigheten.</p>
<p>All licensing will be assumed by Spelmyndigheten, which is proposed to be given a significantly expanded right to issue regulations, this being largely a result of the new Act’s character in terms of framework legislation.</p>
<p>The Authority is to be responsible for the uniform application of the Gambling Act and the Act (1982:636) concerning the Arrangement of Certain Forms of Gaming Machines, and for the appropriate supervision and control of compliance with the legislation, and is to promote sound and secure development in the area of supervision.</p>
<p>Spelmyndigheten is thus to be responsible for the issuing of licences, permits and regulations pertaining to the Gambling Act and the Act concerning the Arrangement of Certain Forms of Gaming Machines.</p>
<p>Spelmyndigheten is to establish a council for gambling market issues, consisting of representatives of Spelmyndigheten, the Public Health Agency of Sweden, the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, the Swedish Consumer Agency, the Swedish Police Authority and the Swedish Prosecution Authority.</p>
<p>Spelmyndigheten is to be the provider and administrator of a voluntary self-exclusion system that is binding on gambling companies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Authority is to be responsible for a national platform against the manipulation of sporting events with regard to betting. The platform is to include representatives of the government agencies and organisations determined by the Government.</p>
<p>The Authority assumes the licensing for which the Government is currently responsible with regard to Svenska Spel and ATG. The Inquiry's proposal significantly increases the number of licensees, which in turn increases the extent of supervisory activities. Compared with the current Lotteriinspektion, it is assessed that the staff needs to be expanded by 50 per cent, i.e. about 25 persons.</p>
<h2>Gambling forms and risk, gambling responsibility measures and a self-exclusion register Risk evaluation</h2>
<p>The Inquiry highlights the connections between gambling forms and the risk of developing gambling dependency.</p>
<p>Several studies agree in stating that casino games, gaming machines for gambling for money (token gaming machines) and certain interactive games online are the most risky forms of gambling. These are also the most popular forms of gambling and those which show the greatest increase. They are characterised by the short time for each individual game. The shorter the time between stake, outcome and the opportunity to gamble again in the same game, the higher the risk potential.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Sweden's survey, Swelogs (The Swedish Longitudinal Gambling Study), shows that of those who gamble on games with a high risk potential (e.g. online gambling and gaming machines), seven per cent risk developing gambling dependency. The corresponding figure for games with a medium risk potential (e.g. sports betting and gambling on horses) is three per cent, and for games with a low risk (lottery tickets bought at an agent), just one per cent.</p>
<p>This type of social study is a way of attempting to assess risk and dangerousness. However, the studies are relatively blunt instruments as they are based on categories of games.</p>
<p>Instruments have been produced to classify the degree of dangerousness of a specific game, GAM-GaRD being an example. The weakness of these instruments is that they accommodate quite a lot of subjective elements that limit their validity.</p>
<p>A third way to assess the dangerousness of games is to use statistics on those who seek help for gambling problems. However, representativeness is problematic here.</p>
<p>The Inquiry notes that it is difficult to specify the dangerousness of games. Besides this, the “dangerous” games are already on the market and are the most attractive. The approaches described each have their deficiencies and should probably be used with caution. They could possibly complement each other to give a picture of risk conditions in the area.</p>
<p>The question is complicated by the fact that social and demographic factors also show links with problem gambling. Socioeconomically vulnerable groups and the foreign-born run a greater risk of developing gambling dependency. Men and young people are other groups that more easily develop gambling problems compared with women and elderly people.</p>
<p>The Inquiry notes that it cannot be guaranteed that a new licensing system will not lead to an increase in gambling. Nor is it possible to establish that a licensing system would lead to an increase in problem gambling.</p>
<h2>Gambling responsibility measures</h2>
<p>Enhanced gambling responsibility is a cornerstone of the new regulation of gambling. To a large extent, this aims at the gambling companies whose undertaking will be significantly expanded by the Inquiry's proposal.</p>
<p>Under the Inquiry's proposal, gambling companies must take the measures necessary to prevent and reduce problem gambling where this is possible. Players are to receive correct information about how the game functions, about the risks of playing and how they can gamble responsibly.</p>
<p>One starting point according to the Inquiry is that the gambling company analyses information from each player, since divergent patterns in their gambling behaviour can lead to the early detection of problem gambling.</p>
<p>In addition to retaining the gambling age limit of 18 and the ban on granting credit for gambling, the Inquiry submits a number of proposals for enhancing gambling responsibility</p>
<p>• gambling companies must register and analyse each player's gambling behaviour,</p>
<p>• gambling companies are to be required to offer players the opportunity to set limits for their gambling in terms of game time and amount,</p>
<p>• gambling companies may not offer games to a player who does not have a satisfactory player profile with the game provider,</p>
<p>• gambling companies that assess a player's gambling to be risky, e.g. by the player having exceeded their own set limits, are to actively alert the player to this and give them opportunity to choose whether they want to continue playing,</p>
<p>• gambling companies are to have information regarding what help is available and how to contact this help,</p>
<p>• gambling companies are to ensure that game participants can exclude themselves from gambling until further notice or for a certain period. It shall only be possible to lift exclusion until further notice after 12 months,</p>
<p>• online gambling companies (i.e. those offering quick games such as online casino games, online bingo and games on computersimulated machines) are to provide an opportunity for immediate exclusion – a panic button – easily visible on their websites. This exclusion is to be valid for 24 hours.</p>
<h2>Self-exclusion register</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that Spelmyndigheten  create and maintain a register of players who temporarily or permanently want to exclude themselves from gambling with all gambling companies. Players can choose to be entered in the register on the Spelmyndigheten  website. Players are to give their explicit consent to being registered. The opportunity for exclusion applies to all games requiring players to be registered. The data in the register shall be subject to secrecy. All gambling companies receive continuous updates on the people in the register, which means that those registered can neither log in nor create a new registration for gambling. This also makes it possible to prevent advertisements being sent to the deregistered players.</p>
<h2>Marketing</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Gambling Act contain basic provisions on marketing. Moderation is to be observed in the marketing of gambling to consumers. The assessment of whether marketing is moderate is to particularly observe that the marketing 1. in a correct and balanced manner presents the chances of winning so as not to create the impression that the chances of winning are greater than they actually are, 2. does not convey the image that gambling is socially attractive, 3. does not specifically target children or young people under the age of 18, 4. does not take place by using  well-known people whereby it is suggested that their participation in gambling contributes to their social success, 5. does not convey the impression that participation in gambling is a solution to financial problems or can improve the player's social standing, and 6. does not convey the image that an offer of gambling is free of charge, free or the like, if this is not the case.</p>
<p>Marketing that contravenes the requirement of moderation is, in the application of Sections 5, 23 and 26 of the Marketing Act, to be considered unfair to consumers.</p>
<p>A ban on gambling advertising from companies that do not have a licence under the Gambling Act when this is required will be introduced in the Radio and Television Act (2010:696) with regard to television broadcasts, searchable teletext, on-demand television and radio broadcasts. Furthermore, a provision will be introduced in the Radio and Television Act entailing that a company, whose principal activity is to arrange and provide gambling and which does not have a licence under the Gambling Act when this is required, may not sponsor a programme in a television broadcast, searchable teletext, on-demand television or radio broadcast.</p>
<p>The provision in the Radio and Television Act on the ban against product placement is to be expanded to also apply to gambling products from a company that does not have a licence under the Gambling Act when this is required.</p>
<p>Marketing may not directly target gambling customers who have excluded themselves at their own request or have been excluded by the gambling company. Marketing may only directly target gambling customers who have terminated their gambling account if the gambling customer has actively approved this in connection with termination.</p>
<p>A gambling company that offers players a bonus for participating in gambling are at the same time to clearly and explicitly inform players of whether conditions and rules apply to the bonus. Where players avail themselves of the offer, all conditions and rules are to be easily accessible. The payment of a bonus is to be made as soon as possible after the condition has been met.</p>
<p>A bonus to an individual player may not be dependent on conditions other than those which are offered under the same circumstances to other players playing the same game.</p>
<p>A player is to have at least 60 days in which to meet any conditions that have been attached to the payment of a bonus.</p>
<h2>Payout, tax and licence fees</h2>
<p>The new regulation is intended to secure the financing of central government activities and public interests to as great an extent as possible. The demand for online gambling is to be channelled to safe and controlled offerings in a way that does not lead to an increase in gambling.</p>
<p>The Inquiry establishes that provisions on stakes, winnings and payout percentage for different games are central elements of gambling policy. For this reason, the Government should have a general right to issue regulations regarding these issues.</p>
<h2>Payout</h2>
<p>No ceiling on competitive gambling is currently proposed. With the market entry of the online gambling companies, the payout percentage – or the price of gambling – has become a competitive factor. The online gambling companies unregulated in Sweden today pay out significantly higher winnings than their Swedish counterparts. These more favourable conditions for players risk reducing the market shares of Swedish operators. The online gambling companies unregulated in Sweden have a payout of between 91 and 99 per cent.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry's assessment, a payout ceiling would risk a decrease in channelling.</p>
<p>For the games that the associations and Svenska Spel will be allowed to offer, and which may not be offered by other gambling companies on the market, a payout percentage is proposed that will be essentially the same for Svenska Spel and for the non-profit sector, amounting to a maximum of 50 per cent. This is in line with what the non-profit sector has proposed.</p>
<p>An amendment regarding payout percentage is also not proposed for gambling on token gaming machines and landbased casinos in designated premises, for which central government will retain an exclusive right. This is primarily because there is no need to channel such gambling.</p>
<p>In the debate, it has been argued that a lower price entails a greater risk of an increase in problem gambling. Against this, it could be argued that a lower price means that players win back more, with the net result being a reduction in their total gambling expenditure.</p>
<p>Studies of the factors that play a role in problem gambling have shown the payout percentage to be unimportant in relation to other factors. This has not even been on the list of the ten most important factors.</p>
<p>If there is no intervention, competition will push down prices until revenues just manage to cover costs so as to maintain the required rate of return. Besides the gambling companies’ required rates of return, the size of the price reduction is controlled by the prevailing tax rate on gambling.</p>
<h2>Tax rate and channelling</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a tax rate of 18 per cent on gambling in the competitive sector. The tax rate is to be calculated on net gambling revenue, i.e. the company's profit after paid winnings.</p>
<p>An important question is of course whether the desired channelling is achieved. In this regard, the tax rate plays an important role. Through a tax rate of 18 per cent and a regulation that does not entail an excessive administrative burden, the Inquiry anticipates a channelling degree on the competitive market of 90 per cent.</p>
<p>Attempts to forecast channelling have in most cases focused on the tax rate. As previously stated, there are also other significant factors, both negative and positive, that will be part of the basis for deciding whether or not a licence is to be sought. Compliance with the new regulatory framework entails a significant cost, as does the imposed limitation of market freedom. Information delivery, permits and “restrained” profit maximisation to curb problem gambling are to be added to the total cost base. There is probably also a psychological threshold effect. The tendency for a company to join the system rises rapidly when it perceives that “enough others” are choosing to join.</p>
<p>On the positive side of licensing and legislation, prominence is given to common gambling rules, predictability, greater legitimacy and credibility. The online gambling companies become a visible and accepted industry.</p>
<p>The Inquiry's assessment is that a tax of 18 per cent on the gambling companies’ profit from gambling is a well-balanced level that meets the requirements in the terms of reference pertaining to channelling, central government's continued financing opportunities and the need for strong consumer protection for Swedish players.</p>
<p>The Inquiry believes that the proposed consumer protection regulations are more ambitious than they are in, for example, Denmark, and in any case on a par with those in the United Kingdom. It is important that compliance with player protection is high among all gambling companies after a new gambling regulation has entered into force, and that the costs of implementing and investing in longterm consumer protection are not challenged due to the tax costs being considered too high. Against such a background, the Inquiry considers there to be reason for the tax burden on gambling companies not to exceed 18 per cent.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that players be liable for tax on winnings from gambling companies that allow participation in gambling in Sweden without a licence where this is required.</p>
<h2>Licence and supervision fees</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that in principle all gambling companies pay a licence and supervision fee. The licences will be valid for a certain period. When determining the amounts, the guideline has been that the cost for the work invested by Spelmyndigheten  in licensing and supervision is to be matched by licence and supervision revenues. The fees are based on the companies’ turnover and the number of games involved. The licence fees in the competitive area vary from SEK 60,000 to SEK 700,000 and the annual supervision fees in the same area are between SEK 30,000 and SEK 1 million.</p>
<h2>Sanctions</h2>
<p>An effective system of sanctions is a prerequisite for the proposed Act to function as intended.</p>
<p>This is also associated with the companies that choose to operate under licence not being exposed to illegal competition from unlicen- sed gambling companies.</p>
<p>The following is fundamental to the penal provisions: a party that intentionally or through gross negligence provides (in Sweden), arranges (in Sweden) or otherwise facilitates (in Sweden) participa- tion in gambling for persons resident or permanently staying here without a licence when this is required under the Gambling Act shall be sentenced for unlawful gambling activities  to a fine or imprison- ment of at most two years.</p>
<p>If the crime is gross, the penalty is imprisonment of at least six months and at most six years.</p>
<p>For the promotion of illegal gambling, i.e. a breach of the pro- motion ban, the Inquiry believes that the range of punishment should be significantly raised in relation to what is applicable today.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the range of punishment be the same as for the principal offence, i.e. from fines or imprisonment of at most two years or, if the crime is gross, imprisonment of at least six months and at most six years.</p>
<p>If a gambling company that has a Swedish gambling licence violates the Gambling Act, regulations or conditions issued by virtue of the Act, a sanction charge shall be imposed in the first instance. This can vary between SEK 5,000 and SEK 50 million. The sanction charge may not exceed ten per cent of the company’s turnover in Sweden.</p>
<p>It is furthermore proposed that internet service providers be re- quired to display a warning message when a visitor attempts to play on illegal sites. The message shall inform the visitor that the game provider does not have a licence in Sweden and is not under Swedish supervision.</p>
<p>The Inquiry does not propose the blocking of electronic com- munication to sites offering games that are not legal in Sweden.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the blocking of payment transactions between illegal gambling companies and players be considered. For reasons of competition, this should be introduced simultaneously by all con- cerned parties or payment transfer providers.</p>
<p>The provision of payment transfers will be criminalised with a range of punishment from fines or imprisonment of at most six months.</p>
<p>A new crime classification will be introduced, the offence of cheating at gambling (match-fixing and other types of manipula- tion of the outcome of a game). The offence shall be able to be imposed with a prison sentence of at most two years. If the offence has been committed intentionally and has been conducted systema- tically or on a major scale or has otherwise been of a particularly dangerous nature, it is classed as gross, resulting in imprisonment of at least six months and at most six years.</p>
