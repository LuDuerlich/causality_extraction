<p>My commission and the implementation of it</p>
<p>The Government has commissioned me to evaluate the system for personal protection for the central government in Sweden. Under the terms of my assignment I have been instructed to conduct a survey and analysis of the regulations and procedures for the personal protection of the central government, an examination of how the system of personal protection was applied in connection with the murder of Minister for Foreign Affairs Anna Lindh and a study of how the personal protection of the central government is organised in other countries that are comparable with Sweden, especially the Nordic countries and some EU countries. It has also been part of my task to consider whether any changes are needed in the system of personal protection and, if I find they are, to propose such changes.</p>
<p>In order to gather information I have met almost 100 people in the course of my work. I have visited counterparts of our secret service in Berlin, Copenhagen, the Hague, Helsinki, London and Oslo.</p>
<p>In addition, I have examined a large number of files and other documents held by the Swedish Security Service. I have also studied some other documentation such as judgments, reports of government commissions and inquiries, behavioural science reports and a study by the U.S. Secret Service.</p>
<p>Partly in view of the public debate on personal protection following the murder of Anna Lindh, I have sought to give an open account of the current system for personal protection and of my deliberations. However, special secrecy regulations circumscribe the activities of the Swedish Security Service in a number of areas, including personal protection. In this report I have tried to strike a reasonable balance between the demands of secrecy and the interest of openness.</p>
<p>Some starting points for my deliberations</p>
<p>The concept of personal protection covers both technical measures to improve security for a particular person and the use of personnel from the police to detect and prevent attacks on that person. Technical measures can include the installation of special locking devices, the provision of alarm telephones, etc. The use of personnel can take the form of bodyguard protection and protection in other forms, such as on-site surveillance and route surveillance as well as protective investigation.</p>
<p>Current rules class the Head of State, the Riksdag, including the Speaker and the Members of the Riksdag, the Cabinet and its members and State Secretaries as belonging to the central government.</p>
<p>The Swedish Security Service has the main responsibility for the personal protection of members of the central government and carries out bodyguard protection and technical protection. The police authorities around the country are responsible for on-site surveillance, route surveillance, etc.</p>
<p>In making my deliberations I have had the following starting points.</p>
<p>• I consider that it is not part of my task to carry out any general review of whether the concept of central government should be expanded to also include people other than those covered by current rules. However, I suggest that the leaders of the parties represented in the Riksdag are included in the concept of the central government even if they are not members of the Riksdag.</p>
<p>• One question that has been asked many times since the murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme is whether it should not be compulsory for certain members of the central government to have personal protection. I share the view taken by several previous inquiries that the individual for whom protective measures are being considered must personally have the final say as to whether and how much protection is to be provided.</p>
<p>• Another issue is what interests are to govern personal protection. I consider that the starting point should be that the special dangers associated with a position as member of the central government should be the motive for personal protection. The responsibility of the Swedish Security Service should extend no further than this. However, if a person is entitled to protection on</p>
<p>account of his or her position he or she must also be protected from other risks.</p>
<p>• In my view personal protection issues must be assessed not only on the basis of known threats but also in the light of the risk of unforeseeable events. An important factor in this context is that many members of the central government have considerable mass media exposure. This makes them well known and easy to recognise when they are in public.</p>
<p>• I consider that personal protection measures must continue to be based on an assessment of the risks of attack as regards both  long-term risks (tactical assessments) and risks relating to certain events, engagements and so on (operational assessments).</p>
<p>My assessment of current system</p>
<p>Threat assessments</p>
<p>The Swedish Security Service is capable of satisfactorily assessing known threats and risks.</p>
<p>One disadvantage of threat assessments as carried out today is that, by starting from known threats, you exclude or overlook that there may be unknown or latent threats and risks.</p>
<p>Previously another weakness of long-term threat assessments was that individual assessments were only drawn up for the King and the Prime Minister. Other people – ministers, the Riksdag Speaker, the leaders of Riksdag parties, etc. – were only covered by a general threat assessment drawn up for the Riksdag as a whole.</p>
<p>It is also a shortcoming of current tactical threat assessments that they are only updated every six months unless special circumstances motivate a review of the threat picture in the intervening period.</p>
<p>Basis for assessments by the Swedish Security Service</p>
<p>The information in the lists of ministerial engagements regularly sent by the Government Offices to the Swedish Security Service is an insufficient basis for assessments of personal protection measures. A particular problem is that information on alterations of engagements often reaches the Swedish Security Service at a late</p>
<p>stage and sometimes when the engagement in question has already taken place. It also appears that procedures in the Government Offices for sending engagement lists are not uniform.</p>
<p>Moreover, there seems to be a lack of uniform procedures for the handling by the Government Offices of threatening letters and other messages that can be of importance for threat assessments by the Swedish Security Service.</p>
<p>The Government Offices appear only very rarely to report incidents, etc. that occur during Ministers’ meetings outside the ministries.</p>
<p>Another shortcoming is that the Government Offices do not normally notify the Swedish Security Service of controversial issues currently handled in a ministry that can increase the risks for the responsible minister.</p>
<p>The Swedish Security Service seems only to receive a modest amount of information of importance for threat assessments from police authorities around the country.</p>
<p>In my view it is also a shortcoming that, on account of current secrecy regulations, the Swedish Security Service is not able, even on request, to obtain certain essential information from the health and medical services and the prison and probation authorities and that, in general, conditions for closer cooperation between the Swedish Security Service and the relevant authorities do not appear to exist.</p>
<p>The interaction between the Swedish Security Service and other police authorities</p>
<p>At present the Swedish Security Service is in charge of close protection measures – primarily bodyguard protection – and the relevant local police authority is in charge of distance protection – mainly on-site surveillance at events in which ministers and others take part. Several protected persons have made critical comments about distance protection, while there seems to be general satisfaction with the bodyguards and their performance.</p>
<p>I share the view taken by other inquiries that in the area of personal protection there is a grey zone concerning the division of responsibilities between the Swedish Security Service and other police authorities. According to my interpretation of the current system of regulations there is also a discrepancy between the</p>
<p>governmental regulations on the duties of the National Police Board and the Swedish Security Service, on the one hand, and the regulations in this area issued by the National Police Board, on the other.</p>
<p>Another shortcoming is that there is no report-back system from the local police authority to the Swedish Security Service on how distance protection has functioned in specific cases.</p>
<p>My assessment of the application of the personal protection system in connection with the murder of Minister for Foreign Affairs Anna Lindh</p>
<p>At the time of the murder of Anna Lindh, the procedures of the Swedish Security Service for drawing up tactical threat assessments were not good. These assessments were prepared far too rarely and, as in the case of ministers, they were too general. I have, however, no basis for stating that the threat assessment for Anna Lindh would have been different if a separate tactical threat picture had been drawn up close in time to the murder. On the contrary, I have found no information that might suggest the existence of any known threats to Anna Lindh in the period immediately before her murder.</p>
<p>My review of the lists of her engagements for the period when the murder took place well illustrate the shortcomings that I have drawn attention to in another context. However, even if the information from the Government Offices had been clearer and more detailed, I am convinced that, considering the circumstances, the Swedish Security Service would not have had reason to make a different assessment of Anna Lindh’s need of personal protection than it actually did.</p>
<p>The Swedish Security Service based its threat assessment on known threats, in line with the rules and general advice issued by the National Police Board. If the Swedish Security Service had also taken account of any potential or latent threats, then the threat picture for Anna Lindh would probably have been very different given the level of exposure she was being subjected to. In the light of the relevant regulations I do not, however, find reason to criticise the Swedish Security Service because it did not take these considerations into account in its assessment. However, a question</p>
<p>that deserves to be asked is whether the rules should already have been altered at the time.</p>
<p>Associates of Anna Lindh have made some criticisms of the personal protection or rather lack of protection provided for her by the Swedish Security Service. The Swedish Security Service has rejected their opinions. Without more detailed documentation, especially within the Swedish Security Service, I have not been able to afterwards investigate what actually took place at the events covered by the criticism. I can, however, conclude that these events seem to have been perceived in different ways. I can also conclude that, on several occasions, distance protection in the form of outer surveillance seems to have failed and that the Swedish Security Service has not been made aware of this through its contacts with the local police.</p>
<p>My proposals</p>
<p>Changes to threat assessments</p>
<p>I consider it is urgent to establish a system to ensure that action will be taken to combat not only known threats but also potential and latent threats. I do not see increased information gathering concerning potentially violent individuals to be a feasible approach. Nor do I consider that personal protection should be provided generally for a considerably larger number of individuals or that protective measures should be dependent on the role certain individuals have in the central government. Instead the existing categories of threat assessments – terrorism, domestic extremism, other expressions of opinion, mental disorder and transferred threat picture – should be supplemented by a new category of assessments linked to the situation of the person concerned. The basic approach should be that there is always a certain, but low, risk of the realisation of latent or potential threats. The situation of the protected person may, however increase or even greatly increase this risk. Many factors can affect such a threat assessment. Some examples are the extent of media exposure to which a person is subjected, how media depict a person, whether the person appears to be controversial or to represent an opinion that many reject or whether the person, such as a minister, is responsible for a proposal that has aroused strong public feeling. In my view, a threat</p>
<p>assessment of the kind proposed provides scope for more flexible personal protection, where action can be geared to what is actually required in the particular circumstances.</p>
<p>The current term “mental disorder” as a category for threat assessments is misleading and should be changed to the more adequate term “threats that can be linked to individuals.”</p>
<p>A separate assessment should always be made of the tactical threat picture for the Head of State, the Prime Minister, other ministers, the Speaker and the party leaders. For others, separate threat assessments should be carried out when justified by the circumstances.</p>
<p>The Swedish Security Service should review the tactical threat pictures more continuously than every six months.</p>
<p>It should still be possible to regulate the grounds for threat assessment in the National Police Board’s regulations and general advice (FAP).</p>
<p>Should the counter-terrorism unit do threat picture work?</p>
<p>I propose that threat assessment should no longer be carried out by the counter-terrorism unit. Instead these tasks should be transferred to a new unit of its own.</p>
<p>In its work on threat assessments the Swedish Security Service uses experts, especially experts in psychology. I consider that it is urgent that the Swedish Security Service also obtains the assistance of experts in other areas. Moreover, I consider it is important that the Swedish Security Service establishes contact with the university and higher education community in order to draw on the most recent findings in behavioural science and other areas.</p>
<p>Information from the Government Offices, the Riksdag and the Royal Court</p>
<p>Information on the planned programmes of protected persons</p>
<p>In all essentials, I am in favour of ministerial engagement lists containing the information set out in a list that the Swedish Security Service presented to the Government Offices in the spring of 2004. It is important that the Government Offices use clearer guidelines and better and more regular follow-ups to establish</p>
<p>uniform procedures for what information must be supplied to the Swedish Security Service and how this is to be done in practice. When these guidelines are drawn up, decisive importance should be attached to the wishes of the Swedish Security Service. The Government Offices and the Swedish Security Service should have an ongoing dialogue on procedures relating to the engagement lists.</p>
<p>Short-notice alterations to ministers’ programmes can lead to problems. Of course, it is impossible to tie ministers to a previously decided programme. One way of dealing with at least part of this problem is to improve and deepen contacts between the Government Offices and the Swedish Security Service.</p>
<p>With the changes I propose in threat assessment the Riksdag will have to provide more information about the planned programmes of party leaders. The Head of the Riksdag Security Department should be responsible for providing this information. The party secretariats in the Riksdag, which are the bodies with access to the relevant information, have stated that they are willing to assist in supplying this information to the Head of the Security Department. It is important that the party secretariats and the Head of the Security Department consult to try to develop functioning procedures for how the Swedish Security Service is to be made aware of programme changes.</p>
<p>Information on the receipt of threatening letters, etc.</p>
<p>The Government Offices should tighten up their procedures concerning threats received. Clear guidelines need to be designed about what to send to the Swedish Security Service and what procedure to use. These guidelines should be drawn up after consultations with the Swedish Security Service.</p>
<p>A type of information that can be of importance for threat assessment and that I consider should be passed on to the Swedish Security Service by the Government Offices consists of letters and other messages that, while not containing direct threats, express an prejudiced or peculiar attitude to a minister or to the issues that he or she is responsible for.</p>
<p>Information on incidents that have occurred</p>
<p>I consider that it is urgent for the Government Offices to establish reporting procedures for incidents that occur outside the premises of the Government Offices, such as when a minister takes part in an open-air meeting, and that can be of importance for personal protection work by the Swedish Security Service.</p>
<p>Information on controversial issues</p>
<p>I propose that the Government Offices supply the Swedish Security Service with information on issues viewed as controversial by the public.</p>
<p>Controversial issues can also be pursued by individual members of the Riksdag or by a Riksdag party that is not in government. The Head of the Riksdag Security Department has indicated that he is prepared to continually supply the Swedish Security Service with such information.</p>
<p>Other measures to improve information from the Government Offices to the Swedish Security Service</p>
<p>To augment and improve information from the Government Offices to the Swedish Security Service I propose that an official in the Swedish Security Service is stationed in the Government Offices. This person, who should have good knowledge and experience of the Swedish Security Service’s personal protection work, will be tasked with coordinating contacts between the Government Offices and the Swedish Security Service.</p>
<p>Information from the regular police service</p>
<p>I propose that the Swedish Security Service intensifies its efforts in working actively to increase the flow of information from the regular police service.</p>
<p>Gathering other information</p>
<p>I cannot see any solid reasons why the National Board of Forensic Medicine should not be able to release forensic psychiatric examinations to the Swedish Security Service when a court is able to do so under certain circumstances. I therefore propose that the Governmental Regulation on Forensic Psychiatric Examinations should be amended to permit the release of a forensic psychiatric examination when requested by a police authority and needed for the personal protection of members of the central government. This means that secrecy for forensic psychiatric examinations will be broken for the personal protection work of the Swedish Security Service.</p>
<p>When it comes to the relatively small number of people who have become known for making serious threats against people in the central government, I consider that it is appropriate for the Swedish Security Service to be able to obtain information from the health and medical services that is of direct and decisive importance for their threat assessment. I therefore propose that the Act on the Exercise of Healthand Medical professions is amended to require personnel in the health and medical services to release information needed in work for the personal protection of members of the central government if the information is requested by a police authority in a particular case. This provision will break professional secrecy for staff in both public and private employment.</p>
<p>The Swedish Security Service may need information from the prison and probation authorities in the same way as from the health and medical services. In view of this I propose that the governmental regulations on the execution of prison sentences and the execution of probation sentences are amended to require the prison and probation authorities to release to the Swedish Security Service information about the personal circumstances of a convicted person when the Swedish Security Service requests this in a specific case and the information is needed for the personal protection of members of the central government.</p>
<p>Information from the Swedish Security Service to ministers and other protected persons</p>
<p>I consider that information meetings between the Swedish Security Service and protected persons and their closest associates should be held regularly and at least once a year. Ultimately it must be up to protected persons to decide which of their associates should take part in these meetings. The meetings should be seen as an ongoing dialogue where the Swedish Security Service provides the security protection information considered necessary along with information on the current threat picture and where the protected person and this person’s associates are able to present their views and experiences.</p>
<p>Dimensioning of bodyguard protection</p>
<p>Today bodyguard protection consists of at least two bodyguards. In my view there is reason for the Swedish Security Service to consider whether bodyguard protection can not be made more flexible and be geared more to the current threat picture and to other circumstances. In many instances, it ought to be sufficient for a protected person to be accompanied by a single bodyguard, especially if this protection is supplemented by measures taken by the local police.</p>
<p>Participation of the regular police in personal protection actions</p>
<p>Responsibility of the Swedish Security Service and the police authorities for personal protection</p>
<p>I propose that the Swedish Security Service should be able to take decisions, binding for police authorities, on when distance protection must be provided and what form – on-site surveillance, hotel surveillance, route surveillance and/or an escort – it must take. This will clarify the division of responsibility between the Swedish Security Service and the local police. Such a division of responsibility is also more consistent with the provisions in the governmental regulations on the duties of the National Police Board and the Swedish Security Service than are current regulations and general advice issued by National police Board. The decision of</p>
<p>the Security Service shall be seen as establishing a minimum level for the distance protection. It then is a matter for the local police authority to implement the decision and decide if further measures should be taken as well as to lead the operations.</p>
<p>I also propose that, in connection with its decision on the form of distance protection, the Swedish Security Service should also decide whether the policemen involved will be in uniform and/or in plain clothes. The reason for this proposal is that police officers in plain clothes have taken part in distance protection measures without the knowledge of bodyguards, the protected person or his or her associates. When these police officers have taken action, this has disconcerted for both bodyguards and the protected person and his or her associates.</p>
<p>Some questions concerning the participation of police authorities in personal protection actions</p>
<p>I recommend that the Swedish Security Service and the police authorities consider how their cooperation can be deepened in the practical realisation of personal protection measures. I also propose the introduction of a report-back system from the local police to the Swedish Security Service on how distance protection has functioned during an action. With such a system the Swedish Security Service would, for instance, have received information about the occasions when the police were not in place even though the Swedish Security Service and the police authority had agreed they would be.</p>
<p>As regards the conduct of the local police in connection with the provision of distance protection I consider that the police officers who take part in such work should have been given instructions on how they should act and what they should especially bear in mind.</p>
<p>Ministers’ trips in ministerial cars</p>
<p>In order to further reinforce and improve security for ministers, over and above my other proposals, I consider that, whatever the threat picture, they should avoid public transport and should, instead, use a ministerial car. Consequently the use of a ministerial car should not result in any tax liability for ministers.</p>
<p>Resources</p>
<p>With my proposals the Swedish Security Service will need to make a substantial increase in its bodyguard force. It is almost impossible to say how many additional bodyguards will be required, but the minimum number is around 50.</p>
<p>I have considered whether people other than those who have completed full police training should be eligible for employment as bodyguards but have decided that this is not a good solution. Bodyguards should continue to be recruited from the police and, like today, they should be assigned to the Swedish Security Service for a fixed period. However, recruitment on the scale now required can hardly be achieved immediately and will have to take place in a phased manner over the longer term.</p>
<p>My proposals will also result in a need to increase the number of people working on threat assessments, in a need to recruit more group supervisors and in a need to reinforce administration.</p>
<p>Consequences</p>
<p>The purpose of the proposals in this report is to increase security for persons in the central government. As vital interests thus are at stake it is not possible to weigh the financial advantages and disadvantages or to propose a means of financing increased costs.</p>
<p>With my proposals the Swedish Security Service’s cost for salaries, social insurance contributions, materiel and training can, at a very rough estimate, be expected to increase by SEK 80 million over a two-year period. In addition, there will be increased expenditure for premises, office equipment, etc. The costs for the participation of the local police authorities will also rise.</p>
<p>It will probably only be possible to finance a very minor part of the cost increase for the Swedish Security Service and other police authorities within the present appropriation for the police service. Special funding will therefore have to be allocated.</p>
