<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>In June 2011, the European Parliament and Council adopted a directive on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (the AIFM Directive). The Directive requires the Member States to introduce common regulations concerning the managers (AIFMs) of alternative investment funds (AIFs). The rules contained in the directive apply to the managers, who have not previously been subject to common European regulation. It is likely that the AIFM Directive will be supplemented by one or more European Commission implementing regulations, which will be directly applicable in Sweden. Further additions to the provisions of the Directive can be expected in the form of technical standards, which are to be formulated by the European Securities and Markets Authority (Esma) and adopted by the Commission.</p>
<p>The main task of the Inquiry has been to analyse and prepare proposals for the amendments needed to Swedish legislation for the implementation of the AIFM Directive. It was part of the remit to avoid exceeding the minimum requirements laid down in the Directive unless deemed necessary on grounds of systemic risk or investor protection. The remit also included reviewing the regulation of contractual funds that are not mutual funds (special funds), including in those respects not covered by the AIFM Directive.</p>
<p>Following an introductory section describing the conditions for the Inquiry and its work, the report briefly describes the AIFM Directive and current Swedish regulation of the investment fund market (Chapter 2). This chapter also describes the Swedish investment fund market and the various types of funds – in a broad sense – found in it. The Inquiry’s proposals follow in Chapters 3–16 of the report. The Inquiry’s main proposals and assessments are presented below.</p>
<h2>General starting points (Chapter 3)</h2>
<p>In this chapter, the Inquiry looks at various basic and essential questions.</p>
<p>It establishes that many parts of the the AIFM Directive require full harmonisation, i.e. the Member States may not introduce more or less stringent rules than those laid down in the Directive and the Commission implementing regulations. However, in some areas the Directive does allow scope for national deviations, e.g. in the case of marketing of AIFs to non-professional investors. The basic premise of the Inquiry is that the provisions introduced in Swedish law should not go further than the AIFM Directive rules without good reason. However, there are strong investor protection grounds for introducing more stringent provisions for AIFMs marketing AIFs to consumers and other non-professional investors.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the AIFM Directive be implemented via a new legislative act. The terminology in the new act should reflect the terminology in the AIFM Directive, in order to facilitate the application of the implementing regulations and technical standards expected from the European Commission. Terminological consistency will also facilitate the ambition of achieving uniform regulation throughout the European Economic Area (EEA). The Inquiry also proposes that the special funds be regulated in the new act, and that the Investment Funds Act (2004:46) regulate only those funds covered by the UCITS Directive . These funds are currently known as ‘mutual funds’. The Inquiry proposes that they should instead be known as ‘investment funds’, and that this term should therefore cease to be used as a collective term for different types of funds.</p>
<p>Finally, the chapter proposes that the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority, Finansinspektionen, should be the competent authority under the AIFM Directive, i.e. the authority that takes decisions on authorisation for AIFMs and is responsible for supervising compliance with the provisions introduced based on the Directive.</p>
<h2>Scope (Chapter 4)</h2>
<p>The AIFM Directive contains a number of new definitions and terms. The most important are alternative investment funds, and managers of such funds. The Inquiry proposes that the definitions and abbreviations of these terms (AIFs and AIFMs) be introduced in the new act. This chapter also looks at exemptions from the scope of application of the act: both those companies and institutions that are wholly exempt, and AIFMs that manage AIFs with an overall asset value below certain thresholds, to which only certain provisions containing minimum registration and information requirements are to be applied.</p>
<h2>Authorisation and capital requirements (Chapter 5)</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the new act require AIFMs to be authorised. As a general rule, an AIFM may not be involved in any activities other than AIF management, which means that an investment firm or a bank would not be able to obtain authorisation to manage AIFs. A UCITS-management company can, however, obtain authorisation, under an explicit rule in the AIFM Directive which will be implemented through the new act.</p>
<p>An AIFM may obtain authorisation to offer and conduct discretionary management of investment portfolios and certain related secondary services as an ancillary activity.</p>
<p>The chapter also proposes provisions on what an authorisation application should include, the conditions for granting authorisation and the obligation to report certain changes of activity to Finansinspektionen.</p>
<p>Unlike other securities-related directives (e.g. MiFID and the UCITS Directive), the AIFM Directive does not contain any detailed rules on owner assessment. It is an authorisation condition that individuals with qualifying holdings in AIFMs must be suitable, but there are no rules concerning reassessment if there is a change of ownership once the AIFM has already been authorised. The rules on owner assessment in such situations in other legislation aim to protect investors from unsuitable owners gaining influence over activities. The Inquiry therefore proposes that owner assessment provisions corresponding to those currently in place for UCITS, for example, be introduced for AIFMs managing funds that are to be marketed to non-professional investors.</p>
<p>Finally, this chapter proposes that the act contain provisions corresponding to the minimum rules contained in the AIFM Directive on minimum initial capital and own funds during ongoing activities.</p>
<h2>Marketing (Chapter 6)</h2>
<p>In order for an AIFM to be permitted to market units in an AIF to professional investors it is not enough simply to hold AIFM authorisation. The AIFM must also notify the competent authority in its country of which funds are to be marketed. The Inquiry proposes that the term ‘marketing’ be defined in the new act, and that the act contain provisions concerning obligations to notify Finansinspektionen.</p>
<h2>Different rules for different categories of investors (Chapter 7)</h2>
<p>The AIFM Directive rules on authorisation and cross-border activities concern AIFMs managing AIFs that are to be marketed to professional investors. For example, as long as AIFs are only to be marketed to professional investors, AIFMs have the right to market funds in EEA countries other than their own following a relatively simple notification procedure. However, the AIFM Directive allows national rules with stricter requirements if funds are to be marketed to non-professional investors. Such stricter requirements must nonetheless be the same for domestic AIFMs and AIFs as for those from other EEA countries. regards organisational requirements and operating conditions for investment firms and defined terms for the purposes of that Directive (OJ L 241, 2.9.2006, p. 26, Celex 32006L0073).</p>
<p>In this light, it is proposed that the current rules for special funds remain largely unchanged. The Inquiry also proposes, as a general rule, that specific requirements be placed on AIFs that are not special funds if they are to be marketed to non-professional investors. Under the Inquiry’s proposals, units of such AIFs should be admitted to trading on a regulated market, either as fund units or as shares. The aim is to set requirements on liquidity, i.e. investors’ ability to transform their fund units into cash, that are equal to the liquidity requirements that apply to special funds, in that it must be possible to redeem such funds. Furthermore, the Inquiry proposes that there must be a fact sheet containing an easily understandable summary of the basic information needed by investors to assess the fund and the risks associated with investing in it. In form and content, this fact sheet should correspond to those required for special funds and, as for special funds, should be made available to investors in good time before agreements to purchase fund units are entered into.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that the provisions concerning registration requirements and certain disclosure obligations, which apply to AIFMs managing portfolios of AIFs whose assets under management in total do not exceed certain thresholds, should not apply to managers of special funds, regardless of the investor category to which they are marketed. Nor should these provisions apply to AIFMs managing AIFs other than special funds, if these are to be marketed to non-professional investors.</p>
<p>This chapter also proposes relaxing aspects of the disclosure requirement for managers of special funds, if they are marketed only to professional investors. This is considered to be justified on grounds of competitive neutrality.</p>
<h2>Rules for conducting activities (Chapter 8)</h2>
<p>The AIFM Directive contains a number of rules concerning how AIFMs conduct their activities. This chapter looks at provisions on conflicts of interest, relations with prime brokers, remuneration systems, risk management, financial leverage, liquidity management and securitisation transactions. The chapter also deals with some special rules for AIFMs offering discretionary management of investment portfolios.</p>
<p>Regarding conflicts of interest, the Inquiry proposes that provisions corresponding to those that apply to UCITS management companies and investment firms concerning the identification and management of conflicts of interest be introduced into the new act.</p>
<p>Under the AIFM Directive, if an AIFM uses a prime broker to fund or act as a counterparty to the AIF transactions in financial instruments, a written contract must be drawn up detailing the relationship and the possibilities for transfer and reuse of the fund’s assets. The Inquiry proposes that such provisions be included in the new act.</p>
<p>It also proposes provisions to the effect that AIFMs must have a structure for remuneration to employees that promotes sound and effective risk management. It is proposed that the Government, or the authority designated by the Government, have the right to issue regulations concerning the design of such remuneration systems. Similar rules are laid down in Finansinspektionen’s regulations for other enterprises in the financial sector, e.g. credit institutions, investment firms and UCITS management companies.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that AIFMs must have appropriate risk management, and a risk management function that is separate from the manager’s other operational activities. Staff responsible for management and for fund value development must not, for example, be in a position to influence the activities of the risk management function. Specific requirements for monitoring and stress testing of the liquidity risks in each AIF to be managed are also proposed.</p>
<p>Under the Inquiry’s proposals, AIFMs that use financial leverage, i.e. increase an AIF’s exposure to certain assets through loans or derivative instruments, must set limits for the scale of such techniques. The AIFM is responsible for ensuring that these limits are reasonable, and compliance with them. It must also be possible for Finansinspektionen to review these limits if it deems necessary on grounds of systemic risk.</p>
<p>Securitisation transactions mean that a credit institution, for example, pools certain assets and issues corresponding securities. Credit institutions may invest in such securities if the originator, the original lender or the credit institution involved in the emission has retained a financial interest equivalent to at least five per cent. The AIFM Directive contains a similar rule for AIFMs. According to the Directive, the conditions under which an AIF may invest in securitisation transactions should be laid down in delegated acts. The Inquiry therefore proposes only authorisation of the right to issue regulations, in case future delegated acts do not fully regulate investments in securitisation transactions.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that AIFMs authorised to manage investors’ portfolios on an individual basis be prohibited from placing such investors’ funds in AIFs managed by the AIFM in question, unless the investors have given prior approval. Furthermore, it is proposed that such activities be covered by the investor compensation contained in the Investor Compensation Act (1999:158).</p>
<h2>Organisation, valuation and delegation (Chapter 9)</h2>
<p>In this chapter, alongside general provisions stating that AIFMs must have appropriate organisation, sound administrative procedures, satisfactory internal controls, etc., the Inquiry proposes provisions concerning AIFMs’ valuation of assets in the AIFs managed. Firstly, AIFMs must have appropriate and consistent methods to ensure that a correct and independent valuation of the assets in each AIF can take place with a frequency appropriate to the fund’s redemption interval. Secondly, AIFMs must ensure that the valuation is carried out by an independent function: either by an external valuer or by a function within the AIFM that is independent of portfolio management functions.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes provisions concerning delegation. There are rules on delegation, or contracting/outsourcing, for most financial enterprises. In essence, the rules in the AIFM Directive, and the provisions the Inquiry proposes for AIFMs, mean that delegation must be justifiable on objective grounds, that the contractor must be chosen carefully to ensure the AIFM that the contractor is capable of undertaking the task, that activities requiring authorisation may only be delegated to contractors with the necessary authorisation, that possible conflicts of interest must be dealt with and that scrutiny by Finansinspektionen may not be impaired. Delegation of tasks must also be notified to Finansinspektionen. Further provisions are proposed for AIFMs to the effect that portfolio management or risk management may not be delegated to the AIF’s depository.</p>
<h2>Depositories (Chapter 10)</h2>
<p>As for every investment fund, for every AIF there must be a depository that holds the fund’s assets or, in the case of assets that cannot be held in custody, checks that the fund owns the assets. The Inquiry proposes provisions concerning both who can be a depository and what a depository must do. The provisions concerning the custody of assets, or checks of ownership rights, by depositories will be supplemented in future implementing regulations. Alongside these tasks, depositories exercise a control function and must ensure that shares are sold and redeemed in accordance with the law and the AIF rules, and that valuations are undertaken correctly. Supplementary rules on this will also be laid down in future implementing regulations.</p>
<p>This chapter also proposes provisions on the liability of depositories. No changes are proposed to the current regulations concerning depositories for special funds, but the Inquiry proposes that depositories for other AIFs be made liable for controls in the custody of financial instruments, and also in cases of negligence.</p>
<h2>Disclosure requirement and reporting to competent authorities (Chapter 11)</h2>
<p>The rules in the AIFM Directive concerning annual reports for all AIFs and information to investors is largely reminiscent of the provisions governing annual reports and information brochures for investment funds. In this chapter, the Inquiry proposes provisions concerning the contents of annual reports and information brochures for AIFs. These provisions would apply to all AIFs, including special funds and other AIFs that are marketed to non-professional investors. However, in addition to this disclosure requirement, a fact sheet would also be required for funds that are marketed to non-professional investors (see also Chapter 7).</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes provisions concerning AIFMs’ obligation to regularly inform Finansinspektionen of, for example, on which markets and with what assets AIFs are trading and what illiquid assets are in the funds. Detailed requirements concerning what information must be submitted and how often will be found in future implementing regulations.</p>
<h2>Control over non-listed companies and issuers (Chapter 12)</h2>
<p>In this chapter, the Inquiry proposes provisions to the effect that AIFMs that acquire control over a non-listed company must submit certain information to Finansinspektionen, the company and investors. According to the AIFM Directive, control over a nonlisted company means that an AIFM, alone or together with other funds, holds more than 50 per cent of the voting rights. If this occurs, the AIFM must inform Finansinspektionen and the company, and refrain from taking measures that might mean that the company is stripped of its assets. The same applies if AIFMs acquire control over an issuer, i.e. a company registered in the EEA and in which shares are listed for trading on a regulated market.</p>
<p>This chapter also proposes provisions to the effect that if an AIF acquires or transfers shares in a non-listed company such that its holdings exceed certain thresholds, the AIFM must inform Finansinspektionen.</p>
<h2>Cross-border activities (Chapter 13)</h2>
<p>The provisions in the AIFM Directive concerning cross-border activities are largely drafted like corresponding rules in other securities-related directives (e.g. the UCITS Directive and MiFID). Those wishing to operate across national borders must notify the competent authority in their home country, which in turn will pass on the notification to the competent authority in the country where the activities are to be operated (the host country). However, the AIFM Directive is complicated by the fact that special rules are permitted if AIFs are to be marketed to non-professional investors. The matter is further complicated by the rules on cross-border activities concerning funds and managers established outside the EEA (third countries).</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that rules on management and marketing passports be implemented through provisions on notification of cross-border marketing and management in those situations where both the AIFM and the AIF are EEA-based.</p>
<p>The chapter also proposes provisions for situations where the AIF or the AIFM, or both, are established outside the EEA. In such cases, activities are dependent on authorisation from Finansinspektionen. However, this is a national regulation and does not mean that the AIFM can, based on its authorisation in Sweden, operate activities in other EEA countries in the same way as under the provisions on management and marketing passports. These national provisions on authorisation will have to be repealed some time after 2015 if the Commission decides that the rules in the AIFM Directive concerning a harmonised passport regime are to be applicable for third country situations.</p>
<p>This chapter also deals with the rules in the AIFM Directive that may apply in the future to third country situations. In brief, these rules mean that an AIFM established outside the EEA could obtain authorisation in an EEA country (Member State of reference). The AIFM would then have, in principle, the same freedom to operate activities in the EEA as an EEA-based AIFM. The same applies to AIFMs established in the EEA managing non-EEA AIFs. If and when these rules will begin to apply depends, however, on Commission decisions expected some time after 2015. By that time, Esma will have assessed how the rules on management and marketing passports have worked and the Commission can then decide whether the rules in the AIFM Directive concerning harmonisation of third country situations should be applied. The Inquiry therefore proposes that these rules not be introduced in the Swedish act yet. Instead, the proposals made can form the basis of a legislative proposal if and when the Commission takes its decision.</p>
<h2>Supervision and sanctions etc. (Chapter 14)</h2>
<p>The rules in the AIFM Directive concerning supervision, the powers of the competent authorities and sanctions largely correspond to the rules on supervision and sanctions in the UCITS Directive and MiFID. In this respect, the Inquiry proposes provisions on supervision and intervention corresponding to Chapters 10 and 12 of the Investment Funds Act.</p>
<p>The chapter also proposes rules on appeals against decisions taken by Finansinspektionen.</p>
<p>The AIFM Directive contains rules to the effect that a competent authority can refer matters to Esma in some cases, e.g. in case of disagreement between the competent authorities in different countries. The Inquiry proposes a provision to this effect.</p>
<h2>The impact of the proposals on tax controls (Chapter 15)</h2>
<p>This chapter establishes that the Inquiry’s proposals do not affect the application of tax regulations for funds, as the implementation of the AIFM Directive does not affect the legal structure of the funds – an AIF in the form of a limited company is a limited company and an AIF in the form of a special fund is a contractual fund – even after the implementation of the AIFM Directive. However, certain changes of a technical-legislative nature are proposed so that the scope of the Coupon Tax Act and the obligation to provide statements of income etc. remain unchanged.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions (Chapter 16)</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the new act come into force on 22 July 2013. Certain transitional provisions are proposed to give the companies concerned time to adapt to the new regulations, and make it easier for companies authorised under the Investment Funds Act or Securities Market Act that need to switch to authorisation under the new act.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposals</h2>
<p>The implementation of the AIFM Directive will bring a number of changes to the existing regulatory framework. These changes will entail increased costs for AIFMs, depositaries and Finansinspek- tionen. The changes will be more drastic for some companies, those that are not currently subject to supervision, than for others, e.g. investment firms and UCITS management companies, which are already subject to supervision.</p>
