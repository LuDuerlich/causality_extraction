<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The Commission on Border Control was tasked by the Government (Ministry of Justice) in June 2003, to evaluate the effects of the Swedish application of the Schengen acquis, identify deficiencies and suggest improvements. Sweden has been applying the Schengen acquis since March 2001. In this Report the Commission presents its findings.</p>
<p>Border control is a joint responsibility of several Swedish national agencies: Police, Customs and Coast Guard. In addition, matters related to inter alia asylum, visa and residence permits are the responsibility of the Migration Board.</p>
<p>The last couple of years have seen an increase in the number of asylum-seekers in Sweden, thus following a general European trend. The purpose of the border control is to facilitate the orderly application of the national migration policy, while at the same time ensuring an effective law enforcement regarding cross border crime. Presently, Sweden’s land territorial borders are all Schengen borders. Only the frontiers, demarking the Swedish sea-territory and airports, are non-Schengen borders.</p>
<p>The Commission has found that some aspects of the Schengen acquis have been applied in a less satisfactory manner. While the notion of unrestricted crossing of a Schengen-border was well understood by the authorities, the responsibility to safe-guard law enforcement in Sweden, including the border areas, was not carried out. In some instances the border was more or less treated as an immune zone, where no police preventive or repressive actions were permitted. Misconceptions also hampered the flow of information between the Police and the Customs officials to the detriment of operational efficiency. While some of these misunderstandings are being cleared, the legal framework is still not conducive for a proper application in this respect.</p>
<p>Cross border crime include obvious examples like terrorism, trafficking and smuggling of narcotics and other contraband, but also any crime were there is a cross border element, e.g perpetrators being non-residents, but using Swedish territory as a part of a criminal endeavor.</p>
<p>An important aspect for the changes proposed by the Commission has been the risk of a rise in cross border criminality, which has been analyzed by the Police and Customs (reports and studies made in conjunction with the recent EU-expansion).</p>
<p>The Commission’s terms of reference do not include the prospect of any major organizational reform, e.g the establishment of a joint Border Agency, but indicate that the present division in three separate agencies is to remain.</p>
<p>The main proposals put forward in this report by the Commission are the following:</p>
<p>• It should be clearly stated that the purpose of Border Control is implementation of both Migration Policy and Law Enforcement (Crime prevention and Combating crime);</p>
<p>• The lines of authority between the Police, Customs, Coast Guard and the Migration Board should be clearly drawn;</p>
<p>• Joint Actions and pooling of resources at key points are to be used as a rule;</p>
<p>• Access to relevant information, including  on-line, between the agencies involved should be facilitated;</p>
<p>• Intelligence analysis and profiling regarding cross border crime are to be more operationally integrated, both within and between the law enforcement agencies;</p>
<p>• The present judicial procedural requirements for establishing cause should be maintained in case of control of a criminal suspect also at the border areas. However, the rules should be redrafted to ensure efficiency as well as legal security in preventing unjustified discrimination. The same rules are to be applied in cases of control of aliens elsewhere in Sweden; and</p>
<p>• All relevant provisions are to be enacted in a new Border Control Act, to be applied by all the agencies concerned.</p>
<p>It is suggested that the new Act is to be in force as of 1 July 2006.</p>
