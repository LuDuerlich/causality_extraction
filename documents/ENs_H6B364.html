<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Proposals</h2>
<p>The current Estate Agents Act (2011:666) will be replaced by a new estate agents act that applies not only to individual natural estate agents, but also to estate agencies in which individual estate agents operate. This means that the Swedish Estate Agents Inspectorate’s supervision of the estate agency industry will be expanded and more effective. More effective supervision may help consumers feel more secure when entering into property transactions.</p>
<h2>Estate agencies to be covered by the Estate Agents Act and anti-money laundering regulations</h2>
<p>The current Estate Agents Act applies only to estate agents. Estate agencies in which estate agents operate are therefore not covered by the Act. This means that such agencies are not required to be registered, nor are they subject to supervision by the Swedish Estate Agents Inspectorate.</p>
<p>We propose a new estate agents act that also covers estate agencies. The Swedish Estate Agents Inspectorate should be granted the right to take action against any estate agency that fails to fulfil its obligations under the act. This will enable the Inspectorate to conduct more effective supervision. It is usually estate agencies, in their capacity as employer of individual agents, that can guide the direction of their operations and how resources should be allocated. Agencies are also generally better equipped than individual estate agents to decide how the work should be organised. As a result, action against an agency may in many cases affect all the agents working there, without the Inspectorate having to take action against each individual agent. A right to take action directly against the estate agency will also enable the Inspectorate to direct the action against the actor best able to deal with any problems or shortcomings, regardless of whether it is the estate agent or the estate agency. This should ultimately contribute to a high level of consumer protection in the housing market and greater confidence in the entire estate agency industry.</p>
<p>We also propose that certain estate agencies be covered by the Act on Measures against Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (2017:630) (Anti-Money Laundering Act) in their capacity as business operators. In our assessment, this is in line with the purpose of the EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive. To ensure compliance with the Anti-Money Laundering Act, we propose that the Swedish Estate Agents Inspectorate be granted the right to take action against any estate agency that fails to fulfil its obligations under the regulations.</p>
<h2>Estate agencies must be registered</h2>
<p>A key component of our proposal is that estate agencies will be covered by a registration requirement. As with agents, there should be different registration categories. Which form of registration an estate agency is required to have depends on the type of operations conducted by the agency’s estate agents. If an estate agency fails to register, it may be prohibited, under penalty of a fine, from continuing its operations.</p>
<p>Certain agencies may be exempt from the registration requirement. Law firms do not need to be registered, even if any lawyer working in the firm provides intermediary services covered by the Estate Agents Act. Nor should estate agencies in which estate agents solely provide intermediary services for certain types of rental accommodation, and are thereby exempt from the registration requirement, be covered by the registration requirement. Estate agencies established in another state in the EEA or Switzerland, and conducting temporary activities in Sweden, are also exempt from the registration requirement.</p>
<p>Estate agencies must fulfil certain requirements to be able to be registered. The agency must not be bankrupt or in liquidation. The agency must also have professional indemnity insurance and intend to operate as an estate agency. In addition, the agency must be reputable and otherwise suitable for carrying out intermediary services. The estate agency must also pay an application fee and annual fee.</p>
<h2>Obligations of estate agencies and estate agents</h2>
<p>An estate agency cannot act as an intermediary in listing contracts. These contracts are personal for each estate agent. We do not propose any changes in this respect; rather, the estate agent should continue to be party to the listing contract and have primary responsibility for ensuring it is carried out in accordance with the legal requirements and good estate agency practice. Nor should estate agencies have any independent responsibility for following good estate agency practice. However, we do propose that estate agencies have an overall responsibility for ensuring that the estate agents working in the agency are given the conditions to carry out their tasks. Estate agencies must work to ensure that their estate agents fulfil their obligations under the Estate Agents Act. Any estate agency that fails to fulfil their obligations may be both liable for damages and subject to disciplinary action.</p>
<p>We also present certain proposals that can be expected to strengthen an estate agent’s position as an independent intermediary. We propose that no estate agency should be allowed to purchase any property that is, or has been, listed by one of its own agents. We also propose that estate agencies be prohibited from engaging in any activities that are likely to undermine confidence in the estate agents working in the agency. Nor should any estate agency be allowed to act as a representative. Furthermore, we propose that no estate agent be allowed to act as an intermediary for real property to other agents working in the same estate agency.</p>
<h2>Registered estate agencies subject to supervision</h2>
<p>Another essential component of our proposal is that estate agencies must be subject to supervision by the Swedish Estate Agents Inspectorate. One prerequisite to enable the Inspectorate to exercise effective supervision is ensuring that it has access to the information needed to conduct an inspection. Estate agencies will consequently be obliged to provide any documents and information necessary for supervision. To enable estate agencies to fulfil this obligation, we propose that estate agents be required to keep a copy of their records, the list of offers, property descriptions and other documentation needed by the Inspectorate to exercise supervision. The Inspectorate must also be entitled to conduct on-site inspections at estate agencies.</p>
<p>If any estate agency no longer fulfils the requirements for registration, fails to pay the prescribed fees or fails to fulfil its obligetions under the Estate Agents Act, the Swedish Estate Agents Inspectorate must be able to take action by revoking its registration or, if deemed sufficient, by issuing a warning, a caution or an order to make a correction. If any estate agency fails to fulfil its obligations under the anti-money laundering regulations, the Inspectorate must also be able to impose a financial penalty.</p>
<h2>Supervision of and action against owners and senior management</h2>
<p>One important reason for covering estate agencies under the provisions of the Anti-Money Laundering Act is due to the requirements that the EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive places on Swedish legislation. This includes requiring it to be possible to conduct a suitability assessment of owners and individuals on the estate agency’s board of directors. To satisfy this requirement, we propose that anyone who has failed to fulfil their obligations in the exercise of their business activities, or is guilty of a serious crime, should neither be allowed to own an estate agency or be part of its management.</p>
<p>If it emerges that an estate agency is owned by a person who does not fulfil this suitability requirement, the Swedish Estate Agents Inspectorate must be able to order this person to sell all or parts of their share in the agency. If a person in the agency’s senior management has failed to fulfil their obligations in the exercise of their business activities, or is guilty of a serious crime, the Inspectorate must instead be able to order the estate agency to take corrective action and by doing so give the estate agency the opportunity to replace the disqualified person.</p>
<p>The Swedish Estate Agents Inspectorate must also be able to take action against a person in senior management who, intentionally or through gross negligence, has caused an estate agency to breach the anti-money laundering regulations. Action must be taken by imposing a financial penalty or a temporary ban on holding a senior management position in the agency.</p>
<h2>New registration category to be introduced for estate agents (special registration for letting agents)</h2>
<p>An estate agent is usually required to be registered with the Swedish Estate Agents Inspectorate. There are currently two registration categories: full registration and registration for letting agents. Registration for letting agents only involves the right to provide intermediary services for rental accommodation, while full registration also entitles agents to provide intermediary services for properties, tenantowned housing and other property objects covered by the Estate Agents Act. In practice, these rules mean that letting agents of rental flats must be registered, while other letting agents have no such obligation. Certain provisions in the Estate Agents Act apply only to estate agents with full registration. And as the original Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive did not cover letting agents, the current Anti-Money Laundering Act also applies only to estate agents with full registration.</p>
<p>In May 2018, a directive to amend the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive was adopted. Under the amendment the antimoney laundering regulations will apply to estate agents even when they act as intermediaries in the letting of immovable property, on the condition that the rental accommodation has a monthly rent that equals or exceeds EUR 10 000. To fulfil the requirements of the revised Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, we propose introducing a new registration category called ‘special registration for letting agents’. Estate agents must register in this category if they provide intermediary services for rental accommodation with a monthly rent that amounts to or exceeds EUR 10 000.</p>
<p>An estate agent with special registration for letting agents must be covered by the provisions in both the Estate Agents Act and the Anti-Money Laundering Act. If the estate agent fails to fulfil their obligations under either of these acts, the Swedish Estate Agents Inspectorate can take action and revoke the agent’s registration or issue a warning, a caution or an order to make a correction. If the estate agent fails to fulfil their obligations under the Anti-Money Laundering Act, the Inspectorate can also impose a financial penalty.</p>
<h2>Supervision of, and action against, estate agents</h2>
<p>At present, the Swedish Estate Agents Inspectorate is entitled to conduct inspections on site in its supervision under the Anti-Money Laundering Act, but not if supervision is carried out pursuant to the Estate Agents Act. Furthermore, the Inspectorate is entitled to issue an order to make a correction if any estate agent has breached their obligations under the anti-money laundering regulations, but not if the agent has acted in contravention of their obligations under the Estate Agents Act.</p>
<p>We propose that the Swedish Estate Agents Inspectorate be granted the right to conduct on-site inspections of registered estate agents also in its supervision under the Estate Agents Act. Furthermore, we propose that the Swedish Estate Agents Inspectorate be granted a general right to issue an order to make a correction, i.e. regardless of whether the estate agent has failed to fulfil their obligations under the Estate Agents Act or the anti-money laundering regulations.</p>
<p>It is possible today for an estate agent fearing action to avoid this by requesting deregistration. To remedy this, we propose that the Swedish Estate Agents Inspectorate be able to examine whether there is reason to take action against an estate agent before the agent deregisters, either at their own request or because the agent no longer fulfils the registration requirements.</p>
<h2>Electronic assignment contracts, escrow agreements and property descriptions</h2>
<p>Current legislation prevents parties from entering listing contracts and escrow agreements electronically. In our assessment, the technological solutions available for signing contracts electronically are sufficiently secure to allow the use of electronic signatures. Accordingly, we propose that it should be possible to sign listing contracts and escrow agreements electronically.</p>
<p>Today, estate agents are required to provide consumers with a written description of the property. This requirement means that the estate agent must make sure that the consumer actually reads the property description. We propose that it should be sufficient that the estate agent makes the property description available, for example by publishing the property description on a website or displaying it on a tablet during the showing. However, an estate agent should always be required to provide a property description immediately and free of charge if a consumer requests it. The estate agent must also ensure that actual buyer has read the information.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>It is proposed that the legislative amendments enter into force on 1 July 2019.</p>
