<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Developments on the international scene have not only radically affected conditions governing the promotion and dissemination of culture , they have also altered people’s cultural habits . The rapid advance of information technology and the expansion of the media sphere has profoundly changed our society and the ways in which we communicate across countries and regions and between organisations and individuals.</p>
<p>We have witnessed a dramatic rise in cultural activity at all levels. New cultural forms have emerged while our cultural heritage has grown increasingly accessible. The cultural labour market has expanded and new networks have taken shape. As always, young people have led the way, breaking fresh ground and discovering new ways of using culture and technology. In the past few years the importance of culture to the development of societies has been acknowledged throughout the world. It was in recognition of these developments that the Swedish Government appointed the present</p>
<p>Committee of Inquiry on International Cultural Activities in 2002. Among other measures, the committee proposes the following:</p>
<p>• The establishment of an international  cultural fund  for the support of major projects.</p>
<p>• Transferral  of the existing tasks and responsibilities of the Swedish Institute ( Svenska institutet ) in the following spheres to other authorities and institutions: a) education and research</p>
<p>– with the exception of Swedish language instruction abroad, b) promotion of democracy and social reform, and c) grant allocation and funds intended for the support and promotion of literature.</p>
<p>• That the Swedish Institute’s core operations comprise  information  about Sweden ( Sverigeinformation ) and presenting Sweden ( Sverigepresentation ), services to embassies and services to and</p>
<p>information about the network ”Sweden’s International Institutes for Culture and Research” (see below).</p>
<p>• That Swedish cultural and research institutions abroad and the international cultural institutes located in Visby be merged into a single network, named  Sweden’s International Institutes for Culture and Research (Sveriges internationella kultur- och forskningsinstitut).</p>
<p>• That the Swedish National Council for Cultural Affairs ( Statens kulturråd ) be made responsible for coordinating  international cultural activities, as part of the Government’s overall cultural policy.</p>
<p>• That the Arts Grants Committee ( Konstnärsnämnden ) be commissioned to assess the feasibility of developing exchange activities  in areas other than the visual arts, on the IASPIS  (International Artists Studio Programme in Stockholm) model.</p>
<p>• The establishment within the National Council for Cultural Affairs of an  international centre for literature  for the translation of literature and the propagation of Swedish literature abroad.</p>
<p>• That holders of the office of cultural counsellor abroad be provided with sets of  clearly defined objectives, goals and professional requirements.</p>
<p>• That resources be set aside to enable the Ministry of Culture to provide for  roving cultural counsellors  (in addition to the semipermanent posts in Berlin, London, Moscow, Riga, Warsaw and Washington D.C.).</p>
<p>• The establishment of a unit responsible for  consultation on strategic issues  between the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Culture.</p>
<p>• That the Swedish Film Institute ( Svenska Filminstitutet, SFI ) and the Swedish Institute collaborate on the development of procedures for handling international film distribution , with a view to ensuring that the Swedish Institute’s services to Swedish missions abroad and the Swedish Film Institute’s international activities can be provided for.</p>
<p>• That special encouragement be given to  exchange appointments  between institutions, ministries and authorities.</p>
<p>Provided resources are suitably rationalised and redistributed it should be feasible to implement these proposals within existing budget frameworks.</p>
<p>As efforts must frequently be made to meet various international cultural objectives at once, it is essential that international cultural activities be followed up and evaluated  on the basis of common guidelines. The committee accordingly proposes the following guidelines  for the planning and evaluation of international cultural activities:</p>
<p>• Promotion of artistic and cultural quality</p>
<p>• Establishment of  long-term cultural contacts in other countries</p>
<p>• Promotion of cultural diversity and democracy</p>
<p>• Promotion of international cooperation in the sphere of cultural policy</p>
<p>The tasks</p>
<p>One of the tasks entrusted to the committee of inquiry was to clearly define and delimit the established objectives for international cultural activities. Another was to identify synergies (or conflicts) arising from the many different objectives governing the international activities of Swedish cultural authorities.</p>
<p>The committee was also instructed to propose task revisions, modification of existing resource distribution policies, organisational reforms and the adoption of new principals by authorities, institutions and organisations with a view to meeting the needs of cultural life.</p>
<p>The committee’s analyses, assessments and findings were based on facts collected from (mainly national) institutions and authorities responsible for cultural affairs and from Swedish missions abroad. Its activities included seminars for cultural workers – one of which addressed the issue of cultural diversity – and interviews of internationally active cultural workers. The committee also made study visits to a number of cultural exchange organisations in other countries, including France, the UK and South Africa.</p>
<p>A leaner, more focused cultural network</p>
<p>Like most other governments, the Swedish Government undertakes or sponsors cultural and culture-promoting projects and activities abroad. It does this at various levels, for longer or shorter periods of time and through a range of authorities and institutions.</p>
<p>Some of these activities are research-oriented, while others are aimed at promoting democracy or are otherwise associated with development assistance. Still others can be described as ‘national marketing’ – ranging from the promotion of Sweden as a whole to that of national institutions and groups to individual artists and performers. Some of these may combine several of the above elements. Ultimate responsibility for all these undertakings rests with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Education and Science and the Ministry of Industry, Employment and Communications.</p>
<p>The free exchange of ideas and methods is essential to a dynamic cultural life. Its representatives not only need to display their work and activities, but they also need stimulus, ideas and inspiration from outside. The Government’s task is to stimulate and facilitate this process through support measures of various kinds.</p>
<p>Nowadays, all cultural institutions must cultivate an international outlook and be part of active, continually developing networks.  In addition, the division of competencies  between authorities and institutions must be clearly defined and their administrative and grant allocation procedures must be transparent and accessible.</p>
<p>The committee found that government institutions have not always kept pace with development. Administrative machinery is frequently cumbersome, operations may be poorly coordinated and staff turnaround rates are often low. Some institutions do not make sufficient use of IT. Information is sometimes not available in languages other than Swedish. On the other hand, cultural authorities have not always received sufficient funds to operate effectively in a world of increasing cultural richness and complexity. The shortage of funds has been compounded by the lack of fresh approaches to the task of attracting new players.</p>
<p>Coordination of Sweden’s cultural and research institutions abroad would serve to consolidate and clarify our cultural policy commitments. Most of these institutions, many of which are housed in premises of cultural and historical interest, are little known either in Sweden or the host countries. The committee recommends that a special network be set up for these bodies.</p>
<p>In general, activities must be more closely coordinated  than at present so that those involved in international cultural exchanges can make the best possible use of them and institutions can benefit from one another. This will require better communication between</p>
<p>authorities accountable to different ministries as well as between ministries.</p>
<p>The committee also concluded that international management training in the cultural sphere  should be introduced as a course subject in higher education in order to narrow the gap between creative capacity and administrative skills.</p>
<p>There should be higher staff turnaround rates  and a wider age distribution  in Sweden’s cultural authorities. In addition more scope should be given to project activities  involving staff on fixed term contracts.</p>
<p>The committee considers that special efforts  should be made to enhance the knowledge and skills of Foreign Ministry staff with respect to cultural policy and cultural affairs. Other ministries would also benefit from further education and in-service training in this sphere.</p>
<p>The National Council for Cultural Affairs is  ill-equipped  in terms of knowledge and information to deal competently with international issues. Among other things, the council should be concerned with acquiring and disseminating information about foreign networks and funding approaches. The council, which has a large number of permanent beneficiaries, should seek to develop greater flexibility with regard to grant allocation. A comprehensive system of measures for  follow-up  and evaluation of fund allocation is lacking.</p>
<p>The Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) is the biggest single spender in the sphere of governmentsponsored cultural activities outside Sweden. Although its principal, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, has not specifically commissioned it to undertake cultural activities, the agency accounts for nearly half of all expenditure in this area. Sida must naturally be included in the  inter-institutional  cooperation and coordination of projects and measures advocated by the committee.</p>
<p>The Swedish Institute  has become a sort of hybrid authority with responsibility for a wide range of heterogeneous, often mutable activities and a highly complex, cumbersome fund allocation structure. If the institute is to become the vigorous, effective instrument it was designed to be – a body created to promote and disseminate information about Sweden – its duties must be pared back and its organisation trimmed. Task reallocation designed to enable the agency to focus on its core activities in accordance with</p>
<p>the committee’s proposals would yield rationalisation gains, which could be usefully channelled into international cultural exchange activities. The institute’s operations in the fields of education and research, provision of grants and subsidies, support for the promotion of democracy and other forms of development assistance should be turned over to other institutions. CCS, the Swedish cultural centre in Paris, is to remain an effective platform for the dissemination of Swedish culture under the institute’s direction.</p>
<p>The National Council for Cultural Affairs and  the Swedish Institute have common interests, which could also yield rationalisation gains. An arrangement to share premises would entail additional benefits for the two authorities.</p>
<p>Although rationalisation and streamlining can improve the efficiency of the larger cultural authorities, the need for a body that can handle major projects and attract the new players which have emerged in the last decade remains. The committee proposes the creation of an international cultural fund , formally subordinate to the National Council for Cultural Affairs but with a governing board of its own. Its work, characterised of necessity by flexibility, would include extending support for projects aimed at the establishment of long-term cultural contacts.</p>
<p>The successful establishment of the cultural exchange programme IASPIS by the Arts Grants Committee  has helped put Stockholm on the international visual arts map. The committee proposes that the Arts Grants Committee study the feasibility of setting up similar programmes in other art fields.</p>
<p>Cultural workers interviewed by the committee perceive the division of competencies  among institutions as unclear. Other views are that cultural authorities are not good at making use of common resources and too slow at delivering promised financial support. Many cultural workers also maintain they lack the necessary support to develop contacts with Western Europe and North America to the desired extent.</p>
<p>Sweden and the world at large</p>
<p>Sweden boasts a large number of internationally successful artists, performers and cultural figures in a wide range of fields and Swedish culture – from the more established forms (music of different genres, film, theatre, visual arts, dance and literature) to</p>
<p>the less traditional (video art, new circus, design, etc.) – is in demand abroad. In addition, our budding multicultural society has proved to be a major asset in this regard.</p>
<p>Sweden is subject to or influenced by international agreements, conventions and directives which bear directly or indirectly on the cultural sphere. Membership of the European Union and organisations such as UNESCO, the Council of Europe and the Nordic Council of Ministers enables us to bring our influence to bear on international regulatory frameworks, allows us to take part in international cultural projects and programmes, and gives us an opportunity to promote cultural and language diversity.</p>
<p>The maintenance and development of cultural ties and contacts can make a vital contribution to the work of conflict prevention  and confidence building . Sweden can play a crucial role in this regard.</p>
