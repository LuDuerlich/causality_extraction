<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Government support for religious communities other than the Church of Sweden was first established in 1971. Its purpose was to make it easier for those religious communities in a financially weak position to obtain and equip premises and provide religious activities. The introduction of the support must be seen in the light of the long-held politically and economically dominant position of the Church of Sweden. State support was reviewed as part of the reform of church and state in 2000. At this point, the Act on support to religious communities (1999:932) was passed, which regulated the criteria governing eligibility for state support. On grounds of equality, the reform also provided for free help for religious communities other than the Church of Sweden with collecting membership fees. Still today, the funding provided by the State for religious communities other than the Church of Sweden comprises government grants and help from government agencies with the administration of fees.</p>
<p>Swedish society has changed since the support was first established. Consequently, questions have also been raised as to whether the support system meets the needs of the religious communities active in Sweden today and the needs that exist in society. At the same time, there are a number of shortcomings in the current system which call for a review. For example, there is a lack of clarity as to how the current democracy criterion is to be interpreted in the light of the accumulated case law of the European Court of Human Rights, and regarding the possibility of withdrawing support from religious communities that have developed in an undemocratic direction. Furthermore, the current support system uses terms that are not denomination-neutral and are thus not relevant to all religious faiths.</p>
<p>In the light of this, the inquiry has been charged with reviewing state support to religious communities. Under its terms of reference, the inquiry is to analyse the effects of the current support system on the religious communities concerned and society in general. The inquiry is additionally to propose a new objective for the State’s support to religious communities and new criteria for receiving that support, including a clearer democracy criterion compatible with freedom of religion. The inquiry is also to propose new provisions on revoking support and recovering funds paid out. The inquiry’s terms of reference do not, however, instruct the inquiry to form an opinion on whether the State should allocate funding to religious communities at all.</p>
<p>In additional terms of reference, the inquiry was charged with surveying the provision of and demand for denominational training in Sweden, geared towards religious community leaders. The inquiry is also to assess the provision of non-denominational training for representatives of religious communities and the demand for such training in religious communities, e.g. training on Swedish society and fundamental freedoms and rights, democracy and gender equality.</p>
<h2>The importance of the support for the religious communities and society in general</h2>
<p>The overall view of the inquiry is that state support is extremely important for religious communities. Were this funding to be reduced or abolished, particularly help with collecting membership fees, this would have major consequences for the activities of the religious communities. Above all, it would place the religious communities in a less advantageous position than the Church of Sweden. The support is therefore significant as a point of principle, because it places all religious communities on roughly the same footing in terms of conducting religious activities. In this way, the support to religious communities helps to ensure that all people in Sweden are able to practise their religion and thus exercise their religious freedom on relatively equal terms.</p>
<p>In addition, the state support helps to give religious communities the fundamental prerequisites they need to carry out activities that are important for meeting people’s varying existential needs.</p>
<p>This encompasses those situations in which people turn to religious communities, such as particular life events such as weddings and funerals, and also when in crisis or suffering misfortune. The activities of religious communities in health, the prison and probation service and civil contingency planning, are particularly important in this context. They also play an important role in engagement with culture and the arts, particularly in ensuring that individuals with a foreign background are able to retain their culture and identity. Furthermore, several religious communities carry out a great deal of social work with newly arrived migrants and socially vulnerable people, which is important for individuals who the public welfare system finds it difficult to reach. The inquiry also finds that, to a certain extent, the support can strengthen fundamental democratic values and stimulate participation in democracy, partly in that the religious communities have to comply with the current democracy criterion, and in that several religious communities are organised in line with the tradition of formal societies in Sweden.</p>
<p>However, the contribution of the religious communities in strengthening fundamental democratic values is not clear in all respects, and there are examples of religious communities that have maintained values and structures that restrict individuals in terms of enjoying their freedoms and rights.</p>
<h2>Grounds for the State to support religious communities</h2>
<p>In the view of the inquiry, freedom of religion must be seen as the main reason for the State to support religious communities. The State is obliged to take a neutral stance towards different religious communities. By allocating funding to religious communities and offering help with collecting membership fees free of charge, the State can rest assured that no religious community is given a particularly advantageous position in society in relation to the State. All religious communities thus conduct their religious activities on equal terms and all individuals are granted relatively identical fundamental opportunities to exercise their religious freedom. Furthermore, the international conventions ratified by Sweden state that the State is to promote freedom of thought, conscience and religion.</p>
<p>The social benefit provided by the activities of the religious communities is an additional reason for providing support. The religious communities fulfil an important function for many people’s wellbeing, partly by meeting people’s existential needs. This is particularly the case in conjunction with particular life events such as weddings and funerals, but also when in crisis or suffering misfortune. Through their cultural and social activities, the religious communities also contribute towards social benefit. In their activities, the religious communities can also encourage democratic participation, strengthen democratic values and counteract anti-democratic tendencies.</p>
<p>Giving support to religious communities places the State in a better position to conduct dialogue and consult with religious communities and forge connections with people who are engaged in them.</p>
<h2>Proposed new objective of support</h2>
<p>Given that the inquiry considers that freedom of religion must be seen as the main justification for support, in the future the objective should continue to be that support is to help to create conditions for the religious communities to actively conduct religious activities with a long-term focus. The objective as it currently stands states that activities of a religious nature are to take the form of services, pastoral cure, religious instruction and care. The inquiry considers that there is no reason to define in this manner what religious activities must cover. Instead, what religious activities are to include will be shown in the definition of the term ‘religious community’. Additionally, the terms ‘services’ and ‘pastoral cure’ are not denomination-neutral, which is another reason for the inquiry to propose a new definition of the term ‘religious community’.</p>
<p>The inquiry further considers that the objective should make it clear that state support is to contribute towards maintaining and strengthening the fundamental values on which society is based. The objective would thereby better reflect the Government’s intention, expressed by providing the support, of promoting democracy and participation, with respect for gender equality and the equal value of all people. Some religious communities also seek funding to help develop their work on democracy. Incorporating this into the wording of the objective makes it clear that the funding is intended to help develop and strengthen work on these issues.</p>
<p>Because the main justification for the support is freedom of religion, the inquiry does not deem it reasonable or appropriate to formulate an objective whereby the importance of the support for the religious activity is to be followed up, or to require that the support has any specific effects in this respect. The support primarily has a value in terms of safeguarding a human right and not primarily in terms of the activities of religious communities that are beneficial to society. Additionally, the government grant is mainly allocated as an organisational grant, which in itself is difficult to follow up. On the other hand, it is possible to carry out overall evaluations of the effects of the support on the basis of the objective of maintaining and strengthening the fundamental values of society. This may, for example, involve evaluating the proportion of women on governing bodies, and the work of the religious communities on democracy and values issues.</p>
<h2>Changes in forms of support</h2>
<p>Today the government grant is mainly allocated as an organisational grant intended for the core activities of religious communities. From the point of view of freedom of religion, it is particularly important to protect the independence of the religious communities and there are therefore grounds for the grant to continue to largely be allocated as an organisational grant in the future. On the other hand, organisational grants give the agency less scope to monitor and assure itself that the government funding really is being used for the purposes for which it is intended. Nor does an organisational grant provide any guarantees that the funding will be passed on to the communities and activities that are in the greatest need of support. Therefore, the inquiry considers that the proportion of support allocated as operational grants and project grants should increase compared with today’s levels.</p>
<p>To support the organisational development of the religious communities, the inquiry also proposes that an appropriate organisation development grant be set up. Such a grant could be of benefit to many religious communities facing difficulties managing extensive financial and administrative activities.</p>
<p>Operational grants for training representatives of religious communities</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that an operational grant be established, which can be applied for by eligible religious communities or their groups to finance both denominational and non-denominational training of representatives. The background to this proposal is that the theological training courses which currently receive support cannot in themselves be considered to be religious communities and therefore should not be eligible for funding. In addition, from the equal treatment perspective, it is unsatisfactory that not all religious communities are able to receive this operational grant. The inquiry’s proposal will enable all religious communities entitled to support and their groups to seek grants for training that, for example can be given at higher education institutions, folk high schools, in non-formal adult education, or by other training providers, etc.</p>
<p>The survey conducted by the inquiry additionally shows that several religious communities express a need for both denominational and non-denominational training. Several representatives of the religious communities and their groups lack Swedish language skills and knowledge of Swedish society, and this can affect their contact with Swedish society and with people who turn to the religious communities. It is also necessary for the religious communities to be given opportunities to improve their representtatives’ skills and competence in the field of democracy, particularly in terms of the inquiry’s proposal to more clearly specify the democracy criterion.</p>
<h2>A new definition of a religious community</h2>
<p>A religious community is defined in the Act (1998:1593) on religious communities as a fellowship for religious activities that includes holding services. The inquiry considers that this definition is unclear and that it is difficult to make a predictable assessment of what religious activities are. The definition also draws on Christian language and can therefore not be considered to be denominationneutral.</p>
<p>The inquiry considers that the focus of a definition of the term of religious community should not lie in the content of the faith but in the form of activity carried out. The activity covered by the definition must furthermore be such activity as is considered worthy of protection under Article 9.1 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p>Religious activity is largely conducted through worship, prayer or meditation. These terms also have a meaning that is well-established among religious communities and the general public. Religious activity usually also includes specific rituals, such as celebrating festivals, coming together around spiritual or existential questions, or devotions. The inquiry therefore proposes that the term ‘religious community’ be considered to be a community that conducts religious activity through worship, prayer, meditation or rituals.</p>
<p>Under the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, a religious belief must “attain a certain level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance” to be considered worthy of protection under Article 9.1 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p>In the same way, a community’s religious activity must be judged on the basis of its gravity and importance, for example whether it includes regular rites of passage such as weddings and funerals.</p>
<p>From an equal treatment perspective, and in the light of the fact that today there are secular belief communities that perform rituals such as weddings and funerals to the same extent as several religious communities eligible for state funding, there may be grounds to also allow such secular groups to be entitled to state funding. The inquiry has not been tasked with proposing a belief-neutral support system, but considers that there may be grounds for the Government to appoint an inquiry to review whether secular belief communities whose activity should be considered worthy of protection under Article 9.1 of the European Convention on Human Rights should also be eligible for support.</p>
<h2>Formal support criteria</h2>
<p>The inquiry considers that there are several reasons to continue to require that religious communities eligible for funding have an established and clear organisational structure. People who turn to a religious community and participate in its activities must be able to know how the religious community is organised and who is responsible for its activities. It is also crucial to the State that the religious community is a legal entity and has a formal leadership capable of representing and speaking on behalf of its members. According to the inquiry, these needs are best met by the religious community being registered with the Legal, Financial and Administrative Services Agency (Kammarkollegiet). The same criteria regarding the organisation of the religious community will thus apply to both the government grant and government assistance in the collection of fees.</p>
<p>In order for religious communities to be stable and self-sustaining, it is also important that there are clear criteria governing their finances and accounting. It must not be possible for religious communities to be heavily in debt. Such criteria can be seen as an assurance to those served by the religious communities that the state support is used for the purposes for which it is intended. In addition, the current criterion that the religious activity of the religious community must largely be financed by those served by the community and resident here in Sweden must continue to apply. This requirement can be seen as protecting the religious community’s independence, because a religious community receiving major grants or gifts from an organisation or person outside the community may find itself in a position of dependency vis-à-vis this organisation or person. However, the inquiry considers that the current requirement whereby religious communities must have the right of disposal over the premises they use for their activities is not justified and therefore is to be abolished.</p>
<p>There are grounds to set certain formal criteria regarding the minimum number of people served and the length of time activities must have been conducted, as this provides an assurance that the religious community is stable and self-sustaining, and that the support will actually lead to lasting, active religious activity. Given that the purpose of the support is to promote freedom of religion, the inquiry considers that these criteria should not be too stringent so as not to exclude several smaller religious communities. The inquiry therefore proposes that the criterion for the number of people served be lowered from 3,000 to 1,000. However, in the future too, activities must have been run for at least five years. The inquiry also finds that there are no grounds for the current criterion on the geographical spread of activities and that this should be abolished.</p>
<p>Generally, the same requirement should apply to all religious communities, and therefore the inquiry proposes that the opportunity for collaborative bodies and small religious communities which are part of an internationally active religious community to receive support be removed.</p>
<h2>A clearer democracy criterion</h2>
<p>The inquiry has drawn the conclusion that it is necessary to introduce a democracy criterion in the support legislation for several reasons. Firstly, Chapter 1, Article 2 of the Instrument of Government imposes upon the State a duty to work positively to ensure that the fundamental values of society are protected. State support should thereby not be awarded to activities that contravene or counteract these values. Through international conventions that Sweden has ratified, the Swedish State is also obliged to protect and promote various rights under these conventions, and for this reason support must, as a rule, be able to be refused should human rights be infringed. The legitimacy of the support also presumes that public funding is not paid out to religious communities that conduct activities incompatible with our fundamental values. The inquiry therefore judges that a democracy criterion should be set, irrespective of the manner in which the support is granted, i.e. also covering state assistance in collecting membership fees.</p>
<p>Refusal of entitlement to support may result in restricting freedom of religion</p>
<p>It is the assessment of the inquiry that a refusal to recognise a religious community as being eligible for support due to the fact that it fails to meet the democracy criterion may in some cases involve restricting freedom of religion under the European Convention on Human Rights. The case law of the European Court of Human Rights shows that it is not for a State to evaluate the legitimacy of different faiths or the way in which they are expressed or manifested. The European Convention on Human Rights also provides extremely strong protection for the autonomy and internal life of religious communities. According to the religious communities, actions that can be considered to contravene the democracy criterion are often closely linked to their religious teachings or internal circumstances.</p>
<p>The European Convention on Human Rights permits restrictions to freedom of religion under certain stated conditions. Such restrictions must be laid down by law, have a certain legitimate purpose and be considered to be necessary in a democratic society. Because a refusal to recognise a religious community as eligible for support may mean restricting freedom of religion, the democracy criterion must be clearly regulated and worded on the basis of values that are considered to be particularly worthy of protection in a democratic society.</p>
<p>The current democracy criterion is associated with several problems</p>
<p>The inquiry considers that the current democracy criterion is associated with several problems. Firstly, the criterion is vague and unclearly worded and is therefore difficult to apply in practice. Setting requirements that the religious community must contribute to  maintaining and strengthening the fundamental values of society makes the criterion unclear, because all religious communities could be considered to contribute in some way or other. Additionally, there is no consistent and exhaustive description of what is meant by the fundamental values on which society is based . The religious community therefore cannot clearly predict which actions on their part might lead to entitlement to support being refused. The lack of clarity also increases the risk of discretionary assessments and arbitrary decisions on the part of decision-makers, which is unacceptable considering that refusing entitlement to support may involve restricting religious freedom.</p>
<p>In addition, the preparatory works when drafting the current democracy criterion are unclear and contradictory, partly because they state that the State is not permitted to make any more detailed assessment of the community’s teachings in relation to the common values of society, while the actions mentioned often concern different religious beliefs. Another major problem with the preparatory works is that they pay too little attention to the relationship between the democracy criterion and freedom of religion and fail to address protection of freedom of religion under the European Convention on Human Rights at all.</p>
<p>The democracy criterion should be worded on the basis of clearly stated grounds for exclusion</p>
<p>The inquiry considers that the democracy criterion should be worded in such a way as to exclude religious communities that act in contravention of fundamental values in Swedish society that are particularly worthy of protection. The legislator would thereby be able to state when restriction of freedom of religion is justified. Regulation would thus be limited to situations where it really is necessary for the State to intervene. Furthermore, this would make it easier for the religious communities to predict in advance which actions might lead to entitlement to support being refused and would limit decision-makers’ opportunities to make arbitrary assessments. It would also make it possible to strike a reasonable balance between the State’s need for control and the religious communities’ need for privacy and independence, while facilitating application in practice.</p>
<p>The inquiry is aware that a democracy criterion with grounds for exclusion has shortcomings. For example, there is a risk that by stating clear grounds for exclusion, actions from which the State would wish to distance itself, but which were not predicted, or which only become relevant in the light of changes in our values, might be missed. The inquiry considers that such shortcomings are the price of predictable and clear legislation.</p>
<p>The actions of the religious communities and their groups, representatives and speakers may prove grounds for exclusion</p>
<p>In line with the inquiry’s proposal, support will not be granted if the religious community or any of its groups or representatives acts in such a way as stated in any of the grounds for exclusion. This not only concerns legal representatives, but also people who may be considered to represent in other ways the religious community in relation to those it serves or the general public, such as formally appointed or employed religious leaders, teachers, etc. Responsibility for the actions of the representative only becomes relevant when the representative acts within the remit of the religious community’s activity or that of one of its groups.</p>
<p>A religious community and its groups also bear major responsibility for speakers, etc. invited in. If a religious community or one of its groups invites in a speaker who advocates hate against certain groups, for example, this legitimises the speaker and their opinions. Granting support to such a religious community or group is incompatible with the aim of helping to maintain and strengthen the fundamental values on which society is based.</p>
<p>Points of departure for grounds for exclusion</p>
<p>Fundamental values that can be considered to be particularly worthy of protection in Swedish society are set out in Chapter 1, Article 2 of the Instrument of Government. This provision largely rests on the international conventions that Sweden has ratified, such as the European Convention on Human Rights, the UN’s</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It covers values such as the equal worth of all and the liberty and dignity of the individual, the ideals of democracy, participation and equality and protection against discrimination, the private and family lives of the individual and the rights of the child. These are values that are seen as particularly worthy of protection in a democratic society, and actions that infringe these may restrict other people’s freedoms and rights.</p>
<p>The inquiry has focused on the values that may be of particular importance in relation to religious communities. It was not relevant whether the actions addressed actually occur in religious communities today and if so, to what extent. Instead, the inquiry considers that it is sufficient that it can be assumed that a religious community, today or in the future, will not respect a certain fundamental value particularly worthy of protection in order to include it as grounds for exclusion. On this basis, the inquiry proposes grounds for exclusion in the following areas:</p>
<p>Violence against the person, force and threats</p>
<p>Support will naturally not be provided if the religious community exercises violence against the person, force or threats. Nor will religious communities that justify, promote or encourage violence against the person, force or threats receive state support. For example, this might involve a religious community justifying violence in close relationships, or promoting forced marriage or violent extremism by spreading propaganda, providing financing or conducting recruitment. Attacks might be encouraged by a religious community encouraging violence, force or the making of threats against people due to their sex, transgender identity, sexual orientation, religious conviction, ethnic origin or political opinions, for example.</p>
<p>Infringement of children’s rights</p>
<p>The relationship between what is best for the child and the freedom of religion of the child and their parents respectively is a complex one. Parents have the right to bring up their child and thus to influence the child on issues of religion. However, according to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the state has an obligation to protect children from harm, irrespective of the environment in which this may occur. The inquiry considers that the state should never support religious communities that infringe a child’s rights in such a way as to cause a tangible risk of harm to the child’s health or development. For example, this might involve a religious community inflicting harmful punishments on children. Nor may religious communities that justify, promote or encourage harmful infringements of children’s rights be entitled to support. For example, this might involve a religious community urging parents to act in a particular way, such as maintaining a certain traditional custom or refusing children care or education, which involves a tangible risk of harm to a child’s health or development. It might also involve religious communities that justify, promote or encourage child marriage.</p>
<p>Restrictions on the rights and freedoms of those served by the religious communities</p>
<p>Different religions or religious communities may prescribe particular rules of behaviour that adherents must follow in their private life. This may involve regular attendance at worship, performing particular rituals, etc. The State’s scope to restrict the choices adherents make in order to follow religious commands is very limited under the European Convention on Human Rights, even though the commands may be harmful to the adherents’ wellbeing. Adherents who do not accept the religious decrees of a religious community must, however, always have an unconditional right to leave the community in question.</p>
<p>If a religious community restricts the freedoms and rights of those it serves through force or exploiting a vulnerable situation, it should be refused entitlement to support. For example, this might involve a religious community exploiting the fact that someone it serves finds themselves in a dependent position, is powerless or has an intellectual disability or illness.</p>
<p>Discrimination and clear infringement of the principle of the equal value of all people</p>
<p>A fundamental value in a democratic society is that discrimination or abuse of people due to their sex, religion and sexual orientation cannot be tolerated. If a religious community were not to respect the principle of equal value of all people, it should therefore as a rule not be eligible for support. At the same time, the European Convention on Human Rights protects the autonomy and inner life of religious communities and a religious community should, in line with its religious teaching, be free to choose the people who are to represent its core religious activities, such as religious leaders and teachers, even if this involves discrimination due to e.g. sex or sexual orientation. Even the Discrimination Act (2008:567) must be considered to allow a certain degree of discrimination regarding such religious representatives. If, on the other hand, the religious community discriminates against people applying for other posts in the community, it should not be eligible for state support. Discrimination might also be permissible if the religious community refuses someone access to public worship due to their sexual orientation, or in an educational context, for example.</p>
<p>The inquiry also considers that a religious community that clearly infringes the principle of equal value of all people must be excluded from state funding. This may, for example, involve a religious community that expresses disdain for groups of people with reference to their sex, ethnic origin, belief or sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Actively counteracts the democratic form of government</p>
<p>The inquiry considers that a religious community that actively counteracts the democratic form of government must not be eligible for support. This might, for example, involve a religious community encouraging its adherents not to follow Swedish law, to fail to fulfil their civic duties or to ignore orders from authorities. Civic duties refer here only to legal obligations and not moral undertakings to society, such as exercising the right to vote. In exceptional cases, encouraging adherents to break the law, etc. may be compatible with eligibility for support. In such cases, this must involve urging civil disobedience which entirely seeks to preserve or re-establish democratic values.</p>
<h2>Provisions on revoking entitlement to support will be introduced</h2>
<p>The current Act on support to religious communities lacks provisions on revoking entitlement to government grants, and on recovering government grants should a religious community no longer fulfil the criteria entitling it to support. The Act on religious communities contains a provision whereby government assistance with the collection of fees may be revoked, but it does not state the circumstances in which this may happen, which is unsatisfactory from the rule of law perspective.</p>
<p>With the aim of protecting state funding and the fundamental values of society, the inquiry proposes that a revocation provision be introduced in the Act on support to religious communities, setting out that entitlement to support must be revoked if the religious community no longer fulfils the criteria for support. The provision must apply to both the government grant and help from the state in collecting fees. If the religious community temporarily fails to meet any of the formal entitlement criteria, for example if it does not serve a sufficient number of people, the religious community may be given an opportunity to rectify the deficiency.</p>
<p>A religious community must repay organisational grants that the community has received without fulfilling the entitlement criteria as long as there are no particular grounds for concessions to be made.</p>
<p>So that the decision-making agency is able to reach a decision on questions of entitlement to support and recovery, the inquiry proposes that religious communities be entitled to support report such changes in circumstances that may result in failure to meet the entitlement criteria.</p>
<h2>Cases concerning entitlement to support are to be resolved by the Swedish Agency for Support to Faith Communities</h2>
<p>The inquiry considers that the system currently in place whereby the Government reviews cases concerning entitlement to support is inappropriate for several reasons and instead the right of decision should be delegated to government agency level. The first point is that such cases cannot be considered to be of such importance in principle or of such particular importance as to demand review by the Government. The inquiry has also proposed amendments to the material rules concerning the criteria for entitlement to support. The proposals make the conditions more specific and review will mainly involve applying legal rules. This minimises the scope for weighing up appropriateness or other more political assessments. Delegating review to government agency level furthermore affords the religious communities protection against politically motivated decisions, while the decisions made may be subjected to complete review in a public administrative court.</p>
<p>The inquiry considers that there is value in all the cases concerning state support to religious communities being gathered under one agency and therefore proposes that the Agency for Support to Faith Communities make decisions on entitlement to support and on allocating and recovering government grants. The Agency is the State’s expert agency on religious community issues and has indepth insight into and knowledge of the circumstances in which religious communities operate.</p>
<p>Decisions on entitlement to support can be highly sensitive and in some cases are also complex decisions to reach. The inquiry therefore considers that such decisions should be reached collectively by a special decision-making body within the Agency. The decision-making body is to be named the Council for Decisions on Entitlement to Support, and its members are to be appointed by the Government.</p>
