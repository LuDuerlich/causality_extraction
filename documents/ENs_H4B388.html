<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The assignment</h2>
<p>On 25 June 2015, the Government set terms of reference for a review of equipment and logistics provision to the Swedish Armed</p>
<p>Forces. The Government’s terms of reference are clear and leave little room for misinterpretation. The terms of reference have two main tracks.</p>
<p>Firstly , the Inquiry is to submit proposals on how the Swedish Armed Forces are to be able to control and follow up the logistics services required to meet the demands for increased operational capabilities of military units. The Swedish Armed Forces must have the ability to take overall and clear responsibility vis-à-vis the Government for the status of military units.</p>
<p>Secondly , the Inquiry is to submit proposals to remedy the failings identified by the Swedish Agency for Public Management and the Swedish National Financial Management Authority concerning operational and financial management within the area of logistics and equipment provision.</p>
<h2>Considerations</h2>
<p>The Inquiry is strictly limited to its terms of reference. The Swedish Armed Forces and the Defence Materiel Administration should continue as two agencies under the Government – each with their own tasks and responsibilities.</p>
<p>The Inquiry differentiates between logistics provision  for the</p>
<p>Swedish Armed Forces’ military units and equipment provision , that is investments in new equipment or improved capabilities. These have two separate purposes. They are two different processes and have different time perspectives.</p>
<p>The Riksdag’s and the Government’s requirements in terms of increased availability and preparedness of military units and increased operational effectiveness of the Swedish Armed Forces are given high priority and weight, as a basis for the Inquiry’s proposals.</p>
<p>The Government has decided to introduce a new system for planning, decision-making and follow-up of investments by the Swedish Armed Forces in 2017. This system forms the basis of the inquiry’s considerations and proposals.</p>
<p>Logistics provision creates the conditions, within the framework of unit production, for conducting military unit training and exercises, not least military unit exercises which all units must carry out during their introductory period, for rapid response capability and for meeting the availability and preparedness demands of the Government.</p>
<p>Command of unit production, rapid response capability, activation, mobilisation and operational activities should be kept together with the command of logistics provision. Like other parts of the Swedish Armed Forces, logistics must be led in the same way, whether in times of peace, crisis or war. Perhaps sometimes conducted during a rapid and violent course of events.</p>
<p>The Swedish Agency for Public Management and the Swedish National Financial Management Authority have identified failings caused by the current system for operational and financial management in the Swedish Armed Forces and the Defence Materiel Administration.</p>
<p>The division of responsibilities between the agencies should be clarified to improve the Government’s ability to carry out control and exact accountability.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>Logistical resources within the Defence Materiel Administration which support units of the Swedish Armed Forces should be concentrated in the Swedish Armed Forces. This means that the Storage, Service and Workshops area of activities within the Defence Materiel Administration should be transferred to the Swedish Armed Forces. Resources to enable the Swedish Armed Forces to procure equipment and services for this logistics provision, and resources for operational control of the equipment, should also be transferred from the Defence Materiel Administration to the Swedish Armed Forces.</p>
<p>The Swedish Agency for Public Management and the Swedish National Financial Management Authority have pointed out that procurement expertise at the Swedish Armed Forces has been weakened and is inadequate as a result of the reorganisation of defence logistics which has taken place in recent years. The Inquiry shares this view. The Inquiry therefore proposes a rebalancing of this expertise from the Defence Materiel Administration to the Swedish Armed Forces so that Swedish Armed Forces procurement expertise of Defence Materiel Administration services is strengthened.</p>
<p>As is the case today, the Defence Materiel Administration – on behalf of the Swedish Armed Forces – will be responsible for the procurement of new defence equipment or its considerably increased capacity, and the testing and evaluation of such equipment before it is put to use by the Swedish Armed Forces.</p>
<p>The Defence Materiel Administration will also continue to support the Swedish Armed Forces in its procurement of equipment and services required to maintain the equipment that has been delivered to the Swedish Armed Forces.</p>
<p>An administrative appropriation should be created in the central government budget for the Defence Materiel Administration. The administrative appropriation should primarily finance activities that are not intended to support project work.</p>
<p>The Defence Materiel Administration should be given the right of disposal of appropriation 1:3 Acquisition of equipment and facilities , that is the investment appropriation.</p>
<p>The investment appropriation should be split into two sub-items. One sub-item would concern financing industry’s deliveries of equipment and services to the State. The other sub-item would concern financing the Defence Materiel Administration’s costs relating to studies, planning, procurement, delivery and decommissioning of defence equipment carried out on behalf of the Swedish Armed Forces.</p>
<h2>Impact of the proposals</h2>
<p>The Swedish Armed Forces will be able to fully control and follow up the logistics services. The proposals are fully compliant with the direction of the defence policy government bill, the Government’s policy direction decisions to the agencies and the inquiry terms of reference.</p>
<p>The failings observed by the Swedish National Financial Management Authority and the Swedish Agency for Public Management in operational and financial management within the current system for the equipment and logistics area will essentially be taken care of.</p>
<p>The Swedish Armed Forces will receive undivided and overall responsibility vis-à-vis the Government for the maintenance of the military units since all state defence logistics and responsibility for the maintenance of equipment will be concentrated in the Swedish Armed Forces. The chain of command will remain the same, whether in times of peace, crisis or war. Operational responsibility and financial responsibility go hand in hand.</p>
<p>The Swedish Armed Forces’ procurement expertise, in relation to the Defence Materiel Administration’s investments in industries that the Defence Materiel Administration is to procure, will be strengthened.</p>
<p>A transition to mainly appropriation financing of the Defence Materiel Administration will give the Government an opportunity to steer the agency.</p>
<p>The budget documentation for sub-item 1 in the investment appropriation will clearly identify the equipment and services expected to be delivered to the State during the current and following budget year – this is lacking today.</p>
<p>The budget documentation for sub-item 2 in the investment appropriation will clearly identify the Defence Materiel Administration’s project-related costs and thus it will be possible to assess their extent – this is lacking today.</p>
<p>The solution provides clarity on how appropriations are used. Follow-up will focus on deliveries of equipment and services rather than established appropriations. There will be a focus on delivery. Thus, there will be a direct connection between the Riksdag’s and the Government’s appropriation decisions and the equipment and services tied to the equipment delivered to the State – which is not the case today.</p>
<p>The Government will be able to meet the rationalisation requirement of the Defence Materiel Administration’s appropriation in connection with the price and salary recalculation of their appropriation – the Government cannot do this today.</p>
<p>The Defence Materiel Administration will receive undivided and overall responsibility vis-à-vis the Government. Operational responsibility and financial responsibility will go hand in hand.</p>
<p>The budget decision will affect deliveries – this is not the case today.</p>
<p>The investment appropriation will be debited when the State receives deliveries from industry and when the Defence Materiel Administration delivers services to the Swedish Armed Forces – there will be streamlined financial flows.</p>
<p>The authorisation report will show the State’s financial commitments and future appropriation needs – this will be in accordance with the Budget Act.</p>
<p>The division of responsibilities between the agencies will be clarified, which will improve the Government’s ability to carry out control and exact accountability.</p>
<p>Financial management will be strengthened. Both agencies will receive an important assignment with a strong link to the central government budget process.</p>
<p>The new planning, decision-making and follow-up process introduced in 2017 will be stabilised and formalised. The Swedish Armed Forces will gain control over client orders to the Defence Materiel Administration, and the follow-up of orders placed. The Government will gain increased control over the implementation of the project. Several decision gateways will be introduced during the course of the project, which will enable the Government to influence shifting demands in relation to finances or capability.</p>
<h2>Implementation of the Government’s decisions</h2>
<p>The Government should appoint a management group with representation from the Government Offices, the Swedish Armed Forces and the Defence Materiel Administration to coordinate work to</p>
<p>implement the changes decided by the Government. When the Government has made its decision in response to the Inquiry, a number of borderline case decisions will likely remain to be taken. It is essential that these are taken promptly so that implementation is not delayed. It must not lead to a protracted negotiation process between the agencies. The management group has an important task to facilitate fast decision-making within the agencies. Coordination is the result of collaboration. The group will not take over any new agency decisions. If consensus cannot be reached, the issues should be referred to the Government for a decision.</p>
<p>The Government should continuously monitor how the agencies implement the Government’s decisions in response to the Inquiry’s proposals. The Government can engage an independent party for this task. An evaluation should be conducted five years after implementation at the latest to examine whether the purpose of the new system has been served.</p>
