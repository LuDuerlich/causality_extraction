<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>The three parts of the remit</h2>
<p>The inquiry's remit can be divided into three parts. The first part concerns the removal of the words “race” and “racial” from the legislation. The second concerns amendments to the term “transgender identity or expression” and the definition of that term in the Discrimination Act. The third concerns the issue of stronger legal protection for transgender persons under criminal law.</p>
<p>This remit is set out in the inquiry's terms of reference, which were adopted on 31 July 2014 (Dir. 2014:115), see appendix.</p>
<h2>Removing the terms “race” and “racial” from Swedish law The remit</h2>
<p>The inquiry's remit has been to consider whether the words “race” and “racial”, as used when referring to people, should be removed from legislation in which they occur and possibly be replaced by some other expression.</p>
<p>According to the terms of reference, the background to this review is mainly that there is no scientific basis for dividing human beings into separate races and consequently, from a biological point of view, there is also no basis for using the word “race” when referring to people. According to the terms of reference, use of the word “race” in statutes risks stirring up prejudice.</p>
<p>Some points of departure and boundaries for this part of the remit are set out in Section 2.</p>
<h2>The Penal Code and the Freedom of the Press Act</h2>
<p>The provisions concerning agitation against a national or ethnic group in the Penal Code (BrB) and the Freedom of the Press Act (TF) – the provision concerning unlawful discrimination in Chapter 16, Section 9 of BrB; the prosecution rule for the crime of insulting behaviour in Chapter 5, Section 5 of BrB and the rule concerning increasing the severity of the punishment in Chapter 29, Section 2, point 7 of BrB – contain the word “race”, together with the expressions “skin colour”, “national or ethnic origin” and “religious belief”. The inquiry presumes that “race” has the same meaning in all these provisions.</p>
<p>The word was originally introduced into the provisions concerning agitation against a national or ethnic group and the provision concerning unlawful discrimination in order to fulfil the requirements of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</p>
<p>According to the legislative history, the term “race” refers to such groups of the human species as were formerly included in anthropological racial classifications. However, the inquiry believes it may be the case that the term has a broader meaning. If the word “race” were to be removed without being replaced by some other expression, there is a risk of some groups losing their protection under criminal law. It is also important that the provisions continue to capture cases in which perpetrators expressly justify their reprehensible behaviour by referring to race or racial ideologies.</p>
<p>The inquiry thus makes the assessment that there is a considerable risk that the scope of the provisions will be restricted if the term “race” is removed without being replaced by another expression. Accordingly, no such removal should take place. Another reason for this is the criticism expressed – in legislative cases, internationally and within the inquiry's own reference group – to the effect that removal might involve a risk that the legislator does not explicitly address the racism problems that actually exist.</p>
<p>According to the inquiry, it would be appropriate for the penal provisions to replace the word “race” with the expression “conception of race”. This expression satisfies the arguments put forward in support of removal. It satisfies the legislator's need to disavow the word “race” in the sense in which it has been used in legislation in the past. The legislator instead focuses on what is punishable, namely the notions that constitute the perpetrator's reason for insulting others. Accordingly, this means that the legislation does not conceal the problem of racism; on the contrary it is highlighted.</p>
<p>These amendments are not intended to involve any change to the scope of the provisions.</p>
<h2>The Act on Criminal Responsibility for Genocide, Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes (2014:406) and the Aliens Act (2005:716)</h2>
<p>The Act on Criminal Responsibility for Genocide, Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes contains the word “racial” in its penal provisions concerning genocide and crimes against humanity. The Aliens Act contains the word “race” in the provision that indicates which persons are to be considered refugees.</p>
<p>Both of these acts are based on international undertakings. For reasons including the risk that the protection in these provisions would be weakened if the words were to be removed without being replaced by another expression, the inquiry has made the assessment that no such removal should take place. Instead, the inquiry proposes a solution similar to that in BrB and TF, which is based on the expression ”conception of race”. This would appear to be the most appropriate option if the aim is to ensure that the provisions comply with the underlying international undertakings. At the same time, this underscores the legislator's disavowal of the biological concept of race.</p>
<p>These amendments are not intended to involve any change to the scope of the provisions.</p>
<h2>The Act on International Cooperation in the Enforcement of Criminal Judgments (1972:260) and the Act on International Cooperation in Criminal Proceedings (1976:19)</h2>
<p>The Act on International Cooperation in the Enforcement of Criminal Judgments and the Act on International Cooperation in Criminal Proceedings contain provisions concerning the rejection of a request for enforcement of judgements or legal assistance, respectively, if the request has been occasioned with reference to “race”. These provisions are based on international conventions and exist to enable a state to reject a request in cases where compliance would contravene human rights.</p>
<p>With respect to these acts, the inquiry makes the assessment that it is appropriate to replace “race” with the expression “ethnicity” in the sense this expression has in the Discrimination Act. According to the inquiry, this does not encroach on the State's opportunity to refuse to cooperate if this were to contravene human rights.</p>
<p>These amendments are not intended to involve any change to the scope of the provisions.</p>
<h2>Registry statutes</h2>
<p>There are a number of acts containing provisions on the processing of sensitive personal data. These acts have been formulated in accordance with Article 8(1) of the Data Protection Directive and have the same wording with regard to the definition of the personal data that is sensitive in the respect now in question, namely data concerning a person's racial or ethnic origin. According to the main rule in Section 13 of the Personal Data Act (1998:204), it is prohibited to process personal data that discloses sensitive data of this kind. The other registry statutes contain provisions which are supplementary to or constitute exceptions to Section 13 of the Personal Data Act.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has assessed that the most appropriate solution is for the term “race” in these statutes to be replaced with “skin colour or any other similar circumstance attributable to the/an individual”. Data on “other similar circumstance” includes data that is based on conceptions of some capacity to divide people into races and data concerning hereditary physical characteristics associated with a particular geographical region or ethnic group, regardless of linguistic, cultural, national or religious factors. The term also appears in the Instrument of Government and in the Discrimination Act.</p>
<p>These amendments are not intended to involve any change to the scope of the provisions.</p>
<h2>The term “transgender identity or expression” and its definition in the Discrimination Act</h2>
<h2>The remit</h2>
<p>This part of the remit has been to consider whether there is a need to amend the term “transgender identity or expression” and the definition of this term in the Discrimination Act (2008:567) and other statutes in which the term appears.</p>
<h2>The term “transgender identity or expression” can be criticised</h2>
<p>The term “transgender identity or expression” is found in the Discrimination Act, the Act concerning the Equality Ombudsman (2008:568), the Education Act (2010:800), the Agency Work Act (2012:854) and in seven ordinances. “Transgender identity or expression” was introduced as a new ground for discrimination in the Discrimination Act in 2009. The definition of the term in Chapter 1, Section 5 of the Discrimination Act is “that someone does not identify herself or himself as a woman or a man or expresses by their manner of dressing or in some other way that they belong to another sex”.</p>
<p>This ground for discrimination has in view those people who are sometimes called transgender persons. The term transgender persons refers here to people whose gender identity or gender expression always or sometimes differs/has differed from a norm for the gender assigned to them at birth. The term “transgender identity or expression” has the same meaning in all the acts in which it occurs.</p>
<p>The term has met criticism since its introduction. This criticism has mainly involved the view that the chosen wording is written from the perspective that this is a divergence, i.e. that it assumes an understanding of a norm and singles out those who do not adhere to it. Furthermore, it is the inquiry's opinion that both the term itself and its legal definition are ambiguous and misleading. The term and its definition might lead to unnecessary problems in terms of where to draw the line and to misconceptions concerning the scope of the protection.</p>
<p>Irrespective of the fact that the legal history to some extent clarifies what is meant by the ground for discrimination “transgender identity or expression”, the inquiry believes that there are good reasons to amend both the ground for discrimination and its definition.</p>
<h2>The term “gender identity or gender expression” should be chosen instead</h2>
<p>The term and its definition should be amended in such a way as to abandon singling out transgender persons as being divergent, while taking into consideration the mentioned ambiguities and criticism.</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the ground for discrimination “transgender identity or expression” in the Discrimination Act and other acts be replaced with “gender identity or gender expression”. In addition, it is proposed that the ground “gender identity or gender expression” in the Discrimination Act be defined as a person's identity or expression in the form of clothing, body language, behaviour or other similar circumstance that relates to gender.</p>
<p>The proposed wording of this ground for discrimination is closer to how the ground is usually described in international documents. These often use the expression “gender identity”, sometimes in combination with “gender expression”.</p>
<p>In principle, this amendment means that all individuals will be protected from discrimination on the basis of gender identity or gender expression, regardless of how that gender identity or gender expression relates to the norms for the gender assigned to them. This means that this ground for discrimination will also include “cisgender people” (essentially people who have a gender identity or a gender expression that is and always has been consistent with the norms for the gender they were originally assigned) when such people are discriminated against on the basis of their gender identity or gender expression. This amendment thus involves a formal expansion of the scope of this ground for discrimination. However, it is hard to believe that this expansion could have any major practical significance.</p>
<p>As a result of this assessment, the inquiry proposes that the corresponding amendment should also be made to the other acts and ordinances in which the term “transgender identity or expression” occurs. Exceptions should be made only for two ordinances. One of these contains provisions concerning the Ministry of Culture's responsibility for matters concerning the situation of homosexual, bisexual and transsexual people and people with a transgender identity. The second ordinance contains provisions concerning central government grants to certain organisations. For these ordinances, the inquiry proposes that “transgender identity or expression” be replaced with the term “transgender persons” together with an explanation of what is meant by “transgender persons” in each ordinance.</p>
<h2>Greater protection for transgender persons through the criminal law</h2>
<p>The inquiry's remit has been to consider whether transgender persons should belong to the groups covered by the provisions concerning agitation against a national or ethnic group in Chapter 16, Section 8 of the Penal Code (BrB), the Freedom of the Press Act (TF) and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression (YGL), the provision concerning unlawful discrimination in Chapter 16, Section 9 of BrB and the prosecution rule for the crime of insulting behaviour in Chapter 5, Section 5 of BrB. Furthermore, the inquiry had to consider whether any amendments to the aforementioned provisions, for example with respect to the interest in having technically consistent legal solutions, should result in any amendment to the rule of increasing the severity of the penalty in Chapter 29, Section 2, point 7 of BrB. The rule concerning increasing the severity of the punishment differs from that of the other provisions mentioned in that it already covers transgender persons.</p>
<p>According to the terms of reference, there is reason to consider whether the protection provided to transgender persons though criminal law should be strengthened. The terms of reference state that there may be a practical need for legislation targeting agitation against transgender persons as a group. Furthermore, international developments in this area point favour stronger protection.</p>
<h2>The provisions concerning agitation against a national or ethnic group</h2>
<p>At present, it is not a punishable offence to threaten or express contempt for transgender persons as a group. However, there are a number of provisions in the Penal Code concerning offences that may also constitute violations of freedom of the press and freedom of expression, granting transgender persons some protection against threatening or offensive statements such as provisions on insulting behaviour, defamation, unlawful threat and inciting rebellion. These provisions provide transgender persons with some protection against threatening and offensive statements, but do not provide protection against agitative propaganda directed towards transgender persons as a collectively defined group.</p>
<p>Transgender persons are very vulnerable. Among other sources, reports published by the Public Health Agency of Sweden show that transgender persons are subject to discrimination, violence, threats and other offensive treatment to a much higher degree than the rest of the population, precisely because they are transgender persons. Furthermore, these reports demonstrate that the health, particularly mental health, of transgender persons is much poorer than that of the rest of the population. This is probably explained by their vulnerable situation.</p>
<p>As regards agitation against transgender persons as a group specifically, there is no reliable information on how common this is. Since agitation against transgender persons is not a punishable offence at present, there are no official crime statistics in this area. Over the course of the inquiry, however, evidence has emerged for the existence of agitation against transgender persons, mainly in the form of agitation on the internet. Comments in various “threads” contain a number of examples of statements to the effect that LGBT people in general and transgender persons in particular are unnatural, immoral, sick and perverted. In some cases, these statements could constitute agitation.</p>
<p>That there is no evidence to support the position that agitation against transgender persons is an extensive problem is not of decisive importance. Transgender persons are such a vulnerable group that there is reason to grant them specific protection, even from offences that occur more infrequently. In addition, there is reason to fear that agitative propaganda of this kind may become more common as transgender persons become increasingly visible in society.</p>
<p>There is also the fact that knowledge about transgender persons is generally low. Many people are unclear on the difference between gender identity or gender expression on the one hand and sexual orientation on the other. Agitation against transgender persons is part of and intermingled with agitation against LGBT people in general and with miscellaneous questions about sexual orientation. It can be assumed that the offender is rarely clear about the ground(s) on which they are agitating, other than that this agitation is directed towards what is, in the offender's personal philosophy, “abnormal”. Consequently, unless not only homosexual and bisexual people, but also transgender persons are covered by the agitation provisions, the provisions will not constitute adequate protection for any of these groups.</p>
<p>International developments also indicate the time it right to criminalise agitation against transgender persons. In recent years, the rights of transgender persons have begun to be highlighted in international contexts. An example of this is the 2010 recommendation by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe for protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity that specifies rights for LGBT people. Appendix I B, which concerns “hate speech”, states that member states should take appropriate measures to combat all forms of expression, including in the media and on the Internet, which may be reasonably understood as likely to produce the effect of inciting, spreading or promoting hatred or other forms of discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons.</p>
<p>Against this background, the inquiry believes it is necessary to criminalise agitation against transgender persons as a group.</p>
<p>As previously established by the legislator and the European Court of Human Rights, the interest of protecting vulnerable groups against threats and other expressions of contempt constitutes a purpose for which it is permissible to restrict freedom of expression in accordance with both the Instrument of Government and the European Convention on Human Rights. For this reason, the conditions are also in place for the criminalisation of agitation against transgender persons within the scope of both the Freedom of the Press Act and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression, provided that a need for such criminalisation can be established. According to the inquiry, this need also manifests itself in the legal area encompassing freedom of the press and freedom of expression. The evidence that the inquiry has been able to find for the actual existence of agitative propaganda against transgender persons as a group concerns statements on the internet. These statements may fall within the areas protected by the fundamental laws. If a provision on agitation against transgender persons is to be effective, it must therefore also be present in the Freedom of the Press Act's catalogue of offences.</p>
<p>The inquiry proposes that criminalisation take place through an expansion of the Penal Code's provision on agitation against a national or ethnic group so that it also encompasses threats and expressions of contempt for a national or ethnic group or other such group of people with allusion to gender identity or gender expression. The corresponding amendment is proposed in the Freedom of the Press Act's catalogue of offences. The expression “gender identity or gender expression” satisfies the desire that transgender persons should not be singled out as a divergent group. Moreover, the use of this expression means that the basis on which the agitation if founded is formulated in accordance with how the agitation provision is otherwise worded. This wording is also consistent with the protection against discrimination in the Instrument of Government and in the civil discrimination legislation on the whole.</p>
<p>This expression has a view not just to transgender persons, but to all people regardless of how their gender identity or gender expression relates to a norm.</p>
<h2>Unlawful discrimination</h2>
<p>There is evidence that transgender persons require protection from such discrimination as is covered by the provision on unlawful discrimination in Chapter 16, Section 9 of the Penal Code. In 2009– 2014, the Equality Ombudsman received around ten complaints concerning incidents at work where the ground for discrimination was transgender identity or expression. Outside working life, the Equality Ombudsman received around eighty cases in the same period, most of which related to healthcare and to access to goods and services. Furthermore, reports published by the Public Health Agency of Sweden show that a significant proportion of transgender persons consider themselves to have been subject to discrimination and refrain from activities for fear of discrimination.</p>
<p>Accordingly, there is also a need for protection against discrimination within the areas regulated under criminal law. International developments also point in the same direction. The inquiry therefore proposes that the provision concerning unlawful discrimination be expanded to also include discrimination against transgender persons.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the assessment with respect to the wording of the crime of agitation against a national or ethnic group, the inquiry proposes that the provision concerning unlawful discrimination be expanded to cover unlawful discrimination on the basis of gender identity or gender expression in general, which means the legislation protects all people equally.</p>
<h2>The prosecution rule with respect to insulting behaviour</h2>
<p>It is not uncommon for individual transgender persons to be exposed to harassment due to their being perceived as having a gender identity or gender expression that diverges from a norm. Reports published by the Public Health Agency of Sweden show that it is much more common for transgender persons to be subject to harassment and other offensive treatment than the population in general. Such harassment might, for example, consist of insulting behaviour. Unlike unlawful threat and molestation, for example, insulting behaviour on the basis that someone is a transgender person is not subject to public prosecution. The latest hate crime reports from the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention demonstrate the existence of defamation offences with transphobic motives, even though the number of identified complaints with such motives is not particularly high. However, there are good grounds to assume that a large number of cases go unreported.</p>
<p>It is important that society takes exception to various kinds of prejudiced behaviour targeting transgender persons. Responsibility for condemning these types of offensive behaviour should not rest entirely with the individual. Given that it has emerged that transgender persons are generally reluctant to even report crimes they are victims of, the inquiry finds it obvious that transgender persons who are subject to a defamatory offence such as insulting behaviour may need the support that a prosecutor taking on their case entails. Without such support, there is a risk that the provision concerning insulting behaviour loses a significant portion of its protective effect for transgender persons in practice.</p>
<p>According to the inquiry, it should therefore be possible for insulting behaviour towards transgender persons to be subject to public prosecution. As a consequence of the assessment with respect to the wording of the crime of agitation against a national or ethnic group, the expansion should encompass gender identity and gender expression in general; that is to say, even in cases where this identity or expression does not diverge from a norm. The inquiry therefore proposes that the rule of prosecution in Chapter 5, Section 5, point 2 of the Penal Code be expanded to cover insulting behaviour with allusion to gender identity or gender expression.</p>
<h2>Other expansions of the provision concerning unlawful discrimination and the prosecution rule for insulting behaviour</h2>
<p>The inquiry proposes that the provision concerning unlawful discrimination and the prosecution rule for insulting behaviour be expanded to cover cases involving erroneous assumptions and offences on the grounds that, or with allusion to the fact that, someone other  than the injured party belongs to one of the protected groups.</p>
<h2>Cases involving erroneous assumptions</h2>
<p>The provision concerning unlawful discrimination and the prosecution rule for insulting behaviour do not at present cover cases where an offender discriminates or insults someone on the basis of an erroneous assumption about, e.g. the person's skin colour.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of ignorance concerning the difference between sexual orientation on the one hand and gender identity or gender expression on the other. The consequences of this include transgender persons falling victim to crimes because offenders perceive them to be homosexual. If such offensive behaviour against transgender persons, motivated by assumptions about their sexual orientation, were not covered by the provisions, the intended protection for transgender persons could, in practice, lose some of its effectiveness. Essential to marking the boundaries of the criminalised area and to what is subject to public prosecution should, in all likelihood, be the culpable motive upon which the discrimination or culpable expression in the insulting behaviour is based, regardless of whether the offender is accurate in their assumptions. The law enforcement authorities should also not need to investigate which sexual orientation or gender identity the victim actually has.</p>
<p>Against this background, the provisions should be expanded to cover cases involving erroneous assumptions, at least with regard to sexual orientation and gender identity or gender expression.</p>
<p>However, it is the inquiry's understanding that there is no reason to treat the different grounds in the provisions differently and thereby make the scope of some grounds greater than that of others. Accordingly, the inquiry proposes that cases in which the offender has made an erroneous assumption with respect to any of the protected grounds be covered without exception by the protection of the provisions. This is accomplished by the words “his or her” being removed from the provisions.</p>
<h2>Unlawful discrimination and insulting behaviour on the basis that someone other than the injured party belongs to one of the protected groups</h2>
<p>It is also the case that the provision concerning unlawful discrimination and the prosecution rule for insulting behaviour do not at present cover discrimination on the basis of, and insulting behaviour with allusion to, a person other than the injured party belonging to one of the protected groups.</p>
<p>However, the inquiry believes it is unjustified to differentiate depending on whether the motive for the discrimination or insulting behaviour lies in the gender identity or gender expression of the person against whom the act is directed or that of, for example, a relative of that person. The provisions should therefore be expanded to include discrimination and insulting behaviour on the ground that another person belongs to one of the protected groups. The inquiry believes that there is no reason to treat the different grounds differently and thereby make the scope for some grounds greater than that of others. The inquiry therefore proposes that the scope of such an expansion of the provision concerning unlawful discrimination and of the prosecution rule shall refer to all the protected grounds listed in the provisions. This too is accomplished by the words “his or her” being removed from the provisions.</p>
<h2>The rule concerning increasing the severity of the punishment</h2>
<p>For the purposes of clarity, and as a consequence of the proposed amendments to Chapter 16, Sections 8 and 9 of BrB and Chapter 5, Section 5 of BrB, the inquiry proposes that the rule concerning increasing the severity of the punishment in Chapter 29, Section 2, point 7 of BrB expressly state that it is an aggravating circumstance if a motive for the crime was to insult a person or a group of people on the basis of their gender identity or gender expression.</p>
<h2>Entry into force</h2>
<p>On account of the rules applicable to the amendment of a funda- mental law, the amendments to the Freedom of the Press Act's provision on agitation against a national or ethnic group can enter into force no earlier than 1 January 2019. The amendments to BrB's corresponding provision should enter into force at the same time. As for the other proposed amendments, it should be possible for these to enter into force on 1 July 2017.</p>
