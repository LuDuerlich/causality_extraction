<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Values-based not-for-profit organisations have several important roles in society. Getting engaged in an organisation gives individuals meaning, a sense of community and a force for their own liberation. People who would otherwise have had difficulty being heard are given a collective voice. Civil society contributes perspectives different to those held by public authorities and private companies. Engagement can also contribute to greater social cohesion, and voluntary and community organisations are an important schooling in democracy.</p>
<p>Moreover, values-based organisations of various kinds have long played an important role in welfare service provision. Many of the welfare state’s institutions have their roots in activities once developed by voluntary associations or faith communities. Values-based organisations have been pioneers of what is now core welfare services, at the same time as they have continued to identify, articulate and meet needs neither public nor commercial actors have been able to pick up. This makes values-based actors important innovators in welfare service provision.</p>
<p>Values-based organisations are often strongly anchored, and enjoy great confidence, among the people who need the welfare services they provide, and include individuals with their own experience of e.g. substance misuse, homelessness, long-term unemployment and disabilities. Often these are groups that are harder for the public institutions to reach. Local roots, in a community or a housing area, are another distinctive feature of values-based actors, and this can be particularly important in places where both public and commercial services have disappeared.</p>
<p>Values-based actors contribute to diversity and to freedom of choice for users in ways that include providing adapted or niche services.</p>
<p>Compared with most other countries in the Nordic region and across Europe, values-based not-for-profit actors account for a small share of the welfare services sector in Sweden. Moreover, the increase in recent decades in the share of welfare services delivered by external suppliers is mainly due to provision by commercial actors, while the values-based share has remained low. At the same time, it is not necessarily the case that increased participation by valuesbased actors in welfare service provision would have to be at the expense of commercial actors. It could instead involve activities otherwise produced in-house by public actors or completely new types of services, initiatives or solutions not available from either public or commercial actors.</p>
<p>One feature shared by all of the Inquiry’s proposals is that they increase the possibilities for values-based actors to participate in the delivery of publicly funded welfare services and for municipalities and central government agencies to benefit from the skills, experience and other resources of values-based actors. Another common feature is that everything is voluntary. Values-based actors decide by themselves if they want to register as values-based actors in welfare service provision and if they want to take part in a values-based public partnership, a procurement or a free choice system. In the same way as municipalities, regions and central government agencies are free to choose whether they want to use the instruments proposed by the Inquiry.</p>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has had the remit of drafting a proposal of a clear definetion of ‘values-based actors’ that can be used to identify them and distinguish them from other actors in welfare activities and closelyrelated publicly financed and subsidised activities. The purpose of this definition has been to draft proposals that promote greater valuesbased participation in welfare service provision. Therefore the Inquiry has also had the remit of developing examples and describing potential areas of application in welfare service provision where a definition of values-based actors can be used. In order to promote collaboration between values-based actors and public institutions, the remit of the Inquiry has also covered proposing guidelines, criteria or applicable instruments for entering into values-based public partnerships. Our remit has also included mapping and analysing how non-economic services of general interest are regulated in other EEA countries. The remit has not included presenting proposals in the area of taxation.</p>
<h2>The concepts of welfare service provision and welfare activities</h2>
<p>Unlike regarding previous inquiries with closely related remits, the Inquiry’s terms of reference do not identify any specific areas or activities. So, the Inquiry has been relatively free to define what to include in the concept of ‘welfare service provision’ in this context. There is no generally accepted definition of the concept.</p>
<p>The starting point for the Inquiry’s definition of the scope of welfare service provision has been the Inquiry’s remit. The activities that are of interest are those that are included in a broader use of the concept, that are covered by some form of public funding and that are conducted by values-based actors who receive such funding. In the view of the Inquiry, the concept of ‘welfare activities’ means, in this context:</p>
<p>• health care;</p>
<p>• health promotion activities;</p>
<p>• education regulated by the Education Act, education and adult education delivered by folk high schools and study associations and other education and training whose organiser is a municipality, region or central government agency;</p>
<p>• activities in the labour market area; and</p>
<p>• activities intended to increase people’s integration and inclusion in society and to combat segregation and isolation.</p>
<h2>How the values-based sector or its equivalent is organised in other EEA countries</h2>
<p>The Inquiry has looked at a number of countries judged to be of particular interest.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s review shows that there are great cross-country variations regarding both forms of funding and what share of welfare service provision is conducted by values-based actors or their equivalent. There are several reasons for this great variation. Part of the explanation is to be found in how welfare systems are designed and how they have evolved. It is common to have special rules for nonprofit organisations in the countries we have examined. Several, but not all, countries have a definition of non-profit organisations or their equivalent. Definitions when given are often found in tax legislation, and the special rules usually consist of special tax rules. In two of the countries examined, Norway and Italy, legislative procedures are in progress in order to increase the activities of nonprofit organisations or to make it easier for them to conduct activities. In Norway the procedure concerns a provision in procurement legislation. In Italy it involves a law about the whole of the non-profit sector that also includes various kinds of forms of collaboration. In Norway the provision is still at the level of a proposal. In Italy the law has been adopted but has not yet begun to be applied.</p>
<h2>A definition of values-based actors in public funded welfare activities</h2>
<p>The definition that the Inquiry has had the remit of drafting is to be long-term, sustainable and monitorable. To achieve its purpose, the definition also needs to be predictable and easy to apply. In the view of the Inquiry, this is ensured through a legal definition in a law and a registration procedure to distinguish  values-based actors from other actors. A procedure like that also means that there will be a consistent assessment of which actors fulfil the definition. In addition, the administrative burden will be smaller for municipalities and regions and for central government agencies that would otherwise need to check compliance with the requirements in each specific case. The same applies to values-based actors. It will also be possible to produce statistics about values-based actors if they are simple to identify and follow over time.</p>
<p>One important restriction is that the definition is to apply to values-based actors conducting publicly funded activities in welfare service provision. The definition is not intended to be a general definition of values-based organisations or activities, and is only aimed at organisations in their capacity of actors in publicly funded welfare activities. Values-based welfare activities that are not publicly funded are not affected.</p>
<p>Values-based actors currently conduct activities in several different legal forms. In the view of the Inquiry, it would be inappropriate to design the definition in a way that forces existing values-based actors in welfare service provision to change their legal form in order to meet the definition. The purpose of the definition is not to exclude any values-based actors but to differentiate them from public and commercial actors.</p>
<p>The definition and procedure must also be designed so as to minimise the risks of misuse. The Inquiry’s proposal is that in order to be classified as a values-based actor in publicly funded welfare activities an organisation has to be legal person that: 1. is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the State, a municipality or a region; 2. has a purpose that is altruistic; 3. conducts or intends to conduct publicly funded welfare activities; and 4. does not make any value transfers to parties other than registered  values-based actors or to scientific research.</p>
<p>Registration</p>
<p>The values-based actors that meet the requirements in the definition should be able to register in a special register. Registering as a valuesbased actor in publicly funded welfare activities should be voluntary. However, the actors that have registered should have to meet the legal requirements while in? the register. In addition, the provision about restrictions of value transfers in the fourth point of the definetion should continue to apply for five years after deregistration.</p>
<p>It should be possible to impose a fine a person who breaches the rules on value transfers either intentionally or through negligence.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the Government should decide which authority will be responsible for the register. However, the Inquiry’s assessment is that the county administrative boards, which are currently supervisory and registration authorities for foundations, should also be responsible for the register of values-based actors in welfare service provision.</p>
<h2>Values-based public partnerships</h2>
<p>Values-based public partnerships are a form of collaboration between public and values-based actors. They are based on the insight that several perspectives and several different types of resources may be needed to solve certain problems, especially more complex ones.</p>
<p>On the basis of an analysis of the purpose of these partnerships and the requirements imposed by EU law, the Inquiry has concluded that a values-based public partnership in publicly funded welfare activities can be summarised in the following way: 1. The partnership is a cooperation between one or more public actors and one or more  values-based actors in welfare service provision. 2. Its purpose it to achieve a common public benefit objective. 3. Both the public actor and the  values-based actor contribute resources.</p>
<p>The partnership must not contain an award of a public contract, a procurement of a concession or a framework agreement.</p>
<p>The partnership must be consistent with the EU’s State aid rules. The Inquiry describes several different possibilities available concerning the application of State aid rules to values-based public partnerships. If the public actor is a municipality or region, there are also provisions in the Local Government Act and special legislation to take into account.</p>
<p>A guide</p>
<p>On the basis of the above criteria, the Inquiry has produced a special guide, containing concrete examples, that describes various alternative ways of being able to enter into a values-based public partnership that are consistent with the applicable regulatory frameworks such as the Local Government Act, procurement legislation and the State aid rules.</p>
<p>A commission to the National Agency for Public Procurement</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes giving the National Agency for Public Procurement a commission to work on information measures in relation to public and values-based actors on the basis of the criteria proposed by the Inquiry. We also propose that the National Agency for Public Procurement should manage and develop the Inquiry’s guide on the basis of case law and practical experience.</p>
<h2>Proposals concerning public procurement</h2>
<p>A commission to the National Agency for Public Procurement</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s assessment, there are possibilities, within the framework of current procurement legislation, of making better use of the added value that can be contributed by values-based organisations. Part of the role of the National Agency for Public Procurement is to make it easier for values-based organisations to participate in procurement. However, the Inquiry notes that the support and guides produced up to now do not have any focus on values-based organisations. The Inquiry therefore proposes giving the Agency a special mission to work on targeted information measures in relation to values-based actors and contracting authorities, so as to increase the participation of values-based actors in procurements. Under this proposal, the mission would be carried out in collaboration with relevant actors, such as representatives of contracting authorities and the values-based sector.</p>
<p>Possibility of reserving contracts for values-based actors</p>
<p>The Inquiry makes the assessment that there is legal scope that makes it possible to reserve contracts for values-based actors for social and other specific services, i.e. services covered by the Light Touch Regime in the Public Procurement Directive that applies to the classic sector and, as regards Sweden, Chapter 19 of the Public Procurement Act. According to the Inquiry, the main support for this assessment is to be found in the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.</p>
<p>Under this proposal, contracting authorities would be given the possibility of reserving the right to participate in a procurement of the welfare services enumerated in Schedule 2 a of the Public Procurement Act to values-based actors. The services covered by that Schedule include health care, social services and closely related service as well as teaching and education services. The possibility of reserving the right to participate in procurements to values-based actors applies provided that this contributes to the realisation of the social objective and leads to budgetary efficiency. However, a wish on the part of the contracting authority to have a certain share of values-based actors is not, in itself, enough to justify reserving a procurement.</p>
<p>As the proposed possibility of a reservation is based on the special standing that social services have been given in the Public Procurement Directive, what is said there about taking account of the need to ensure the quality, continuity, accessibility, affordability, availability and comprehensiveness of the services, the specific needs of different categories of users, including disadvantaged and vulnerable groups is of importance. If a reservation for values-based actors contributes to the realisation of the social objective through higher fulfilment of any of the above, this indicates that the reservation is permitted.</p>
<p>Values-based actors can contribute to higher quality in several ways. If the altruistic purpose of the values-based actor has a link to the service concerned, this can be an indication that quality has been given a higher standing than other considerations when the service is performed. Quality can also be promoted by values-based actors working for a specific target group from a holistic perspective.</p>
<p>With regard to continuity, the fact that values-based actors have an altruistic purpose may make it more natural for them to look both to the needs of the target groups and to the long-term effects of the services they perform.</p>
<p>Many values-based actors have a close link to users of their service. This gives their activities a distinctive character, a special value compared with activities conducted by public actors in-house or by commercial actors.</p>
<p>According to the Court of Justice of the European Union, when there is no objective of distributing funds to owners, this may result in budgetary efficiency since any surplus will be reinvested in the activities and will therefore benefit the community and the users.</p>
<h2>Proposals concerning free choice systems</h2>
<p>In order to increase the participation of values-based actors as suppliers in free choice systems, the Inquiry proposes amending the Act on Free Choice Systems to state that the fundamental principles that follow from the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) shall not apply to free choice systems that do not have a definite cross-border interest.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes adding a provision to the Act to make it possible to reserve the right to apply to participate in a free choice system. However, special reasons should be required for this.</p>
<p>Values-based actors claim that in many current free choice systems it is difficult to communicate information about the distinctive character of values-based organisations to users. The Inquiry’s assessment is that, when informing individuals about suppliers in a free choice system, it is possible and also appropriate to provide the information that a supplier is a registered values-based actor.</p>
<h2>Other areas where the definition could be used</h2>
<p>When there is a clear definition of values-based actors in publicly funded welfare activities, this definition can also be used in the award of grants both by central government and by municipalities and regions when considered appropriate.</p>
<p>The definition will also provide better possibilities of producing statistics about values-based actors. Statistics of this kind can be used for various types of comparisons between values-based actors and other actors, either public or commercial. They can, for example, be used to examine whether the rules have had the intended effects.</p>
<p>The definition may be given additional areas of use in the future. Once it is in place, it will be possible, if judged appropriate, to, for instance, adopt special rules for values-based actors.</p>
