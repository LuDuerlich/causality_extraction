<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Each year in Sweden a large number of people are subjected to threats and harassment. According to the National Council for Crime Prevention, more than 600 000 people between the ages of 18 and 79 have at some point been the victim of a stalker. For 105 000–165 000 people, this has happened in the past year.</p>
<p>Two thirds of victims were, in some way or another, acquainted with their stalker. Of these two thirds, approximately a quarter had – at the time or previously – been the stalker’s partner, and approximately one quarter were or had previously been in some other kind of personal relationship with the stalker. In other cases the stalker was, for example, a work colleague or someone with whom the victim had come into contact through their professional activities. One third of the victims stated that they were not acquainted with their stalker.</p>
<p>The National Council for Crime Prevention noted that the closer the relationship between victim and stalker, the more serious the harassment and the greater the risk of violence. Twenty-five per cent of all those who had been the victim of a stalker had also been subjected to violence.</p>
<p>The National Council for Crime Prevention also noted that every year in Sweden approximately 15 000 people are forced to move after having been subjected to harassment.</p>
<p>Almost a third of victims had reported the harassment to the police. One fifth of all reported cases led to some kind of penalty for the stalker. The most common charges filed were unlawful threats and assault.</p>
<p>There is currently no general legal provision that criminalises systematic harassment. However, individual acts can constitute crimes. It is also possible to impose a restraining order if there is a risk of one individual subjecting another individual to crime or harassment. It is a criminal offence to violate a restraining order.</p>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Stalking Inquiry was instructed to examine which protective measures are best suited to improving protection for people who are subjected to threats or harassment. The Inquiry was also given the task of considering whether there is a need for complementary financial support in certain cases where people are subjected to repeated, serious threats or other kinds of serious crime to such an extent that the way they live their lives is clearly affected.</p>
<p>The remit included analysing how the Restraining Orders Act is applied, proposing amendments that could result in the better and more appropriate use of restraining orders, and submitting proposals for a legal solution that allows restraining orders to be monitored electronically. The Stalking Inquiry was also instructed to review the provisions on the confidentiality of addresses etc. and protected personal data.</p>
<p>In addition, the Stalking Inquiry was given the task of analysing the application of penalty provisions in cases of repeated harassment and stalking, and to consider whether there needs to be greater protection in such situations.</p>
<h2>Considerations and proposals</h2>
<p>There is currently extensive work under way in Sweden connected to the issues that the Inquiry has dealt with. A number of the initiatives are described in the Government’s Action Plan to combat men’s violence against women, violence and oppression in the name of honour and violence in same-sex relations (Govt. Communication 2007/08:39). Several government agencies have implemented their own initiatives, for example on issues relating to protected personal data and the treatment of perpetrators.</p>
<p>By April 2007, eight countries in the European Union had adopted specific stalking prohibitions in their legislation. Although the rest of the EU countries lack special provisions on stalking, the act of stalking can still constitute a punishable crime under other rules – such as those governing unlawful threats, harassment or assault – as is the case in Sweden today. Of the 27 countries in the European Union, 26 have regulations on restraining orders.</p>
<p>It is our view that current efforts in Sweden are still not sufficient for overcoming the problem of stalking. Therefore, we are submitting proposals on how work to combat systematic harassment could be made more effective.</p>
<p>Three key areas</p>
<p>We consider there to be three key areas that should be dealt with if the problems concerning stalking are to be tackled in an effective manner. Firstly: efforts must be made to eliminate the threat of stalking – in other words, efforts directed specifically against the stalker. Secondly: in some cases, however, it can be impossible to deal with the actual act of harassment. Some stalkers can be regarded as so persistent that not even long custodial sentences are enough to solve the problem. In these cases, the victims will need protection. Thirdly: in many cases it is necessary to offer the victims support measures other than protection.</p>
<p>Criminalisation of stalking</p>
<p>There is currently no special legal provision on penalties for systematic harassment. The stalker can be sentenced for each act that constitutes a crime, but there is no basis for addressing his or her actions as a whole. Therefore, there is no basis for taking account of the fact that the act of systematically harassing another individual is a cause of great mental distress for the victim. We consider that there are strong arguments for treating acts that are already criminal from a different perspective if they are committed within a pattern of systematic harassment. We therefore propose the introduction of a new crime – unlawful harassment.</p>
<p>The various undesired actions that systematic harassment can cover are spread across a very wide spectrum. The new provision should, therefore, cover all punishable activities within the area it is intended to protect. However, we do not consider that the criminalised area as such should be extended. Harassment that is not considered to have reached the level of a crime should, instead, lead to a restraining order.</p>
<p>Under the new provision, those who commit criminal offences within the meaning of Chapter 3, Section 5; Chapter 4, Sections 4– 7; Chapter 5, Sections 1 and 3; Chapter 6, Section 10; Chapter 12, Section 1; Chapter 17, Sections 1–2 and 10 of the Swedish Penal Code, or within the meaning of Section 35, first paragraph of the Non-contact Orders Act (200x:xx) are to be convicted of unlawful harassment if any of these acts has been part of a repeated violation of the victim’s integrity.</p>
<p>It is proposed that the penalty in normal cases be a prison sentence of at most two years. For gross cases the penalty should be imprisonment for at least six months and at most four years. When assessing whether an act is to be considered gross, special attention should be given to whether violence or threats of serious violence have occurred, whether the harassment has been going on for a long time, or whether the acts can be considered particularly serious for any other reason.</p>
<p>New Non-contact Orders Act</p>
<p>In 2007 the number of applications for restraining orders amounted to 10 400. This means that the number of applications for restraining orders had almost doubled from 2000, when 5 700 applications were received. In 2007 approximately 42 per cent of restraining order applications were approved.</p>
<p>The follow-up assessments of the Restraining Orders Act (1988:688) carried out by the National Council for Crime Prevention suggest that there are major problems with restraining orders. It emerges from the follow-up assessments that the person the restraining order is intended to protect feels safer with the restraining order in place. In many cases, however, the fear of being subjected to crime remains.</p>
<p>According to available statistics, one third of restraining orders are breached. The National Council for Crime Prevention has criticised the police and prosecutors for their handling of restraining orders. There is a lack of adequate information for the person who is to be protected, risk assessments rarely appear to have been based on a balanced overall assessment, and restraining orders are seldom used to prevent new crimes.</p>
<p>In order to deal with these problems, I propose that the Restraining Orders Act be replaced by a new Non-contact Orders</p>
<p>Act. The new Act has a different structure from the current Act and is clearer with regard to the terms for issuing a non-contact order. A decision to impose a non-contact order must always be preceded by a proportionality assessment. The proportionality assessment should take into account the opposing interests that exist – in particular the protection and integrity aspects. Particular consideration should be given to the danger of violence or threats being used against the protected person.</p>
<p>It should be made easier to impose a non-contact order without the protected person having already been subjected to a crime, so that the non-contact order is better able to complement the proposal for a new penal provision for unlawful harassment. We are of the opinion that if clear requirements for proportionality are set out, the legal rights of individuals can be upheld even without a crime having been committed, which is what is required in practice today. It is now possible for adequate assessments to be made thanks to the structured threat and risk assessments that the Swedish Police Force has introduced.</p>
<p>Just as is the case under the Restraining Orders Act, it should be possible to combine a non-contact order with a clause prohibiting the presence of an individual in a specifically designated area. However, it should be possible for the forbidden area to be larger than is currently the case, and the clause is to be termed access ban. The scope of the access ban should be determined in accordance with the general proportionality assessment.</p>
<p>Similarly, it should be possible – as is currently the case – for a non-contact order to be combined with a clause prohibiting an individual from residing in a dwelling that is used jointly with the protected person. The conditions for issuing a clause concerning a joint dwelling should, however, be simplified.</p>
<p>As is the case today the prosecutor should, as a rule, decide whether a non-contact order is to be imposed. Under the current provision, a decision to impose a restraining order is open to examination by the district court, which must comprise one judge and three lay assessors. We consider that the district court should be able to make decisions concerning non-contact orders without a board of lay assessors, as this would both eliminate certain practical problems and speed up the judicial procedure. It should also be possible for the prosecutor, the injured party or the court itself to raise the issue of a non-contact order during the hearing of a criminal case.</p>
<p>We propose that the scale of penalties for breach of a non-contact order be raised and for the maximum penalty to be two years’ imprisonment. Minor breaches should also be made punishable offences.</p>
<p>We propose that the responsibility of the Police Service for matters concerning non-contact orders be clarified in the new Non-contact Orders Act – e.g. with regard to the monitoring of orders imposed.</p>
<p>The Injured Party Counsel Act (1988:609) should be made clearer by a provision stipulating that if an injured party counsel has been appointed for the protected person, it is this counsel’s task to appear for their client at court hearings concerning a noncontact order.</p>
<p>Details of non-contact orders should be removed from criminal records no later than five years following the decision, and not ten years as is currently the case.</p>
<p>Non-contact orders with electronic monitoring</p>
<p>The National Police Board has been instructed by the Government to carry out experiments with technical equipment in order to link up non-contact orders to a system of electronic monitoring. The purpose of this task was to determine which technical possibilities and limitations exist with regard to the monitoring of non-contact orders.</p>
<p>It has previously been found that technological developments were not so far advanced as to enable the electronic monitoring of an individual who has been given a non-contact order whilst upholding that individual’s legal rights. We consider that this is now possible, and that it is highly likely that the chances of introducing such a system will be even greater by the time provisions on this are able to enter into force.</p>
<p>Therefore, we propose the possibility of attaching electronic monitoring to a non-contact order with an access ban.</p>
<p>We propose that it should be possible to electronically monitor the individual who has been issued a non-contact order and to pinpoint his or her location so as to determine whether he or she enters the area covered by the non-contact order. This monitoring should be carried out by the Police Service, which can then warn the protected person if the order has been breached, take action against the individual under the order and secure evidence that a breach has occurred.</p>
<p>The protected person should be offered their own equipment to give an alarm if the individual under the order breaches the noncontact order and is approaching.</p>
<p>A decision on a clause attaching electronic monitoring to noncontact orders should be made by a court of law. However, we propose that the prosecutor be given the power to make an interim decision on electronic monitoring pending review by the court.</p>
<p>If an individual under a non-contact order intentionally, or through grave carelessness, prevents the electronic monitoring, he or she should be fined or sentenced to at most one year’s imprisonment.</p>
<p>Protection of personal data</p>
<p>In Sweden today there are currently 11 500 people whose personal data is protected in some form or another. This figure is rising by approximately 6 per cent each year.</p>
<p>There are currently four different protection levels. The first is the protection of personal data under the Secrecy Act, e.g. Chapter 7, Section 1a, and Chapter 7, Section 15. Under Chapter 7, Section 1a of the Secrecy Act, a government agency that is aware that a person is being harassed can refuse to release details of where that person lives. Secondly, the Swedish Tax Agency can decide to include a ‘security marking’ in the national population register. Thirdly, the Swedish Tax Agency can allow a person to remain registered at their old address when they move. Fourthly, and lastly, a person can be granted fictitious personal data by a court of law.</p>
<p>We consider that there are strong arguments, from a victim perspective, for the legal regulation of these forms of security marking, which are currently not regulated in legislation. This issue should be dealt with further within the framework of the Population Registration Inquiry (Fi 2007:11). Legal regulation would increase the chances of more consistent assessments in these cases. Legal regulation would also provide an opportunity to appeal decisions – both for those who have had their application for security marking rejected and those who have been informed that this protection is to be discontinued. It should also be possible for the parameters for the obligation of agencies to examine cases to be defined by law.</p>
<p>We also consider that when a decision is made to supply a person with fictitious personal data, it should not only be taken into account whether registration under past data will provide sufficient protection; an assessment should also take into account how long the threat is expected to last and whether there may be any other effects resulting from registration under past data that could cause problems for the individual. It should also be possible to supply a person with fictitious personal data if this appears to be more suitable than any other measure, in view of that person’s needs and personal circumstances in general.</p>
<p>Property designations and land leasehold designations are currently exempt from general secrecy protection under Chapter 7, Section 1a of the Secrecy Act. However, we do not consider that this exemption is necessary as anyone with a justified interest in finding out who owns a certain known property has the possibility of accessing this information even without the provision. We therefore consider that this exemption should be removed.</p>
<p>Municipal protection officers for victims of crime</p>
<p>Municipalities already have a far-reaching obligation to help the victims of crime. Under Chapter 5, Section 11 of the Social Services Act (2001:453), it is the responsibility of the social welfare committee to ensure that victims of crime and their families receive support and help.</p>
<p>There is often a lack of coordination within the municipality and between municipalities and government agencies. Measures are often taken in the absence of a plan and this happens at a time when the victim is at his or her most vulnerable. In addition, the victim often needs to be in touch with a large number of agencies and other bodies so as to protect himself or herself against new crimes and harassment. In their fear of being found, many victims are forced to flee from place to place.</p>
<p>There is a need for protection and support to be arranged in a safe and correct manner from the outset. In order to maintain a high level of quality and integrity, municipalities should establish specialist functions in this area. We therefore consider that there should be trained protection officers available in every municipality. A protection officer should be a link between the victim and the municipality’s functions, government agencies and non-governmental organisations. The protection officer has a particularly important role to play if the victim is forced to move to a new location.</p>
<p>If municipalities establish functions such as that of protection officer, this will mean a huge improvement in the quality of protection given to individuals forced to flee their homes due to threats, violence or harassment. This should also lead to long-term savings for municipalities.</p>
<p>Police protection work</p>
<p>The Police Service’s special personal security work, which was formalised in 2006, is primarily intended for people who are to give evidence or people employed in the judicial system. In special circumstances, special personal security work may also be carried out for other people. It is our view that there are currently no grounds for proposing that the terms governing who is to be covered by special personal security work be changed. However, we do propose that the Government take the initiative to evaluate this special personal security work.</p>
<p>Measures to expand the Police Service’s local personal security work have now begun, and this will make it possible for more victims of crime to receive the right protection and other help. However, we consider that an effective and uniform expansion of local personal security work will require that the National Police Board take the initiative to introduce national guidelines and coordination.</p>
<p>Financial compensation for people subjected to harassment or serious crime</p>
<p>Most of the people the Inquiry has been in contact with and who have been or are being subjected to harassment state that they were not prepared for the costs and practical problems caused. The costs incurred as a result of an individual being subjected to harassment do, of course, depend on the nature of the harassment and the threat involved. The way in which the person being harassed experiences the threat is another factor affecting which measures are taken.</p>
<p>There are currently a number of ways in which people subjected to crime can receive financial compensation and support, for example, in the form of damages from the perpetrator, insurance compensation, criminal injuries compensation and financial support from the municipality. Those covered by the Police Service’s special personal security work may, in certain cases, receive personal security compensation. Those who are considered unfit for work or those who are unable to find work may be granted sickness compensation or unemployment benefit.</p>
<p>A person subjected to harassment or serious crime can face costs at different stages. Initial costs may emerge when the threat first becomes apparent. For example, this may include the cost of protecting oneself by paying for things like alarms. Adjustment costs are incurred when the victim is forced to move. According to the National Council for Crime Prevention, approximately 15 000 people move from their homes each year because they have been subjected to harassment. In the long term there is the need to earn a living in the new place of residence.</p>
<p>We consider it particularly important that the application of municipal financial support be further improved and standardised.</p>
<p>One important issue concerning financial support is clarifying who should pay this support. There is currently a lack of clarity over how the financial responsibility should be divided between municipalities in cases where an individual is forced, on grounds of protection, to move from his or her home to a new municipality. The issue of the responsibility born by the municipality in which the individual is residing needs to be examined. The Municipality of Residence Inquiry (S 2008:02) is now dealing with this.</p>
<p>Another issue is whether the perpetrator or society should bear greater responsibility in cases where the victim is forced to take measures to protect himself or herself against further crime at the hands of the perpetrator. We consider this to be an issue that lies beyond the remit of this Inquiry, but we nonetheless think that the problem should possibly be investigated.</p>
<p>Stalking by people admitted for care or in an institution</p>
<p>It is sometimes the case that people are subjected to harassment by someone who has been admitted to a correctional institution, or who is receiving compulsory mental care or forensic mental care.</p>
<p>There are a number of question marks over how far an institution’s responsibility for preventing this type of crime should stretch. We consider that these issues should be dealt with within the framework of the Government’s current review of penal care legislation and in the inquiry on compulsory mental care that the Government is currently preparing.</p>
<p>Cost and impact assessment</p>
<p>Our proposal on the electronic monitoring of non-contact orders would entail increased annual costs for the National Police Board to the tune of SEK 11 million. This increase in cost should be balanced out by a general reduction in costs for society, as the costs incurred as a result of violence against women and other violence will be reduced.</p>
<p>In general, the increase in costs for government agencies will be minor. The cost of processing fictitious personal data at the National Police Board can be expected to rise somewhat. The judicial system will be affected by increased costs for public counsel and injured party counsel in matters concerning non-contact orders. To a certain extent, the rise in costs can be expected to be neutralised by other measures that will improve efficiency and result in opportunities to improve working methods, etc. In any case, we consider that the rise in costs can be met within the framework of existing appropriations.</p>
<p>It is expected that the Inquiry’s proposals will help to prevent crime and increase equality between women and men. The proposals will result in better chances of preventing crimes, investigating crimes and prosecuting perpetrators. This should lead to a decrease in violent crimes, e.g. men’s violence against women. The proposals may also have a positive effect from a child perspective. This is above all the case if the provisions on non-contact orders and municipal protection officers are implemented.</p>
<p>The electronic monitoring of non-contact orders will have consequences in terms of personal integrity. In the cases in question, we consider that crime prevention takes precedence.</p>
<p>Entry into force and transitional provisions</p>
<p>We propose that the new provisions enter into force on 1 January 2010. Special transitional provisions are required in the Non-contact Orders Act and the Criminal Records Act for restraining orders that have already been issued and that apply when the new provisions enter into force.</p>
