<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit of the Inquiry</h2>
<p>Under our terms of reference, the Inquiry is to formulate an objecttive for the premium pension system and the role of the fund marketplace for achieving that objective. It is also to create a choice environment that is reliable and secure and offers pension savers freedom of choice.</p>
<p>The Inquiry is also to draft a proposal for a regulatory framework for a procured fund marketplace for the premium pension and an act regulating a new agency tasked with procuring funds and managing the fund marketplace. After that, in a second stage, the Inquiry is to prepare and implement the formation of the new agency.</p>
<h2>Purpose of the premium pension system</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s assessment is that up to now the premium pension system has fulfilled the purpose of making higher returns possible by investing in the capital market and of contributing to risk diversification in the national public pension. The Inquiry also makes the assessment that the premium pension system has partly fulfilled the purpose of enabling individuals to influence how their assets are managed. In contrast, the premium pension system has not fulfilled the ambition of generating more commitment and interest among individuals in their own pension.</p>
<h2>Objective of the premium pension system</h2>
<p>Our terms of reference state that an objective need to be formulated for the premium pension system and aimed at delivering an expected return that, as at present, clearly exceeds the income index in the long term. They also state that part of our remit is to ensure that the objective of the premium pension system is consistent with the objective of the default option, which has been investigated separately in the Ministry of Finance’s review of the default option.</p>
<p>The full version of Chapter 5 Objective and choice architecture for the premium pension system  translated into English can be found in Appendix 3 (Bilaga 3).</p>
<p>The premium pension is a social insurance system</p>
<p>The Pension Agreement states that the Pension Group agrees that the premium pension system should be maintained, but that the system should be reformed to provide better security and higher future pensions. Its design should have a different basis and a new structure in accordance with a number of principles including the principle that the premium pension is a form of social insurance for which the state must have a clearer responsibility.</p>
<p>The Inquiry notes that one fundamental part of welfare provision in Sweden is a universal, compulsory and comprehensive social insurance system. It is intended to provide financial security for all insurees in all phases of their lives. One important part of this financial security is the national public old-age pension, which is intended to guarantee reasonable, secure and sufficient income after working life when there are not normally any possibilities of other sources of income. The national public old-age pension is compulsory and is designed as insurance cover that provides insurees with a pension for the rest of their lives, irrespective of how long they live. The premium pension is also part of the national public old-age pension and is therefore also a form of social insurance. One fundamental feature of the premium pension is that, along with the income pension, it is intended to provide protection for insurees’ living standard on retirement on the basis of premiums paid.</p>
<p>Against this background, the Inquiry takes the view that it is reasonable for the objective to be proposed by the Inquiry for the premium pension system to be guided by the status of the premium pension as a form of social insurance. In the opinion of the Inquiry, this means that the State has a clear responsibility for the premium pension system being designed so as to be consistent with the objective. In particular, this means taking responsibility for a risk level that provides the possibility of a long-term good return while restricting the risk of strong fluctuations in individuals’ pension amounts.</p>
<p>The objective of the premium pension should always be based on delivering as good insurance cover as possible, focusing solely on the interests of savers and pensioners. While other interests can be taken into account, this can only be done to the extent that doing so is not to the disadvantage of savers and pensioners. This means, for instance, that the premium pension system should not be designed to promote growth in the Swedish economy or to serve other economic policy objectives. Nor should it have the purpose of being a distribution or marketing channel for fund managers, acting as a product development platform for the fund market or serving as a channel for newly started or foreign fund managers wishing to establish a presence in the Swedish fund market.</p>
<p>What is a responsible level of risk in a social insurance system?</p>
<p>In line with other social insurance benefits, the objective of the premium pension system should be guided by the intention of providing financial security. The premium pension system certainly is intended to benefit from an expected higher return from the capital market, so that the premium pension is associated with a risk that could be considered to be inconsistent, to at least some extent, with providing financial security. However, the fund-based saving involved here normally takes place over a very long period of time. In addition, shares have traditionally and in the long term given a higher return, i.e. a return in excess of income growth. This does not, however, mean that this is sure to be the case in the future. Moreover, individual savers in a system with individual freedom of choice can always get a low or volatile premium pension because their choice of funds has resulted in such an outcome.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the tension between risk, return and security is unavoidable, but that an acceptable trade-off is possible.</p>
<p>However, it is, in the assessment of the Inquiry, important that, at a general level, the objective of the premium pension system is guided by its status as a form of social insurance and that the level of risk during both the saving and the payment period is therefore adjusted so as to limit variation in pension amounts.</p>
<p>Objectives for the saving and payment period and the right to freedom of choice</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the objective of the premium pension system should be to form a pension saving of high quality that provides a secure pension, which means that: 1. during the saving period give a return that is clearly higher than the change in the income index but without guarantees for the return; and 2. during the payment period deliver a premium pension with low volatility, taking account of the remaining saving period.</p>
<p>The premium pension system should provide the right to freedom of choice so that savers and pensioners are able to influence their risk level and investment approach regarding the investments of the premium pension assets.</p>
<p>The objective of the premium pension system and the principle of freedom of choice should be regulated by law.</p>
<p>During the saving period the premium pension system must be expected to give a higher return than wage growth</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the objective of the premium pension system during the saving period needs to contain a level for the return. This applies especially to the asset management for which the State is responsible, i.e. in principle the default option (currently AP7 Såfa).</p>
<p>The premium pension system should also include a right to real freedom of choice for savers and pensioners regarding the investments of the premium pension assets. As a principle, and since the pension is part of the social insurance system, the objective should therefore also apply to those who choose funds by themselves. Since one intention of having own choices is to actually be able to influence the level of risk, it goes without saying, however, that the likelihood for a result that diverges from the objective is higher for individuals choosing funds on their own. By making use of their right to freedom of choice, these individuals set their own objectives for the premium pension.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has given consideration to whether there should be a quantitative target for the return but takes the view that this is inappropriate. The historical performance of the capital market has certainly been good, but it is an unreliable indicator of future returns. The assessment of a responsible level of an objective for returns is also likely to vary over time – depending on long-term economic performance, in Sweden and globally.</p>
<p>An objective should be of a long-term nature. The Inquiry therefore takes the view that it is not reasonable to set an objective based on historical returns or present-day assessments of future returns and that the general, long-term level of the objective set by law should only provide that the return should clearly exceed the income index.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has also taken account of the fact that an objective will also be set for the default option. It is the Inquiry’s view that that objective must be considered to express the State’s ambitions for the premium pension system in terms of the return on savings and the risk of variations in pension payments. The Inquiry also makes the assessment that it would be inappropriate to have different quantified objective for the premium pension system as a whole than for the default option.</p>
<p>During the payment period the objective should be a secure and stable pension</p>
<p>On the basis that the premium pension is a part of the social insurance system that is intended to provide for financial security after working life, the fundamental ultimate objective of the premium pension should be to deliver a secure and stable pension during the payment period. ‘Secure and stable’ means a pension payment with low volatility. Even if the pension capital during the saving period can encounter both strong downturns and upturns, insurees ought to be able to feel secure that the premium pension system after the working life will provide pension payments that are sufficiently predictable and stable.</p>
<p>The investment of assets in the capital market is, by definition, associated with risk. A higher risk provides the possibility of a higher return but can also result in the opposite. Obviously, the return should be as high as possible, but be balanced at the same time towards the objective of secure pension. The risk level will therefore always be a trade-off between the highest possible return and reasonable security. Since the fundamental purpose with the social insurance system is financial security, the Inquiry considers that security should normally be given priority. This does not entail the absence of risk. The inquiry’s proposal for objective for the payment period is therefore a premium pension with low volatility, taking account of the remaining saving period.</p>
<p>For the savers who make their own choices of funds, their choices will be able to lead to outcomes that are in conflict with the objective of a pension with low volatility. The Inquiry notes that this conflict between objectives exists and that it is genuine, and therefore cannot be solved without removing either the objective of low volatility or the right to freedom of choice. Completely preventing volatile outcomes would require such extensive constraints on freedom of choice that there would no longer be any real freedom of choice. Such an approach would therefore be inconsistent with both our terms of reference and the pension agreement.</p>
<p>Savers who want to influence their risk level and investment approach should have the freedom to do so</p>
<p>Our terms of reference state that one purpose of the premium pension system is to enable individuals to influence their pension by making their own choices of one or more funds that their assets are invested in. In addition to the default option, there should, according to our terms of reference, continue to be a fund marketplace for the premium pension containing funds with different investment approaches and risk profiles that pension savers who want to take on responsibility for the management of their premium pension assets should be able to choose between. For pension savers who so wish, there should be a possibility of investing premium pension assets in funds in a secure, controlled and professionally procured fund marketplace. The procurement of funds should be conducted according to general principles of freedom of choice, sustainability and controllability. The funds offered on the fund marketplace should be of good quality and be cost-effective, sustainable and controlled.</p>
<p>Based on what has been stated in our terms of reference, the Inquiry can conclude that it is natural to view freedom of choice as an integrated right for savers in the premium pension. Freedom of choice provides a possibility for those who so wish to influence their risk level and investment approach on the basis of their individual preferences by choosing the management of their premium pension assets.</p>
<p>Achievement of the objective in a system with freedom of choice</p>
<p>The Inquiry makes the assessment that there is a tension between the State setting objectives for returns and volatility in a funded pension system and, at the same time, giving savers freedom to choose their own level of risk in their savings through funds in a fund marketplace. To handle such a tension without one of the interests having to completely give way to the other, there must be a clear and wellconsidered choice architecture that creates conditions for well-founded choices and increases the possibility of achieving the objectives.</p>
<p>The Inquiry notes that saving in the fund marketplace can lead to outcomes that are both higher and lower than the State’s ambition for the premium pension system as expressed in the objective of the default option. This is an unavoidable consequence of the fact that the system contains freedom of choice. Whether this is acceptable is ultimately a matter of suitability that has to be decided in a political position. However, the Inquiry wishes to point to some factors that ease this conflict of interests, according to the Inquiry.</p>
<p>First , the Inquiry considers that the State should make clear that only savers who want to, and consider they are able to, should choose funds in the fund marketplace. Second , the choice architecture should support this happening. Third , the funds in the fund marketplace should be procured and also be audited to a greater extent than they are at present. The selection entailed by procurement creates a possibility – that does not exist at present – to weed out funds that are judged to have a lower likelihood than others of generating good returns, just as is done by other insurers in, for example, occupational pensions.</p>
<p>A special payment product needs to be investigated</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that in order to achieve the objective of a premium pension with low volatility during the payment period, a separate investigation should be made of whether to supplement the premium pension system with a special product aimed at the payment phase. As part of such an investigation, proposals should be developed to handle the transition between the saving and the payment phase.</p>
<p>The objective of the default option is consistent with the objective of the premium pension system</p>
<p>The Inquiry makes the assessment that the objective of the default option that is proposed in the Ministry of Finance’s review of the default option in the premium pension is consistent with the objecttive of the premium pension system that is proposed by the Inquiry. The Inquiry considers that the objective of the default option should be regulated by law.</p>
<p>The role of the fund market place in achieving the objective</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the procured fund marketplace should give pension savers the possibility to influence the risk level and investment approach of their premium pension assets by choosing among procured funds. The procured fund marketplace should offer a selection of funds suitable for the premium pension system with different risk levels and investment approaches that provide real freedom of choice. The funds should be cost-effective, sustainable, controllable and of high quality. Our terms of reference state that it is not part of the Inquiry’s remit to take a stand on the number of funds in the fund marketplace.</p>
<p>It is not possible to give an exact definition of what is meant by or should be meant by real freedom of choice. This is because the meaning of the concept is subjective and therefore depends to a great extent on the observer’s values. However, the Inquiry considers that a definition suitable as a starting point is that the range of funds should be broad enough to satisfy most of the pension savers interested in making their own choices.</p>
<p>Moreover, the more exact meaning of the term real freedom of choice is likely to change depending on the performance of the financial market. The funds ought not to be too similar, both to simplify the choice for savers and to create a cost-effective and controllable fund marketplace for the organisation charged with examining the funds continuously. The various fund categories should be based on generally accepted categories in the light of the best industry standards at any particular time. The Inquiry considers that it ought to be the new agency, not the legislator, that sets these restrictions on the basis of the financial knowledge available at any particular time.</p>
<p>Since the procurement is intended to select the best funds, a fund marketplace without funds that are too similar ideally means that worse funds are not selected. There can, admittedly, be reasons to have several similar funds so as to attain a functioning fund marketplace and to avoid the State becoming too big an owner in individual funds.</p>
<p>The Inquiry is aware that always being able to select the best funds is an idealised picture, but a procurement professional is normally in a better position to examine and compare funds than most pension savers. But simply weeding out the funds that have the poorest prospects of offering a good saving product increases the possibility that the fund marketplace will contribute to achieving the objective of the premium pension system. By establishing a procured fund marketplace, the competition aspect of the premium pension system can become relevant again and create sound price pressure and relevant innovative power in the fund market. The existence of and methodology for the selection of funds in the occupational pension system is likely to be able to serve as a model for the design of the selection of funds for the fund marketplace of the premium pension.</p>
<p>In practice the cost aspect will greatly limit the number of funds compared with today. How many funds a procured fund marketplace will ultimately contain will thus be a trade-off between what is required to achieve real freedom of choice and what can be managed and controlled at a reasonable cost. For that reason, the Inquiry does not consider that an objective should be set for the number of funds but should be determined by the new agency after professional assessments.</p>
<p>Should the risk in the fund marketplace be limited?</p>
<p>The Inquiry makes the assessment that there should not be any prior limitations on the fund marketplace regarding the risk level and investment approach of the funds. Instead it ought to be left to the new agency to ensure that the risk level and investment approach of the funds procured are suitable for premium pension savings.</p>
<p>It ought to be the choice architecture, and not any constraint on freedom of choice, that deals with the potential negative effects of too high or too low risk in individual funds by supporting conscious choices; and it should do so by making it possible to compose diversified portfolios on the basis of savers’ wishes.</p>
<p>A fund marketplace without any actual restrictions regarding risk means that it is possible for savers to design portfolios only containing risky funds during both the saving and the payment period. This manifestly increases the risk of a both low and volatile pension, which could conflict with the objective of a pension with low volatility.</p>
<p>However, introducing restrictions in risk to prevent a small number of savers from making bad or risky choices means, in the view of the Inquiry, excessive constraints on savers who choose to make use of the right to freedom of choice. At the same time, the risk of inappropriate choices is limited by the proposed choice architecture and information about the consequences of leaving the default option and instead choosing funds on the fund marketplace.</p>
<p>The Swedish Pensions Agency should be tasked with measuring achievement of the objective</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that based on the objective of the premium pension, the Government or the agency designated by the Government should continuously formulate key figures and measure the achievement of the objective of the system. This should include measuring the degree of freedom of choice for savers in the fund marketplace. The Inquiry proposes that the Government should give this role to the Swedish Pensions Agency.</p>
<h2>Behavioural economics research casts light on deficiencies in the design of the premium pension system</h2>
<p>In recent decades, a new branch of academic studies has emerged in the borders between economics and psychology: behavioural economics. Alongside this, twenty years of Swedish premium pension saving have provided considerable insights into individuals’ behaviour in financial matters.</p>
<p>The general conclusion of behavioural economics – that, for various reasons, individuals are not as rational as economic models assume – is of particular relevance for pension saving. Pension saving is a recurring example of a complicated decision situation in which individuals either save too little or too much, seek or are offered advisory assistance that is not always economically rational or take investment decisions that are not always economically rational either.</p>
<p>There are special difficulties associated with individuals’ behaviour in long-term pension management. This is due, in part, to the requirements for dynamic decision-making and the difficulties of compose an efficient portfolio and of valuing the funded pension in relation to other assets. It is also due to the fundamental difficulty savers have in determining their own risk preference and choosing a combination of funds that matches it. Moreover, savers need to understand and apply diversification in their portfolios, for instance to realise which assets covary, to evaluate the quality of their fund manager and to consider the need to rebalance their portfolio in the light of both market changes and age. There are, of course, a considerable number of savers who have made conscious, informed and rational choices in the management of their pension capital. However, the Inquiry has not been able to find support in behavioural economics research for the great bulk or even a majority of savers having done so or having the capacity or even the wish to do so.</p>
<p>It is a global problem that, as buyers of financial products, savers are seldom knowledgeable about the goods – so high fees can be charged and extensive marketing put in place that generates switches from good and cheap products to worse and more expensive ones. The fact that savers are not knowledgeable about the goods is not only due to savers themselves but is also because the characteristics of the goods are not, and cannot be, well-defined and are, instead, only described on the basis of historical experience using statistics that are of unclear or, at any rate, uncertain importance for the future characteristics of the goods.</p>
<p>A change of approach is under way in several other countries as part of various pension solutions – a change from a conviction about the possibilities and interest that individuals have in making active choices to an understanding of how individuals actually behave in practice. Even if pension systems of other countries have a different design from the Swedish system and function in a different environment and culture there are, however, distinct similarities concerning experience of how individuals behave, or do not behave, and of how the advisory market grows when the system becomes too complicated. The Inquiry can conclude that neither information, transparency nor standardisation is of any help if the product sold is too complex for most individuals.</p>
<h2>Choice architecture is the key to a well-functioning premium pension system</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the choice architecture of the premium pension system should encourage pension savers to make informed and considered choices about how to invest their premium pension assets.</p>
<p>The Inquiry makes the assessment that the premium pension system should be designed and administered in such a way that only savers who want to and can compile their own fund portfolios in the fund marketplace do so. A well-considered and well-maintained choice architecture, which provides support and guidance, is crucial in ensuring that this will come about. The Inquiry also makes the assessment that the selection of funds in the way done by insurance providers in, for instance, the occupational pension system counters some of the problems faced by individuals when choosing funds in the premium pension system.</p>
<p>One prominent conclusion of behavioural economics research is that individuals seldom behave in a rational way in the type of decision situation that arises in pension saving. This is why designing a well-considered choice architecture is a central task for insurers providing pension insurance. One starting point is that even relatively small changes in the decision situation can make it simpler for individuals to make decisions that promote their own welfare, and sometimes also collective welfare, without limiting their own freedom of choice. This corresponds to what is called ‘libertarian paternalism’ or, put simply, nudges  or behavioural insights .</p>
<p>As early as a couple of years after the introduction of the premium pension system it was noted that pension savers faced considerable difficulties in choosing from the large range in the fund marketplace. Since then one frequently advocated solution has been to design various types of decision support for savers.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the overall experience gained in recent years and the conclusions of behavioural economics research show that decision support as solution for those savers who can not choose funds is no longer fully relevant. Relatively deep knowledge and continuous engagement are required to be able to make longterm financial decisions about pensions. Many pension savers do not have this knowledge and these abilities. Nor is it reasonable, as part of a compulsory social insurance system, to demand such knowledge and abilities, or to build the design of the system on the basis that savers have this knowledge or these abilities. The experience of the system up to now also shows that, in practice, it is not possible to supply such knowledge and abilities for a broader group of pension savers through decision support or financial education of the population. People who cannot compose and manage a well-diversified portfolio should therefore not do so either. They should even less be encouraged to do so, either directly or indirectly. Behavioural economics research indicates that these people should stay in the default option.</p>
<p>Moreover, the conclusions of behavioural economics and the experience from the premium pensions system so far gained point to a considerable imbalance between those faced with choosing a financial product (pension savers) and those supplying the product (fund managers) in terms of knowledge and information. This is probably at least part of the reason why almost all insurers in the occupational pension system apply a selection procedure. The selection procedure means that funds judged to be less well-placed than others to give a good return are weeded out or, as is most common, the funds judged to be best placed to give good returns are selected. Viewed in the light of the experience of the premium pension so far and of the conclusions of behavioural economics, the Inquiry sees no reasons why the State as an insurance provider should act differently.</p>
<p>So, only savers who have sufficient knowledge ought to choose funds in the fund marketplace, but this does not mean that these savers should be left to do so without support and good tools for choosing funds. In the view of the Inquiry, a well-considered and well-maintained choice architecture should supply relevant information based on the needs of the target group and build on modern information technology.</p>
<p>The stronger the choice architecture, the more funds are possible in the fund marketplace</p>
<p>The Inquiry makes the assessment that a well-designed choice architecture with clear steps in the choice process and blocks of unwanted and poorly considered choices provides scope to permit a relatively large number of funds with different risk levels and investment approaches in different categories. Vice versa, a weak choice architecture only provides scope for a small number of funds in the fund marketplace.</p>
<p>The Inquiry notes that the large number of funds in the present system has made it difficult for savers to make conscious choices. Of course, the new agency’s procurement of funds must take account of this and of what is shown by behavioural economics research. However, the inquiry considers that a robust and clear choice environment with in-built blocks to prevent individuals who lack the knowledge or will to choose funds from nevertheless reaching the fund marketplace does enough to reduce the risk and disadvantages of a relatively large range of funds. It does not appear unlikely that a number of funds at the level of the maximum number of funds in the selectable part of the occupational pension system could function in accordance with the objective proposed by the Inquiry below.</p>
<p>Main features of a choice architecture for the premium pension system</p>
<p>The Inquiry makes the assessment that at least the following requirements need to be set for the choice architecture in the premium pension system.</p>
<p>The default option should be the starting point for all savers, and this must be reflected in the design of the choice architecture. Since the default option is the starting point, the investment and choice environment is designed so that no activity or financial knowledge is required on the part of the saver.</p>
<p>Pension savers who choose to leave the default option should be informed that, by doing so, they are taking over the responsibility for choices and the maintenance of choices. In conjunction with this, the saver needs to be given information, support and guidance for their assessment of whether it is appropriate to leave the default option.</p>
<p>It should be possible to choose a risk level as part of state management without having to enter the fund marketplace. If the saver wants to leave the default option, they should first be given information about and take a decision on their choice of risk level.</p>
<p>If the saver does not only want to choose risk level, there should be a possibility, in the first place, of choosing one or more fund categories that the saver can invest their assets in.</p>
<p>If the saver does not only want to choose categories, there should be a possibility for the saver of investing their assets in procured funds in the fund marketplace.</p>
<p>The number of categories and the number of funds in each category vary depending on factors including the demand from pension savers and the possibility of achieving the objective of the pension system and maintaining the principle of freedom of choice.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the saver should confirm in writing, normally by a digital signature, that they have read information about what compiling their own fund portfolio means. However, over and above the fact that the confirmation is needed to move forward in the choice process, it should not be assigned any further legal importance, but should serve as an important point for the saver to note.</p>
<p>As at present, it should be possible to choose the default option again after choosing funds in the fund marketplace.</p>
<p>In the electronic choice environment savers should be given appropriate tools, guidance, support and information to simplify their choices in and before every step.</p>
<p>Regulation of the choice architecture</p>
<p>The main features of the choice architecture should be regulated by law since it is a central part of the functioning of the premium pension system. How the environment is designed will also be of great importance for the number of funds and what kind of funds are procured. The Inquiry’s terms of reference state that one clear purpose of the reform of the premium pension system is to create a regulatory framework that means that the Government is unable to steer the selection of funds. For this reason, too, the main features of the choice architecture should be regulated by law.</p>
<p>However, the more detailed regulation of the choice architecture ought to take place at a lower level in the legislative hierarchy. One important reason for this is that the choice architecture needs to be reviewed and adapted continuously on the basis of saver behaviour, the performance of the fund market and behavioural economics research. The legislative process is unnecessarily protracted and complicated for these specific needs. Since the design of the choice architecture is of great importance for the selection of funds and the design of the fund marketplace, such more detailed regulations about the choice architecture should not be issued by the Government; this should be done by the new agency.</p>
<p>The main addressee of regulations concerning the choice architecture is the Swedish Pensions Agency, which supplies the choice architecture in their online interface in relation to savers.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<h2>Survey of occupational pension selection central demonstrates the existence of and methodology for fund selection</h2>
<p>Our terms of reference state that the Inquiry is to survey ways of working and contractual solutions for the selection central in the occupational pension system. If they are assessed as appropriate for the procurement of funds for the fund marketplace in the premium pension, the Inquiry should propose such solutions.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s assessment is that the ways of working and contractual solutions of the selection central in the occupational pension system can only serve to a limited extent as models for the procurement of funds for the fund marketplace for the premium pension. This is for two reasons: only one agreement area applies procurement and the main role of the selection central is to administer the occupational pensions under collective agreements and not to procure funds. Therefore, the Inquiry is not presenting any proposals based directly on the ways of working and contractual solutions of the selection central. In contrast, there are ways of working in the selection of funds by insurance providers  that are relevant to the premium pension system. These mainly concern the fact that a selection is performed and the methodology for selection.</p>
<p>There are, or ought to be, clear similarities between the mandatorship that insurance providers have in the selection of funds in the occupational pension system and the role that the State will have for the selection of funds to the fund marketplace of the premium pension.</p>
<p>The fund selection methodology of insurance providers in the occupational pension system is based on commercial decisions and on research. The companies’ commercial considerations are based on there being commercial benefit, i.e. potential profit, in trying to select the best funds and deselect the worst, in terms of expected returns. The additional return attained or assumed by the companies varies, but the companies generally assume that the selection gives a substantial additional return as a result of the fund selection process.</p>
<p>The survey of insurance providers’ ways of working in selecting funds shows that assessments with some degree of subjectivity are a central part of fund selection. So such assessments will probably be required as part of the procurement of funds for the fund market place of the premium pension.</p>
<p>However, the need to leave it up to a government agency to make discretionary assessments to some extent as part of decision-making in central government is not unique to the selection of funds for the fund market place of the premium pension specifically. It is actually an accepted and essential principle of administrative law so as to enable all relevant and known circumstances to be taken into account in decision-making about matters that cannot be described in clear and objectively verifiable terms. There is no opposition between an administrative authority observing objectivity and impartiality when making decisions in its activities while using discretionary assessments at the same time. On the contrary, the requirements for objecttivity and impartiality include an obligation to take account of all the relevant factors in the particular case and assign them their correct weight. The Inquiry proposes that the procurement to be used in the selection should be reviewable by an administrative court. This will provide a check that the selection is performed within discretion.</p>
<p>The Inquiry therefore finds that there is no tension between having the ambition of procuring the best possible funds for the fund marketplace and making the necessary assessments of suitability when doing so while doing this in a legally certain and sufficiently transparent way.</p>
<h2>What funds should it be possible to procure for the fund marketplace of the premium pension?</h2>
<p>Under our terms of reference, the Inquiry is to draft proposals for a regulatory framework for the procurement of funds for the fund marketplace of the premium pension. The proposals made should start from the Pension Group’s agreement. The Pension Group’s agreement states that the funds to be offered in the fund marketplace for the premium pension should be procured in the private market and the State should not itself have any funds in the fund marketplace. Our terms of reference also state that it is funds, and not fund managers, that should be procured.</p>
<p>The Inquiry sees clear advantages in procuring capital management services rather than individual funds. Solutions of that kind would enable savers to influence their own risk level and investment approach, which the Inquiry sees as the most relevant aspects of freedom of choice in pension saving, at the same time as this would enable the costs of the system to be kept at a minimum level. The type of aggressive and misleading marketing that has been relatively common in the premium pension system would cease entirely. Moreover, the risk of fraud would be minimised. However, our terms of reference do not provide scope for the Inquiry to present proposals for a regulatory framework with that direction.</p>
<p>The objective of the premium pension system should steer what types of funds it should be possible to procure for the fund marketplace of the premium pension</p>
<p>The proposed objective of the premium pension system and the role of the fund marketplace for achieving that objective and the principle of freedom of choice must, in the view of the Inquiry, steer what types of funds it should be possible to procure for the fund marketplace. In this context, types of funds means the different types of funds defined in the commercial law frameworks and that are covered by different regulations. The regulations can, for instance, apply to what asset classes the funds’ money may be invested in and to what investors they may be marketed to. Swedish UCITS-funds and special funds are examples of different types of funds.</p>
<p>According to the Inquiry’s proposal, the procured fund marketplace should contribute to the achievement of the objective of the premium pension system by offering a selection of funds suitable for the premium pension system with different risk levels and investment approaches that provides real freedom of choice. The funds should be cost-effective, sustainable, controllable and of high quality.</p>
<p>The requirements that the funds should be cost-effective, sustainable, controllable and of high quality are best assessed in relation to individual funds, not in relation to different types of funds. Ensuring that the funds procured do meet these requirements is therefore something that should be done in the first place through the specifications set in the procurements and the award criteria used to award fund agreements. The requirement that the funds should be appropriate for the premium pension system can be assessed in relation to individual funds and different types of funds.</p>
<p>So, in assessing which type or types of funds it should be possible to procure to the fund marketplace, what is of prime importance is therefore how the different types of funds can contribute to pension savers being offered a selection of funds appropriate for the premium pension system with different risk levels and investment approaches that provides real freedom of choice. Against this background, what risk levels and investment approaches the different types of funds can have is of importance.</p>
<p>In assessing which types of funds it should be possible to procure for the fund marketplace, another important consideration is which pension savers can be assumed to want to place their premium pension assets in funds in the fund market place. The starting point of the choice architecture proposed by the Inquiry is that this concerns individuals who both want to and have the knowledge required to make such a choice. However, these savers are still to be regarded as non-professional investors according to law.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the types of funds currently available in the market satisfy the need of funds for the fund market place. So, in the view of the Inquiry, there is no need to investigate in depth and propose regulations that involve the creation of a new type of fund solely for the premium pension system.</p>
<p>It should be possible to procure Swedish and foreign UCITS-funds as well as special funds and foreign equivalents of such funds for the fund marketplace of the premium pension</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that it should be possible to procure mutual funds and fund companies that are already permitted in the fund marketplace for the premium pension’s fund marketplace. These include funds with a number of investment approaches such as equity funds, mixed funds and fixed income funds that can, in turn, focus on different industries and geographical areas. Risk levels can vary depending on the funds’ investment approaches. In the view of the Inquiry, the great range of mutual funds and fund companies create good conditions for the new agency to procure funds that maintain high quality and have low fees, in addition to having different risk levels and investment approaches. The characteristics of the mutual funds and fund companies and the great range of funds therefore mean that the funds should be able to contribute to the role of the fund market place in achieving the objective of the premium pension system and maintaining the principle of freedom of choice.</p>
<p>In addition, the Inquiry proposes that it should also be possible to procure special funds and the foreign equivalents of such funds for the fund marketplace. The characteristics of the special funds, including the fact that they can have different investment approaches from mutual funds, and the fact that there is a relatively large range of funds, also mean that the special funds ought to be able to contribute to the role of the fund marketplace in achieving the objective of the premium pension system and maintaining the principle of freedom of choice, including by increasing freedom of choice for pension savers.</p>
<p>A special fund only needs to be open for redemption once a year. To ensure that the funds offered in the fund marketplace are liquid, it should only be possible to procure special funds and the foreign equivalents of such funds if they are open for redemption at least once a week.</p>
<p>In the view of the Inquiry other types of funds are not appropriate for the premium pension system, so it should not be possible to procure them for the fund marketplace.</p>
<h2>Are there applicable regulatory frameworks for procurement?</h2>
<p>The remit of the Inquiry includes proposing a regulatory framework for procurement of funds for the fund marketplace of the premium pension. When assessing the legal possibilities of drafting such a framework, account must be taken of the competence of the EU in the area.</p>
<p>Competence is shared between the EU and Member States in the area of social security. Member States have the right to design their own social security systems. In the Inquiry’s assessment, however, the procurement of funds for the fund marketplace of the premium pension cannot be held to fall outside the competence of the EU on the grounds that the procurement is being carried out as part of a social security system.</p>
<p>Competence regarding public procurement is also shared between the EU and Member States. The EU has adopted several directives in the area of procurement. The procurement directives and the Swedish acts that implement these directives in Swedish law regulate how a contracting authority has to act when selecting one or more suppliers in the acquisition of goods, services or works contracts. To ensure that the contracting authority acts in an open, marketoriented and non-discriminatory way, the regulatory frameworks contain regulations about how the selection and award have to be carried out.</p>
<p>The Inquiry makes the assessment that the procurement of funds for the fund marketplace of the premium pension does not fall within the scope of any of the procurement directives or any of the procurement acts. This means that there are no legal obstacles to introducing a special regulatory framework for the procurement of funds for the fund marketplace.</p>
<p>However, if one of the procurement acts is judged to be suitable for the procurement of funds for the fund marketplace, there is, in the view of the Inquiry, no need to propose a new regulatory framework. The Inquiry has therefore analysed whether any of the procurement acts should nevertheless be applied to this type of procurement.</p>
<p>The assessment of the Inquiry is that this should not be done. The act that could be considered for application to the procurement of funds for the fund marketplace for the premium pension is the Public Procurement Act. In the view of the Inquiry, there is no need for a regulatory framework as extensive, detailed and complex as that Act in the procurement of funds for the fund marketplace. In the Inquiry’s opinion, a separate regulatory framework should be drafted for the procurement of funds for the fund marketplace for the premium pension.</p>
<h2>Starting point for new regulations</h2>
<p>A regulatory framework for the procurement of funds for the fund marketplace for the premium pension should be flexible and specially geared to the fact that the procurements relate to funds to be offered in the fund marketplace. The means, for instance, that the requirements that the funds should be cost-effective, sustainable, controllable and of high quality and should also be appropriate for the premium pension system should be expressed in the regulatory framework. In the first place, the regulatory framework should set out the limits of the new agency’s scope for action without compromising with the requirement of legal certainty.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s assessment a fund agreement is a ‘contract having a certain cross-border interest’, i.e. it may be of interest to a fund manager established in another Member State. This means that the fundamental principles of procurement (the principles of non-discrimination, equal treatment, transparency, proportionality and mutual recognition) are applicable even though the procurement falls outside the scope of the EU’s procurement directives. The regulatory framework for the procurement of funds for the fund marketplace should therefore be based on these principles.</p>
<h2>General principles for procurement of funds for the fund marketplace of the premium pension</h2>
<p>Our terms of reference state that the procurement of funds for the fund marketplace for the premium pension should be conducted according to general principles of freedom of choice, sustainability and controllability. The Inquiry’s terms of reference include proposing a regulation of these principles.</p>
<p>Principle of freedom of choice</p>
<p>As part of the role of the fund marketplace in achieving the objective of the premium pension system and maintaining the principle of freedom of choice, the Inquiry proposes that the new agency should procure funds with different risk levels and investment approaches on such a scale that the selection of funds in the fund marketplace for the premium pension gives pension savers real freedom of choice. The proposed regulation ensures that freedom of choice in the fund marketplace is maintained.</p>
<p>It is not possible to give an exact definition of what is meant by or should be meant by real freedom of choice, since the meaning of the term is subjective and therefore depends to a great extent on the observer’s values. However, the Inquiry considers that a definition suitable as a starting point is that there should be a freedom of choice that means that the selection of funds is broad enough to satisfy most of the pension savers interested in making their own choices.</p>
<p>The starting point should be generally accepted fund categories in the light of the best industry standards at any particular time.</p>
<p>Principle of sustainability</p>
<p>A fund agreement should, according to the Inquiry’s proposal, contain conditions requiring the fund manager to take account of environment, social responsibility and governance, ‘ESG factors’, in their management. A minimum requirement should be that, in their management, the fund manager shall observe what follows from international agreements Sweden has entered into that concern sustainability issues.</p>
<p>It will be up to the new agency to design these conditions in greater detail in the agreements. Passing this matter on to the new agency makes it possible to adapt the requirement to different methods of taking account of ESG factors in management. It will then be possible to take account of circumstances such as what assets the fund invests in and the size of the fund manager. This kind of regulation also makes it possible to adapt the requirement both to the development of the market and to future legislative changes.</p>
<p>Principle of controllability</p>
<p>One expression of the principle of controllability is that the fund managers and funds that participate in the fund marketplace are covered by licensing requirements and are subject to supervision. The commercial law framework containing regulations about licensing requirements and supervision means that there are possibilities of ensuring that the fund managers and funds participating in the fund marketplace are conducting sound and safe activities. However, since private funds will be admitted to a state fund marketplace that is part of a compulsory social insurance system, it is reasonable for savers to assume that the State is taking a special responsibility for the quality and soundness of the funds that goes beyond what follows from the commercial law framework. Therefore, in the view of the Inquiry, the funds offered in the fund marketplace cannot be considered to be subject to sufficient control in that the fund managers and funds are covered by licensing requirements and subject to supervision.</p>
<p>To ensure that the fund managers and funds meet the requirements for participation in the fund marketplace – and that the range of funds is therefore secured and controlled – the Inquiry proposes that the new agency should audit that the fund managers and funds always meet the conditions of their fund agreements. To be able to conduct this audit, the agency has to receive information from the fund managers. A fund agreement should therefore, according to the Inquiry’s proposal, contain conditions about an obligation for fund managers to provide information to the new agency and to also assist in audit and monitoring work in other ways.</p>
<p>The new agency and the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority have different responsibilities regarding fund managers and funds. Both agencies can benefit from an exchange of information, particularly in terms of effectiveness. Such an exchange of information also increases the protection for pension savers. The Inquiry therefore proposes an obligation for the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority and the new agency to collaborate and exchange information.</p>
<p>If the new agency is to be able to ensure that fund managers and funds are following the conditions of their agreements, it is, in the view of the Inquiry, of crucial importance that there are not too many funds in the fund marketplace. In practice, the possibilities of effective audit set limits on how many funds can be offered in the fund marketplace. Given the number of savers who choose funds in the fund marketplace, there is also a limit to the amount of resources it is reasonable to put into audit and the size of the organisation to be built up for this purpose. The number of funds in the fund marketplace should therefore not be so great that the agency is unable to perform its audit task in a secure and effective way with reasonable resources. In assessing how many funds should be procured for the fund marketplace, the new agency should therefore take account of the fact that it will have to be possible to audit the fund managers and funds in a certain and effective way.</p>
<h2>A regulatory framework for procurement of funds for the fund marketplace for the premium pension</h2>
<p>The Simplification Inquiry’s proposal of simpler and more flexible procurement regulations should serve as a model</p>
<p>When it comes to proposing a new regulatory framework for the procurement of funds for the fund marketplace for the premium pension, the existing procurement acts are natural starting points. There is a value in the rules that apply to a particular area also being designed in a similar way – to the extent that they deal with the same or closely related subjects. With regard to a procedure like procurement, it goes without saying that regulations of a certain kind will always be needed, irrespective of what is being acquired.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the Public Procurement Act – and especially its regulations for procurement in the area not steered by directives – can serve as a model in designing the new regulatory framework.</p>
<p>In June 2018 the Inquiry on Certain Simplified Procurement Regulations (the Simplification Inquiry) presented its report Possible, permitted and accessible – proposals for simpler and more flexible procurement regulations and certain regulations about review cases . The report includes proposals about how the regulations on procurement under the EU thresholds in the Public Procurement Act can be made simpler and more effective. These proposals are currently being processed by the Government Offices.</p>
<p>The remit of the Simplification Inquiry – to propose simpler and more flexible procurement regulations – coincides with the starting points of the regulatory framework for procurement that this Inquiry is tasked with proposing. Moreover, in designing its legislative proposals, the Simplification Inquiry has taken account of what is required under EU law if a contract has a certain cross-border interest.</p>
<p>Against this background, the Inquiry considers that the Simplification Inquiry’s proposal of regulation for procurements under EU thresholds in Chapters 19 and 19 a of the Public Procurement Act should serve as a model for the design of the procedural regulations that should apply to the procurement of funds for the fund marketplace.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the legislative proposals are identical. Some regulations proposed by the Simplification Inquiry have no equivalent in the Inquiry’s proposal. The Inquiry also proposes certain regulations that are specially adapted to the fact that the procurement relates to funds to be offered in the fund marketplace. The regulations are shaped by the requirements that have to be set for the funds procured if the fund marketplace is to contribute to the achievement of the objective of the premium pension system and to maintaining the principle of freedom of choice.</p>
<p>Requirements for the funds to be procured</p>
<p>The premium pension is part of the national public pension and, as such, part of the social insurance system, for which there is a state responsibility. This means there is reason to set particularly high requirements for the funds offered in the premium pension system.</p>
<p>According to the Inquiry’s proposal, the funds procured to be offered in the fund marketplace should be appropriate for the premium pension system. To ensure this, the new agency should set mandatory requirements in the procurements that are aimed at suitability. The term mandatory requirements means requirements that must be met for a tender to qualify for evaluation. If these requirements are not met, the tender has to be rejected. The requirements should be formulated on the basis that the premium pension is a social insurance system and that pension savers should be able to feel high confidence in the premium pension system and the participants in it.</p>
<p>The Inquiry also proposes that the funds procured to be offered in the fund marketplace should be cost-effective, sustainable, controllable and of high quality.</p>
<p>The requirement that the funds should be cost-effective is primarily aimed at the size of the administration fee, but other aspects linked to the fund category that is the subject of the procurement can also be taken into account.</p>
<p>As regards the requirement that the funds should be sustainable the Inquiry proposes, as set out above, that a fund agreement should contain conditions requiring the fund manager to take account of ‘ESG factors’ in their management.</p>
<p>The requirement that the funds should be controllable mainly refers to the complexity of a fund. A fund should not be considered to be controllable if it has such a high degree of complexity that the agency cannot audit it in a satisfactory way with a reasonable input.</p>
<p>The requirement concerning quality has a great deal to do with the fund manager’s ability to generate future returns. This can, for example, cover the fund’s return, risk, return in relation to risk, investment approach and management model, qualifications and experience of those managing the fund, the fund manager’s owner, leadership and organisation, the fund manager’s business models, internal processes and incentive structures and significant events and staff turnover at the fund manager.</p>
<p>If the fund marketplace is to be able to contribute to the achievement of the objective of the premium pension system, it is of central importance that the funds procured to be offered in the fund marketplace meet these requirements. It is up to the new agency to ensure through its design of the mandatory requirements and award criteria in its procurements that the funds procured meet these requirements.</p>
<p>Procedural regulations</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes a number of procedural regulations that should apply to the procurement of funds for the fund marketplace for the premium pension. This includes regulations about notices, procurement documentation, forms of communication, deadlines, information about decisions, documentation, the award of fund agreements and direct awards. In all essential respects the provisions have been designed on the model of the Simplification Inquiry’s proposal.</p>
<p>In addition, the Inquiry proposes that it should be possible to review a procurement of funds for the fund marketplace and the validity of a fund agreement. As part of this the Inquiry proposes provisions on standstill periods, review and damages. In all essential respects the provisions correspond to the provisions in Chapter 20 of the Public Procurement Act.</p>
<p>Fund agreements</p>
<p>The relationship between the new agency and a fund manager will be regulated in the fund agreement, i.e. it will be based on civil law. The Inquiry’s proposals include provisions about the minimum conditions a fund agreement must contain. The term of a fund agreement must not exceed twelve years, according to the Inquiry’s proposal.</p>
<h2>Transition to a procured fund marketplace</h2>
<p>Our terms of reference state that the Inquiry is to propose how the transition from the present fund marketplace to the procured fund marketplace should take place. The transition should be gradual, show care about the needs of pension savers, be cost-effective and lead to as limited effects on the capital market as possible.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that a natural starting point is that the premium pension assets invested in funds that will be covered by a new fund agreement following procurement will not be affected, unless the pension saver chooses to switch funds on their own initiative. The capital invested in a fund that is not covered by a new fund agreement following procurement should be dealt with in the following way: 1. The pension savers who have assets invested in the fund should be given the possibility of deciding within a set period that their assets should be invested in one or more funds in the range of procured funds. 2. If the pension saver does not decide within the stated period that the assets are to be invested in another fund, their assets should be invested in a fund that is essentially equivalent to the previously chosen fund. 3. If there is no equivalent fund, the assets should be invested in the default option. 4. If there are special reasons, the assets may be invested in the default option without the pension saver first being given the possibility of deciding how to invest the assets.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that this proposal balances the trade-off required between the interest of taking account of all pension savers’ choices and ensuring that the transition to the procured fund marketplace is carried out effectively. The proposal also provides good conditions for procuring funds of high quality for the fund marketplace.</p>
<h2>An agency for a procured fund marketplace to be formed by giving AP7 additional tasks</h2>
<p>Our terms of reference state that the Inquiry is to propose a new agency tasked with procuring funds and managing the fund marketplace for the premium pension. Our terms of reference also state that the agency should be regulated by law and have an independent standing in relation to the Government corresponding to that of the AP Funds.</p>
<p>In addition, our terms of reference state that the Inquiry should, at least, present a proposal in which the agency is organised as an independent agency and a proposal in which the agency is led by a committee that is co-located with the Swedish Pensions Agency outside the County of Stockholm.</p>
<p>Experience of past and present organisational solutions in the premium pension system</p>
<p>Since 1998 the responsibility for the premium pension system has been organised in different ways and in different agencies. So, there is experience of how different organisational solutions have worked and the organisational solution chosen should draw on the lessons of this experience.</p>
<p>At present the Swedish Pensions Agency is responsible for the administration of the whole of the national public pension, including the premium pension. Previously this responsibility was divided between the Swedish Social Insurance Agency and the now wound up Premium Pension Authority (PPM). Since the introduction of the premium pension system the management of the default option in the premium pension has been handled by AP7.</p>
<p>The experience of past and present organisational solutions shows how important it is that the organisational solution proposed brings together the knowledge, administration and control of the premium pension system in as few agencies as possible. In addition, information about the whole of the pension system needs to be held together. The administration should be characterised by high expertise and professionalism.</p>
<p>Gathering capital managing tasks in one agency generates considerable efficiency and quality gains</p>
<p>The Inquiry notes that there are numerous tasks of a capital managing nature in the premium pension system. This applies to management of the default option in the premium pension system, capital management in the traditional insurance, management of the fund marketplace in the premium pension by among other things procuring funds, and management and development of the choice architecture of the premium pension system.</p>
<p>The Inquiry makes the assessment that considerable efficiency and quality gains result from gathering the responsibility and competence for these closely related tasks in one agency.</p>
<p>The alternative stated in our terms of reference have clear disadvantages</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s assessment the organisational proposal presented needs to be able to deal with all the tasks identified, perform its mission independently of both the Government and other government agencies and conduct its activities efficiently and with good quality.</p>
<p>Neither of the alternatives stated in our terms of reference – a new independent agency with a more limited mission or a committee agency – fully lives up to all the above criteria. The Inquiry considers that it is difficult to conduct cost-effective operations in a new independent agency with the more limited mission stated in our terms of reference, just as it is difficult to conduct suitable operations independently of the Government in a decision-making committee. The Inquiry therefore presents another organisational proposal.</p>
<p>Form an agency through additional tasks for AP7 …</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes forming the agency by giving AP7 additional tasks. In addition to its present task of managing the default option in the premium pension system the agency should also be responsible for managing the fund marketplace of the premium pension by, among other things, procuring funds, to deal with the capital management in the traditional insurance on behalf of the Swedish Pensions Agency and manage and develop the choice architecture of the premium pension system by issuing regulations on the design of the choice architecture.</p>
<p>The other tasks in the premium pension system should be performed by the Swedish Pensions Agency. These tasks include fund administration and fund information, presenting the choice architecture, on the basis of the new agency’s regulations, in the Swedish Pensions Agency’s interface to pensioners and pension savers, following up the objective of the premium pension system and administering the traditional insurance, excluding the practical conduct of its capital management. … which changes its name to the Agency for the Premium Pension’s</p>
<p>Fund Management</p>
<p>When AP7 is given additional tasks, the Inquiry proposes making a change of name to the Agency for the Premium Pension’s Fund Management. The change of name marks that this is a new start with significantly expanded tasks. It also avoids confusion with the other AP Funds.</p>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the new agency’s activities should be regulated by law. This means that the new agency will have an independence in relation to the Government comparable to that of the AP Funds. With regard to the activities currently conducted by AP7, the new act should contain provisions largely corresponding to those in the AP Funds Act (2000:192).</p>
<p>The Agency ought to be financed from several different sources. The fund managers finance the management of the fund marketplace, including the audit and procurement of funds. The management of the default option in the premium pension system is financed by those savers who choose the default option. Other activities are financed via drawings from the premium pension system.</p>
<p>The Government will not be able to steer the range of funds</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s organisational proposal means that the agency will be independent in relation to the Government concerning which individual funds are selected for the fund marketplace since: 1) the procurement procedure is regulated by law; 2) its activities are solely financed by fees that are decided by, and used by, the agency; 3) the agency’s fundamental organisation is decided by law; and 4) the head of the agency is appointed by its board. Furthermore, the agency will manage and develop the choice architecture. The design of the choice architecture very much steers the design of the fund marketplace, including the number of funds. Because the agency is responsible for the strategic design of the choice architecture, the Government will not be able to influence what individual funds are offered on the fund marketplace through it either.</p>
<h2>Secrecy and processing of personal data</h2>
<p>According to our terms of reference, the Inquiry is to analyse whether the existing provisions of the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act give the parties to these agreements the secrecy protection needed.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s assessment is that no further secrecy provisions are needed to protect public interests. However, supplementary secrecy provisions are needed to protect information about the personal and financial circumstances of individuals.</p>
<p>Under the Inquiry’s proposals, secrecy would apply at the new agency and the Swedish Pensions Agency to information about business or operational circumstances of a private individual or other financial or personal circumstances when the private individual has entered into a business relationship or a similar relationship with a fund manager that is participating or has participated in a procurement of funds if it can be assumed that the individual will suffer harm if the information is disclosed. It is proposed that secrecy should apply to information in an official document for at most twenty years.</p>
<p>In the Inquiry’s assessment secrecy should not have priority to the right to communicate and publish information according to the Freedom of the Press Act and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression.</p>
<p>The Inquiry makes the assessment that the provisions of the Data Protection Regulation and the Data Protection Act are applicable to the agency’s processing of personal data. The Inquiry’s view is that no further provisions about the processing of personal data are needed.</p>
<h2>Entry-into-force and transitional provisions</h2>
<p>The proposed statutes enter into force on 1 January 2021, according to the Inquiry’s proposal. Older provisions should apply to fund agreements entered into with fund managers before 1 January 2021.</p>
<p>The new agency should work to ensure that the present fund marketplace has been wound down and replaced by a procured fund marketplace by 31 December 2023.</p>
