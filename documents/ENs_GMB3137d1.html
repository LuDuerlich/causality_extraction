<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Planning and construction period</h2>
<p>In the summer of 1991, the Government assigned the National Rail Administration to construct a tunnel through the Hallandsåsen ridge in Southwestern Sweden. This project is part of the west-coast rail link between Gothenburg and Malmö, and comprises 14.5 km of new track, of which 8.6 km is tunneled (double tunnel, with one track in each direction, 25 metres apart). The decision to build a tunnel was preceded by discussion, studies and investigations which commenced in 1975, or earlier. In the mid-1980s, this process was intensified when a group of senior executives of major European companies presented a report on ”Missing Links”, describing a number of specific projects to eliminate bottlenecks in the European transportation system. In addition to discussing a fixed link between the UK and the Continent, the report also examined the question of a ”Scan Link” to improve transportation between Oslo and Germany. Free movement of goods was not enough – goods also had to move rapidly.</p>
<p>Regional and local authorities and various organizations in Sweden were also working for a tunnel solution. When the Rail Administration circulated its report to public authorities and other organizations for comment in 1990, there were no objections to the project as a whole.</p>
<p>The Hallandsåsen ridge is a primary horst formation consisting of rock with many fissures, partly converted into clay. It is considerably more aquiferous than most primary rock formations in Sweden, which makes the area on the ridge and the Bjäre peninsula highly suitable for the cultivation of vegetables. Considerable use is made of water resources for irrigation purposes. The Hallandsåsen ridge and the neighbouring coastal area are considered to be of national interest and are protected by law – in other words this area is regarded as unique. Interests relating to the countryside and outdoor life must be taken into account when assessing whether any disturbance of the environment is to be permitted. The area is also protected against measures which may harm the natural or historic environment. This is a traditional countryside area, with archeological remains and, in a Swedish context, a considerable measure of biological diversity. Hallandsåsen and the surrounding area have had national status as a tourist site for many years.</p>
<p>Some investigation of the environmental impact was undertaken prior to commencing construction operations. In the main, such considerations focused on the measures required to prevent disturbance of local residents, for example by providing fencing to reduce noise and tripleglazing for windows. In principle, rail transport was considered to be environmentally friendly. It addition, trains would pass under these protected areas, not through them.</p>
<p>Construction of the tunnel commenced in October 1992 and, in accordance with the initial contract, was due to be completed by December 1996. It was estimated that the cost of construction would be SEK 1,250 M. Construction ceased in October 1997 when approximately one third of the total main-tunnel stretch had been blasted, at a cost of more than SEK 1,000 M.</p>
<h2>Construction stopped</h2>
<p>The immediate reason for stopping construction was that the water seeping out of the tunnel had a high acrylamide and N-methylacrylamide content. The contractor had taken samples of the water following complaints by workers. It also proved that cows which had drunk seepage water became paralyzed and fish died in a breeding facility in one of the water courses into which seepage water was released.</p>
<p>Acrylamide is a substance which has serious effects on health. Nmethylacrylamide is less toxic. Both substances are components in the Rhoca Gil grouting material used to seal the tunnel surfaces. By the time construction ceased, a total of 1,400 tonnes of ready-mixed grouting had been used which, it is estimated, corresponded to approximately 140 tonnes of acrylamide and N-methylacrylamide. These toxic substances had been dispersed with the seepage water, but had also penetrated the ground water. A total of 29 wells in the area were polluted in this manner.</p>
<p>As a result of the release of these toxic substances, it was also found that construction operations had caused a greater drop in ground-water levels than had been anticipated. This was primarily because the tunnelsealing techniques employed prior to the summer of 1997 had not been successful. Rhoca Gil was used in an attempt to find other methods of sealing the tunnel. The ground-water problem had, in fact, been critical for some time. Prior to commencing operations, the Rail Administration requested permission to drain off 33 litres of water per second from the entire tunnel, and this was approved by the Water Rights Court. Since the rock formation contained many fissures and was aquiferous, this called for substantial sealing operations. The original intention was to inject concrete into cracks in the surface of the tunnel. However, it soon became apparent that this method was not feasible, since adequate sealing could not be achieved, despite the application of considerable quantities of concrete. At times, the water take-up amounted to 70 litres a second.</p>
<p>Sealing problems were the main reason for the delay in construction, and the tunnel also proved to be much more expensive than originally estimated. There were other problems too, however. The original procurement process which was completed in 1992 was based on use of a giant drilling machine to cut the tunnel. Investigations indicated, however, that equipment of this nature was not appropriate in view of the geological circumstances. This was confirmed when the drill came to a standstill after 13 meters of tunnelling, and blasting techniques had to be used. This failure had financial consequences which the original contractor proved unable to handle. As a result, a new procurement process was initiated on terms which were less favourable for the National Rail Administration. A new working tunnel was built from the peak of the ridge down to tunnel-level, in order to speed up the construction process. This permitted operations to be carried out on four tunnel faces simultaneously.</p>
<h2>After construction ceased</h2>
<p>When the discharge of toxic substances was reported in October 1997, the extent of their dispersal in the water system was not known. The subsequent turbulence placed local inhabitants and municipal politicians in a difficult position. The municipal emergency plan was put into effect. Samples of the municipal water supplies were taken immediately and preparations were made for transporting water supplies. The crisis management team made an initial broadcast on the local ”Radio Båstad” channel, and an information office was set up. A preliminary risk zone was established and, a few days later, central government authorities issued recommendations regarding the suitability of drinking or using water supplies, and the possible risk involved in eating meat or vegetables from the area concerned. Eventually, the state of emergency ceased, and in January 1998 the Municipality was able to return to its normal operational structure. One of the difficulties experienced was that there were no sufficiently sensitive certified/approved methods for analysing the acrylamide content in water supplies. As a result, the risk zone classification could not be removed until March 1998.</p>
<p>Construction of the tunnel has resulted in the initiation of legal proceedings, including legal proceedings instituted by regional and local authorities. More than ten persons have been summoned on charges of suspected breaches of environmental and working environmental legislation, the Water Act or the Act on Chemical Products.</p>
<p>In view of what had occurred, on 20 October 1997 the Government decided to appoint an official Tunnel Committee. The Committee was assigned to report on the environmental and working environment issues related to the project, to evaluate the reasons for the damage and the inconvenience suffered, and to evaluate the way in which working environment tasks had been organized and the manner in which factual information and information to the public had been handled by the authorities and other parties. In addition, the Committee was to propose measures to avoid similar incidents in the future. We have not been assigned to express views on matters concerning responsibility and compensation, which may be subject to consideration by the courts.</p>
<p>The Committee presented an interim report on 15 May 1998 (SOU 1998:60) which reported on the effects of commencement of tunnel construction operations from certain health and environmental aspects, the decisions and events which had caused these effects and the manner in which the critical situation which had occurred had been handled. The report also outlined the planning process and briefly described geological and technical factors in relation to construction of the tunnel.</p>
<h2>Impact</h2>
<p>A report by the Institute of Environmental Medicine (IMM) commissioned by the Committee indicates that acrylamide is toxic in the event of skin contact or when consumed orally by drinking. In addition, it can damage the nervous system and cause cancer and hereditary genetic damage. N-methylacrylamide is less toxic and the oncogenic effect is much weaker than in the case of acrylamide. Grouting operations using Rhoca Gil were conducted in a manner which resulted in exposure to acrylamide and N-methylacrylamide. Some 20 of the 223 workers who were medically examined immediately after cessation of construction were diagnosed as suffering from peripheral effects on the nervous system, for example in the form of irritation/numbness in their arms or legs as a result of exposure to these substances. When this examination was followed up in the spring of 1998, nine workers continued to experience discomfort. A new medical examination is due to take place in October/November 1998. Since exposure to these substances occurred for a relatively limited period, it was considered that the risk that these workers would suffer other ill-effects or develop cancer were either zero or negligible.</p>
<p>As far as people living in the neighbourhood were concerned, exposure primarily took the form of polluted water supplies. In all, water from 310 wells was analysed. Acrylamide/N-methylacrylamide was detected in 29 cases. When it was established that the discharge of these toxic substances had occurred, the Municipality started to supply drinking water by tanker to households in the risk zone which had their own wells. A total of 196 persons from 75 households in the area were examined between 10 October and 6 November 1997. Some of these individuals were members of households which had polluted wells and, in addition, some of them had been in contact with polluted water in streams. However, the majority of those examined had only been in contact with polluted water in streams. In several cases, skin or stomach complaints of recent origin were reported. However, when evaluation of these complaints was completed, there was considered to be no correlation between exposure to toxic substances and these complaints. It was considered that people living on or close to the Hallandsåsen ridge had not been subject to any physical health risks.</p>
<p>A report prepared by the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) at the Committee's request indicated that seepage in the tunnel was at a rate of 55 litres/second when construction ceased. The highest seepage rate was noted at the northern face, where the ground water had dropped by 100 metres. During the winter of 1998, water levels rose as a result of the build-up of ground water during the winter months. In March 1998, the reduction in the water level at the northern face was 75 metres.</p>
<p>SGU also conducted an outline model study from which it drew conclusions about the situation anticipated in the future and the possibilities of restoring ground-water levels. Ground-water conditions in the event of completion of the tunnel were studied, allowing for the seepage permitted by the Water Rights Court, and also the effects of full sealing of the tunnel sections which had been completed. If the tunnel is completed in accordance with the water rights permit, which allows for a maximum seepage of 33 litres/second, there would be gradual drainage of the rock formation until equilibrium was achieved which might take 10 years, according to SGU. The permanent reduction in the groundwater level might then be expected to be in excess of 10 metres within an area of approximately 25 km , with a reduction of more than 20 metres in the immediate vicinity of the tunnel. If full sealing is achieved, on the other hand, the ground-water would recover its original level within two to three years.</p>
<p>These issues were also investigated by the National Rail Administration's consultants and by the Environmental Analysis Group, a research group financed by the National Rail Administration and Skanska [the contractor]. The results presented by SGU attracted considerable attention, since the reduction in ground-water levels anticipated by SGU in the event of the seepage permitted by the Water Rights Court was significantly greater than the conclusions drawn in the other reports. The Committee's final report indicates the reasons for these differences. Even a detailed model provides a highly simplified picture of reality. In addition, the results of calculations depend, for example, on the values selected to describe the way in which the soil and rock formations affect water flows and water storage. The report contains a description of the model-building process and factors subject to uncertainty in this type of estimation.</p>
<p>The interim report also considers the risk of possible changes in vegetation in the area. Only two of the most sensitive areas were checked prior to commencement of construction, however. No comprehensive inventory of the entire area was undertaken prior to 1997, when it was planned to monitor changes in vegetation over a four-year period. Until this task is completed, it will not be possible to draw any definite conclusions about the potential long-term impact on the ecological system.</p>
<p>The report also describes the effects on commercial operations in the district, especially agriculture. In addition to problems of access to water supplies, some farms had to slaughter their stock. In all, 370 animals were slaughtered and destroyed. Nine suppliers of milk were excluded from milk collection services and a total of 330,000 kg of milk had to be disposed of. Vegetables and root-crops were dumped and, for a time, growers found it difficult to sell their produce. The National Rail Administration and Skanska appointed a claims adjustment group relatively quickly, after pollution was reported. This group has considered claims by private individuals and businesses as a result of the tunnel project. So far, approximately SEK 26 M has been paid out.</p>
<p>In our final report, we analyse and evaluate the manner in which the Hallandsåsen project was reviewed and approved by the licensing authorities, monitored by the supervisory authorities and implemented by the authority assigned to carry out the construction operation, that is say the National Rail Administration.</p>
<p>The new Swedish Environmental Code will enter into force on 1 January 1999. We have tried to assess the implications of the Code – assuming a situation in which the Code was applied to the Hallandsåsen project.</p>
<h2>Investigation and licensing process</h2>
<p>The question of whether the study on which the track report and the associated environmental impact analysis were based was sufficiently comprehensive is a matter for discussion. In any event, the conclusions reached may be questioned. The ruling pronounced by the Water Rights Court indicates a considerable margin of error – a factor of five to ten times – as regards the conclusions drawn about the possible impact of the tunnel on ground-water levels. However, the reason that groundwater levels dropped more than anticipated is that the technology employed was inappropriate for construction operations in the Hallandsåsen ridge. Until Rhoca Gil was introduced, efforts were made to seal the tunnel surfaces with concrete, although this technique proved ineffective. Prior to this, the Rail Administration had contracted for tunneling operations using giant drilling equipment, but this technique had not been successful. The various failures cannot be primarily considered to be due to deficiencies in the study of the impact on the ground water. The events that occurred were primarily due to inadequate control and management of the project. Broadly speaking, supervision operations functioned in an acceptable manner, based on the available resources and possibilities, but they failed to prevent the incident. We will return to the question of supervision at a later stage.</p>
<p>The Government considered the permissibility of the project, for example from an environmental perspective, in accordance with the current legislation, within the framework of the expropriation issue. However, the Government had already approved the project in a previous decision taken nine months earlier. The extent to which there was an interest in analysing the environmental aspects in an unprejudiced manner or developing alternative solutions may therefore be questioned. The environmental impact analysis to which the Government had access was inadequate. The problems were described as ”challenges” which would be tackled successfully. The National Rail Administration used the study to legitimize the project, not to minimize the impact on the environment. No alternatives were indicated.</p>
<p>There is a need to counterbalance the dominant role of the applicant when determining the scope and contents of an environmental impact assessment. The Environmental Code gives the County Administrative Board an important role in this process. In the future, central government may well take decisions on other major infrastructure projects in the wrong order – that is to say decisions arrived without proper investigation. The manner in which the requirements for an environmental impact assessment are determined is a crucial issue. An environmental impact assessment must contain adequate and relevant alternatives. This is essential if the potential problems are to be impartially analysed and the priorities between the environment and other interests clearly established. The Committee proposes that the most environmentally friendly alternative should always be reported, at least in the case of operations and measures which may be expected to have a significant environmental impact.</p>
<p>The dominant position of the applicant may be counterbalanced by an impartial review and/or by strengthening the position of other parties. The Committee has studied the way in which this problem has been solved in the Netherlands, where an impartial, independent Committee reviews environmental impact assessments, and participates in the decision process regarding the scope of the assessment in a specific case. We consider that the Dutch solution is worth studying, although we are not prepared to propose the establishment of a new institution for this purpose.</p>
<p>The Environmental Code gives the general public greater opportunities to influence the investigation process. In addition, it extends the interested parties concept and gives environmental organizations an opportunity to present their case. The absence of a natural advocate for environmental interests is a problem in this context. Everyone, and no one, is in favour of the environment. In addition, independent studies and assessment of the documentation presented by the applicant calls for resources. The Committee has considered the possibility of establishing an environmental ombudsman/advocate function and introducing the right to appeal against a decision to approve an environmental impact assessment. Both these questions were discussed in the course of the drafting of the Environmental Code. In view of this, we are not prepared to propose measures of this nature, prior to evaluation of the new arrangements under the Environmental Code.</p>
<p>The Railway Construction Act entered into force in 1996. Under the Act, the National Rail Administration determines plans for rail facilities, including its own plans. This means that the Rail Administration acts as its own supervisory authority. This will not change when the Environmental Code and certain amendments to the Act enter into force in 1999. Once the Government has determined the permissibility of a major rail project, the National Rail Administration decides the scope of the permit and the conditions which are to apply. Under the Environmental Code, the Government is to determine the permissibility of a number of specified major projects which are considered to have a significant impact on the environment. Permits for such projects are granted by the Environmental Court, with the exception of railways, roads and certain navigation channels, for which environmental review is partly conducted by the authority concerned. We propose that this procedure should be amended and that any project which is subject to a Government decision on permissibility must also be considered by the Environmental Court.</p>
<h2>Supervision</h2>
<p>The Committee has also considered action taken by the supervisory authorities before it was established that an accident had occurred. There may be some scope for criticism, but on the whole the supervisory process was conducted more or less as might be expected in view of the opportunities and resources at the disposal of the supervisory authorities. However, the conclusion drawn is that, given current resources and the current regulatory structure, supervisory activities normally have limited opportunities of preventing serious environmental impact of the type which occurred in the Hallandsåsen ridge, at any rate as regards the discharge of toxic substances. The authorities must be able to take action more rapidly and more effectively. The circumstances in this instance were special since the County Administrative Board and the Municipality were responsible for ensuring that a central government authority which had been commissioned by the Government implemented a project in accordance with the relevant legislation and permits.</p>
<p>The County Administrative Board was responsible for monitoring water aspects, and there was a control programme for water seepage. Losses were measured on a continuous basis and certain tests were carried out to determine the chemical composition of the water. In accordance with the Water Rights Court's ruling, the water released was supposed to be of fully satisfactory quality, based on assessment by the County Administrative Board. The starting point for this assessment was the natural quality of the water in the water courses into which seepage water was released. As a result, it is surprising that the control programme was not modified when large-scale use of Rhoca Gil commenced. As regards the volume of ground water lost, the County Administrative Board in Kristianstad pointed out, as early as the summer of 1995, that it considered that the permitted volume was being exceeded. The National Rail Administration had a different opinion about the way in which the permit granted by the Water Rights Court should be interpreted. In addition, the flow of water seems to have varied. However, both the supervisory and the National Rail Administration must have realized that the permitted volume would be exceeded if a better sealing method was not found. Following an attempt to impose a default fine on the National Rail Administration in 1996, the</p>
<p>Country Administrative Board initiated legal proceedings in February 1997. The prosecutor planned to visit the construction operations for the first time on 7 October 1997.</p>
<p>On 14 August 1997, when the County Administrative Board and the Municipality were informed that Rhoca Gil was to be employed, the Municipality decided to ascertain the risks in more detail. However, there was a delay of three weeks before the National Chemicals Inspectorate was contacted by letter. This might have resulted in an injunction to use a less hazardous grouting material. Before this stage was reached, however, acrylamide and N-methylacrylamide had polluted the water in streams, wells and the ground water.</p>
<p>Supervisory authorities have a considerable burden of responsibility in the case of major projects in which a single day's delay involves substantial costs. It is difficult for regional and local authorities to act when a central government authority does not live up to its environmental responsibilities and fails to respect the permits granted. Nonetheless, in our opinion the County Administrative Board could have adopted a more determined attitude. We propose that supervisory authorities review their routines as regards the demarcation lines between the exercise of authority, providing advice and information, and assistance and promotion activities.</p>
<p>The supervisory authorities did not have very much time in which to react since the National Rail Administration failed to inform them of the use of Rhoca Gil until ”large-scale” experiments were already under way. We propose that, in similar situations, users should be obliged to notify their plans to the supervisory authority. In the interests of improving supervision, we also propose that the National Environmental Protection Agency should be given a broader role and greater responsibility.</p>
<p>The Environmental Code strengthens the role of the municipality as a supervisory authority, although it may be difficult for small municipalities to have the requisite expertise in the chemical sphere. We therefore suggest that municipalities which wish to do so should be able to transfer supervision of chemicals to county administrative boards.</p>
<h2>Management and control</h2>
<p>The decision to build the tunnel was taken by the Government, which then assigned the project to the National Rail Administration. The Government (Ministry of Transport and Communications) was informed that there were major problems in connection with the ground water and that this would lead to additional costs of SEK 800 M. Despite this, the project was not one of the matters raised in the discussion of objectives and results between the Ministry and the Administration which took place in April 1997, and it appears that the problems reported by the Rail Administration were not raised in other informal contacts either.</p>
<p>The Rail Administration's board did not receive sufficient information, and it failed to query further information when it was notified that the permit granted by the Water Rights Court was being exceeded and that costs were rising. The Administration's organizational structure was based on the principle of delegation of responsibilities and authority to the lowest possible level in the organization. It has been difficult to ascertain how the problems which occurred were reported back to higher levels in the organization. Faced with an increasingly hopeless situation, there was growing pressure on those who were immediately responsible, and many people appeared to have been waiting for someone else to solve the problems.</p>
<p>The studies conducted by the National Rail Administration were primarily used to justify the project, rather than as a basis for its decisions. The Administration failed to take its consultant's advice on the question of the wisdom of trying to drill a tunnel through the ridge. On other occasions, the Administration failed to obtain relevant information. The attempt to drill a tunnel resulted in substantial delay and considerably higher costs, and the Administration's efforts to save time by commencing operations on a central face involved a serious negative impact on the environment. The Administration's accounting system was not compatible with the needs of the project, which probably made it difficult to monitor project costs.</p>
<p>The failures encountered in the project must be primarily regarded as the result of deficiencies in management and control. Furthermore, in its efforts to maintain progress on the tunnel, the Administration neglected its responsibilities as a government authority serving the interests of the general public.</p>
<h2>Environmental management and expertise</h2>
<p>As a result of the problems experienced in this project, there is a need to focus on environmental management competence and expertise on the part of those involved in the construction operation. We assigned KM Miljöteknik AB to investigate the effects of the introduction of an environmental management system on the environmental process in large construction projects. The problems involved in this particular project have sounded an alarm bell in the construction industry, and the major construction companies are introducing environmental management systems for their site operations. In December 1997, the Government directed the National Rail Administration to introduce an environmental management system. The customer's competence is particularly relevant for the manner in which environmental issues are handled in the procurement process. The Administration had however a routine for evaluating chemicals which had not been used previously, but this routine was not applied in the procurement process for Rhoca Gil.</p>
<p>Environmental management systems result in increased environmental know-how and they clarify the responsibilities involved. There is, however, some contradiction between the need for an environmental management system and the rules which govern public procurement procedures. The procurement rules are an aspect of EC law and, as a result, cannot be modified unilaterally. We therefore recommend that Sweden should work for public procurement rules which take environmental considerations into account to a greater extent.</p>
<p>Broader and more extensive expertise on the part of construction companies is called for, and public-sector customers in the construction industry must take greater responsibility for environmental issues in their sector. We therefore propose that the public administrations in the Swedish transport sector should be assigned to initiate, manage and finance development programmes. A greater measure of expertise is important, both as regards the external environment and the working environment.</p>
<h2>Working environment</h2>
<p>We commissioned the National Institute for Working Life to evaluate working life activities at Hallandsåsen. A protective structure has been established to provide working environment safeguards for employees at their place of work. The tunnel project, however, is an example of a situation in which the regulatory structure, per se, does not guarantee that working environment aspects are taken into account in a satisfactory manner.</p>
<p>The problems caused by the use of Rhoca Gil were the result of a chain of errors and mistakes. There was no adequate analysis of the risks, and the relevant expertise was lacking. The information provided by the supplier was incorrect and was not checked. The safety organization, company heath care services and trade union representatives were not sufficiently involved. If the risks had been evaluated in advance and then followed up during the course of the project, these problems could have been avoided. This should be mandatory at the planning stage in major projects. Potential environmental problems must be discussed. In view of the deficiencies revealed in this project, there are grounds for reviewing the current regulatory structure.</p>
<p>Suppliers of chemicals are liable to provide correct and exhaustive information about their products. The experience gained in the Hallandsåsen project indicates, however, that such information may be misleading and inadequate and that the purchaser/user must be able to check its reliability.</p>
<h2>Contingency planning and information</h2>
<p>We have analysed the way in which the factual information and information activities were handled by public authorities and other parties in connection with the release of toxic substances, and we have also looked at the way the emergency organization functioned. Our conclusions are based on the Committee's interim report and four other reports prepared by the sociology faculty at Lund University.</p>
<p>Once it became clear that toxic substances had been released at Hallandsåsen, attention was focused on the Båstad Municipality. Faced with an unaccustomed situation which was problematical in many respects, the Municipality was obliged to take a number of more or less sensitive decisions. The general public had to be informed quickly, and on a continuous basis. The Municipality was able to cope with the situation, although this involved an exceptionally heavy workload and external assistance. However, in our opinion the functions and allocation of responsibilities of the management chain of command (the Government, the Director of the Regional Civil Defence Area, county administrative boards, county councils and municipalities) should be reviewed as regards severe stresses in a peacetime situation. Principles for the manner in which central government bodies should assist other public authorities need to be established.</p>
<p>There was an immediate need to establish contact with central government authorities for advice concerning water supplies. This was not achieved until the County Governor of Skåne wrote to the authorities concerned requesting that coordination personnel should be assigned to the management group. We therefore propose that central government authorities should appoint specific individuals for contacts with municipalities, county administrative boards and public authorities with operational responsibilities.</p>
<p>The central government authorities concerned retained primary responsibility in their respective areas. The National Food</p>
<p>Administration and the National Board of Health and Welfare issued recommendations regarding the use of water supplies, but they assessed the risks in different ways. Experience of the Hallandsåsen incident indicates the importance of consultation between public authorities if their responsibilities coincide. All those involved should endeavour to ensure that information to the general public is unambiguous by explaining and clarifying any statements made. We understand that several government authorities are reviewing their emergency planning in the light of the Hallandsåsen incident. We see no reason to propose a special joint emergency plan for central government authorities, although practice/training to prepare for similar incidents is required.</p>
<p>The lack of a sufficiently sensitive method of analysis to detect the presence of acrylamide presented a major problem. An approved method for the analysis corresponding to the WHO benchmark was not available until March 1998. The National Food Administration and National Board of Health and Welfare recommendations were based on the WHO standard. It may be concluded that it is not satisfactory to rely entirely on the commercial market for the development of new analysis methodology. This problem might also have occurred when construction was in progress if, for example, the County Administrative Board wished to modify the control programme for seepage water in line with the sealant which was actually being used. The question of responsibility for the development of analysis methods should therefore be studied, both in the context of urgent requirements and in more normal circumstances.</p>
<p>The Båstad Municipality managed to acquire a certain degree of public confidence during the crisis in terms of information to the general public, although many people regarded the Municipality as partly responsible for the situation. After it initiated legal proceedings against the National Rail Administration and Skanska, it would appear that, in the end, the Municipality wound up ”on the right side”, in the eyes of the public. The media were generally considered to be ”on the side of ordinary citizens”. The surveys conducted indicate that, for the most part, media coverage received a highly positive rating. Above all, the local press won the confidence of local inhabitants.</p>
<h2>Proposals</h2>
<p>Most of our proposals have already been presented above. In the interests of clarity, they are summarized below. However, we wish to emphasize that the most important conclusions drawn relate to the way the project was managed, and that no proposals are made in this area.</p>
<h2>Permits and permissibility</h2>
<p>· Environmental impact assessments must always include the best possible alternative from the environmental perspective, at any rate in the case of operations or measures which may be assumed to have an appreciable impact on the environment. · All major infrastructure projects must be subject to environmental review by the Environmental Court.</p>
<h2>Supervision</h2>
<p>· Supervisory authorities should review their routines as regards drawing clear demarcation lines between the exercise of powers of authority, the provision of advice and information, and assistance and promotion activities. In particular, a distinction must be made between tasks involving the exercise of powers of authority and other tasks. · The Ordinance concerning Environmental Sanction Fees should be supplemented to permit the imposition of sanction charges on commercial interests which ignore permit requirements or exceed the conditions established for water operations. · The possibility to introduce an obligation for users to notify the supervisory authority of  large-scale use of chemicals should be investigated. · Municipalities should be permitted to transfer responsibility for the supervision of chemicals to county administrative boards. · As a central government supervisory authority, the role of the National Environmental Protection Agency should be studied as regards the possibility of following up environmental tasks performed by other national authorities and combines. This function would, for example, include reporting to the Government on an annual basis as regards performance of this function, responsibility for coordination, advice and information, with the object of making environmental tasks performed in the various sectors more effective.</p>
<h2>Environmental expertise</h2>
<p>· The public administrations in the transport sector should be assigned to initiate, manage and finance development programmes to improve environmental expertise in the construction sector, including contractors in this industry. In our opinion, a development programme of this nature should include  in-service training of the personnel concerned and feedback of experience gained in the field. It might be appropriate to conduct this programme in cooperation with technical universities, other university institutions and the Council for Building Research. · We recommend initiatives to achieve better environmental compliance of EC legislation in the procurement area to permit special requirements to be introduced regarding the need to take environmental considerations into account in connection with the procurement of goods and services.</p>
<h2>Working environment</h2>
<p>· A thorough risk analysis and discussion of potential working environment problems should be required when major projects are planned. Experts should be consulted at the planning stage, particularly if operations involve the use of chemicals on a large scale or other circumstance involving a high degree of risk. In view of the deficiencies revealed in the Hallandsåsen tunnel project, there are grounds for reviewing the adequacy of the existing regulatory structure. · It must be possible for the purchaser/user to evaluate and check product information submitted by suppliers. The National Institute for Working Life has indicated a number of issues which should be examined more closely in this context (Which entity should check the information? What responsibility will the chemical industry take via its trade associations? Are public authorities or other control functions to be responsible?). We share the views expressed by the Institute for Working Life, and would like to place special emphasis on the obligations of the private sector in this context.</p>
<h2>Contingency planning and information</h2>
<p>· The functions and allocation of responsibilities of the management chain of command (the Government, the Director of the Regional Civil Defence Area, county administrative boards, county councils and municipalities) should be reviewed and clarified as regards severe stresses in a peacetime situation. Principles for the manner in which central government bodies provide expert support and other assistance need to be established. This also applies to way in which these bodies are to achieve the necessary degree of preparedness for such situations as a result of training exercises.</p>
<p>· Central government authorities should appoint specific individuals for contacts with municipalities, county administrative boards and public authorities with operational responsibilities.
