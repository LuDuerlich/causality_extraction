<h1>Summary and proposals</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The remit of the Inquiry was to investigate possibilities to promote access, participation and influence for individuals and actors in Sweden with regard to matters decided within the EU. The overall aim has been to contribute to democratic development in line with the democracy policy objective to strengthen the individual’s opportunities to exert influence.</p>
<h2>Built-up need for change</h2>
<p>In a healthy democracy, anyone wanting to influence political decisions, visions and choices must have the possibilities to do so. Today, these possibilities vary depending on where decisions are taken. Individuals and organised interests have poorer prospects of accessing and influencing political issues decided at EU level than issues not connected to the EU. As more and more issues are decided at European level, this imbalance has increased.</p>
<p>To some extent, the imbalance is due to the fact that it is sometimes more difficult to influence a large and complex political system such as the EU than a smaller system such as the Swedish one. However, policies adopted at EU level can be influenced, besides via the EU’s institutions, through several different national channels that are currently not sufficiently open and inviting. Despite</p>
<p>Sweden’s more than 20 years of EU membership, the Swedish political system has not changed in a way that fully enables citizens to take advantage of existing channels in Sweden. Nor does public debate in Sweden help to give visibility to policies at European level. A large part of what is often referred to as the EU’s democratic deficit is, in fact, a Swedish democratic deficit.</p>
<h2>Lack of knowledge</h2>
<p>A fundamental problem is the widespread lack of knowledge  in society about the relationship between the Swedish democratic system and the EU. Insufficient knowledge is particularly serious among groups that disseminate knowledge about democracy and politics. Many elected representatives and officials in municipalities, for instance, find it difficult to explain how municipal activities relate to decisions at EU level. Many journalists feel uncertain of how the EU works. In schools, teachers say that they steer clear of the EU in connection with democracy lessons due to their own inadequate knowledge. Not even university lecturers in political science feel familiar with the EU.</p>
<p>The basic knowledge a citizen needs to gain insight into and have the opportunity to influence policy is greatly lacking. Such knowledge includes a basic understanding of how decisions are adopted in the European Union, a grasp of the fact that both Swedish parliamentary elections and elections to the European Parliament, albeit in different ways, are about choosing representatives who will adopt decisions in the EU, appreciation of the fact that a large proportion of decisions adopted by the Riksdag are a direct result of decisions adopted at EU level, and an understanding of which issues are decided at each level. Better knowledge is needed to improve the opportunities for individuals and other interested parties to question, make further inquiries, make their voices heard and demand accountability.</p>
<p>In addition to the lacking knowledge, there are two overarching trends that, ever since Sweden’s accession to the EU, have had a negative impact on and amplified the imbalance in the opportunities for access, participation and influence. One trend concerns power shifts and altered roles for the political institutions. The second trend concerns the absence of public debate on EU-related matters – an absence that appears to be growing over time.</p>
<h2>Power shift</h2>
<p>One trend concerns the power shifts  that have gradually taken place in Sweden as a result of EU membership. First and foremost, the Government has gained more legislative power, at the expense of the Riksdag, concerning issues decided in the EU. From a democratic standpoint, this power shift entails greater responsibility for the Government to continuously communicate developments and consult with society ahead of and during  the legislative process. This is not done to the full today. In the context of EU-related issues, for example, a consultative procedure that enables interested parties outside the Government Offices to contribute viewpoints to the legislative work is normally applied after  the new EU legislation has been adopted and when all that remains is national implementation. At that point the opportunities to actually influence the EU decision itself are largely non-existent. Few reforms have been implemented to increase individuals’ and interested parties’ access to and participation in politics ahead of and during the Government’s legislative work in the Council.</p>
<p>Government agencies have also gradually gained increased power to influence both the formulation and implementation of EU decisions. This has led to an increasing grey zone of blurred division of responsibilities between ministries and government agencies. It is often up to the agency to decide the scope of its EU-related outreach information and to determine if and when interested parties in the wider community should be invited to take part in a dialogue on the current legislative process at EU level. Some agencies opt for a minimal approach and, in doing so, obscure a large part of agencies’ power of formulation with regard to EU-related matters. As a result, the wider community’s access, influence and chances of demanding accountability become obstructed.</p>
<p>At regional and local level, EU membership has also altered democratic conditions. Far away from Brussels and often far away from Stockholm as well, the EU affects citizens in their daily lives via municipalities and county councils/regions. Local elected representatives and their administration are often the day-to-day interpreters and those who, in practice, implement decisions adopted by the European Union. They also carry out advocacy work on behalf of their inhabitants – individually or via associations, such as the</p>
<p>Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions – to influence political processes in the EU. However, very few municipalities have considered how their altered role should be reflected in the democratic process. In many municipalities, there is no political debate or dialogue with voters and other interested parties on how municipalities should conduct their EU-related work.</p>
<h2>Political silence</h2>
<p>The second trend concerns the seemingly more and more peripheral role of the EU in the public debate . There are several indications that actors with the greatest chances of exerting influence on the public debate – political parties and the media – increasingly refrain from explaining the connection between national policy and the EU. Although a large part of activities in the Riksdag and the Government are related to political decisions at EU level, political parties rarely debate EU-related issues. In addition, the media generally do not convey the political options or dividing lines in current EU issues. So-called conflicts are rather presented as if the disagreement lies between Sweden and the EU, or Sweden and other EU countries. This is particularly problematic from a participatory perspective, as dividing lines in many issues rather denote that different interested parties in Swedish society have differing views on political solutions at EU level. When these political dividing lines are not visible in the public debate, this also reduces the possibilities for individuals and organised interests to find out about, take a position on and influence issues.</p>
<p>The overall picture is that – apart from internal discussions in political institutions and administration – there is essentially a political silence in Sweden regarding policies at EU level. A more lively public debate, more than anything else, would improve democratic conditions for access to and participation concerning issues decided at EU level. If political parties and the media to a greater extent helped to introduce the EU into the public debate, the knowledge deficit would decrease and opportunities for participation and influence would increase.</p>
<p>A lively public debate cannot be commanded into existence. For this reason, it is important that public institutions take greater responsibility for conveying information, conducting dialogues, and raising knowledge levels in society in other ways. This may also improve the conditions for future public debates that better reflect how many major (and minor) political decisions are taken.</p>
<p>In this report, we clarify and take a more in-depth look at parts of this problem in individual chapters and propose measures in three overarching areas: measures to improve knowledge , measures to increase opportunities for access and participation , and measures to improve access to information . All three areas have mutual points of contact. If the measures are correctly implemented, they can reinforce each other and increase overall opportunities for broader participation in issues decided at EU level.</p>
<h2>Measures to improve knowledge</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s terms of reference set forth the ambition that should guide all knowledge providers: that the understanding of the EU’s decision-making processes should be on a par with that of national decision-making processes. The knowledge overview we present in Chapter 3 shows that this is far from the reality today. Various forms of knowledge-enhancing measures – in schools and the broader education system, as well as among other knowledge providers such as elected representatives, officials and journalists – are important instruments to ensure better conditions in the long term for broad public participation.</p>
<p>Compulsory and upper secondary school education seldom provides adequate knowledge about the importance of the EU for democracy and individuals’ opportunities to exert influence. For this reason, we propose measures to strengthen the ongoing continuing education for teachers  in EU-related subjects and to further clarify compulsory and upper secondary school policy documents  with regard to the responsibility of schools to include the EU in their teaching. We also propose that the Government should support schools in arranging school elections to the European Parliament .</p>
<p>Furthermore, we propose that teachers at journalism programmes in Sweden  should be offered special courses focused on journalistic work on EU-related issues and that the Government should facilitate professional training courses on the European Union for practising journalists .</p>
<p>We also propose that municipalities and county councils/regions should work to ensure that elected representatives and officials  have a high level of EU expertise, with the help of professional training courses that will increase knowledge and awareness of the EU’s significance at the local level and where opportunities for citizens to access, participate in and influence EU-related issues is a key theme.</p>
<h2>Measures to promote access and participation</h2>
<p>The dialogue that the Government, its agencies and municipalities conduct with the wider community concerning EU-related issues is often sporadic or does not take place at all and is often informal in character. In addition, it often takes place at a late stage in the legislative process when there are few, if any, opportunities to exert influence. This means that it is difficult for individuals and other actors to gain insight into which EU-related issues are current and what the possibilities are to influence and participate, directly with regard to EU institutions and via central and local government actors who take part in EU legislative work and implementation.</p>
<p>The Government should bring forward and strengthen its dialogue with stakeholder organisations and other actors regarding its ongoing work in the Council, for instance during its preparatory work that takes place alongside the European Commission’s development of legislative proposals and ahead of negotiations in the legislative process. We therefore propose that the Government set up a new procedure which means that interested parties outside the Government Offices would be invited to take part in special EU preparatory groups  for all important issues expected to lead to new EU legislation. Early collection of viewpoints would also simplify the Government’s formal referral and consultation process at a later stage.</p>
<p>We also propose that the Government create forms for national electronic consultation  in connection with preparatory legislative work in the EU. Legislative processes at EU level expected to result in legal instruments to be incorporated in Swedish legislation should furthermore be described and summarised in EU memorandums  which would be published in a special series. In addition, the Government should always report viewpoints obtained from the EU preparatory groups and electronic consultations as part of its information to the Riksdag.</p>
<p>We also propose that the Government, in its instructions to government agencies, clarify government agencies’ consultation responsibility  in its EU-related work, and that government agencies create formal and transparent consultation forms for issues decided at EU level.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we recommend that municipalities and county councils/regions increase the scope of dialogue and consultation  with local and regional interested parties and other actors in EU-related activities and work actively to illustrate that many EU-related issues are part and parcel of democracy at municipal level.</p>
<h2>Measures to improve access to information</h2>
<p>There is a need for better access to information concerning EU- related issues. This includes information that provides basic knowledge about how political decisions are taken at EU level  and how political decisions that concern the EU are taken in Sweden , and ongoing information activities concerning the political content in current processes and their outcomes. Information needs to be available well before decisions are taken and must be comprehensible to generally interested citizens in terms of language and content.</p>
<p>In a broad social context, political parties and the media have by far the most important role in disseminating information. We have already mentioned measures to improve journalists’ knowledge of</p>
<p>EU-related processes.</p>
<p>In addition, we propose that the Government Offices create an</p>
<p>EU portal  on government.se that will present the Government’s</p>
<p>EU policy and all important ongoing processes, including EU legislative work. We also recommend that activities at the EU Information Centre of the Swedish Parliament  – which has in recent years been given lower priority and been reduced in scope – be restored to the level that prevailed until 2012.</p>
<p>We also propose that the Government, in its appropriation directions, clarify government agencies’ information responsibility  with regard to EU-related tasks. We also recommend that municipalities carry out measures to provide better information  on how local and regional democracy is integrated with policies at EU level. In conclusion, we propose that the Swedish Institute for European Policy Studies  (Sieps) strive to contribute more clearly to an in-depth debate in society concerning subjects raised in Sieps publications.</p>
