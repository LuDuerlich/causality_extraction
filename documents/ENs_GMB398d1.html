<h1>Summary in English</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>The report presents experiences gained from and views on the rules relating to merger control in the Competition Act (1993:20). Considerations concerning the need for and design of legal provisions of this type are also presented. The conclusions include: · that control of concentration between undertakings by means of competition law is still needed · that the Swedish control rules should be designed with the corresponding Community Law as a model · that the scope of the control should not be altered · that the general obligation of notification should be retained in principle but should to a certain extent be modified · that there is a requirement for a more informal procedure during the Competition Authority's preparatory handling of cases dealing with mergers · that strict confidentiality rules are necessary for the initial, informal procedure.</p>
<p>Terms of reference</p>
<p>We have in earlier reports compiled experiences of and views on the general design and application of the Competition Act (KL) and submitted proposals for amendments to the law in some parts. This is contained in our earlier report (SOU 1997:20) the Competition Act 1993 - 1996.</p>
<p>In accordance with an additional directive to the commission, KL's rules concerning merger control are dealt with in this report.</p>
<p>Arguments for and against merger rules in KL.</p>
<p>We have tried to elucidate the scientific economic, theoretical and empirical, grounds for rules relating to merger control. This has mainly been done through expert studies. These studies confirm that concentration between undertakings in some cases have effects that from society's point of view ought to be counteracted. As a whole, the studies do however give a clear picture of the difficulty in stating generally applicable grounds and specific rules for an examination procedure.</p>
<p>All in all, the material that has emerged from the expert studies and otherwise in our deliberations supports the opinion that legal provisions concerning concentration between undertakings are still needed.</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that provisions on merger control should also in future be included in KL. Taking into consideration the uncertainty that exists concerning economic assessments and the effects of various measures, only larger concentrations should be examined. Furthermore, intervention should only take place in cases that are of considerable economic weight from the society point of view and when a relatively safe appraisal of the concentration can be established.</p>
<p>How should the rules be designed?</p>
<p>We have not found any particular solutions in other national laws which should be used as a basis for amending KL. Against this background, we are of the opinion that there are two main alternatives for the design of the material contents of KL´s merger rules: · to retain the general form of the current rules · to model rules in the closest possible conformity with Community Law</p>
<p>An argument in favour of retaining the current rules is that the concept of company acquisition is comparatively clearly defined and has been elucidated by the Competition Authority in many cases. One argument against this concept is that it may be regarded as too narrow, since it does not include all concentration measures. Further, it also embraces acquisitions which are not interesting from a control point of view.</p>
<p>Some of the arguments for basing the legislation on the concept of concentration are that market power and damaging effects can be created by other means of concentration than transfer of ownership, that the concept of concentration is established in Community Law, that its application in that system has not - as far as is known - created any major problem, that the Swedish national competition legislation in other areas already is to a considerable extent modelled on Community Law, that an increased harmonisation with Community Law terminology most likely facilitates the application of the concentration control rules in the national system as well as in the Community and also the co-operation between national and Community authorities, which is presumed in the Community system.</p>
<p>Also the application problems that now exist in connection with examination of joint ventures and ancillary restraints will to a large extent be eliminated on an adjustment to Community Law.</p>
<p>We propose that KL's merger rules be adjusted and modelled in accordance with Community Law.</p>
<p>Scope of control</p>
<p>As in the present system, the control of concentration between undertakings must be seen as an exceptional measure and only major concentrations should be subject to investigation.</p>
<p>As for the question of defining the scope of application of the control, it is proposed that the present construction with a threshold value in the form of a turnover limit is retained. This rule is comparatively easy to apply, both for the competition authorities and the undertakings concerned.</p>
<p>The limits of application should be set out in the law. It appears from a legal technical point of view to be less appropriate to include in the provisions of law any exception to the various types of concentrations that could be assumed to be without any importance from a competition point of view. For these cases we propose a solution which includes a simplified notification and processing procedure.</p>
<p>Some criticism has been directed against the level of the turnover limit, four billion Swedish crowns. Proposals have been submitted for increasing of the limit. However, the survey of companies active within the country, and of merger activity in the period 1993 – 97, that has been carried out at the instigation of the commission, does not at present provide a basis for any proposal for adjustment of the level of this turnover limit.</p>
<p>Appraisal criteria</p>
<p>The present Swedish system for control of acquisitions has - modelled on Community Law - been designed to make it possible to intervene against acquisitions that are deleterious to competition and the national economy. The appraisal criteria set out in the law must, in all essentials, also be regarded as corresponding to the appraisal criteria in force under Community Law.</p>
<p>With reference to the above mentioned we have not found any reason to propose any other appraisal criteria (34 § KL).</p>
<p>Should the obligation of notification be abolished?</p>
<p>KL introduced provisions - modelled on Community Law - which include a limited scope of application and a general obligation of notification.</p>
<p>The proposals we put forward imply a further adjustment of KL's principal provisions concerning merger control to Community Law.</p>
<p>Against this background, we conclude that strong arguments appear to be required for reintroduction of a system where no general obligation to notify exists.</p>
<p>Arguments for a system with general obligation of notification with time limits are, in particular, the saving of time and that a certain formal stability is achieved in the control system. Also the subjective assessment of the Competition Authority with respect to the obligation of notification is limited in this case, which improves the predictability and legal certainty in the control system. Another advantage with this system is that the Competition Authority at an early stage can receive information about a merger. The system also counteracts the emergence of a situation where the acquiring company attempts to surprise the Competition Authority by immediately integrating the acquired company in its business.</p>
<p>The arguments that may be advanced against a system with a general obligation of notification are that the obligation of notification is combined with extensive requirements for providing information to the Competition Authority, which may make a notification complicated and expensive for undertakings.</p>
<p>However, it could be argued that the extent of the inconvenience that the obligation of notification causes undertakings has to a large extent been reduced by the amended rules that apply from 1 July 1997.</p>
<p>A system for control of concentrations which does not include provisions for a general obligation of notification presupposes rules for voluntary notification. Such a system also presupposes that the Competition Authority has sufficient collected knowledge in order to enable the Authority to appraise cases in a speedy manner. The question of how a notification in such case should be constituted contains several problems concerning, among other things, form and content of the notification, time limits and legal effects. Furthermore, a system with voluntary notification will also lay a considerable burden on undertakings in terms of obligation to submit information.</p>
<p>A simplified notification procedure – where the submission of information in certain cases may be limited to some essential information – is already feasible under the present procedure and can also be expected to include a considerable number of mergers that fall under the obligation of notification.</p>
<p>In addition to this, a procedure which facilitates for more informal contacts between the Competition Authority and the undertakings concerned can be assumed to contribute to a reduction of the burden to provide information and also reduce the processing time. In this connection we emphasise the importance of introducing such a procedure.</p>
<p>Against this background, we have not found strong enough arguments to propose a repeal of the general obligation of notification.</p>
<p>Some criticism has been directed against the present procedures resulting in many acquisitions without importance to competition and the national economy falling within the general obligation of notification.</p>
<p>As regards the general obligation of notification, it is noted that the number of acquisitions notified during the second six months of 1997 is less than half of the number of cases notified during the corresponding period of 1996 and the first six months of 1997 respectively. Also, the Competition Authority has not found any reason to request the acquisition parties to notify any acquisition.</p>
<p>Against this background, we propose a certain further restriction of the general obligation of notification. We propose that § 37 KL be worded so that a concentration should be notified to the Competition Authority if 1) the undertakings concerned had an aggregated turnover in the preceding financial year in excess of four billion Swedish crowns and 2) at least two of the undertakings concerned carry on business within the country and had, in that business, a turnover in the preceding year in excess of 200 million crowns for each of the undertakings.</p>
<p>The need for more informal procedures</p>
<p>Many times concentrations of undertakings falling within the scope of application of the competition law affect matters of considerable public interest and large economic values. Economic turnover normally places great demand on expeditious and efficient processing of such cases. Therefore, there are in the interest of both the public and the trade and industry that procedures for control of concentrations of undertakings are purposefully designed and function in the most efficient way and with legal certainty.</p>
<p>A system providing increased scope for more informal processing in cases concerning concentration, and which provides increased room for informal contacts between the Competition Authority and the undertakings concerned in the individual case, appears to be an absolute necessity in order to make processing more efficient in these cases.</p>
<p>It would be appropriate to leave consideration of the more detailed design and application of such procedures to the Competition Authority. In this context it can be observed that the Community Law procedures with so-called pre-notification could, where applicable, provide a model. Also the more informal processing methods used in USA and the United Kingdom could provide some guidance in this respect.</p>
<p>Both the provisions of the Freedom of the Press Act concerning public documents and the provisions of the Secrecy Act as regards confidentiality may, however, considerably hamper the possibility of a more informal processing system, mainly as regards the possibilities of informal contacts between the Competition Authority and the undertakings concerned. det, och</p>

<p>Artikel 2.1 lyder:</p>
<p>Artikel 2.4 lyder: 3.5.1.1 Dominerande ställning ”The concept of a dominant position is defined in settled case-law as a position of economic strength enjoyed by an undertaking which enables it to prevent effective competition being maitained on the relevant market by giving it the power to behave to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors, its customers and ultimately of its consumers”.</p>
<p>Marknadsandel ”...the existence of a dominant position may derive from several factors which, taken separately, are not necessarily determinant but among these factors a highly important one is the existence of very large market shares...The view may legitimately be taken that very large shares are in themselves, and save in exeptional circumstances, evidence of a dominant position.” ”A dominant position can generally be said to exist once a market share in the order of 40 to 45 per cent is reached. Although this share does not in itself automaticlly give control of the market, if there are large gaps between the position of the firm concerned and those of its closest competitors and also other factors likely to place it in an advantage as regards competition, a dominant position may well exist. Strengthening by means of a merger is likely to constitute an abuse if any distortion of the resulting market strukture interferes with the maintenance of remaining competition /.../ or its development. Such an effect depends, in particular, on the change in the relative market strength of the participants after the merger, i.e. the position of the new unit in ralation to remaining competitors” 3.5.1.2 Relevant marknad - utbytbarhet på efterfrågesidan - utbytbarhet på utbudssidan - potentiell konkurrens</p>
