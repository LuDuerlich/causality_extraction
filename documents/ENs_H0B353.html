<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit of the Inquiry</h2>
<p>The Buffer Fund Inquiry (Fi 2011:11) has been asked to present a proposal on measures to improve the conditions for long-term and more cost-effective management of the buffer capital of the national pension system. This capital is currently managed by the First–Fourth AP ( allmänna pension  = national pension) Funds and the Sixth AP-fund. The operations of these funds are regulated by the AP-funds Act (2000:192) and the Sixth AP-fund Act (2000:193). The remit of the Inquiry has been to evaluate mandates, investment rules, guidelines, structures and fund management based on the need for more effectiveness and changes in the surrounding economic and financial environment. Particular analysis has been made of the objectives, mandate and investment rules of the Sixth AP-fund. It has not been part of the Inquiry’s remit to review the overall role of the buffer capital as a buffer fund in the national pension system. The Inquiry has made its considerations within the framework of the five-party agreement, which states that the buffer capital is to have purely financial objectives without regard to industrial or economic policy. Furthermore, the funds are not to hold a controlling interest as owners of Swedish listed companies. Finally the fund management is to be conducted independently of each other, especially in the case of shares issued by domestic listed companies.</p>
<p>The remit includes conducting a comprehensive analysis of alternative fund management forms and capital management structures to find a structure and create a framework that provide for the greatest possible benefit to the financing of the pensions system, while allowing operations to be conducted appropriately and cost-effectively.</p>
<h2>The buffer capital is part of the national pension system</h2>
<p>The buffer capital was established in connection with the national supplementary pension reform in 1959, when three national pension funds were established. The reason for establishing three funds was to avoid a concentration of power, whether it be of state or private interests. Since then, the funds have enjoyed a relatively independent status. In 1972, the Fourth AP-fund was established with the task of investing in Swedish companies.</p>
<p>The current AP-fund Act, which entered into force on 1 January 2001, emerged in connection with the implementation of the major pension reform adopted by the Riksdag (Swedish parliament) in 1998 in a five-party agreement. The main intention of the reform was to move from a defined-benefit system to a selffinancing, defined-contribution system in which pensions are adjusted according to growth in the rest of the economy.</p>
<p>The First–Fourth AP-funds were given new and identical investment rules and, compared with previously, greater fund management freedom and autonomy in relation to the Government and the Riksdag. The Sixth Fund Board, which was named the Sixth AP-fund, became the fifth buffer fund, but was allowed to retain its special investment profile.</p>
<p>At the end of 2011, the total buffer capital corresponded to approximately SEK 870 billion. At the same time, the capital of the funds is part of a pension system that has total assets of SEK 7700 billion, which means that at the end of 2011 this corresponded to approximately 12 per cent of the pension system balance sheet.</p>
<p>According to the Swedish Pensions Agency the buffer capital is expected to decrease over the next thirty years as the generation born in the 1940s enters retirement. Even now, with the current level, the buffer capital has limited ability to influence balancing on its own, but in times when the pension system is financially relatively weak, i.e. with a balance ratio close to one, positive contribution from the fund management can be significant for the pension system. With a declining capital base, the buffer capital will account for a smaller share of the total assets. The role of the buffer capital as a demographic buffer, by contributing to the financing of the pension system, depends on its ability and capacity to generate returns on the funds’ portfolios. This is achieved through a structured investment process and conscious risk-taking. A minimum level for returns is to exceed the income index over a defined time horizon. The income index corresponds to the growth of average income and steers the upward adjustment of pensions. If returns exceed the growth of the income index, this means that the buffer capital is contributing positively to the financing of the pension system. However, based on the long-term role of the buffer capital, and the fact that high returns contribute even more to the financing of the pension system, the level of ambition should be higher.</p>
<h2>Part of global financial markets</h2>
<p>The management of the buffer capital, based on its mandate and objectives, means being one of many actors on the global economic and financial markets. The financial markets have developed considerably during the past 10 to 15 years and this Inquiry is being presented in the midst of a financial and debt crisis which has involved and will bring major changes in both the domestic and the global capital markets. The conditions and the external environment for the current AP-funds have thus changed considerably since the introduction of the current legislation.</p>
<p>Since the mid-1990s, the number of pension funds and institutional investors worldwide, and their assets, have tripled, which means there are several hundred other institutional investors that are larger or of equal size as the total buffer capital competing with the AP-funds for competencies and investment opportunities. This must be seen in light of the expected reduction of the buffer capital during the coming decades.</p>
<h2>Identification of problems and development needs of the buffer fund system</h2>
<p>Effective governance of pension fund management has significance for the returns and financial results. Structural failings and potential problems with current structures are affecting the ability of the buffer funds to achieve a high level of returns after expenses.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals are aimed at improving the prospects of achieving higher returns to benefit the pension system by: – clarifying the mandate and investment objectives of the buffer capital and its link to the pension system; – clarifying the division of responsibility between the asset  owner  and the asset managers ; – reforming board appointment routines and clarifying the responsibilities and powers of board members; – considering how the fund management competence of the current boards can be increased; – considering how the investment rules can be made more flexible and adequate; – studying the arguments for dividing the buffer capital between several funds with identical investment mandates and examining alternative solutions; – reviewing the role of the Sixth  AP-fund in the pension system.</p>
<h2>The buffer capital’s role and investment objectives</h2>
<p>The main role of the buffer capital is to act as a buffer in the income-based 1 st  pillar national pension system. In times when pensions disbursed are greater than pension contributions, funds will be drawn from the capital. Inversely, the capital will grow if contributions exceed expenditures. Thus, the pensions can be maintained at a long-term sustainable level during years of strain on the system.</p>
<p>The objectives of the Act with regard to investment activities do not provide adequate guidance on determining appropriate risk tolerance and expected returns for the management of the buffer capital. It is necessary to set an investment objective for the management of the buffer capital based on the financial position of the pension system and prevailing market conditions. This issue is central to the governance of the buffer funds. The Swedish Pensions Agency has important knowledge of the pension system and should therefore participate to a greater degree in the analysis of appropriate risk tolerance and expected returns for the management of the buffer capital within defined time horizons.</p>
<p>The investment objective must be clear and provide a basis for evaluating the management. Depending on demographic and economic factors that influence the financial position of the pension system, the objective of management may vary over time.</p>
<p>A firmly rooted investment objective for the management of the buffer capital will enable the evaluation to distinguish the pension system’s mode of operation (balancing mechanism) from the performance of the fund management. This in turn allows a form of asset management that can utilise the comparative advantages of taking a true long-term approach. However, a principal responsible for the fund management is a prerequisite, which is currently lacking. The absence of a principal who can take a holistic perspective affects the legitimacy of the system.</p>
<p>To justify building up a buffer capital, returns on the buffer capital must at least exceed the upward adjustment of the liabilities in the pension system (income index). This can be a starting point in analysing the formulation of the fund management mandate with regard to returns and risk.</p>
<h2>Governance of the current AP-funds</h2>
<p>In formal terms, the current AP-funds are mutually independent state agencies on which the Government has limited influence. The Act states that the Government only exercises influence by: appointing boards, including chairs and vice chairs, determining remuneration and other forms of compensation to board members, appointing auditors, adopting the income statement and balance sheet of the funds and evaluating the management of funds on the close of each year.</p>
<p>The role of the buffer capital is to be a buffer for the pension system so that contributions can be held constant over time. This role should not be confused with the state agency role of the AP-funds, which is to manage the buffer capital based on the provisions of the Act.</p>
<p>Currently, the AP-funds shall themselves interpret the general provision of the Act on the objective of investment activities in terms of a more concrete, measurable objective. (The funds are their own principals.)</p>
<p>In the latest annual evaluations, the Government, which initially following the reform evaluated and expressed a positive view of the objectives set by the funds, has not detailed its opinions regarding the commitments of the pension system or the different investment objectives set by the AP-funds. It is remarkable that the Government has not evaluated the objectives set by the funds for their operations during the past decade considering the turbulent period there has been in the financial markets with altered market conditions.</p>
<p>The current structure of the AP-funds makes it difficult within the funds to organisationally separate the decision on the investment objective from the overall operational decisions on fund management. The AP-funds have not achieved the organisational separation between the decision-maker and implementer of fund management investment objectives.</p>
<p>The mutual autonomy of the funds precludes the funds from taking joint responsibility for the role of the buffer capital in the pension system.</p>
<p>The unique position of the AP-funds among government agencies has resulted in neither the Government nor the Riksdag taking principal responsibility for the operations of the AP-funds in general.</p>
<p>The funds are free-standing from each other and independent of the Government and the Riksdag in decisions on strategic and tactical allocation. The mutual independence of the funds does not preclude them from cooperating in other areas, if this is perceived as cost-effective, for example in securities administration, information technology, financial administration and human resource services. However, this has not taken place to any degree.</p>
<h2>Structure of asset management</h2>
<p>Asset management is a matter of making active investment decisions on portfolio construction and market exposure. The most important decision for management results is the total risk level of the management, which determines the division between different assets in the portfolio.</p>
<p>The AP-funds have advantages which distinguish them from other investors, such as good liquidity and the ability to take a long-term approach. It is likely that the risk level and the composition of different risks in the portfolio need to be altered over time depending on the financial position of the pension system, which supports the idea of not locking capital into strict indexing – or any other strategy. The Inquiry considers that decisions on active or passive market exposure should be based on the professional assessment of the asset manager and on expected risk-adjusted net returns.</p>
<p>In-house asset management is often cheaper than external management in terms of costs, however this does not automatically mean higher net returns. If net returns from in-house management are to be as good as or better than those of external management, it is essential that adequate asset management competence can be recruited and retained. The ability to build up in-house competence depends on the organisation’s attractiveness. Advantages of inhouse management include reduced dependence on external suppliers of financial services and analysis. Disadvantages can include reduced flexibility for strategic and organisational changes. The Inquiry considers that this is a decision to be taken by the management of the asset management organisation based on its mandate and circumstances.</p>
<p>Studies and experience clearly show that there are clear economies of scale with regard to expenses for fund management and administration. The findings are not as clear-cut with regard to the assertion that there are economies of scale for net returns in general, this depends on management style and asset class.</p>
<p>A disadvantage of managing a larger fund is the difficulty of taking on board strategies that are based on investments in smaller market niches (primarily domestic) or on the ability to quickly adjust the portfolio. With regard to a larger fund, studies clearly indicate much better returns in alternative asset classes.</p>
<p>Available studies also indicate that in-house management is cheaper than external, which indirectly would indicate that there are some scale benefits of building up an in-house asset management organisation.</p>
<p>A larger fund is also better able to attract competence, which is crucial for success in the ever increasing global competition.</p>
<p>With regard to the buffer capital, whose comparative advantage is its ability to have a long-term approach, the advantages of managing a larger fund are considered to outweigh the disadvantages.</p>
<p>The concern over market influence that existed when the current AP-fund system was established is less relevant today. Globalisation in general and the development of the Swedish stock exchange has meant that the buffer capital operates in another environment than was the case then. A joint buffer capital that is well diversified with regard to asset class, risk profile and geography should therefore not cause any problems of market influence on the Swedish stock exchange.</p>
<p>Diversifying the capital across four AP-funds with the same mandate does not automatically lead to the buffer capital as a whole being well-diversified, on the contrary. If anything, the current structure is costly for the pension system, from a risk-adjusted returns perspective. The Inquiry considers that diversification which takes into account the total risk to the buffer capital as a whole should be based on an analysis of the entire buffer capital.</p>
<p>The competition between the four AP-funds has if anything had a negative influence. The management of the funds has become much the same. It has been more important that results do not deviate from the other funds in the short term than to implement a deliberate long-term strategy. Competition among the funds has also contributed to a misdirected focus on their internal costs.</p>
<p>Concern over political influence on the management of the buffer capital is important and is shared by other pension reserve funds around the world. In other countries, the desire for politically independent management has been met through clear governance models and limits on powers and accountability.</p>
<p>Apart from the division into several funds, the owner influence of the AP-funds is limited by not permitting ownership of more than 2 per cent of the Swedish stock exchange and 10 per cent of any individual company. With occasional exceptions, actual investments have steered well clear of these limits during the lifetime of the funds. The Inquiry believes that this indicates that the ambition of the AP-funds has been to act as financial investors in the best interests of the pension system.</p>
<p>Division into four independent funds can reduce political influence, but it can also have the opposite effect because of underestimated responsibility and the difficulty of presenting a united front against political influence.</p>
<p>A key aspect for the effective governance of an organisation is how homogeneous or heterogeneous it is. In general, a homogeneous structure facilitates decision-making and is therefore presumed to result in more effective governance. A heterogeneous structure with specialised departments and different interests makes it more difficult to reach consensus on decisions and therefore produces less effective governance.</p>
<p>Other aspects are the number of departments in the organisation and the degree of separation between the departments.</p>
<p>A structure in which capital is divided into a heterogeneous structure with specialist funds is theoretically attractive, but has a number of problems in practice. The need for a department with overall responsibility for risk control and allocation means the structure can rather be viewed as one(1) fund with structural lockins.</p>
<p>A homogeneous structure can comprise one or more funds with identical mandates. Crucial to the choice of the number of funds is the evaluation of the risk of power concentration versus economies of scale.</p>
<p>There are of course alternatives in which a homogeneous and heterogeneous structure can be combined. Such solutions can be attractive in theory but involve a number of difficulties that need to be resolved in practice.</p>
<h2>Responsible investment</h2>
<p>The management of the buffer capital should be conducted in a responsible manner that takes sustainable development into account and therefore shows consideration for future generations. Via its role as a financial investor and owner, fund management can influence companies in the direction considered to benefit the pension system in the long term. In earlier preparatory materials, it is stated that the AP-funds are to take ethics and the environment into account in their investments without negatively affecting returns. In the report of the Committee on the ethical and environmental responsibility of the AP-funds (SOU 2008:107), it is proposed that the provisions of the preparatory materials are included in the Act and that basic values should be developed on which the operations of the buffer capital be based. Like the Committee on the ethical and environmental responsibility of the AP-funds, the Inquiry considers that there is a need for a common and living set of basic values for buffer capital management.</p>
<p>However, the Inquiry does not share the Committee’s view that the preparatory text requiring the funds to take environmental and ethical considerations into account should be incorporated in the Act, since there is a risk that these will quickly become obsolete and may limit future higher ambitions. In the assessment of the Inquiry, it is preferable if ethical and environmental considerations are given a prominent place in the work to develop a common set of basic values for the fund management. The basic values should clarify what environmental and ethical considerations should guide the investment operations, and what trade-offs have been made in relation to benefits for current and future pensioners. The Inquiry considers that the deeper integration of ethical and environmental considerations in fund management is one of several factors in the ambition to create good conditions for the long term effective management of the buffer capital.</p>
<h2>Investment rules</h2>
<p>Current investment rules for the AP-funds arose out of a concern to ensure politically independent fund management and limit risktaking with the buffer capital. The investment rules are based on the regulations and financial models that set the tone at the end of the 1990s. The development of the financial markets in the 2000s has forced investors to question the link between risk and returns for different types of assets. What has been successful over the past 10 years will not necessarily continue to be so in the future. It is therefore inappropriate to set quantitative investment rules that are not in line with economic development. As a result, the current investment rules for the AP-funds have not always fulfilled their aim of limiting risk.</p>
<p>The insufficient flexibility has made it difficult for the funds to diversify risks, which means some portfolios could provide higher risk-adjusted returns were they given greater degrees of freedom. The investment rules were inspired by the rules for private pension companies at the time. Their regulations have now been replaced with other types of guidelines, which further underscores the need for also modernising the guidelines for the future management of the buffer capital.</p>
<p>Unlisted assets have become a more common feature of institutional fund manager portfolios. In the 1990s and 2000s, returns on private equity investments have been particularly high, benefiting investors who were both early and successful in their fund management selections. Because of the 5 per cent limitation rule, the First–Fourth AP-funds have limited ability to invest in unlisted assets which potentially could diversify portfolio properties and increase risk-adjusted returns. Some of the potentially high returns are due to the greater diversification across successful and less successful investments which places increased demands on the investment organisation. Increased exposure to unlisted assets therefore requires a professional organisation with the relevant competence.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has considered whether the reasons for quantitative investment rules are still valid or whether qualitative rules are possible (the prudent person principle). Parts of the prudent person principle – duty of loyalty, risk diversification and payment preparedness – are contained in the current Act. However, these do not have a prominent role in the discussion of investment provisions since the quantitative provisions of the Act are more conspicuous. The more process-oriented parts of the prudent person principle are absent from the current Act.</p>
<p>A fundamental obstacle to the introduction of the prudent person principle for the funds under the current arrangements is that they decide the objectives for their own fund management themselves.</p>
<p>Quantitative investment rules risk becoming outmoded as the financial markets rapidly evolve with new types of assets and investment instruments, and thus they are more inclined to contribute to poorer risk control, contrary to the intention. Removing the quantitative guidelines will give the management of the buffer capital the flexibility to better utilise its comparative advantages of being a long-term pension reserve fund. However, such a transition presupposes a clear investment objective and effective governance.</p>
<h2>Cost-effectiveness</h2>
<p>The greatest potential for cost-effective buffer capital management comes from creating an effective and well-functioning governance model which allows a relevant fund management organisation and conditions to secure the best possible competence, risk model and investment process for the benefit to the pension system and prevailing conditions in the capital markets. This is more difficult to achieve if the capital is divided into several independent funds, than if the capital is managed by a cohesive entity.</p>
<p>Each of the current AP-funds seems to have low costs from a national and international perspective, given the mandate of the funds. However, the focus on their internal costs has to some extent prevented the funds from building up the necessary specialist competence in-house and making sure that resources exist to create effective fund management organisations within different areas of the different funds. Each AP-fund board is responsible for assessing, reviewing and evaluating on an ongoing basis the chosen fund management strategy, organisational structure, and associated costs. In this context, it seems remarkable that the active fund management has not been more clearly re-evaluated and altered to a greater extent, given its weak contribution to the total results.</p>
<p>The AP-fund system of several mutually independent and autonomous funds creates structural costs by quadrupling, among other things, fund management competence, IT systems and other support functions. If the administration and management of the entire buffer capital is gathered in a single entity with a more cohesive and appropriate management organisation it will be possible to achieve cost-efficiency gains of at least SEK 200 million per year. At the same time, this will free resources and create conditions to ensure a more appropriate organisation that is sufficiently broad and has the necessary specialist competence in several important areas.</p>
<p>Limited conditions exist for achieving equivalent efficiencies with several autonomous buffer funds sharing IT systems and other support functions to a greater extent than currently.</p>
<h2>Sixth AP-fund</h2>
<p>The weak historic returns of the Sixth AP-fund show that direct investment in unlisted companies in an institutional setting is very difficult. Private equity investment is a complex craft and successful recipes are very difficult to replicate, which explains why established and experienced institutions have long been prepared to accept high levels of compensation to successful private equity managers.</p>
<p>The chances of building successful direct investment operations within the framework of the Swedish buffer fund system are very small. The desired level of risk capital exposure is better achieved through funds and co-investment.</p>
<p>The buffer fund system should not contain any mandatory allocation of capital to domestic risk capital. Should the Swedish business sector’s access to venture capital need to be strengthened or supported, it should be supplied via efforts outside the pension system.</p>
<p>Winding up the Sixth AP-fund would mean that a relatively large source of capital would disappear, most of which is dedicated to Swedish risk capital. Thus the sector’s dependence on foreign capital would increase while, all other things being equal, actors that are not internationally competitive, and companies that other risk capital actors do not want to invest in, would lose an important financier. This is from a perspective where access to state risk capital is seen as comparatively good.</p>
<p>Regarding the companies that would go without financing in the absence of the operations of the Sixth AP-fund, this very fact may be seen as indicative of the attractiveness of these investments to pension savers.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s proposals</h2>
<p>Principles of the Inquiry’s proposals</p>
<p>A number of issues and areas of particular importance to the Inquiry relating to the objectives, governance, organisation and investment rules of the buffer capital are identified above. The aim of the Inquiry’s proposals is to ensure that these areas are addressed to create better conditions for effective governance and management of the buffer capital to benefit the pension system.</p>
<p>The principles underpinning the Inquiry’s assessments and proposals are as follows:  Ensure the independence and autonomy of buffer capital management.  Create conditions for truly  long-term asset management.  Clear role for the Swedish Pensions Agency in the management of buffer capital.  Clear separation between the responsibilities of the asset owner (Principal) and the asset management operations.  Professionalisation of asset management.  Appropriate framework for investment activities.</p>
<p>The Inquiry will hereafter refer to buffer capital as the Pension Reserve or Pension Reserve Fund in order to clarify the link with the pension system and the main role of the capital as a reserve for future pension payments. The Inquiry will also propose that a special government agency be established with responsibility for management of the pension reserve. This government agency will be called the Pension Reserve Board(PRB), once again to mark its connection with, and role in, the pension system.</p>
<p>Separation of management organisation and capital</p>
<p>The pension reserve should be considered as one or more funds that the Pension Reserve Board is to administer and manage. The Pension Reserve Board that administers and manages the funds will not have more extensive control over them than allowed by law.</p>
<p>Mandate and objective</p>
<p>The overall mandate of the Pension Reserve Board will be prescribed by law. The mandate will be formulated at a general level so as not to require amendment if circumstances change.</p>
<p>On the basis of the mandate prescribed by law, an objective is to be set that is quantitative, transparent and related to a specific investment time horizon.</p>
<p>The investment objective will be decided after a thorough analysis of the pension system’s financial position and the prospects of achieving returns on the current assets under management. This will require increased collaboration between the Swedish Pensions Agency and the body that determines the investment objectives.</p>
<p>The objective will be reviewed if the need arises, i.e. in the event of changes to the pension system’s financial position, changing market conditions or other external factors. It is expected that a major review of the investment objective will normally be conducted every three years. The body that decides on the specific investment objectives should be separate from the asset manager who’s task is to fulfil the investment mandate. The objective should serve as the benchmark for evaluating the investment activities.</p>
<p>Governance – ensure independence, autonomy and accountability</p>
<p>A state agency, the Pension Reserve Board, will be set up and assigned the role of asset owner (The Principal); in other words, it will represent the interests of present and future pensioners. The agency will also be responsible for determining the objective of the management of the pension reserve.</p>
<p>The agency will also have overall responsibility for the administration of the total pension reserve. This includes overall responsibility for establishment and operation of the necessary infrastructure, support functions and portfolio management. This will lead to the creation of a responsible principal, governance and effective administration which are currently lacking, while ensuring autonomy and independent management.</p>
<p>Independent asset management</p>
<p>Responsibility for the asset management of the pension reserve fund will lie with three independent and autonomous fund boards within the agency. The agency’s governing board will establish the investment objectives and mandates, which means that the funds will be managed and evaluated based on the same objectives and will be delegated identical investment mandates. Within the given mandates, it will be the fund boards’ responsibility to manage the funds prudently to achieve the highest possible returns. The fund boards may also instruct a securities intermediary or other capital manager to manage the fund’s assets.</p>
<p>Governing board of the agency</p>
<p>The governing board of the agency will comprise eleven board members appointed by the Government. The term of office will last for three or four years. The Government will appoint a chair and a vice chair from among the members of the board. The Swedish citizenship requirement for board members will be removed. The formal right of organisations representing employer and employee interests to nominate board members will be removed. The Government will evaluate the Pension Reserve Board, along with the objectives established by the governing board.</p>
<p>The agency’s governing board to coordinate and determine the objectives</p>
<p>The agency’s governing board will determine the investment objectives for the management of the pension reserve by the fund boards. This will be done based on a thorough analysis of the pension system’s financial position and prevailing market conditions, in collaboration with the Swedish Pensions Agency and the fund boards. The Pension Reserve Board may bring in external expertise if it considers this to be necessary and functional.</p>
<p>Before determining the objectives, the governing board is to consult with the fund boards and the Swedish Pensions Agency. However, the governing board is solely responsible for setting the objective. The Pension Reserve Board will assign investment mandates to the fund boards aimed at achieving the objective.</p>
<p>The agency’s governing board appoints the fund boards</p>
<p>The agency’s governing board will appoint the fund boards, including the chair and the vice chair. The appointment process should be based on well-defined and transparent processes including a predetermined candidate profile that is relevant to the fund.</p>
<p>The agency’s governing board evaluates the management</p>
<p>The Pension Reserve Board will regularly evaluate on an ongoing basis how well the funds meet their management mandates. Evaluations should cover both external and internal efficiency. The Pension Reserve Board will report to the Government.</p>
<p>The agency’s governing board will set guidelines for corporate governance, as well as guidelines for environmental and ethical considerations involved investment activities.</p>
<p>It may establish other general guidelines for investment activities as it may deem necessary.</p>
<p>Appointment and composition of the fund boards</p>
<p>The fund boards will be part of the agency and will be appointed by the agency’s governing board. They should be characterised by professionalism and effectiveness. The Inquiry therefore proposes the fund boards comprise five members who will provide academic and practical experience of asset management. To attract expertise and ensure that the work of the boards is given high priority by its members, the Inquiry recommends an increase in remuneration in relation to current levels, but will leave it to the Pension Reserve Board to determine the level. The work of the fund boards will be evaluated by the agency.</p>
<p>Duties of the fund boards</p>
<p>The primary duty of the fund boards will be to meet the asset management mandate by establishing an appropriate investment strategy and portfolio. The fund boards are also to establish an owner policy for financial assets and policy for implementation of ethical and environmental considerations involved in investment activities. The fund boards are to appoint a person responsible for organising and taking care of the day-to-day management.</p>
<p>Current quantitative investment rules will be replaced with a prudent person principle, which means that it will be the fund boards’ task to, on the basis of risk limits and required rate of return, determine the assets and asset limits based on the chosen classification. The introduction of the prudent person principle presupposes the implementation of the Inquiry’s other proposals concerning clear objectives and effective governance.</p>
<p>Ensuring the management’s political independence is central to its legitimacy and maintaining public confidence, which justifies the regulation of investments in Swedish listed shares. The Inquiry proposes retaining the rule that each fund’s investments may not exceed 2 per cent of total market capitalisation. In practice, this means that the pension reserve’s total allowable share of Sweden’s market capitalisation will be limited to 6 per cent as against the current 8 per cent. In addition, the Inquiry proposes that the voting restriction of maximum 10 per cent ownership in listed holdings be maintained.</p>
<p>The current assets of the Sixth AP-fund and the assets of the current First–Fourth AP-funds will together constitute the</p>
<p>Pension Reserve Fund’s capital and be managed by the new agency, the Pension Reserve Board. The investment activities will be managed by three fund boards with identical mandates and the Sixth AP-fund’s assets will form part of one or more of these three funds.</p>
<p>Reporting</p>
<p>The provisions of the AP-funds Act on accounting and auditing for the agency will be transferred to the new Act and remain essentially unchanged.</p>
<p>An annual report will be prepared for each fund. Annual reports will be prepared clearly and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>
<p>The agency’s accounts and annual reports should follow the accounting regulations for comparable financial companies and funds. Any deviations from these accounting regulations should be clearly presented and justified.</p>
<p>The Management’s operational responsibility, internal management and control</p>
<p>The Act should state that the agency’s management is accountable to the Government for its activities and is to ensure that they are conducted effectively and in accordance with applicable law, that they are reported in a reliable and fair manner and that the agency manages public funds well.</p>
<p>The management will also be responsible for decisions on the rules of procedure, business plans and annual reports.</p>
<p>Provisions on internal management and control will be included in the Act. The management is to include in the agency’s annual report an assessment of whether the internal management and control of the agency is satisfactory.</p>
<p>The Act will require internal auditing of the agency. The management will decide on the guidelines and audit plan for internal auditing, as well as measures in connection with internal audit findings and recommendations.</p>
<p>Based on an analysis of business risks, internal auditing is to independently examine whether the management’s internal management and control is designed to enable the agency to fulfil its operational responsibilities with reasonable assurance.</p>
<p>Internal auditing is to be conducted in accordance with best practices for internal auditing and internal auditors.</p>
<p>Compensation for input VAT</p>
<p>A new provision should be introduced in the Act stating that the agency is entitled to offset input VAT.</p>
<h2>Alternative proposal</h2>
<p>During the course of its work, the Inquiry has conducted a broad and comprehensive analysis of various governance and management models. Within the context of the main proposal, an alternative proposal is attached; the alternative proposal does not fit within the stated scope of the Inquiry’s terms of reference, but the</p>
<p>Inquiry believes that it is more likely to fulfil the role of pension reserve within the framework of the national pension system.</p>
