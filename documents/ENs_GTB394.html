<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2></h2>
<p>Knowledge is the backbone of work on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. Various types of knowledge are needed. Nature inventories and surveys provide a basis for identifying environments and species that require special action. Large-scale inventories also serve as valuable input in spatial planning and in cases involving exploitation of land or water areas. Environmental monitoring makes it possible to assess the general state of biological diversity in Sweden as well as ongoing changes. By following up on targets, measures and policy instruments, the effectiveness of environmental work can be assessed. Documentation of experience and practice is needed to build up knowledge about methods of conservation and sustainable use. All knowledge-building activities derive vital support from research at universities and other higher education institutions.</p>
<p>The measures being taken to conserve and sustainably use biological diversity, and associated knowledge-building actions, are governed principally by the national environmental quality objectives, EU directives, such as the Habitat and Species Directive and the Framework Directive for Water, and international undertakings, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity.</p>
<p>In Sweden many far-sighted actions have been taken to build up knowledge to support the work on biological diversity. We stand on a good foundation, built up through previous inventories of wetlands, key biotopes in forest areas and meadows and pastures, through environmental monitoring, including the recently started project for landscape monitoring (National Inventory of the Landscape in Sweden, NILS), through the ongoing basic inventory of Natura 2000 and other protected areas, and through major investments in research on biological diversity. However, the ongoing actions involve substantial costs, amounting to at least SEK 500 million, perhaps as much as SEK 1 billion per year.</p>
<p>Overall, it is difficult to obtain a general picture of all present and past actions and their exact costs.</p>
<p>The question of whether there is sufficient knowledge or whether there are significant gaps must be answered from the user’s perspective. This means it is not just a matter of whether the knowledge exists, but also of whether it is accessible and suitably packaged. Primary data from inventories is important for many officials at county administrative boards, for example, while central government officials or members of parliament need knowledge in a processed and summarised form.</p>
<h2>Knowledge for a rich flora and fauna</h2>
<p>The Government has proposed a new environmental quality objective for biological diversity – A rich flora and fauna 1 . This objective complements the other environmental quality objectives, but also raises the possibility of taking an integrated approach and considering general knowledge needs in the work on biological diversity. In order to give the work a stronger landscape perspective and a more comprehensive vision and to develop regional landscape strategies, all-inclusive knowledge and planning bases are needed in the form of vegetation and seabed maps. It is also important to improve environmental monitoring, for one thing so as to be able to follow the effects of climate change and take adaptive measures in time. In order to follow up Sweden’s contribution to the international goal of halting the loss of biological diversity by 2010, the development of indicators should be intensified and coordinated with similar activities elsewhere in the EU.</p>
<p>My proposals are: 1. A national digital vegetation survey should be carried out for the parts of Sweden that have not previously been surveyed. The survey should build on previous experience, while also taking advantage of any new, more  cost-effective methods that have been developed. A corresponding survey of seabed areas is also needed. 2. National and regional environmental monitoring should be revised so as to better match the needs of biological diversity work. Among other things, the need for additional species monitoring should be investigated. 3. There should be regular general reports on the biological diversity situation in Sweden. The reports should be linked to some existing reporting requirement, such as reporting to the Convention on Biological Diversity. The task of exploring possible arrangements in greater detail should be given to the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Swedish Biodiversity Centre, the Swedish Species Information Centre and relevant government agencies. 4. Certification of nature inventory workers should be introduced. The Swedish Biodiversity Centre, the Swedish Species Information Centre and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences should be instructed to explore the necessary conditions and arrangements.</p>
<h2>Knowledge for specific environmental quality objectives</h2>
<p>The state of knowledge linked to the environmental quality objectives Thriving wetlands, Sustainable forests and A varied agricultural landscape is broadly satisfactory. The wetlands inventory has provided basic knowledge about wetlands in this country that are worth protecting. The only areas that have not been inventoried are the mountains, but as the threats to mountain wetlands are relatively limited, at least in the short term, filling in this gap is considered a low priority. As a result of several inventories of Sweden’s forests, we have a relatively solid foundation to stand on when it comes to identifying forest land that is worth protecting. There are certain deficiencies with regard to follow-up of voluntary set-asides and our knowledge about nature conservation values and classifications on land owned by large forestry concerns. The state of knowledge about farming land is also relatively good, largely due to the inventory of meadows and pastures that has recently been carried out. Planned increases in environmental monitoring (within the framework of NILS) should ensure an acceptable level of monitoring is possible for the biological diversity of meadows, pastures and small biotopes.</p>
<p>For the environmental quality objectives Flourishing lakes and streams, A magnificent mountain landscape and A good built environment, the state of knowledge is less satisfactory. There are both gaps in knowledge about the location of particularly valuable areas and deficiencies in environmental monitoring and follow-up. The mountain landscapes are highly sensitive to climate change, yet we have limited knowledge about the changes that are coming and how to adapt to them.</p>
<p>For the environmental quality objective A balanced marine environment, flourishing coastal areas and archipelagos, the state of knowledge is unsatisfactory. Much of the basic information that is generally available for ecosystems on land, such as topographic maps, nature conservation value inventories and lists of endangered species, is largely missing. This is a great obstacle to sustainable management and planning of different marine activities. The lack of knowledge is a serious problem for operational work on identifying marine areas that are worth protecting and protecting them by 2010, as required by target 1.</p>
<p>Further national knowledge-building actions during this target period should be given priority, in the first instance, in the environmental quality objectives where the state of knowledge is unsatisfactory or not very satisfactory. However, for all types of environments and all environmental quality objectives it is very important to complete the basic inventory of Natura 2000 areas and protected areas and the National Inventory of the Landscape in Sweden (NILS).</p>
<p>My proposals are:</p>
<p>For lakes and streams 1. Steps should be taken as necessary to supplement the knowledge base so as to identify particularly valuable natural and cultural environments in and around lakes and streams. The database of geographical information that is being built up to cover lake and stream areas that are worth protecting should gradually be supplemented as knowledge grows and should be made available not only to the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and county administrative boards but also to other actors that may need the information. 2. A review should be made of the environmental monitoring of lakes and streams. The biological components of monitoring must be strengthened, partly to fulfil the requirements of the Water Directive. The review should take into account the planned  follow-up of Natura 2000, the results of which should also be usable in a general assessment of the state of the environment.</p>
<p>For offshore waters, coastal areas and archipelagos 1. A comprehensive digital topographic map should be made covering the seabed area in Sweden’s exclusive economic zone. Apart from topography, it should also show the type of seabed and, if possible, organisms forming significant populations. As far as possible, the map should build on a compilation of existing information held, for example, by the Swedish Armed Forces, the Swedish Maritime Administration, the Geological Survey of Sweden and the National Land Survey, but extensive new mapping will probably also be needed. The digital map must be open for use by the actors concerned. 2. A national biological inventory of the marine environment should be carried out in a representative sample of areas. The topographic map of the seabed should provide a basis for selecting suitable areas. 3. Environmental monitoring should be revised so as to improve monitoring of marine biological diversity. Coordination with other relevant countries around common marine areas should be considered.</p>
<p>For mountain landscapes 1. Environmental monitoring of mountain landscapes should be revised so as to provide a good basis for  follow-up of the state of biological diversity. 2. The Sami Parliament and the Mountains Delegation (Fjälldelegationen) should be instructed to jointly investigate and propose procedures for making an inventory of reindeer grazing lands, and to analyse whether it is possible to counter the negative impact of climate change on mountain landscapes by means of changes in the structure of reindeer grazing.</p>
<p>For the built environment 1. The National Board of Housing, Building and Planning, after consulting the Swedish Environmental Protection</p>
<p>Agency, Statistics Sweden and the municipalities, should investigate possible means of building up an integrated national follow-up of biological diversity in open spaces and natural environments near urban areas.</p>
<h2>Knowledge in work at municipal level</h2>
<p>The municipalities are important actors in local work on conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. Many municipalities put a great deal of effort into building up knowledge about local conditions and biological diversity. It is important that central government agencies, in particular the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, provide guidance to support the municipalities. It is important to the municipalities that central government information is easily accessible in consolidated form.</p>
<h2>Questions concerning research</h2>
<p>Although the remit of the inquiry has not included a review of research on biological diversity, in the course of the inquiry it has nonetheless proved necessary to look in some detail at certain questions relating to research. Extensive research is being done in Sweden concerning biological diversity. It is primarily by means of research that more difficult and complex questions can be answered, for example, questions about function, causal links, mechanisms and, not least, links with human culture and society in general. However, much of the research does not fit in with the specific knowledge needed for conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. The Swedish Biodiversity Centre should be given a stronger role as coordinator and mediator between research and practice, so as to bridge the gap between research and its users. Compilations of knowledge and scientific syntheses should be produced and used to a greater extent. To enable inventories and environmental monitoring to maintain a high quality and inspire confidence, it is important to use generally accepted and consistent scientific methods and analytical tools.</p>
<h2>Dissemination and accessibility – recycle knowledge!</h2>
<p>There are deficiencies in the dissemination and accessibility of information from biological inventories and investigations. There is no integrated portal for actors who need such information. The user is obliged to search for data on different websites and in printed sources. These use different models for dissemination and the data is not always comparable. In general there is a lack of any overview of measures taken to build up knowledge. In certain areas, principally forest and marine areas, the situation is slightly better.</p>
<p>Information about biological diversity is not only disseminated in the form of information from inventories and surveys. Many institutions and academic departments make substantial contributions by means of printed documents, articles and reports. Biological and natural history museums also play an important role as mediators of knowledge about biological diversity. No Swedish museum, however, has been made explicitly responsible for using its exhibitions to present the state of biological diversity and the environment in Sweden.</p>
<p>My proposals are: 1. A national  web-based reference directory of nature inventories and surveys should be built up. The directory should be in the form of a metadatabase with cartographic support. It should not contain any actual inventory data. 2. A national Internet portal should be built up for dissemination and downloading, if possible within the framework of an existing system. This portal should have interactive facilities allowing users to obtain and study data from inventories providing national coverage, primarily by means of links to the websites of agencies responsible for the environmental goals. 3. The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency should be given the responsibility of establishing a national reference directory and a portal, in consultation with other agencies responsible for environmental goals. 4. The responsibility of the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency to ensure that knowledge about the environment and state of the environment is made available to the general public should be further developed. 5. The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, the Swedish Board of Agriculture and the National Board of Forestry should be instructed to agree on common guidelines for ways of making data available via the Internet. 6. The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, the Swedish Board of Agriculture and the National Board of Forestry should be instructed to arrange an initiative similar to StrateGIS but focusing on the use of geographical information systems and locational data in work on conservation of biological diversity specifically and environmental issues in general. 7. The Museum of Natural History should be given responsibility, as part of its exhibition and information activities, for informing the public about the state of biological diversity in Sweden in general and linked to the environmental goals specifically.</p>
<h2>Coordination and governance</h2>
<p>There are inadequacies in the coordination of inventories, surveys, etc. No organisation has explicit overall responsibility for coordination. Consideration has been given to the possibility of transferring knowledge-building tasks from different actors to a separate organisation. Even though such a solution has its advantages, the assessment is that it is not appropriate to create a new organisation within the current model of Swedish environmental work.</p>
<p>The county administrative boards have a central part in knowledge-building work at regional level and conduct extensive activities, primarily on commission or with funding from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. The role and responsibility of the county administrative boards in knowledge-building should be clarified and governance by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency should increase in cases where the aim is that measures should be comparable nationwide.</p>
<p>The prime responsibility for designing methods for national surveys and inventories should rest with national actors. The Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences is considered to be in a good position to manage this type of assignment in so far as it concerns terrestrial and freshwater environments, but other universities may also be appropriate actors for certain tasks. With regard to the marine environment, the marine centres and associated universities together with the Swedish Board of Fisheries are the best placed actors.</p>
<p>My proposals are: 1. The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency’s coordinating role in building knowledge to support work on biological diversity should be strengthened and clarified. The Government’s proposal that the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency should be the agency responsible for the new environmental quality objective A rich flora and fauna and should assume an increased coordinating role for the marine environment should be accompanied by responsibility for coordinating those  knowledge-building activities that principally concern inventories, environmental monitoring and follow-up of environmental goals. It is important that the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency is genuinely put in a position to manage this task and a change in the agency’s instructions is proposed. 2. The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency should take measures internally to put it in a better position to coordinate and manage the building up of knowledge. 3. When the present period for the environmental goals is evaluated and new targets are set for the coming period, this must be combined with a  cross-party parliamentary inquiry on the effectiveness of Swedish environmental work. This inquiry should include an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Swedish environmental system, viewed with reference to the effects of a broader European environmental policy, compared with a traditional Swedish environmental policy. The inquiry may give deeper consideration to the advantages and disadvantages of Swedish procedures for building up knowledge, compared with procedures in other European countries, for instance, Finland and Norway. 4. The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency should be tasked with establishing a national technical standard for inventories and surveys and for the locational data they capture. In this task, the Agency should work with the</p>
<p>Swedish Board of Agriculture and the National Board of</p>
<p>Forestry. 5. Voluntary associations that perform important tasks in building up knowledge about biological diversity and that meet certain basic criteria should be given state support for their activities. This support should be calculated on the basis of the number of members.</p>
<h2>Biological collections</h2>
<p>The status of natural history collections in Sweden gives cause for concern. These collections are of great importance for environ- mental and cultural policy reasons. They constitute an environ- mental history archive, an asset for basic research and an important element of the Swedish cultural heritage. In particular, the conditions in which dry collections are stored in the major museums need upgrading.</p>
<p>My proposals are:</p>
<p>1. A  cross-ministry working group should be appointed with the task of proposing the best means of preserving the collections, or assessing which parts of the collections can be eliminated so that present resources can be focused on the continued existence of remaining collections.</p>
<p>2. The Government should instruct those museums that are answerable to central government to incorporate provisions in their accession policies directing that when a research project gives rise to new collections, the budget for the project must also include funds for registering, storing and looking after these collections for a period of 50 years.</p>
