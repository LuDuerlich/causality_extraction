<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The current Inquiry was instructed to analyse, based on a broad approach, the conditions for creating legal routes to the EU to seek asylum. A legal route could be created, for example, by introducing the possibility of issuing visas or some other form of entry permit for people intending to seek asylum in the EU. If deemed appropriate, the design for a regulatory framework based on EU law and other international commitments will be proposed, and economic and other implications that this could lead to will be assessed.</p>
<h2>Background and problems</h2>
<p>The international community has a shared responsibility to assist displaced persons in need of international protection. Asylum seekers must be treated with respect for their human rights and guaranteed their rights under the Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the Status of Refugees (the Refugee Convention), whereby no refugee is to be sent back to persecution (the principle of non-refoulement).</p>
<p>Enhanced and constructive cooperation both in the EU and globally is a cornerstone of a long-term, sustainable and humane migration policy. However, there are few legal routes to Europe for asylum seekers and the number of asylum seekers is very unevenly distributed across the EU. More countries must be encouraged to take greater responsibility for finding better sustainable solutions to managing the migration and refugee situation.</p>
<p>Applying for asylum in the EU can essentially only be done within the EU or at the EU’s borders. A person who intends to seek asylum in the EU must therefore first get to the EU’s border to assert their need for protection there. However, a premise of the EU Visa Code is that a visa cannot be granted if there is a reasonable doubt regarding the applicant’s intentions to leave the</p>
<p>Schengen area after the expiry of the visa period. Accordingly, under the current regulatory framework, there is no possibility of issuing Schengen visas for the purpose of enabling people to enter the EU and other Schengen countries to apply for asylum, which became even clearer following a judgment in the Court of Justice of the European Union in March 2017.</p>
<p>The migration and refugee situation in 2015 revealed substantial structural weaknesses and shortcomings in the design and use of the European asylum system, especially with regard to the Dublin Regulation . Today’s system was not designed to bring about sustainable distribution of responsibility for asylum seekers in the European Union. This led to situations in which a small number of individual Member States had to handle the large majority of asylum seekers, which put the countries’ asylum systems under a great deal of strain and resulted in a disregard of certain EU regulations.</p>
<p>The European Commission presented seven new legislative proposals in 2016 to reform the common European asylum system. These included revising the Dublin Regulation, and revising and transforming the current Qualification Directive and the Asylum Procedures Directive into regulations. In addition, the Commission has presented a proposal for a regulation on a common EU system for resettlement (defined in the Swedish context as ‘reception of quota refugees’). In recent years, the Commission has devoted considerable effort to developing a common approach to resettlement. From 2015 until 20 September 2017, more than 23 000 persons in need of protection were resettled in the EU as a result of new voluntary commitments.</p>
<p>However, it can be noted that this number corresponds to about 6 per cent of the some 1.2 million people that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees deemed to be in need of resettlement in 2017. In 2016, there were 40 times more asylum applications than the number of resettlement places available in the EU. Furthermore, in the same year, ten times more decisions to grant asylum were taken after spontaneous asylum applications than there were resettlement places. This already shows that the resettlement option by no means covers the needs. The same applies to national programmes for admission on humanitarian grounds, which many EU Member States have recently established in response to the Syrian crisis. These also do not necessarily have in view a secure legal status for persons in need of protection. Other options available to persons in need of protection to lawfully enter the EU, such as studies, labour immigration and family reunification, are obviously better from the point of view of risk than irregular travel, but do not provide a secure legal status. The overall conclusion is thus that asylum seekers need to be afforded several different secure and lawful ways of entering the EU.</p>
<h2>The Inquiry’s considerations etc.</h2>
<p>First, it should be stressed that the European Commission  is the body that drafts legislative proposals in the EU. Sweden can influence the Commission, but does not have the legal power to force the passing of a legal instrument. The adoption of a proposal requires that, under the ordinary legislative procedure, both the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union back</p>
<p>the proposal. Although the Council requires a qualified majority, it always strives to take unanimous decisions.</p>
<p>The ongoing negotiations on a common European asylum system have shown that Member States have widely differing positions in some respects. The current plan is to attempt to</p>
<p>“establish consensus” in the first half of 2018. For this reason, in general, the political conditions to present new legal instruments in the area currently do not appear to be favourable.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s overall assessment is as follows:</p>
<p>• The EU treaties provide support for a legal instrument in the EU for entry permits for the purpose of seeking asylum. The European Commission should examine whether it is possible to present such a proposal as a complement to resettlement and spontaneous asylum applications. Unlike today’s resettlement, an entry permit for the purpose of seeking asylum is intended to be an  application procedure .</p>
<p>• Sweden should welcome the fact that other Member States are establishing humanitarian admission programmes and private/ community sponsorship programmes as a complement to re- settlement and spontaneous asylum applications, but should not push for binding rules on such procedures in the EU. Private/ community sponsorship programmes are deemed not to function optimally in Sweden.</p>
<p>• Sweden should not push for the introduction of EU rules on an asylum procedure directly at missions abroad. The drawbacks of such a procedure would be significant, for both individuals and the Member States’ missions abroad.</p>
<p>With regard to the legal conditions for a legal instrument on entry permits to seek asylum, these could be summarised as follows. In the course of the Inquiry, it has been established that the EU Visa</p>
<p>European Union (TFEU) and the Court of Justice of the European Union’s judgment of</p>
<p>Code’s rules cannot be applied to grant visas to persons who want to seek asylum, cf Judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union of 7 March 2017 in Case C-638/16 PPU. For the time being, this area is therefore covered by the exclusive competence of the Member States. However, according to the Court of Justice of the European Union, this could be regulated in legal instruments developed pursuant to Article 79(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Given that the common visa policy has objectives other than making it easier for asylum seekers, support for a legal instrument on this issue should also be contained in the article that regulates the common asylum policy, namely Article 78 of the TFEU. In the</p>
<p>Inquiry’s view, support for a legal instrument on entry permits to seek asylum is contained in both Article 78 and Article 79(2)(a) of the TFEU.</p>
<p>With regard to a more detailed design, the Inquiry has discussed the advantages and disadvantages of various models in which persons who have been granted an entry permit after a preliminary assessment then undergo a normal asylum examination when they arrive in the Member State in question. In the Inquiry’s view, it is important that the European Commission examine an electronic application procedure to relieve the pressure on Member States’ missions abroad as far as possible and keep costs down. Digital application procedures and common computer systems are already being developed in the EU, for example the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) and the common system for registering asylum applications and redistributing asylum seekers at busy times, as outlined in the European</p>
<p>Commission’s proposal for a revised Dublin Regulation.</p>
<p>Regarding the effects of introducing such rules, the Inquiry has made some estimates and assumptions. However, it should be stressed that the Inquiry is not presenting any proposals that affect costs or revenues for the state, municipalities, companies or other private parties. Based on – what the Inquiry deems to be a realistic assumption of – an annual quota of 500 individuals on Sweden’s part, costs for both processes and the entire establishment on</p>
<p>Sweden’s part, is estimated to be about SEK 200 million. In addition to this are the costs for missions abroad, which are more difficult to assess.</p>
<p>An annex to this report presents the potential design of a regulatory framework on temporary residence permits to seek asylum in a Member State, based on Swedish conditions.</p>
