<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The use of animals in experiments requires approval by an ethical committee on animal experiments before starting. In its review the committee shall weigh the importance of the experiment against the suffering of the animal. The committee may approve an animal experiment application on condition that the use of an animal can be considered important in the public interest, that the purpose of the experiment cannot be achieved by any other satisfactory method that does not entail the use of animals, that as few animals as possible are used and that the activity is organised in such a way as not to subject the animals to greater suffering than is absolutely necessary. Mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and cyclostomes are the animals covered by the ethical review requirement. If the ethical committee on animal experiments rejects an application or approves it on conditions that are not satisfactory to the applicant, the applicant may appeal the decision to a general administrative court, i.e. in the first instance to the county administrative court.</p>
<p>Our remit has been to consider whether the ethical review system for animal experiments should be changed so that a central committee is set up to deal with appeals. The remit also includes assessing whether it should be made possible for a regional ethical committee on animal experiments to refer a case to such a central committee if the regional committee is unable to agree on the outcome of the ethical review of the animal experiment and a certain minimum number of members request a referral. We shall also reach a decision on the organisational issues associated with the establishment of a central committee. Finally we shall assess whether the regional ethical committees on animal experiments should regain a more independent role in relation to their host agency.</p>
<p>Ethical review of animal experiments</p>
<p>There are seven ethical committees on animal experiments based in Göteborg, Linköping, Malmö/Lund, Stockholm (two committees), Umeå and Uppsala. Each committee's secretariat is at a court. Most of the committees consist of a chairperson, a vice chairperson and twelve other members. The chairperson and vice chairperson are usually judges. The other members consist of six researchers or animal experiment staff and six lay members. Four of the lay members are appointed on the basis of proposals from municipalities where animal experiments are conducted and the other two on the basis of proposals from animal welfare organisations. Two of the committees – Göteborg’s ethical committee on animal experiments and the Stockholm North ethical committee on animal experiments – are each divided into two departments. In each department researchers, animal experiment staff and lay members are represented in the same numbers and proportions as apply to the committees which are not divided into departments.</p>
<p>Each ethical committee on animal experiments is an independent decision-making body. The Swedish Animal Welfare Agency used to be the host agency for the committees. This meant that the Animal Welfare Agency was responsible for application forms, statistics, training of members, financial administration and IT support etc. After the closure of the Animal Welfare Agency on 1 July 2007, the Swedish Board of Agriculture took over these duties.</p>
<p>Ethical review of research involving humans</p>
<p>Ethical review of research involving humans as research subjects is carried out by regional ethical review boards. There are six such boards based in Göteborg, Linköping, Malmö/Lund, Stockholm, Umeå and Uppsala. The boards’ secretariats are attached to universities or other higher education institutions in these cities.</p>
<p>Each ethical review board is divided into two or more departments. A department consists of a chairperson, who must be or have been a permanent judge, ten scientifically qualified members and five members representing the public interest.</p>
<p>A regional ethical review board decision may be appealed to the Central Ethical Review Board based in Stockholm. The Central Ethical Review Board also hears cases in which the regional board is not in agreement as to whether the research in question should be approved and at least three members have requested a referral of the case to the Central Ethical Review Board for a decision.</p>
<p>The Central Ethical Review Board consists of a chairperson and six other members. Four of these members must have scientific qualifications and two must represent the public interest. The decisions of the Central Ethical Review Board are final and cannot therefore be appealed.</p>
<p>The need for a central ethical committee on animal experiments</p>
<p>The ethical review committees on animal experiments review about 1 600 cases of planned animal experiments per year. Since 1998, when their decisions became legally binding and thereby possible to appeal, around twenty cases have been heard in various county administrative courts. Thus it is very rare for a judge to be given the opportunity to act as chairperson in determining cases concerning animal experiments. Hence an individual judge can seldom gain extensive experience of such matters. The insignificant number of cases reviewed by a court also means that no real case law has developed in the area.</p>
<p>Cases concerning animal experiments include not only legal assessments, but above all scientific and ethical considerations. Such issues may involve difficult distinctions and decisions. Even if no direct criticism has been levelled against the administrative courts' treatment of animal experiment cases, both the need for expert knowledge of ethical aspects of animal experiments and the need for developed and consistent case law indicates that review should be in another form. On the model of ethical review in the area involving humans we propose that a central committee for ethical review of animal experiments should be established. The committee should consist of a chairperson, who should be or have been a permanent judge, four scientifically qualified members and two members with general competence, i.e. lay members. One of the lay members should represent animal welfare interests. For the committee to form a quorum, the presence shall be required of the chairperson and at least three scientifically qualified members and</p>
<p>one lay member. The members shall be appointed for a period of four years with the option of re-appointment. We propose that the name of the committee should be the Central Ethical Committee on Animal Experiments.</p>
<p>We estimate that 1–2 per cent of the cases reviewed by the ethical review committees on animal experiments will be appealed to the proposed central committee. Given that the regional committees review about 1 600 applications regarding animal experiments per year, it is estimated that 15–30 cases per year will be appealed.</p>
<p>In the field of ethical review of research involving humans, a regional ethical review board may refer an application to the Central Ethical Review Board. Such a referral requires that the members of the referring regional ethical review board are not in agreement regarding the decision, as well as a request by at least three of the members. We propose that a similar option should be introduced in the area of ethical review of animal research and in that case also if an application gives rise to questions of a new or fundamental nature and at least three members request that the case be referred. This is not only an important democratic feature of the review, but also a way, from different points of departure, of bringing about a re-examination procedure, thereby laying the ground for consistent case law. There should be no limitation with regard to which members – researcher/animal experiment staff or lay members – are allowed to decide on referral. However, it is important that the members who wish to refer a case carefully state their reasons. If the reasons are of a standard nature or decisions have recently been made in similar cases it should be possible for the central committee to quickly reach a decision on the case, in some cases through the chairperson alone or by means of a decision taken by the committee in a telephone conference. We estimate that up to 50 cases per year will be referred from the regional ethical review committees on animal experiments to the central ethical committee on animal experiments.</p>
<p>The central ethical committee on animal experiments shall be obliged to reach a decision on a referred case within 30 days of a fully completed case being submitted to the committee. It shall be allowed to extend this time limit once if the central committee needs more information on a case. Other cases should be determined by the central committee within 60 days of a case being submitted in full to the committee.</p>
<p>A new regulatory framework for ethical review of animal experiments</p>
<p>Provisions concerning ethical review of animal experiments can be found in the Animal Welfare Act (1988:534), but above all in the Animal Welfare Ordinance (1988:539) and agency regulations. To make the regulations clearer and to strengthen the independence of the ethical committees on animal experiments, we propose that a special Act and Ordinance on ethical review of animal experiments should be introduced. In consequence of this we propose that the corresponding provisions in the current regulatory framework should be repealed.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation consists for the most part of rules that already exist, but in another legislative form. However, we also propose certain new rules.</p>
<p>Certain questions concerning the regional ethical committees on animal experiments</p>
<p>Processing times</p>
<p>We propose the introduction of provisions concerning processing times. A regional ethical committee on animal experiments should be obliged to determine an application for ethical review of animal experiments within 60 days of the receipt of an application submitted in full to the committee competent to decide on the case. If the regional committee decides to refer the case to the central ethical committee on animal experiments, the regional committee shall refer the case within a week of the referral decision being taken.</p>
<p>Fees</p>
<p>In many areas government agencies’ reviews of applications of various kinds are subject to a charge. We consider it justified that a fee of SEK 1 200 per application for ethical review of an animal experiment be charged (fee class 3 in the Fees Ordinance (1992:191).</p>
<p>The chairperson shall be entitled to make certain decisions alone</p>
<p>To facilitate and simplify the processing of cases, we propose that the chairperson of a regional ethical committee on animal experiments should be able to decide alone on questions concerning rejection and removal of cases and similar decisions on procedural grounds. If the committee intends to approve an application, but discovers that the approval requires certain supplementary documentation, the chairperson shall also be authorised to decide alone on the case if the necessary supplementary documentation has been received.</p>
<p>Organisational issues</p>
<p>As of 1 July 2007, the Swedish Board of Agriculture is the host agency for the regional ethical committees on animal experiments. We consider that the Board of Agriculture should continue to have this responsibility. As before, the secretariats should be in the places where the ethical committees on animal experiments are based. In addition the Swedish Board of Agriculture should also be appointed as host agency for the central ethical committee on animal experiments. Giving the Swedish Board of Agriculture overall responsibility means that the Board's support can be coordinated and made more effective, for example by introducing a common IT system for all the committees. We also expect that the decisions on appeals and the case law that thereby develops can be quickly and simply communicated in the organisation.</p>
<p>The advantages of an integrated organisation are considerable. The integrated organisation does not mean any weakening of the independence of the regional ethical committees on animal experiments. On the contrary, it will be strengthened, above all by means of our proposal that most of the rules governing the work of the committees are to be specified in laws or ordinances instead of agency regulations and that the committees should have their own budget responsibility.</p>
<p>A new organisation is required to meet the needs of the central ethical committee on animal experiments. We consider that the committee should be staffed with a legal officer and an assistant. Initially we estimate that the position of the legal officer will require 50 per cent, and the assistant position 25 per cent, of a full</p>
<p>time position. Since it is difficult to assess how many cases the committee will be processing in the long term it is appropriate that the tasks be dealt with, at least to start with, by people who are employed by the Swedish Board of Agriculture.</p>
<p>Economic implications</p>
<p>Our proposal to establish a central ethical committee on animal experiments will entail costs for salaries to the committee’s staff, fees to the members, training, premises, IT etc. We have estimated the cost of the committee’s first year to be about SEK 1 million. The extent of the cost thereafter will depend on how many cases the committee will be processing.</p>
<p>The ethical committees on animal experiments review about 1 600 applications every year. Our proposal to charge fees for reviews of SEK 1 200 per application would mean revenue of about SEK 2 million for the public treasury, which would thus more than adequately cover the cost of establishing a central ethical committee on animal experiments.</p>
