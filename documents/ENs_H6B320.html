<h1>Summary</h1>
<h2>Remit</h2>
<p>The Inquiry’s remit includes surveying the market for crowdfunding platforms and analysing the roles, functions and incentive structures of these platforms and their participants. The Inquiry is also instructed, while focusing on equity-based crowdfunding and lendingbased crowdfunding, to identify the legislative provisions that apply to procuring, providing or mediating such financing, and to assess whether these provisions are appropriate. In this context, the Inquiry is to examine whether there are any barriers to using crowdfunding for businesses operating as limited companies. The classification of companies and the demarcation between the various company classifications are not to be reviewed, however.</p>
<p>Based on the assessments made, the Inquiry is to consider whether the existing legislation needs to be amended, or whether new commercial law regulations are needed. The remit also includes reviewing the need for sanctions. However, it does not include reviewing or proposing amendments to the provisions in the Consumer Credit Act (2010:1846). Rules for taxes and fees also lay outside the Inquiry’s remit.</p>
<p>The aim of the remit is to improve the conditions for developing this form of financing as an alternative source of financing for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and enable individuals to find joint financing solutions in general within civil society. The Inquiry’s proposals should also ensure a high level of consumer and investor protection in general to promote confidence in, and the development of, crowdfunding.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s terms of reference are appended to the report.</p>
<h2>Regulatory initiatives from the EU</h2>
<p>The potential need to regulate crowdfunding at EU level has been discussed in recent years. The Commission’s position, however, has been to wait and to refer to the directives that may be relevant to regulating crowdfunding, including Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (MiFID II), Directive 2003/71/EC on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading (the Prospectus Directive), Directive 2007/64/EC on payment services in the internal market, and Directive (EU) 2015/849 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing.</p>
<p>The Commission’s work in this area intensified in the second half of 2017, however, and the development of a framework for regulating crowdfunding began. The framework aims to stimulate access to capital for SMEs via lendingand equity-based crowdfunding. The Commission intends, among other things, to create better conditions for cross-border crowdfunding. An initial proposal on a framework for cross-border lendingand equity-based crowdfunding of SMEs will be presented during the first half of 2018 within the context of the capital markets union.</p>
<h2>General comments on crowdfunding</h2>
<p>According to the Swedish National Encyclopaedia, crowdfunding is a method of funding projects, usually online, by raising small amounts of money from a large number of people. The fundraising may be subject to different terms and conditions. Sometimes, part-ownership is given in exchange for funds pledged, although donationsbased, lending-based and other types of rewards-based crowdfunding are also common.</p>
<p>Crowdfunding is not a market; rather, it is several different methods of raising funds. These methods do not compete directly, but in certain cases can be seen as complementary alternatives. A start-up company seeking backing on a rewards-based crowdfunding platform to develop its product may, at a later stage, seek additional growth capital by offering shares on an equity-based crowdfunding platform. Competition is considerable, however, between crowdfunding platforms in each market segment and actors representing more traditional financing channels or other alternative forms of financing. Crowdfunding is usually divided into four categories: donations-based, rewards-based, lending-based and equity-based crowdfunding.</p>
<p>Lendingand equity-based crowdfunding models involve three different parties. Capital seekers and each investor enter into a credit agreement or an agreement on the transfer of shares of ownership or debt, issued by the company seeking capital (principal agreement). The parties to the principal agreement also, individually, enter into a user or project agreement with the crowdfunding platform company. The platform company operates as intermediary, linking capital seekers and investors and enabling them to carry out transactions with each other.</p>
<h2>Development of the crowdfunding market</h2>
<p>The Chinese crowdfunding market is the largest in the world. China’s crowdfunding turnover far exceeds that of all other markets in the Asia-Pacific region. Similarly, crowdfunding in the United States dominates the other markets in the Americas, while the United Kingdom holds a unique position in comparison with other markets in the EU.</p>
<p>Lending-based crowdfunding is the most common type of crowdfunding in Europe. Variation in the rate of development across different countries, regions and forms of financing is a function of the variation in individual countries’ regulations and market conditions. Access to loans from banks is an important factor in assessing the different growth rates of crowdfunding globally. The growth of lendingand equity-based crowdfunding has been stronger in many of the countries in which banks’ lending has been more restrictive since the 2008 financial crisis. Crowdfunding growth in the Nordic countries has accelerated since 2015.</p>
<h2>The need for regulation</h2>
<p>The survey of the crowdfunding market shows that the companies that established the Swedish crowdfunding platforms conduct activities that meet the requirements for a business activity. A platform company whose focus is equityor lending-based crowdfunding is to be considered as an intermediary that provides support to capital seekers and investors so that a financial contract can be established between the parties, and transactions can be conducted, or at least facilitated, between them. The business model and services provided are decisive for how the activities conducted are to be assessed.</p>
<p>Depending on the focus and scope of their activities, some of these business operators are covered by existing commercial law regulations. In reviewing the relevant legislation, the Inquiry has found that satisfactory and appropriate regulations are lacking for activities that focus on the mediation of financing procured by private limited companies via equity-based crowdfunding. This also applies to certain elements of lending-based crowdfunding, namely the mediation of loans between private individuals. With regard to donations-based crowdfunding and rewards-based crowdfunding, the issue emphasised in the Inquiry’s terms of reference is how such activities relate to regulatory frameworks on counteracting money laundering and terrorist financing. The Commission’s assessment is that crowdfunding activities face particular risk of being misused for such purposes. The review of current legislation reveals that anti-money laundering regulations are not applicable to rewards-based or donations-based crowdfunding.</p>
<p>The Marketing Act (2008:486) applies to any marketing activities by Swedish crowdfunding platform companies. Swedish business operators intending to procure financing via crowdfunding are also covered by the Act. However, the Marketing Act applies to foreign companies only to a limited extent.</p>
<p>Whether relevant consumer protection legislation applies to procuring, providing or mediating financing via crowdfunding depends on the constellation of parties in each contractual situation. The review indicates that those providing financing to business operators or private individuals have, in certain respects, limited or no protection. Regarding equityand lending-based crowdfunding, which are the focus of the Inquiry’s remit, both the asymmetric information risk and liquidity risk are, however, often higher than in other regulated forms of saving or investment targeting consumers and other non-professional investors. Moreover, the compensation models found in both equityand lending-based crowdfunding entail the risk of conflicts of interest. In many cases, the investors are private individuals. This means that there is a need and reason to strengthen investor protection by ensuring that the companies mediating contacts and otherwise assisting in financial mediation to private limited companies via crowdfunding are subject to authorisation requirements and supervision, and requirements tailored to this type of activity, such as the duty to provide information. Stricter legislation may also be warranted for competition reasons and to strengthen confidence in this alternative form of corporate financing and investing. In the mediation of loans procured and provided by exclusively private individuals via lendingbased crowdfunding, neither borrowers nor lenders have any regulatory consumer protection rights or obligations towards each other. Accordingly, this form of lending-based crowdfunding is also in need of regulation that, above all, ensures that a proper credit assessment is carried out.</p>
<h2>A new act</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that provisions on crowdfunding be introduced in a new commercial law act called the Act on certain financial mediation activities. The act is to contain provisions on a)  authorisation or registration requirements to conduct activities governed by the act, b ) how these activities are to be conducted, and c)  supervision and sanctions. Finansinspektionen (the Swedish financial supervisory authority) will assess matters concerning authorisation or registration, exercise supervision and maintain a register of those entitled to conduct activities under the act. Entities conducting activities under the new act will be governed by the Act on Measures against Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (2017:630).</p>
<h2>Scope of application</h2>
<p>The proposed new act applies to any business activity that, in return for compensation, seeks to bring together natural persons or legal entities intending to procure financing from natural persons or legal entities intending to provide financing, if the financing is: 1. via such loans, in return for compensation, issued by entities other than companies authorised by Finansinspektionen to grant or mediate loans  (lending-based crowdfunding); 2. in return for the transfer of shares of ownership or debt in the legal entity procuring financing  (equity-based crowdfunding); 3. in exchange for a product or service provided by the entity procuring financing  (rewards-based crowdfunding); or 4. without compensation or any other return provided by the entity procuring financing  (donations-based crowdfunding).</p>
<p>The Act does not apply, however, to financial mediation services via lendingor equity-based crowdfunding solely between business operators.</p>
<p>The act applies to rewardsand donations-based crowdfunding to a limited extent, and instead of an authorisation requirement, it is proposed that companies providing such intermediary services be required to apply for registration with Finansinspektionen.</p>
<p>The act will also include definitions of some terms, including shares of ownership or debt. This term refers to shares and subscription rights issued by private limited companies, and to bonds, warrants and other promissory notes issued by such companies that are not intended or able to be traded on capital markets.</p>
<p>Entities authorised under the act to mediate equityor lendingbased crowdfunding are designated as capital intermediaries.</p>
<h2>Authorisation and registration requirements</h2>
<p>The proposed act specifies the requirements for authorisation or registration. Authorisation to act as a capital intermediary will only be granted to Swedish limited companies or Swedish economic associations, or to foreign companies with a branch in Sweden. This also applies to entities applying for registration to conduct intermediary services in respect of rewardsand donations-based crowdfunding.</p>
<p>Other conditions for authorisation correspond to what generally applies to other equivalent financial activities, including the need for grounds to assume that the planned activities will be conducted in accordance with the new act and other regulations governing the operations. An appropriateness assessment of the company’s owner and management is also required. A capital intermediary must have at least one authorised public accountant. However, there is no capital requirement for authorisation.</p>
<p>After notifying Finansinspektionen, any Swedish company conducting activities as a capital intermediary is entitled to establish a branch in another country.</p>
<p>Exemption from the authorisation requirement applies to certain companies already authorised under other commercial law legislation pertaining to financial markets. This includes companies engaged in banking and financing, securities trading or consumer credit activities. Where relevant, exemption from the authorisation requirement also applies to corresponding foreign companies. Such companies may, after notifying Finansinspektionen, conduct activities as capital intermediaries.</p>
<p>Regarding activities that must be registered, the requirements correspond to those that apply to financial institutions under the Act on currency exchange and other financial services (1996:1006). Companies authorised to act as capital intermediaries and companies exempt from the authorisation requirement under the new act must, instead of applying for registration, notify Finansinspektionen that the company intends to conduct activities that enable rewardsor donations-based crowdfunding. Any company that has been entered into the register is to be removed from the register if the company has been ordered to cease activities and the order has come into force. This also applies if the company provides notification that it no longer engages in activities governed by the act or if it is clear, in any other manner, that compulsory registration no longer applies.</p>
<h2>Rules of procedure and conduct</h2>
<p>The proposed act contains certain rules of procedure and conduct that mainly apply only to capital intermediaries, i.e. companies that conduct activities requiring authorisation under the act.</p>
<p>A capital intermediary’s activities must be organised and conducted in such a way that the intermediary’s organisational structure, relations with other companies and status are transparent.</p>
<p>Activities must be conducted in a sound manner also in other respects. The requirements relating to operational insight and soundness will be tailored to the nature and scope of the capital intermediary’s activities.</p>
<p>The act also contains provisions on managing conflicts of interest, project agreements and complaints.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are certain additional consumer protection regulations. Capital intermediaries must carry out appropriateness assessments of clients that are consumers and that intend to provide financing through equityor lending-based crowdfunding. Moreover, before the provision of financing through such crowdfunding services can commence, capital intermediaries must provide the information needed to enable each natural person or legal entity that intends to provide financing to make informed decisions. Capital intermediaries must also provide clear information that the financing provided is not protected by the provisions of the Deposit Guarantee Act (1995:1571) or the Investor Compensation Act (1999:158). Capital intermediaries – and companies that, following registration, provide services enabling rewardsor donations-based crowdfunding – must also make available certain general information on the services provided, and on prices and fees. If the obligation to provide the prescribed information is not met, the Marketing Act is to be applied, with the exception of the provisions on market disturbance fees.</p>
<p>Regarding capital intermediaries that assist stakeholders and parties with lending-based crowdfunding, certain special provisions also apply. The mediation of such financing between private individuals can only take place if the capital intermediary is a representative of the person providing financing (i.e. the lender).</p>
<p>In mediating financing between a business operator as lender and a private person as borrower, or between a private person as lender and a business operator as borrower, the capital intermediary must assess, before the financing is provided, whether the party intending to procure financing (i.e. the borrower) has the financial ability to fulfil the commitments under the credit agreement. This credit assessment is to be based on adequate information on the borrower’s financial circumstances. Financing may only be provided if the borrower has the financial ability to fulfil their commitments. The obligation to carry out a credit assessment does not apply, however, if the entity providing financing is a company authorised by</p>
<p>Finansinspektionen to issue or mediate loans. In such cases, the company is to carry out the credit assessment. The obligation to perform appropriateness assessments, provide the prescribed information and act as a representative or perform a credit assessment also applies to those companies conducting activities as a capital intermediary but that are exempted from the authorisation requirement, provided that the company is not already covered by a corresponding obligation under another law.</p>
<p>The Inquiry has considered including provisions in the act that limit the volume of financing or investment via equityor lendingbased crowdfunding, but not found sufficient grounds to do so.</p>
<h2>Supervision and sanctions</h2>
<p>The proposed act contains provisions on Finansinspektionen’s supervision and sanctions powers. These provisions essentially correspond to what applies to other equivalent financial activities, and their formulation has been modelled after provisions in other commercial law acts pertaining to financial markets.</p>
<p>Regarding companies covered by the registration requirement under the new act, Finansinspektionen is to exercise supervision in respect of the Act on Measures against Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing.</p>
<p>The provisions on sanctions mean that the requirements under the fourth money laundering directive are implemented for both capital intermediaries and companies that, following registration, conduct activities in accordance with the new act.</p>
<h2>Entry into force and transitional provisions</h2>
<p>The Inquiry proposes that the new act come into force on May 1, 2019. Certain transitional provisions are proposed that will give the companies concerned time to adapt to the new regulations and that will prescribe that pecuniary sanctions under the new act may only be charged for infringements that occur after its entry into force.</p>
<h2>Consequences of the proposals</h2>
<p>The Inquiry considers that an authorisation requirement for crowd- funding platforms will create fairer competition in the market seg- ments where these platforms are active and promote greater long- term confidence in the financial markets. Increased clarity concerning protection for borrowers and investors should also make crowd- funding a more attractive form of financing. While the authorisa- tion requirement risks limiting the number of new crowdfunding platforms entering the Swedish market, the requirement also enables new Swedish and foreign actors to become established in Sweden with a high level of legitimacy. At the same time, the authorisation requirement may be viewed as a barrier to market entry. The Inquiry considers that this is a minor problem relative to the distortion of competition that would result from platforms being exempt from seeking authorisation.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposed authorisation requirements entail in- creased costs for the platforms. The costs are onerous. Nonetheless, the Inquiry considers that the legislative proposals are well justified to create a clear regulatory framework for this form of financing and strengthen protection for capital seekers and individual private investors.</p>
<p>The Inquiry’s proposals entail increased supervisory activities and thus also increased costs for Finansinspektionen and the Swedish Consumer Agency. More actors will apply for new authorisation. The number of actors is limited at present, but it is hoped that greater regulatory clarity may result in an increase in the number of actors.</p>
